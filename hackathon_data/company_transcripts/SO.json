My name is Daisy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 20, 2019.","Your speakers to today are Scott Gammill, Tom Fanning, and Drew Evans","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Gammill","Thank you, Daisy. Good morning, and welcome to The Southern Company's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements including those discussed in our Form 10-K, and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas Fanning","Good morning and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. As we report our 2018 results and look ahead to 2019 and beyond, our focus remains on investing in our premier state regulated utilities and providing outstanding risk-adjusted returns for investors.","2018 was a year of incredible accomplishments for Southern Company. We entered the year with a great deal of uncertainty regarding corporate tax reform and our own first full year as general contractor at Vogtle 3 and 4.","First regarding tax reform, we reached timely innovative and constructive outcomes with regulators in multiple jurisdictions, and as a result are in the process of delivering approximately $1.8 billion of benefits to customers, while preserving our credit quality and improving earnings per share.","At Vogtle Units 3 and 4, we completed our first full year as general contractor. In July, we revised the estimated cost to complete and we recalibrated site production expectations with a site-wide reset. Since then, we have achieved a trajectory of staffing and productive hours worked per week that is ahead of what we targeted on our last earnings call.","We continue to have a lot of work ahead of us to sustain this performance, but we are pleased with our progress and are confident that we can meet the schedule approved by our regulators. I'll provide more details on Vogtle 3 and 4, shortly.","We are executing our business model in a world class manner. Our modernization initiatives have improved customer service and resilience of our system. Through aggressive cost management, we expect to continue to invest in our state regulated franchise, while keeping rates low, sustaining our outstanding operational performance and delivering strong financial performance.","In 2018, we successfully completed strategic value accretive transactions totaling over $11 billion, efficiently sourcing equity to strengthen our balance sheet. Notably, we closed on the sale of Gulf Power Company on January 1, 2019, and we expect to close on the sale of Southern Power's Mankato facility this summer.","Our decisive actions substantially reduced our projected equity needs, removed significant risk from financing plans and positioned the company for future growth.","Customers are at the center of everything we do and we have continued our long-standing track record of providing some of the best customer service in the business. For example, Georgia Power was the highest rated utility for both residential and business customer satisfaction by JD Power in the South region in 2018, and Nicor Gas was rated among the most trusted utility brands by residential customers.","Let\u2019s turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Throughout 2018, progress at the site was significant. We achieved our major 2018 construction milestones for the project. Overall, including engineering, procurement, and the initial test plan, the project is approximately 74% complete.","During the past three months, several significant milestones were achieved. Unit 3 milestones included, setting the first reactor coolant pump, placement of the third and final containment ring, and setting the main control room roof.","At Unit 4, we set the pressurizer and second steam generator inside the containment vessel. Additionally, since our third quarter earnings call, the remaining two AP1000 units in China, Sandman 2 and Haiyang 2 achieved commercial operation. Lessons learned from China will continue to benefit our project.","On our third quarter call, we detailed solid productivity improvement, and I'm pleased to report today that positive momentum at that site continues. We've successfully added approximately 700 new skilled craft resources, attracting pipe fitters and electricians to the site.","We told you in November that we were targeting to ramp up to 140,000 productive hours worked per week by March. So far, for the month of February, we have averaged 141,000 earned hours per week. In fact, last week, we achieved a 146,000 hours with a CPI of 1.08. We are focused on sustaining this progress throughout 2019 and into spring of 2020.","As we have discussed previously, we continue to manage construction on a more aggressive schedule in order to preserve margin to the regulatory approved dates. For reference, we currently estimate that we need to sustain approximately 110,000 weekly earned hours in order to meet the November \u201821 and November 2022 regulatory approved schedule.","We are currently in the midst of rebaselining our work for Vogtle Units 3 and 4. At a high level, this effort involves a verification of estimates for remaining commodity quantities, hours to install those quantities, staffing trends, testing and system turnover requirements and achievable craft labor production. This rebaselining effort will refine the weekly work plan for the remainder of the project.","Our over arching objective in the rebaselining effort is to maintain the aggressive work plan at the site, allowing us to preserve as much margin in our schedule as possible to the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in service dates.","While it's important to acknowledge that this rebaselining effort is not complete, we continue to expect that the project schedule and capital cost forecast will be consistent with our prior estimates. And based on early indications, we also expect a reduction in the amount of remaining productive hours needed to complete the project.","We expect to conclude the rebaseline effort prior to our first quarter call and Georgia Power will file a report with the Georgia PSC reflecting the results no later than May 15. The Public Service Commission staff will then have until July 31st to file their observations on the outcome of the rebaseline process with the Commission.","In the appendix of our slide deck for this call, we've provided the most recent schedule performance index, cost performance index and percent complete metrics. While we continue to believe that these measures are the best indicators of progress at the site, please note that the charts provided for the schedule performance index and percent complete metrics, do not reflect the ongoing rebaselining effort and we believe it is likely that the most recent results shown on those charts are not representative of the current status of the project. We will provide an update on the results of the rebaselining effort, including an update on these key measures on our first quarter earnings call.","On the regulatory front, the Georgia Public Service Commission voted yesterday to approve a stipulation between the PSC staff and Georgia Power that settled all issues in VCM 19, which included combining the filing of VCM 20 and 21 in August of 2019 at the request of the PSC staff.","Combining the filings recognizing - recognizes the ongoing rebaselining effort and is designed to accommodate an unusually busy regulatory calendar in Georgia, which includes Georgia Power's triennial integrated resource plan filing and rate case filings for Georgia Power and Atlanta Gas Light.","This action is not without precedent. Some of you may remember that in 2013, we made a similar determination with the PSC staff to combine VCMs 9 and 10 during Georgia Power's 2013 rate case.","I'll turn the call over now to Drew for a financial and economic overview.","Andrew Evans","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, adjusted results for the quarter and the full year exceeded our expectation.","Due to the positive impact of weather and cost control for the full year, the related customer refund accruals occurred in the fourth quarter, so comparison of year-over-year adjusted fourth quarter earnings results is not particularly informative and I'll focus on the full year.","For the full year, on an adjusted basis, Southern Company earned $3.13 billion or $3.07 per share in 2018, compared to $3.02 billion or $3.02 a share for 2017. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in this morning\u2019s release and earnings package.","Last year, as a result of the impacts of tax reform in our business, we reset the starting point of our expected long-term EPS growth trajectory to $2.87 per share. Our adjusted 2018 results of $3.07 per share were approximately 7% above the mid point of our original guidance range.","This result was also above our updated guidance range disclosed on the second quarter call, which was increased due to performance through mid year and the Florida asset transactions.","The major drivers versus 2017 were the positive effects of constructive regulatory outcomes and weather at our state regulated utilities, somewhat offset by increased depreciation and amortization, interest expense and share issuance.","Importantly, we have also been successful in holding our non-fuel O&M expense flat at our state regulated electric utilities year-over-year as we continue to create and seek out operational efficiencies.","Looking at some of the operational highlights, our generation system load was 4% higher in 2018 compared to 2017, representing our second highest load on record. The increase was primarily due to extreme cold temperatures in January and warmer than normal temperatures in September.","We also experienced record gas burn and gas generation in 2018, due to higher loads throughout the year and lower gas prices in the second and third quarters.","For 2018, our energy supply mix was comprised of 47% natural gas, 27% coal, 15% nuclear and 11% renewables. Notably, generation from coal plants continue to trend downward, which is in line with our stated carbon reduction objectives.","Moving now to an economic review of the year, we continue to see robust net income - net-in migration, particularly in the Southeast. Across our regulated utilities, we added 41,000 new residential electric customers and 32,000 new residential gas meters during 2018.","Our combined business territories continue to see slightly faster population growth than the rest of the nation, and in particular, Atlanta is currently the fourth fastest growing metro area in the United States.","Retail electric sales growth for the year was approximately 1% on a weather-normalized basis, principally driven by this customer growth, with a minimal decline in customer usage. As we forecast future years, we anticipate the customer growth trend to continue, but we also expect a slight annual decline in customer usage.","When looking at these two factors combined, our forecast for retail electric sales growth remains flat to 1%. While we achieved growth at the top end of this [ph] range in 2018, our guidance remains flat to 1% for 2019 for sales.","The commercial customer class continues to grow. However, energy efficiency, eCommerce and other changes in business models are challenging overall demand growth.","While there were signs of slowing momentum in the fourth quarter in selected industrial segments, industrial sales were strong for the year in 2018, with seven of our top 10 industrial segments posting year-over-year growth.","Overall total employment growth remains strong in our service territories. Alabama and Georgia both outpaced the national average, with employment growth of 2.2% and 2.5% respectively. And developers continue to select sites in the Southeast for large-scale economic development projects.","Before I turn the call back to Tom, I'd like to discuss our 2019 EPS guidance range and our long-term outlook. Our 2019 EPS guidance range is $2.98 per share to $3.10 per share. The $3.04 per share mid point represents growth of approximately 6% from $2.87 per share, the midpoint of our original 2018 guidance range.","In the first quarter of 2019, we estimate that we will earn $0.70 per share, excluding a preliminary gain on the sale of Gulf Power currently estimated to be $1.28 per share, as well as any other adjustments in that period.","Our expected long-term EPS growth rate remains 4% to 6%, using the same base of $2.87 per share that we established a year ago. This growth rate is driven by strong fundamentals across our state regulated electric and gas utilities, and a continued focus on cost control. We expect our state regulated utilities to comprise over 90% of total projected earnings through the five year horizon.","Our long-term outlook continues to be driven by capital investment in our state regulated businesses. Our investment plan of $38 billion includes a projected rate base growth at our regulated utilities of approximately 6%. This updated plan reflects a $3.7 billion increase over last year\u2019s forecast for 2019 through 2022, excluding the previously disclosed Vogtle cost increase.","The main drivers of the increase are significant incremental state regulated utility investments primarily related to the closure of ash ponds or environmental spend in Georgia and Alabama as we continue initiatives to modernize and increase the resilience of our electric generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure.","For Southern Power, the cumulative five year investment plan of $900 million is comprised entirely of previously announced projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet. We expect to remain opportunistic with regard to growth at Southern Power, seeking to deploy new capital for projects that meet our stringent risk and hurdle rate objectives, but any incremental growth opportunities at Southern Power are expected to enhance the long-term financial plan and be largely self-funded.","We currently forecast the total equity need of $2.5 billion to $3 billion over the next five years. We have the capacity to fulfill most or all of our projected equity needs through our robust internal equity plans. However, we will continue to preserve all options and evaluate other potential equity alternatives.","We have demonstrated discipline and agility in seeking the most efficient sources of equity in the past. 2018 could not be more indicative of this and we will remain equally thoughtful and investor focused as we fulfill our future equity needs.","Financial integrity and strong credit metrics provide significant benefit to customers and investors, and it has always been a top priority for us. We've taken significant steps over the past year to deleverage our balance sheet, and in 2019 we expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our credit metrics.","Another long standing priority for Southern Company is providing a regular, predictable and sustainable return to shareholders through our dividend. We have an outstanding track record of dividend payments and growth. Over a 71 year period, dating back to 1948, we have paid 285 consecutive quarterly dividends that have been equal to or greater than the prior quarters.","While future dividend policy is the purview of the Board of Directors, we are proud of this track record and we believe our financial outlook continues to support our objectives of growing the dividend $0.08 per year.","I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing remarks.","Thomas Fanning","Thank you, Drew. In closing, throughout 2018, we continued to execute across all our businesses, achieving outstanding results. The foundation of our business remains strong.","Our customer focused business model, with an emphasis on outstanding reliability, best-in-class customer service and rates well below the national average continues to be the cornerstone of delivering value to customers and shareholders.","Our credit profiles are significantly improved. We continue to project 4% to 6% long-term growth in our business and our employees across the franchise continue to deliver outstanding service to customers and the communities that we are privileged to serve.","2019 will be an extraordinarily important year for Southern Company, with particular focus on Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and investment in our state regulated businesses. We have a long track record of successfully executing on our business model and believe we are poised for continued success in the months and years ahead.","We appreciate your continued interest in Southern Company. Operator, we are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Fanning","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Hey. Good morning. Thank you for the time. Just numbers look great, near-term outlook looks great. I just wanted to make sure I understand precisely the message you're trying to deliver on Vogtle today. It was just a tad confusing.","Thomas Fanning","Okay.","Greg Gordon","If I heard you correctly, you said, you were at 146 - productivity of 146 recently, you're at 140 today. The target was to be at 140 by March and that if you can maintain at least 110, you believe you can deliver the regulatory in-service date in November on the current cost schedule, is that correct?","Thomas Fanning","Yes. In general, we \u2026","Greg Gordon","Because the reason I'm asking, sorry\u2026","Thomas Fanning","Go ahead.","Greg Gordon","The reason I'm asking is, because you then said you're now rebaselining and I think - but the rebaselining, if my understanding is correct, is just delivering a schedule to the regulator that now reflects that aspiration?","Thomas Fanning","It's all of that. Yes, it's - every so often. Say 18 months or so, we'll take a look at the schedule and based on everything. We have to kind of use schedule in discrete periods, right. We obviously look every week to optimize workflows and process, learning\u2019s from China as they have now achieved start-up, all of that goes into our thinking about, what the implications are for the work performed for the remaining construction period of the plant. All of that input goes into what we call rebaselining.","And the outputs we believe, now, it's not gone yet, got to stress this to everybody, but everything that we see right now, as of today, says, cost and schedule are preserved and we expect to have to spend less hours to complete the project than what is currently in our budgets, okay?","And if I just gave a little more refinement there, what we know today, what we believe today is at least a reduction in hours of around 600,000 hours. Now, there may be more, we'll see what happens. We\u2019ll deliver that when it becomes public as we conclude the rebaselining effort.","So in general, what we said in October was, we needed to hit 140 by March. We've hit 140 in February. Last week, we hit 146,000. So we're very happy with the productivity and the staffing resources necessary to deliver productive hours per week, so good track.","The challenge for us, can we sustain that from February of \u201819 to February of \u201820. You should expect that those numbers may bounce around during that period of time, but if we can average 140, we believe right now and this is before baselining is complete, that we'll be able to hit our more aggressive schedules.","Recall, the schedule that we are focusing on paramount is November \u201821, November \u201822 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. It remains the case that we are working on site to April schedules. The idea there is to deliver more margin to the regulatory approved schedules by the Georgia Public Service Commission, okay. And we try to give you reference points. And let me just make sure we get those clear.","On productive hours worked per week, we think if we average 110,000 hours per week, we could hit November schedules. Hitting anything better than that improves our likelihood of gaining margin to November.","That's why we're targeting 140 or even above for this remainder of the period, February \u201819, February of \u201820. These numbers, we believe are consistent with the April schedule that we have in place. But again, we got to finish rebaselining, there's a lot that goes on.","Even theoretically you could reduce hours and have a prolonged schedule maybe a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, something like that. It just depends on a whole lot of sequencing that goes on. But the point is, if we do better than 110, we\u2019re gaining margin to November. We're targeting 140,000, and we're doing a little better than that right now.","One other point, these charts in the back, we had an argument internally about providing you those charts. That's okay. We fight all the time here. The charts are based on the old schedule. They do not include the new rebaselining and everything else.","And let me just give you the reference point there. On CPI, if we can beat - I think, it's 1.4, CPI is 1.4, then we will do better than our budget that we're projecting for the November in-service dates. And schedule, if we can beat 1.3, we will do better than the November schedule. That's how we're evaluating those charts. Those are the reference points.","Now, I'm sorry Greg, I went into a little bit detail, maybe more than you wanted, but I want to be very clear about where we are.","Greg Gordon","No. That's exactly - Tom, that's exactly what I was asking. So, right now, you're creating margin against the November schedule. You will sort of quantify exactly what the current schedule is in the rebaselining process that you're going to submit to the Commission. And then as long as you can keep on track, you're continuing to create a little bit of above 110, you continue to create a little bit of headroom to the November in-service date. I think that's clear.","I guess the one final question, then I'll jump to the back. You said you might be able to do it in fewer hours, just fewer hours mean actually a lower cost? I mean, is it really this times hour or are there other factors involved?","Thomas Fanning","Yeah, there's other factors, the amount of commodities involved, and piping wire, stuff like that, certainly the cost of the units employed. I think we suggested \u2013 you know, there was all this conversation in the past about we need people from Canada and everything else and I still think that would be a good thing to have.","What we did on the site was actually increase wages for electricians and pipe fitters to essentially top decile. Now, we were able to absorb those costs in our own variance without touching contingency.","But there will be issues along the way that really deal with unit cost. Hours certainly matter and all of the things being equal, you have less hours, you have less cost, you have less schedule. But we can't say that with certainty until rebaselining is complete. So let us finish the work and we'll tell everybody what the results are once it's complete.","Greg Gordon","Thank you, Tom.","Thomas Fanning","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Fanning","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?","Thomas Fanning","Yes, sir. Hear you fine.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. So perhaps following up on Greg's question on Vogtle, if you don't mind. You talk about a reduction in the amount of remaining productive hours. Can you elaborate a little bit more? You may have already touched on this just a tad in the last question, but I want to hit that very specifically here. What is improving in terms of the underlying construction site from a productivity perspective?","Thomas Fanning","Yes. So, if you recall, one of the big issues we talked about was - we kind of stated, we need more people, and once we get the people on the site, we got to get them productive. And I think, we've talked in the past about some guys, some - an electrician walks on the site, so we got a new person, but it takes him a while to get productive.","We estimate that there is a little bit of friction, may take two weeks or so to get the person working at near best capability. So there is this issue of - what do we get about 75 people per week, getting them up to speed. And so you'll see some friction in the - especially the CPI metric.","But as you get staffing where you need it and everybody starts to become productive, CPI should start to go down, and in fact, that's exactly what we're seeing on the site. So it's a function of getting people, getting them productive and then working better.","The other factor that has been important here is not just attracting, but retaining people. And not only retaining, but also less absenteeism and a variety of other things. All of our compensation practices right now, incent people to stay, to have good attendance and to be productive.","And I must say, we've had a terrific partnership with Bechtel. I want to make sure I call out my friend Brendan Bechtel and Jack Futcher and Barbara and the whole team there at Vogtle 3 and 4. We work with them day in and day out. And we continue to surprise ourselves, I think, with more productivity at the site.","It goes to material management practices, it goes to work packages, just real kind of meat and potatoes, blocking and tackling kind of stuff. We continue to find ways to improve.","Andrew Evans","Julien I think another\u2026","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Please.","Andrew Evans","Another way for you maybe to think about this is that rebaselining is an effort to understand the number of hours that it takes to complete each of the tasks that are required for completion of the facility. And so, efficiency is an important measure, but after a year or so of operation, just really redefining what each individual task will take in terms of total hours that way we're not tracking against the curve that's incomplete.","And everybody should know, Julien, we know it well, there is still a long way to go. Building margin is just smart. You just don't know what's going to happen in the future, we're showing a really good report today. It's important for us to continue to build the margin. That just insulates us against risk in the future.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just to reconcile this, the hiring ramp, I know you're already at these 140,000 plus hours a week. How do you think about that today, given the 700? You just mentioned a second ago about you would like to see potentially Canadian hires, but implied that it wasn't necessary at this point just, just where are we?","Thomas Fanning","The Canada comment was just another arrow in the quiver should something else happen. We still have to go through outage season, will people stay with us, a variety of all, but that's just belt suspenders. We feel like everything we are doing right now is getting us the people we need.","And in fact, what I would say is, pipe fitters, we're pretty well where we need to be. We do need a few more electricians down the road, but we are where we need to be right now and we'll assess hitting the market for more people later.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. It's composition of people rather than a hiring ramp at this point?","Thomas Fanning","Yeah. We're actually very happy with where we are, and in fact, we have a backlog right now. So what does that mean? People see what's happening at the site, I think, word is spreading quickly. We've had great cooperation, Sean McGarvey, US Building Trades, they see this as a quality worksite, a safe worksite. They can count on the hours and so people are really attracted to come here now.","So I think what we want to do is continue to see that. We've had more applications come in than we can process or want to process on the site. Like I said, we could process maybe 150 people on the site, but we couldn't make them productive. That would just be a cost measure.","Our kind of target has been around 75 people per week. And so we have a backlog right now. We feel good about staffing, we feel good about making them productive. And the numbers that we show so far reflect that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Thomas Fanning","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Fanning","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys. I appreciate the extra information on the slides that you're going to update with the rebaselining. And the one you didn't talk about was that percent complete in your answer to Greg, Tom. And I was just curious, when you look at those December and January numbers, they seem to be a long way short even though you are exceeding your current target zone on hours worked.","And should we expect that that gap will effectively be eliminated once you rebaseline? So, is that the right way to kind of think about how that's going to change or anything you could say to that picture?","Thomas Fanning","That graph, I think is based on the aggressive schedule and it's based on an April target, okay. And it's on the old data. It's on the old kind of hours worked and everything else.","So my sense is, there's really two pieces of information you don't see on that: one is, how does that compare to November; two is, it doesn't include the benefits of rebaselining.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. Those sounds like putting them out together, it's safe to assume next time you show it to us, that gap between the blue and the green bars ought to be a lot smaller?","Thomas Fanning","Yeah. And Jonathan let me just give you that. We chatted about that just before the call what that would look like. Now, this is highly imperfect. I'm giving you what we believe. We think at kind of this 140 plus level, we're going to be completing about 2% per month and that will essentially converge these two lines, but we need to show you that.","Jonathan Arnold","Perfect.","Thomas Fanning","We had a real debate about whether to show this or not. We said we would show it to you, that's why we put all these disclaimers up her.","Jonathan Arnold","Well, having that answer, to explain it was very helpful.","Thomas Fanning","You bet.","Jonathan Arnold","Thank you for that. And then just one other, when we look back to some guidance, look back to how you showed your guidance last year, you had this 4% to 6% cone and the numbers coming in at the high end in 2019, including Vogtle, which you've obviously now affirmed, and then, drifting into the middle in \u201820, and toward the lower end in '21. I'm just curious, is that still the right kind of trajectory to be thinking about or is that old presentation now sort of redundant?","Andrew Evans","Jonathan, I think that's still fair. You have to remember that what will actually be reported is still a function of the ROEs that are allowed during the construction period for Vogtle. And so that capital deployment does put a little bit of pressure on what would have been reported normally.","Tom and I've talked a lot about this. I think, absent Vogtle, we're quite comfortable with our strength within that cone of earnings.","Thomas Fanning","We'd be at the top end of the range.","Andrew Evans","We'd be at the top end, but we are comfortable that we can stay within it even with the ROE depression that we get from Vogtle deployment.","Thomas Fanning","And remember, Vogtle 3 and 4. I think, is 8% of our earnings, somewhere around there.","Andrew Evans","Yes.","Thomas Fanning","And just remember, during that period, especially '20 and '21, we're in that period where we have the lower ROEs associated with incremental expenditures. But recall, once we clear '21 and '22, once you get these units in, the trajectory really accelerates. It looks like an 8% kind of number out there from say '20 to '22, or '21 to '23.","So it has a little bit of a shape and it shouldn't surprise anybody. You all have known about the regulatory settlement with Georgia for some time. I'm happy that if you look at our range this year, it shows that the top side, 8% over 2.87. And the bottom side is anchored in the bottom of our 4% growth rate.","Andrew Evans","The most significant difference probably year-over-year is that we really are focusing our efforts on this $38 billion worth of investment into regulated enterprise. We continue to identify projects, whether environmental or modernization, and transmission and distribution.","We're still exploring opportunity around migration of the generating fleet to a less carbon intensive mode. And so I think that these will be a series of updates as we explore these options through '20 and '21, but this is our single best projection of our future, I think, today.","Thomas Fanning","Yeah. And one more just point of interest, the Georgia Commission has always been innovative and creative. For the first time in our IRP, we introduced a section called Resilience, and it really talks about thinking differently about the electric system.","In other words, integrating in concepts of resilience beyond transmission lines and generating plants to gas pipelines and what are all the implications of storage and how can we think differently about the make, move and sell concept in terms of improving the reliability and ultimately the resilience to customers. These are really important concepts.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. And just what one high scheming [ph] item, did you end up sharing with customers in Georgia in 2018?","Thomas Fanning","Yeah. In fact, and Drew probably knows better than I do, but I said on TV this morning, we shared - I mean we gave benefits to customers this year of around $2 billion, $1.8 billion from tax reform. They got about two thirds of the benefit. And then another $200 million or so, perhaps more, 209 is what people are showing me right now, in terms of sharing.","Jonathan Arnold","You got it. And equally weighted across Alabama and Georgia?","Thomas Fanning","Yeah.","Jonathan Arnold","Or closely equivalent.","Thomas Fanning","We love to have the regulatory mechanisms. If the company does well, customers do well.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. All right. Well, thanks a lot guys.","Thomas Fanning","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Fanning","Angie, how are you?","Angie Storozynski","Great. Thank you. So no questions about Vogtle from me for a change. So, we saw the IRP filing from Georgia Power. We're still waiting to see what the Alabama Power files.","And given the changes in the sharing mechanism for any over earning, I was just wondering, I mean, we obviously still expect this earnings pivot during construction at Vogtle, but is there a way to minimize that earnings slowdown from Alabama Power?","Thomas Fanning","From Alabama Power?","Angie Storozynski","Meaning like just have some strength in Alabama Power earnings in order to offset the temporary weakness in earnings at Vogtle?","Thomas Fanning","So I like what you're saying. Look, yes, we talk a lot about this. I think our plan, we call it optionality. We've got lots of singles we can hit here, lay aside any home runs, lots of little singles we can hit along the way, that we think we can optimize plants, but particularly in '21, is kind of the year we're focused on. We certainly have the ability to do that.","Andrew Evans","I think ascribing it to Alabama perhaps is a little bit unfair. We'll look at a variety of options across unregulated complex in total, Alabama's going to seek to do what's in the best interest of their customers at all times related to rate and return.","Thomas Fanning","Yes. Thank you, Drew. That clarification is exactly right. And in fact, when we think about - and we haven't talked about it yet, but kind of investor friendly asset sales and all the stuff, we were very active last year.","We have a lot more opportunity to do things here. I would view it more as pruning. We just announced Mankato and we expect to close that I guess by June or so. There's more of that to do, whether it's Southern Power, PowerSecure, things like that, we'll see.","Andrew Evans","Perfect example is hyper investment in unregulated subsidiary generally leads to some dilution in the near term. We can produce a better earnings profile out of that business in the short term by utilizing its own assets to fund its development.","And as Tom said, maybe prune back a little bit and things that are a little less strategic or find opportunities for people have a different view of value than we do.","Thomas Fanning","And we certainly have done that in '18. And one more comment, boy, we have a great appetite within our operating companies, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, the Gas business to where without forcing anything, we're not backing in the numbers. These are things that we can identify, whether it's ash ponds or resilience in the transmission system, that's very reasonable on things that we should do for the benefit of customers.","The other trade we've made, you've heard about modernization, reducing O&M significantly. Georgia has done a heck of a lot of that. Mississippi, just give you an example, have reduced over the years personnel at that company from 1500 to now about a 1,000, little over 1,000.","So we're really taking money out of the business. We are creating headroom to invest in matters of resilience and technology to improve customer service. Georgia Power withdrew from a lot of its local offices - bill paying [ph] offices and yet increased customer touch through technology by four times. We have lots of opportunity to do better.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And just one other question, so your large cap peers seem to be pursuing a lots of growth from commercial renewables. I know that you have some growth embedded in your plans for Southern Power?","But how do you see this, is this just more as a way to basically give you some flexibility around that 4% to 6% earnings growth or would you think that commercial renewables are still delivering attractive returns and as such should be pursued?","Thomas Fanning","Yeah. Angie, that's terrific point to raise, and we've debated about how to talk about this. Let me just tell you what our point of view is and let the other companies speak for themselves.","We find - especially in the current environment, we find that solar and wind margins are shrinking pretty dramatically, and we\u2019ll still be active. I guess we have a placeholder in our financial plan of something like $500 million a year for this stuff. We don't expect to spend it. We expect more to be in the $200 million range. And that's really a function of the market. You recall when the market was hot, we played really hard.","On the other hand, we have a tremendous appetite inside our franchise businesses to spend more CapEx. What you're seeing with us is an intentional reallocation of CapEx away from those markets to our franchise markets. And it really is a function of need and weighted average cost of capital and what we expect the market will deliver.","Andrew Evans","We're certainly not turning away from the concept of renewables. In fact, Georgia Power included over 1,000 mega watts of renewables within their most recent IRP. And so, I think you might see the form of that investment change a little bit. But as Tom said, as we look at things in the unregulated space, it's not only the margins that have declined, but perhaps the duration of contract and the credit quality of counter party. It simply falls through some of our return expectations. And so we just have to evaluate these things on a case-by-case basis and make sure they're accretive to shareholder value.","Thomas Fanning","Let me - he made such a good point, so let me underline it. Value is a function of risk and return. Returns are down in that market in our opinion, risk is up because the duration of the contract available is down, we don't find that all that attractive.","Angie Storozynski","Great. Thank you very much.","Thomas Fanning","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Fanning","Praful, how are you?","Praful Mehta","Good, how are you?","Thomas Fanning","Super.","Praful Mehta","Well, thank you for taking the question. I guess going back to Vogtle, if you don't mind. Great progress so far and great to see that you're tracking to your faster internal schedule.","I guess, just wanted to understand a little bit on the testing phase. I know that, that will start at some point in terms of testing all the equipment. How would you see that and do you see any uncertainty being added to your schedule as you get to that testing phase?","Andrew Evans","Man, you're right on the money. This is the next big thing to talk about. So coming out the kind of July reset and then into the October earnings call or November earnings call, whenever it was, setting the trajectory, and getting people on-site and getting them productive was the most important thing we could do. We already have been involved in some turnover from construction to start up. So that actually has been ongoing.","None of those systems that in the past have been all that critical in terms of critical path to schedule. Frankly, we haven't done as well as we would like to do on those early efforts. But we are now laser focused on what it's going to take in order to move out of construction phase in the start-up phase.","Let me just tell you, if we stay on this April schedule, conceivably, you could have fuel load as early as for Unit 3, October of 2020, that's 18 months away. So we are right now in a big time mode on focusing, taking in systems, turning them over to the start-up folks and that's not only the construction and operation, but the paperwork and all the stuff we have in place to get the iTech [ph] complete to go to high fuel load. We have integrated teams in place, we have some of the best people around the United States, out own people, Bechtel, and we're very happy with kind of where we are right now.","You should know also, this is an area of great learning from China. We have seen what they've done at Sandman and Haiyang. We've taken best practices. And in fact, we are thinking - even in the part of the rebate lining is, rethinking the schedule and sequence of the major events in the schedule to give us more certainty on the turnover package issue.","This will be the next big thing to talk about. And we have talked internally about some graphics and some other ways to give you some transparency as to how this is going. Right now, we want to make sure we've got people, got them productive. The next thing will be our progress on the question you raised.","Praful Mehta","Got you.","Thomas Fanning","And man, let me just add two more things. One way to talk about this is, just what are the big kind of systems that you should watch, one is, initial Energy Station, we think that's going to happen in the second quarter, and then the integrated flush of the system. This is essentially where you take water and move it through the pipes, you clean out the pipes, and you get ready to operate. That's kind of the integrated flush, third quarter.","And that's one way to talk about, but you got imagine there is lot of systems that go - underlie all these big issues. If we hit these big issues on time, we should hit the little issues on time. So, we're going to work hard to find a way to communicate this with you.","Praful Mehta","Got it. And that is super helpful. So as you think about the testing phase, building in some cushion through the current phase as you enter testing is probably what you're trying to track for given there is a little bit of uncertainty at least in terms of how that testing would go, is that fair?","Thomas Fanning","Sure. Hey, let me add one more thing that is just important. I know people love to complain about government and everything else, I would argue that this administration has been very helpful. Congress has been very helpful. In fact, even the past administrator was helpful on building Vogtle. The NRC is a very tough regulator. They are very exacting and requiring, as they should be, and we work well with them.","One of the things that when we got the AP1000 technology approved, if you remember, way back then by the NRC, there was a lot of first of a kind issues with that technology.","Now, with Sandman and Haiyang operating, we were able to work with the NRC to eliminate what had been required as first of a kind test issues. So, those issues have been eliminated or lessened and that has added about three weeks to our margin. So we're very happy to continue to work with the NRC to look for innovative, creative ways to help achieve the schedules we have in place.","Praful Mehta","As usual very comprehensive answer. So really appreciate that.","Thomas Fanning","You bet.","Praful Mehta","I guess just quickly moving onto the finance side. Just to quickly test, on the equity, you've mentioned $2.5 billion to $3 billion over five years. Was there any clarification around strategic asset sales or other M&A transactions as a part of that? I wasn't clear on that point, so just wanted to clarify, could that equity number come down as you look at more M&A transactions?","Andrew Evans","First, I think a simple answer to your question is, absolutely, it could. What we wanted to demonstrate though is that we can meet the requirements of the plan that we've laid out for ourselves just using the internal plans at our disposal. And so, it's basically dividend reinvestment in any option exercise that occurs.","I think '18 has been very indicative of the approach that we'll take, but I would say the majors have been done or are in process for 2019. We're always looking to prune and make sure that there are opportunities to kind of refocus smaller business lines and we're going to be as opportunistic around those things as we possibly can this year.","Thomas Fanning","And if I could just beat some good news accomplishment. I think, we bought well and we sold well. I think we demonstrate terrific discipline in that. I think the AGL acquisition was a terrific one for shareholders. I think SONAT was a terrific one for shareholders.","When you think about what we were able to do in '18, we sold a gas business in New Jersey and a few other places for 37 times earnings. The highest multiple ever paid for a gas business. The Florida gas business we sold was I think tied - right at tied for the second highest multiple ever paid. Gulf was the highest multiple paid in our knowledge for any electric company.","When you think about just other ways to dimension that, we were carrying assets at the time at $45 a share and sold them for $90 bucks a share. We sold 5% of our earnings for 12% of our market cap.","So, it wasn't just that we were raising money. We were historically raising money with valuations that people hadn't seen before. These were all very accretive, very friendly to shareholders.","Praful Mehta","Got it. Well, thanks again, guys. Appreciate it.","Thomas Fanning","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Fanning","Hi, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Hi. Good morning. On rate-base growth versus earnings growth, it looks like the - especially on the electric side, it looks like the electric rate base growth profile is a little higher, about 1% higher and that's taking out Gulf Power and I guess replacing it with more ash pond CapEx.","I'm wondering if that's going up and it looks like the incremental equity is a little bit less than half of the incremental CapEx overall. All those things would seem to indicate higher guidance growth rate going forward, but the growth rate is basically the same growth rate off that 2018 mid-point. Is that - maybe just talk about what is it about the translation from rate base growth to earnings growth that's keeping the earnings growth about the same?","Andrew Evans","So this is a little like the question, I think, we took earlier and really relates to the shape of our - or the path of our growth through that 4% to 6% earnings expectation. We know that we're going to have pressure related to Vogtle with construction investment over the next three year period, and so it doesn't translate as you see it here, 6% growth in state-regulated - or 6% growth in electric utility to a full 6% growth at the corporation.","I don't know that we'd be particularly doing ourselves a benefit by moving our growth ranges around to the time when we are really focused on execution on Vogtle, but we'll kind of revisit that idea when we\u2019re substantially complete there.","Thomas Fanning","But even with Vogtle, we're within the 4% to 6% count. And if you look at the end, like I suggested before, the shape, for whatever flatter kind of performance you will get through '21, it really takes off once you start clearing 3 and 4. And it looks more like 8% growth at that point.","Andrew Evans","And Michael, you are correct, the vast majority of the change here relates to environmental CapEx and also some modernization of the T&D infrastructure over that period. But our change is little over $4 billion or kind of in that proximity and really is almost entirely in regulated enterprises.","Thomas Fanning","Yes. And I just want to add, these aren't made up numbers. They're not like what do we need to fill a hole and let's create CapEx to do that. These are projects that we know about, they are sensible and they help customers.","Andrew Evans","Identified and largely filed.","Thomas Fanning","Yes.","Michael Weinstein","No. I appreciate your comment also about I guess the increased competitiveness on the non-regulated renewables side. I'm also noticing that the amount of CapEx that's going into the gas pipelines segment declines over time. And I'm just wondering if that is also sort of an area that you might be thinking about divesting at some point?","Thomas Fanning","Divesting, it's an interesting question. I think we will continue to look at opportunity within the midstream. We really enjoy the investment there that we have in SONAT, Dalton, the construction that was completed a year and a half ago that's brought tremendous benefit I think to the customers of Georgia.","The same can be said of other two constructions, although they are much smaller in terms of relative contribution to the - particularly the first one that I mentioned, but divestiture, I don't know, I think as these things get to commercial operation, we'll just have to assess whether they're better held by us or by others.","Andrew Evans","Yes. And the old joke around here is, strategic means the numbers don't work. SONAT is strategic and the numbers work. It's a wonderful annuity. That's another one, where we bought well, I think. And as you mentioned, Dalton, is perfect for our system. There's high synergy with those assets.","Thomas Fanning","The primary goal is to bring low cost gas into our service territories and to the extent that we can continue to do that, SONAT certainly does into the Southeast for both the gas and electric businesses. ACP or PennEast Pipeline into Illinois, anything that's in service of customer, probably fits in our portfolio.","Michael Weinstein","And just one final question about PowerSecure. So I mean that was a relatively recent purchase. And I guess you're thinking about it being a non-strategic asset at this point, does that mean you are\u2026","Thomas Fanning","No. Hope I didn't communicate that, PowerSecure, we think is a really important thing. In fact, somebody - I think it was Angie asked before about generation in commercial and industrial realm. In fact, that's what we've seen. The last three win deals we've done have been General Mills, General Motors and a cruise line.","Here's the point, we see the age of big iron making, moving and selling at scale, central station power units, as potentially slowing down and dissipating over time, won't go away. And I can't tell you the timeframe in which this is happening, but I think it's happening to some degree now.","And then what we see in its place is something we refer to as distributed infrastructure. So now think about make, move and sell on the customer premises. And so we think that a certain combination of Southern Power as it applies to Angie's question, the commercial and industrial segment, along with the strategic portion of PowerSecure really do matter.","And also we are finding in the market elements of Sequent, really include Sequent in our guidance and all that stuff. That is a subsidiary that's part of the gas infrastructure. Their major purpose in life beyond managing the pipeline investments we have, like SONAT is to make sure that the pipelines are full of gas, and that we have efficient operation.","Customers are finding now that if we can handle their fuel management issues, that synergy along with distributed infrastructure has great appeal and may fill up this gap that's developing on what we call distributed infrastructure. There is a whole lot about PowerSecure that is a very strategic. There are elements perhaps that may not be, and we'll figure that out over time.","Andrew Evans","You have to really put that investment in context of size and it does show up in our capital deployment. It's just not as capital intensive as the core business is\u2026","Thomas Fanning","It's tiny.","Andrew Evans","This is - an experiment is not the correct word, probably very important for us to be able to understand how the distributed generation market develops. We have a good sense of it in our own service territories, but there are others that are further along in their journey, whether that's sort of out west of us or otherwise.","And so, I think we'll continue to invest in that business to understand how distributed generation might change the utility business in total, it's a very important way for us to understand the markets.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Well, thank you very much for your time. Appreciate it.","Thomas Fanning","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides","Hey, Tom. Thank you for taking my question. Mine is going to be really, really quick. When looking at the capital spend guidance, the one thing that kind of stood out is, there's very little at the regulated electrics for any new generation in the next few years, meaning, next three or four, three to five years.","Just curious, are you guys being conservative about whether there's an opportunity to build renewables in rate base or whether as you potentially retire or run your coal units even less often, whether new gas fired generation in rate base would be needed?","Andrew Evans","I'd say if you look at the projections today, it's more the lack of having these items here or probably more around the uncertainty of whether or not there will be - the IRPs will reflect them.","However, we are in process with IRPs in Georgia and ultimately in Alabama and expect at least 1,000 megawatts of renewables will be built within the Georgia portfolio.","Thomas Fanning","And we're always looking over our hand in terms of the economics of the best mix of capacity we've got. It wouldn't surprise me. We've announced some stuff in the IRP at Georgia, Hammond, Macintosh, to see more of that thinking elsewhere in the system.","It's just tough to think about all of the expense, whether it's O&M, environmental, everything else supporting the coal fleet. We think that is a drumbeat that will continue. And as technologies developed, whether they are renewables or new, highly efficient gas or storage, we\u2019ll take that into account as well.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Thomas Fanning","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Fanning","Hey, Ali, how are you?","Ali Agha","Good. Thanks, Tom. Good morning.","Thomas Fanning","Good morning.","Ali Agha","First question, I just wanted to be certain, in the past you all had given us a net income profile for Vogtle depending on the construction timeline and the ROE hits that you've been alluding to. Is that still a good profile to be using for modeling purposes?","Thomas Fanning","I think so. If it's not, we'll cover that with you offline, but I don't think anything has changed materially there.","Ali Agha","Okay. Also a couple of your utilities have obviously seen an increase in there all-sized [ph] equity ratios in the recent past. Again, for your planning purposes, as you look out long-term and the 4% to 6% growth, are you assuming that those higher equity ratios stay where they are or how are you thinking about that as future rate cases are coming up?","Andrew Evans","We are assuming that they stay in place, assuming that tax law stays as it is. You'll probably remember that the adjustments to capital structure really were simply for maintenance of the current credit quality of the utilities, as they existed prior to reform.","And so, Ali, we do expect that will continue. That'll be adjudicated in Georgia over the next few months for both Atlanta Gas Light and Georgia Power. We\u2019re working to make some progress in the State of Illinois. And Alabama, had I think really, really strong commitment from their regulators to maintain the credit quality of their business. And so, comfortable with how we've described in the projection.","Thomas Fanning","And let me tell you something, if I could give a quick policy argument, tax reform as they've done it, has been so beneficial to so many people. The argument against it is, only the fat cats, the rich people benefit. It's dead wrong in our business.","The way we've structured it, something like $1.8 billion of some sort of rate reductions accrue, whether they are refunds or other sort of rate reductions accrue to customers. And 46% of our customers make less than $40,000 a year and when you look at that segment, energy budget is a high part of their disposable income. This has a direct positive impact on some of the people in our economy that needed the most. This has been a great outcome.","Ali Agha","Got you. And just one quick question. The effective tax rate, if we get little bit right on your adjusted earnings was slightly lower than I think what you were expecting earlier, is this a good sort of run rate to be thinking about in future years as well?","Andrew Evans","I think the largest change year-over-year was the impact of tax reform. But let me get back to you in terms of the effective rate and the cash tax rate. I don't think it's very differently, significantly from our original expectation. Little bit of movement perhaps related to gains on sale of assets, but that would be the principal difference.","Ali Agha","I got you. Thank you.","Thomas Fanning","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Association. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Fanning","Paul, glad to have you with us.","Paul Patterson","Good to be here. Listen, I mean you guys have really pretty much covered everything with Vogtle, just a quick follow-up on the staff testimony in November, sort of raised some concerns about the 29 month extension and what have you and I was just wondering, 29 months, right?","Andrew Evans","Yes.","Paul Patterson","And I just wanted to sort of get a sense as to what sort of changed between November and now, other than what you guys have already gone over? I mean, I guess it would appear that things have really improved quite a bit. And perhaps that skepticism, if they were to write it today, would be less and I'm not asking you to speak for them, But if you can address, I mean you guys never really I think filed rebuttal testimony or anything. So that's why, I was just wondering if you could just fill in a little bit there as to why they had so much skepticism then and sort of the outlook now?","Thomas Fanning","Yes. So you hit my first answer right on the head. And that is, I don't want to speak for the staff. Look, if you just look at the facts right now, whether it's productive hours per week, a 110,000 versus a 140,000 plus hours work per week, we're developing margin to November. We\u2019re able to get the staff we need. We haven't eaten into any of the contingency. So, schedule, costs, productivity, these numbers look pretty good.","Now, we have to sustain them, and maybe things that we don't know, the unknown are unknowns. We have the units in China working well. So we know the technology works. So here's the thing,","I think - just as I indicated on an earlier question, I think that we're able to demonstrate we get staff, we get them productive, we are working. I think the next big issue is going to be turnover. And I know Dr. Jacobs, who we dearly love, he is a really smart guy and works with us, and sits in all our meetings, that's part of his area of expertise.","But how we move from construction now to the start-up, looking toward half fuel load, potentially as soon as 18 months away, is kind of the big issue right now. And we'll talk more about that in calls ahead.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Listen, everything else has been answered and congratulations.","Thomas Fanning","Thank you. Really appreciate it.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Hang in there.","Operator","And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas Fanning","No. We're really happy to be able to report these results. It's the productive work of thousands of people, making thousands of good decisions every day. I want to call out Bechtel, our partner on this important Vogtle journey that we're on.","I think we're in good shape right now. The challenge is going to be keep the momentum going, sustain the progress and continue to execute the way we have. The financial plan is awfully robust.","I think, we've demonstrated agility in being able to respond to changed conditions in some of the best regulatory environments in the United States. We expect that will continue. Lots of important work ahead in '19, but I think we're poised to execute and do well during this year. Thank you for your followership of this Company and we'll continue to work on your behalf as hard as we can. Have a great week.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

My name is Laurel, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.","Daniel S. Tucker","Thank you. Welcome to Southern Company's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today, in addition to providing historical information. There are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning. We'll also be including slides as part of today's conference call. These slides provide details on the information that will be discussed on this call. You can access the slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com if you want to follow along during the presentation. In addition, we are now making those slides immediately available for download on our website.","Now at this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning, Southern Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Thomas A. Fanning","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge those of you that have been directly affected by Hurricane Sandy. Our hearts go out to you and your loved ones during this difficult time, and we are doing all we can to help. Our industry's response has been unprecedented, with virtually all EEI member companies contributing resources to this enormous effort.","Our own operating companies have dispatched more than 2,400 workers to help restore power. These workers and all the other responders have left their own loved ones and are working long hours under challenging and often dangerous conditions to get -- these folks are some of the real heroes of this disaster. The affected areas are beginning to show signs of recovery, and we expect that the process to continue. In the meantime, please stay safe and know that everything is being done to restore electric service to your area as safely and as quickly as possible.","Now let's turn to a review of our operational performance, including our recent progress on several important initiatives. The most important operational metric, as you know, is safety. In 2012, we are having one of our safest years ever, with one of the lowest recordable incident rates in our history. It is a testament to our continuing commitment to do every job safely every day. We also continue to excel in executing our business model, which, as you know, is based on putting customers at the center of everything we do. The best evidence of this [Audio Gap] our most recent customer benchmark survey, which shows all 4 of our traditional operating companies in the top quartile for customer satisfaction among U.S. utilities.","A key driver of our success is system reliability, where we continue to distinguish ourselves as being among the best in the industry. In this effort, our generation, transmission and distribution operational areas we have performed exceptionally well. I'm especially proud of our team for these achievements and their ability to maintain focus on these priorities.","I'm also pleased to announce that earlier this month, we achieved, under budget and ahead of schedule, the milestone of 4.4 million Smart Meters installed, completing our installations in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. This exciting new technology will help improve reliability, lower costs and minimize our environmental footprint. For example, we have already avoided approximately 40 million miles of driving by meter readers since the program began. Our customers have also seen benefits from the new system in the form of faster outage response time. And during major storms, the technology has proven to be an invaluable tool for coordinating restoration activities. Smart Meters are just one more great example of Southern Company's commitment to driving and leveraging energy innovation, all for the benefit of the customers we serve.","We continue to make progress on our major construction projects, including Vogtle 3 and 4. In fact, we are now halfway through our project schedule and more than 1\/3 of the way through construction. We recently achieved a major milestone of more than 10 million work hours recorded on the construction site, where our success continues to be driven by our uncompromising focus on safety and quality. Recent progress include the installation of approximately 480 tons of rebar in the Unit 3 Nuclear Island and completion of the Unit 3 turbine building foundation, which includes approximately 1,100 tons of rebar and 8,600 cubic yards of concrete. Extensive progress has also been made on the cooling towers for both units. Assembly of the Unit 3 containment vessels bottom head is complete, and the Unit 4 bottom head is more than halfway finished. The structural steel cradle, upon which Unit 3 containment vessel bottom head will be set, is also complete.","We continue to highlight the quality assurance and oversight processes associated with this project. A  significant recent example of our focus on quality is the concrete pour we completed on 1,000 cubic yard Nuclear Island mockup structure. The event lasted approximately 9 continuous hours and simulated the first Nuclear Island concrete pour, which will entail approximately 50 continuous hours of work. The mockup pour was a success, and the lessons learned will benefit all of the participants in the upcoming basemat pours.","Major upcoming milestones include the arrival of the Unit 3 reactor pressure vessel and the pouring of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island basemat. Both are expected to occur around the end of this year.","","The achievement of recent licensing amendment requests discussed in prior earnings calls has helped to clear the way for pouring the Nuclear Island basemat concrete. The nuclear regulatory commission approved 2 license amendment requests, also known as LARs, one associated with the rebar design and the other with basemat thickness. These approvals demonstrate that the new licensing process works as it was intended.","Since the last earnings call, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved another $292 million in expenditures. This means approximately $2 billion has been approved through December 2011. On August 31, 2012, Georgia Power filed the seventh Vogtle construction monitoring or VCM report. This fully unredacted and publicly available report highlights the EPC contract has contributed to stable capital costs, how the projected cost of completing the nuclear facility are still less than the original certified amount and how up to $2 billion of potential additional savings for customers has been identified since the original certification.","Also highlighted in the reporting process is the disclosure of cost disputes between the project owners and the contractors. Our EPC agreement stipulates a specific path for dispute resolution. The required steps are, in order: negotiation, mediation, and finally, depending on the size of the dispute, either binding arbitration or litigation.","The most significant dispute is Georgia Power's potential $425 million share of a claim related to the delay of securing approval of the design control document or DCD. Late last week, the mediation phase of this dispute ended, and both parties filed lawsuits associated with the claim. We continue to assert that the EPC contract is clear as to which party is responsible for certain costs and that Georgia Power and the other owners had no obligation for the cost in question. At this very early stage, there is no definitive timeline for resolution of this plan, but we will continue to keep you posted on its progress. We do not anticipate that the litigation will have any negative impact on the continuing work at the site.","At Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County, Mississippi, construction remains on schedule to begin commercial operation in May of 2014. Cost projections remain on target to finish at or below $2.88 billion. We continue to actively manage ongoing pressures on costs and schedule, which are typical for a project of this scale. Installation of the gasifiers and assembly is proceeding exceptionally well, and the carbon dioxide absorbers are all in place.","Natural gas and effluent water pipelines, as well as critical transmission upgrades, have all been completed on time or ahead of schedule. Contracts for the sale of final byproducts of the gasification process had been finalized, which, combined with the expected savings from financing and factoring in current capital estimates, are projected to provide approximately $500 million more in value to Mississippi Power customers than was originally projected.","Over the next few months and early into 2013, the remaining gasifier lift will be completed. Other major elements, such as the water plant and air compressor are scheduled to be completed in the spring. Start-up activity begins next year as well, with the first fire of the gas turbines scheduled for the second quarter of 2013.","Heat-up of the gasifiers is scheduled for late '13, and reliable flows of SIM gas are expected to begin in early 2014. Once the plant is finished and operational, customers in Mississippi will enjoy the benefits of a clean, cost-effective, cutting edge energy for decades to come.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Art for a review of our third quarter performance and the economic outlook for the remainder of the year.","Art P. Beattie","Thanks, Tom. In the third quarter of 2012, we reported earnings of $1.11 per share compared to earnings of $1.07 per share during the third quarter of 2011, an increase of $0.04 per share. Earnings as reported for the first 9 months of 2012 were $2.26 per share compared with $2.27 per share for the same period in 2011, a decrease of $0.01 per share. This includes a previously announced $21 million net benefit during the second quarter of 2012 for an insurance recovery that resulted in earnings of $0.02 per share associated with the 2009 Mirant bankruptcy settlement. Excluding this item, year-to-date 2012 earnings were $2.24 per share compared with $2.27 per share for the same period in 2011, a decrease of $0.03 per share.","Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our numbers for the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. First, the negative factors. Usage and economic growth decreased earnings by $0.03 a share during the third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011. Weather effects reduced our earnings by $0.07 a share during the third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011. Weather was $0.04 below normal during the third quarter of 2012, whereas weather was $0.03 above normal during the third quarter of 2011.","An increase in depreciation and amortization, representative of our growing rate base, decreased earnings by $0.01 a share during the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. An increase in interest expense reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share during the third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.02 a share during the third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011.","Now the positive factors. Retail revenue effects in our traditional business added $0.09 a share to our earnings for the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. Decreases in nonfuel expenses for our traditional operating companies increased earnings by $0.07 a share in the third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011. As we have shared in previous calls, we typically build flexibility to respond to weather and other revenue variances into the second half of the year. A reduction in income tax expense increased earnings $0.01 a share during the third quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2011.","Finally, Southern Power added $0.01 a share to earnings during the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. In conclusion, we had $0.14 of negative items compared with $0.18 of positive items or a positive change of $0.04 a share.","Moving now to a discussion of our third quarter sales and the economic outlook for the remainder of 2012. On a weather-normalized basis, total retail sales decreased 1.4% during the third quarter of 2012. Year-to-date, weather-normalized retail sales are essentially flat. Our industrial class showed mixed results with some pockets of strength and some pockets of weakness. A slowing in export volume seems to be consistent with slowing demand among certain global markets. However, industrial sales on a year-to-date basis remains at approximately 95% of prerecession levels.","As for bright spots, we continue to see strength in transportation and fabricated metals related to the continued growth of auto production in the region. Other customer expansions and pipelines in lumber drove strong gains of 7% and 5%, respectively.","The last quarterly sales trend -- the latest quarterly sales trend reflects a slowing of economic activity, which we believe is driven by uncertainty around upcoming elections, the fiscal cliff and the global economy. Many of our industrial customers appear to be waiting until these issues have been addressed before taking any further steps, such as hiring new workers, opening new facilities or expanding existing ones. The best evidence of this can be seen in the U.S. economic uncertainty index, which shows economic policy uncertainty at an all-time high. In fact, since 2008, economic policy uncertainty has averaged about twice the level of the preceding 23-year period.","As further evidence that businesses are waiting to make decisions can be seen in the tremendous backlog of active economic development projects in our region. Our economic development pipeline currently features more than 300 projects representing more than 43,000 jobs and $15 billion in capital investment. Announcements in the third quarter alone represented -- represent 3,700 jobs, a 36% increase over the same period in 2011. Those same projects represent $1.5 billion in capital investment, a 155% increase over the same period in 2011. These projects should begin to impact our sales over the next few years. Examples include Mando, an auto parts manufacturer bringing 660 jobs to Georgia; and Huntington Ingalls Industries, which was awarded a $1.5 billion Navy contract to design and build amphibious vessels that could provide up to 2,000 jobs along the Gulf Coast.","Also, last quarter, Home Depot opened their previously announced call center that's expected to add 700 jobs in Georgia. We continue to monitor events and economic activity as we develop our forecast for next year. As always, we'll share our outlook during the fourth quarter call in January.","Now I'd like to share our earnings estimate range for the fourth quarter of 2012. Our earnings estimate range for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $0.38 to $0.40 per share, which puts us in the middle of our annual guidance range.","Now I'd like to hand it back to Tom for his closing comments.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thanks, Art. In closing, I'd like to share with you some exciting news we had just last week. As I've said many times, a critical component of any common sense national energy policy is pursuing energy innovation through investments in research and development.","Southern Company continues to lead in this area, particularly with our development of 21st century coal technology, which is already being implemented in China and it's scheduled to make its debut in the United States in 2014 at Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County, Mississippi. This proprietary technology, known as TRIG or transport integrated gasification, is now ready to be offered all around the globe, allowing for low-carbon generation using an affordable, abundant resource. Toward that end, we have announced an alliance with KBR to market TRIG technology worldwide.","More than 1\/2 of the world's existing coal reserves consists of low-rank coal, such as lignite and sub-bituminous coal, the very types of fuel that TRIG was developed to utilize. While leveraging this technology, we can preserve coal as an energy resource and ensure that more customers have access to clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity. It's just one of the more -- it's just one more example of Southern Company's long standing industry-leading commitment to energy innovation, which continues to reap benefits for customers and shareholders alike.","At this point, we are ready to take your questions. So operator, we'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Listen, Tom, just on the economic outlook and a little more pessimism in your voice than probably I've heard in a little while, do you think it's one of these issues that we get through the election into the fourth quarter that '13 is looking better when you talk to your guys? Or is this something that could linger longer in the doldrums as you talk to folks?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, that's really it, Dan. I mean I think we've tried to call it as we see it. We started out the year like gangbusters. We're meeting many of our annual goals in the first half of the year, and then we started seeing things start to slow down. And we've kind of changed our tone from being cautiously optimistic to being just plain cautious. It does appear -- and this is not a Southern Company issue -- this appears to be a United States economy issue. That during the third quarter, largely because of uncertainty, we're just seeing the economy kind of come to a halt. This morning on Bloomberg, there was an analyst from BlackRock who called this out. We just saw from NAM, the National Association of Manufacturers, they said the #1 issue facing manufacturers today is uncertainty in the economic climate. That's why we wanted to show you this kind of uncertainty index. It's a fascinating issue. When you look at the number and magnitude of issues that need to be resolved, it's really unprecedented in this nation's recent history. It is my firm belief that for the good of America, the policymakers in Washington will address these issues in a timely manner. And no matter who's elected, these are not Republican issues or Democrat issues, these are American issues. For the good of America, I believe that will happen. When you look at the quality of our backlog, so when we try and look through the numbers to find out what's out there, the quality of the backlog is as good as it's ever been. And so if we can just break through the logjam of resolving be the uncertainty, I believe the economic future and the continued recovery of the United States could occur.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, Tom, on the residential side, you have had some customer growth this year, so are you seeing kind of efficiency taking hold? Or is it just more of a psychological impact that's causing usage to be flat to down versus prior years when the economy hasn't been particularly great either?","Thomas A. Fanning","So we pride ourselves, Dan, on kind of providing lagniappe for these calls. We've done our own research on what's going on with efficiency and everything else. A trend that we have called out in the past has continued, and we are seeing actually the economy, at least here in the Southeast, get more and more electrified. And in fact, there is a small amount of energy efficiency weighing against the growth of electricity sales. And what we're seeing, if you strip out kind of exogenous factors, we're actually seeing per capita use of electricity grow. Now when you look at the number -- this is why you got to peel back and get information around the data -- we have seen, frankly, some -- and maybe we should cover this on the post call, but there have been some details that involve, really, accruals for unbilled revenue and unbilled sales around what were before typically estimated unbilled revenue compared to now as we switch over to this new digital age and the AMI meters, we're seeing a different process in estimating unbilled revenues. We think that may be largely responsible for the slight downward performance you see in residential. We believe that the real performance in residential sales is roughly flat.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess one last one, Tom. O&M has been a pretty good success story as managing against demand. If we were to look to next year, some sort of normalization, what kind of inflation do you guys think you're going to have on the O&M line based on kind of the surplus you've been able to accumulate in the last couple of years?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, so we kind of build the budget assuming kind of 2 things for O&M. One is that we have normal inflation associated with the economy wages, et cetera. The other associates a growth in O&M associated with an increase in rate base, an increase in assets that must be maintenanced, if you will. Here again, when you peel the onion back on O&M for this year, I think the companies have done a beautiful job kind of managing performance relative to exogenous factors. If you just think about it for a minute, look at year-to-date weather this year versus last year. We're down $0.21. This has been one of the mildest years on record for Southern Company, a mild winter, a mild summer. Even for the third quarter year-over-year, we're down $0.07 on weather. Now when we look forward on O&M growth, you would expect to see something like 3% to 3.5% growth for the reasons I mentioned. And I think when you look year-over-year on O&M, we're essentially flat. So we've eaten up not only inflation, but also O&M associated with new assets. We will continue to monitor that, of course. We'll get into our earnings projections for 2013 in the January call.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I have 2 questions. Could you comment about your long-term earnings growth projections now in light of the slower load growth? And as you said, your ability to control cost is largely absorbed at this point, and so how should we think about the EPS growth going forward?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, Angie, we'll cover that in the January call. That's what we always do. So key update, long-term earnings guidance once a year, and we'll do that in January. Just one comment on your statement. It is -- and I've tried to convey this so far on this call and really even in our remarks, but there is more uncertainty in the economic climate than we've seen in a while. Now, uncertainty is reflected in the uncertainty index and all the fiscal policy issues that need to be dealt with. Depending on how those get dealt with, obviously, we'll be able to be much more precise in our view of the economy. What we're trying to reflect right now is with the election, with the fiscal cliff, we have some challenges around the worldwide economy. It is less clear, more than ever. Hopefully by January, we'll get some sense as to how that is being resolved. And with respect to O&M, we'll just see. I wouldn't conclude, as you have, that perhaps we've used up our flexibility.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And secondly, about your IGCC, we're pushing another IGCC project with some cost of runs and some issues with the gasifier. You mentioned that your gasifier's going to be installed or heated up on the late 2013. How can you be comfortable with the performance of the gasifier before it's actually being installed?","Thomas A. Fanning","Perfect. It's funny, we love our earnings calls, and we love preparing for them. I remember Jim von Riesemann asked me a question about why we were different than Edwardsport, and I went off on a soliloquy for 20 minutes. I'll resist the temptation to do that, but let me give you some headlines as to why we're different. Number one, this is our technology. We're not buying from a third party. Number two, you know that we are the only one in the industry with an engineering and construction services group of 1,600 people. We're able to self build this effort along with several main subcontractors, but this is our effort. And when you look at the fact that we've deployed, I guess, by the end of '13, $13 billion of the environmental equipment, we know how to build stuff. We think we're going to do, likewise, a great job here. Thirdly, remember that we're the only company engaged in proprietary research and development in a robust way in the industry, and the heartbeat of that effort is in our Wilsonville facility. We call it the PSDF, Power Systems Development Facility. We grew this technology and it really -- it evolved into some R&D that we started way back in the '60s with liquefaction. It is now gasification. We've run that thing for like, I forget how many man-hours, 50,000 man-hours or some enormous -- we have enormous experience running this technology with this fuel at that. So we actually imported fuel from that site to run through our PSDF facility. So for a variety of reasons, we think we're going to be in very good shape to fulfill the promise of this for the benefit of the customers in Mississippi Power.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My question is, could you remind us in Georgia what level of sales growth is embedded in the current rate plan, sort of part 1. And then on this kind of O&M management and sales outlook, if I remember rightly, there was a facility in that plan to go in for an interim increase if you thought you were going to underearn your ROE. Is that something you could envisage absent a reacceleration in the economy triggering and maybe just remind us how that works?","Art P. Beattie","I'll deal with the second part of your question first. There is a mechanism and I can't remember the acronym for it, but that would be applicable to the 2013. And it would foresee some event in the economy whereby you didn't find to the bottom end of your range. I think it's called the ICR provision, and you would go back in for some kind of accelerated hearing process, whereby you might be able to come to some solution of that by year end or allow them to get inside the bottom end of their range. The actual increase in sales embedded into their plan is -- I have to say, Jonathan, I don't have the exact numbers on me, but somewhere in the neighborhood of 2%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I apologize, I came on the call a little bit late. When is the -- when do you guys actually file the next Vogtle VCM? And is it your expectation that you'll ask for a certification of an increase?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, so we just filed once, so we do it every 6 months, right? And so the next one will be February, yes. So you'll see then. All the numbers look really good right now, and we've been helped by some good luck. I mean, let's be clear. When we think about this $2 billion of additional benefit that our customers are getting relative to what was originally estimated, this has been a dynamite environment in which to finance big CapEx projects. I forget, Art, what is our number across the system? It's like $3.5 billion of debt financed at about 3%.","Art P. Beattie","About 3% for an average term of 19 years.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes. I mean just think about -- and I think the estimates when we started this project were more like 6% and 7%.","Art P. Beattie","Yes, yes.","Thomas A. Fanning","So we are developing a tremendous amount of value. And when I look at just the EPC part of it, forget what we're doing on capital costs, we're actually under budget, but we're doing great.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I mean you guys had certified this at almost $6.5 billion, and I know right now you're at $6.1 billion. So even if you went back up towards the original certification, it would still be a win. I'm just wondering whether -- because you already had a current estimate of $6.2 billion, if there are other things that may cause that to drift higher.","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, the big factor that would cause it to move around, I think, is probably schedule. The construction is going very well.","Art P. Beattie","Greg, you also had the claims issue, too, that's still pending. So we are waiting until that was resolved before we went back to commission with any kind of requests for an increase in the certified amount.","Thomas A. Fanning","And recall, the issues around the claim really deal with schedule.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike (sic) [Mark Barnett] with MorningStar Financial.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","It's Mark. Just a couple of quick minor details here. Obviously, the proprietary TRIG technology, as you've already discussed a little bit on the call, it goes back a long way. The inclusion of the slide here, I'm wondering, is this going to presage maybe some further details, given that you've got this partnership on the potential for this technology in terms of external revenues?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, so here's what I would think about that. We've been very consistent, we're going to remain consistent until we have a reason not to be. But basically, we think there is a terrific market for this worldwide; so does KBR. That's why we entered into this relationship. You just think about megawatts of need. In the not-too-distant future, China needs to add 300,000 megawatts of generation; India, 100,000 megawatts of generation. Both India and China lend themselves to the kind of low-grade coal that is perfect as a fuel resource for our TRIG technology. Now, we're not going to get all that. We're going to get some segment out of it, we believe, and we look forward to that. Until the revenues and profitability of our licensing effort become clearer, we just will not have it associated with any of our projections. So if anything shows up, it will be upside, number one. And the other thing I will just remind you. You know that Southern Company is a conservative company. We're very proud of the fact that we, along with our partners, develop this technology, and we think it's going to work great. We think it'll be a solution, not only for America, but for the world to take advantage of this excellent fuel resource. We are going to stick to the business we know the best. And therefore, we thought it was better to give, via this contract, KBR than worldwide marketing rights. We'll still pay attention, as with our research and development facility, as with our engineering and construction services group, the engineering oversight and further developments on the technology. So we'll not be engaging ourselves in worldwide marketing.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. One more quick thing. When we get the Q, might there be any kind of reserve or something along those lines for the lawsuits that have been filed or is it still way too early?","Thomas A. Fanning","Way too early, and please understand, we've been very clear, I think, in all of this that while you cannot determine the outcome, we believe that the facts are very much in our favor. That's why we did not sell, and that's why we did not -- that's why we've taken the step of filing litigation. We've done this in a very transparent way with the independent monitor, with the commission, with the staff. We feel like we are representing the interest of Georgia's customers by taking this step. Please also understand that filing the litigation, we think, is a normal part of the dispute resolution process. And that going forward, we can still settle or go to some other kind of dispute resolution, like arbitration if we feel like that's prudent in the future. So this is -- people should view this as just another step in the process. Work continues; we don't believe there'll be any material slowdown as we progress the thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just a couple of questions. First, if we think about -- I don't know if Art had seen any kind of sensitivity on sales, either for this year or thinking about it in the future, 1% change, and how that sensitivity is impacted in terms of like customer classes?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Steve. Roughly, if it's spread across all of our classes, it's about $100 million. If you do a 1% change in industrial sales, obviously it's less, about $17 million. If it's a 1% change in your residential class, it's more, about $45 million. So you spread it across them all, you get, obviously, a bigger impact. But that doesn't assume that you're going to also manage your expense side of the equation. So you don't want to be just making assumptions that those kind of results and changes in sales will not directly lead to changes in net income.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sure, okay. And just, if things do remain weak, I recall during the crisis, you guys were able to work with your regulators on the Georgia kind of mechanism that you had as well as, I recall, you did something in Alabama. Do you have some of those things that you could work on to kind of help mitigate a weaker economy, if you think about it?","Thomas A. Fanning","Sure. In fact, just as you recall, we put in place this mechanism that Art referred to earlier that takes into account a big change as a result of an economic slowdown, or whatever else, to get Georgia Power back to a place where it can operate effectively. So we've already contemplated that we've made the adjustment in Georgia. Because remember, that's typically been a 3-year accounting order process. If you go elsewhere across the system, RSC kind of operates every year anyway; it's a formulaic approach. Mississippi operates annually; it's a formulaic approach. The only one that doesn't have these kinds of features will be Gulf Power. And remember, Gulf Power has a traditional kind of rate-making approach. They filed for a rate increase last year. They have something like a great deal of their sales -- of their profits associated -- I'm sorry, revenues associated with clauses. It's like 65% -- 60%, 65%. So it's kind of a smaller issue to Gulf Power, and they're kind of small anyway.","Art P. Beattie","Steve, we also had the COR issue at Georgia back in 2009 that -- where we amortized some of that back to help mitigate some of the impacts that Georgia was feeling.","Thomas A. Fanning","And I think the COR impact is, as Art points out, is a great example of how we worked constructively with regulators to do the right thing all the time. So we always have an ongoing dialogue. People should know it is not a discrete relationship. It is a continuous relationship.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Then one last question. Just any update on the Plant Ratcliffe kind of Supreme Court reviews and timing of that?","Art P. Beattie","Everything is still pending. The Sierra Club's appeal of the most recent certification order is still pending. It's a chance to re-court. We expect to hear from that any week now, so we already expected to hear from it, but just haven't heard anything yet. Everything else, our appeal to the Supreme Court is still pending. We don't -- that particular issue is around our ability to bill the cash CWIP, the order the commission gave us denying that request. That won't be heard until sometime in mid-March.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Listen, I wanted to just be clear on your comments around the economy and the uncertainty, et cetera. If I'm hearing you right, you're talking more short term in nature and I believe elections, et cetera, should remove some of that uncertainty. Or are there other secular issues, efficiencies, et cetera, that you may be alluding to as well that may be causing the low-growth outlook to be slow or slower on the longer-term basis? How should I be interpreting your comments there?","Thomas A. Fanning","No, I think you nailed it in your question. Look, I think what we're seeing right now is a pause in the economy, and I think the economy is waiting for the uncertainty to be resolved. Obviously, the big issue facing us kind of post the election is the fiscal cliff, and what's the United States going to do to get its financial integrity in order. I think the kind of more secular change -- and I just don't know where this is -- is what's going to happen with the European Union, what's going to happen with the long-term growth rate in China, Brazil and other formerly growth-oriented economy. I think those are the issues, both for my work at the Federal Reserve, plus the work our economists do here. The economic uncertainty is just at an all-time high. And I think these issues, whether you believe you should cut costs or raise taxes, it is clear to me that what we've got to do is adopt, as a fiscal matter, policies that promote growth in the economy. I think if we do that, when you look at the quality of the economic development backlog that we have, I think we're poised to resume a really attractive growth rate. But the proof will be in the pudding. Let's see how Congress, the policymakers around the United States resolve the issues related to the uncertainty, and let's move forward. Believe me, we will be active in those discussions.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Separate question, coming back to Mississippi for a second. Are you comfortable there with the overall regulatory paradigm? I mean you were mentioning earlier, of course, we've got the CWIP issue, but separately, they had this ROE focus and discussion as well. Comfortable with what's going on there, and any concerns we should be aware of?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, I think you're aware of the concerns that we've had. I think, historically, Mississippi has been a constructive environment in which to do business; it has been for a long time. We were all surprised by the decision to defer the recovery of CWIP pending the resolution of the Supreme Court matters related to the certification of the project. Now, listen, we're confident, we believe the certificate -- the certification process of the plant, once now amended, will go through. So we're very confident of that. That surprised us. That's, frankly, quite about the only negative that I can put there. I think the folks in Mississippi, the policymakers are working hard to create a way forward that will work for both Mississippi Power and its customers. I spoke recently at Governor Bryant's Energy Summit. And Governor Bryant, I think, is doing a terrific job casting, as a primary economic development strategy, the State of Mississippi as an energy hub. I think he is spot on, frankly, and not only carrying forward, but extending the good work of Haley Barbour. Kemper County is so important to the state's future. And I think when you think about the low-cost energy similar to a nuclear plant in terms of its reliability and costs, I think it will serve Mississippi well for decades to come. So my sense is we'll get through this rough spot, and we'll move forward in a constructive way.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And last question. Southern Power, historically, you guys have been telling us, either $150 million to $160 million annual net income kind of business; it's clearly been running ahead of that. I think third quarter was probably ahead as well, ahead of that. So any changes in the paradigm there or do you think that the move up in gas prices in the future, that may bring it back down? How are you looking at that sort of going forward now?","Thomas A. Fanning","That's a very interesting question. It's one we have a lot of conversation about here in Atlanta and around. Look, the earnings have been better. My sense is they'll be better again this year as the kind of year-to-date numbers would suggest. So they continue to do a great job. Recall one of the big projects that was kind of a centerpiece this year has been the biomass facility at Nacogdoches, Texas. Brought that in under budget on time. It's the world's largest bubbling bed technology, North America's largest biomass facility, I could go on. But it's just a great project. And then we've done some of these solar projects, none of which are all that big. We've put in place a kind of an appetite for us on solar, about 300 megawatts over 5 years, and we're just kind of being very faithful to that level of participation. We don't want to go overboard on that. One of the interesting ideas, though, that we've had is you know that our ethos as a company, our business model, is to put customers in the middle of everything we do and to provide clean, safe, reliable, affordable electricity to those customers. And that has served us so well in our integrated, regulated businesses. Likewise, it has served us very well with Southern Power. And I can tell you, when I was down there for the groundbreaking of Nacogdoches, we had lots of interested people, from co-ops and munis in the area, come to me and understand how favorable this has been to the city of Austin and wondered, could we do more business. Frankly, we get that wherever we do business, whether it's the Carolinas, whether it's New Mexico, Nevada. And so one of the things we're thinking about is, \"Are there limited circumstances where we could use exactly the same model? And perhaps, instead of turning down business, do some business with some other co-ops and munis, particularly, and maybe some other IOUs.\" If we do, let me assure you that we will follow exactly the same conservative model. That is: long-term bilateral contracts -- contracts really in 2 segments, one of which we earn a return of them, return on capital on brick-and-mortar investment; the other one earning, essentially, a pass-through on our energy cost,  which is largely fuel. So we don't believe we want to take fuel risks, we won't take transmission risk, and we want to have creditworthy counter-parties. So we are thinking about maybe doing some business in some of the other areas of critical mass that we seem to be developing. We'll see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with UBS.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on a couple of the questions that Steve and Greg and Jonathan were asking. I know this question may be premature, but can you discuss how you're thinking about the upcoming Georgia Power rate case? What the key objectives might be, how the case is going to align with the IRP plan that needs to be filed in 2013? And maybe a little bit about what the regulatory strategy is there for permanent rates from Vogtle, and how all the timing is aligned?","Thomas A. Fanning","Okay, so let's kind of think about that in some bites. First of all, though, Vogtle was progressing very well, and you may note recently that Georgia, as I said it, just did another fuel decrease to its customers. I think it was about 1.7-or-so percent decrease in total builds. Recall, we did a fuel decrease earlier that was roughly 6%, 19% to fuel, 6% of total sales, so we produced fuel decreases that, in fact, will largely speak for a lot of the price increases we see for Vogtle. So if you think about price increases for Vogtle, you're typically in the range of about 1% a year that's already pretty well spoken for, through the processes that exist in the state. Now, we will file an IRP. Recall in, I guess it's February of next year -- January -- recall, too, this is a very collaborative process that we follow with the commission, whereby we and the staff, the commission, in essence, will evaluate trends in demand, we will jointly agree on that. We will jointly agree on the resources necessary to meet that demand, and then we will jointly agree on how best to supply those resources, whether it is self-build or third-party contracts. That has been an exceedingly effective way to think about providing the resources for Georgia in the upcoming years. If you think about it, we're building Vogtle 3 and 4, we've just finished the last of the McDonough units that we've converted from coal to gas. Now we're over 2,550 megawatts of new gas supply. And right here in the Atlanta area and those units are behaving beautifully. In fact, they're producing capacity greater than their nameplate rating. We've also announced some initiatives in the solar arena in Georgia. And my sense is, when you combine that plus some other power purchase agreements, we will have spoken for the capacity needs of Georgia, probably through the end of the decade would be my guess. We'll find that out in the IRP going forward. With respect of the rate case that we will file right around the beginning of July, it's way too early to say, but it would argue that having spoken for Vogtle, having spoken already for McDonough, it would seem that the issues in the upcoming case will be similar to the issues in the last case. That is the normal O&M and CapEx associated with building the best electric system in the United States here in Georgia or in the Southeast, really.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What was weather compared to normal?","Thomas A. Fanning","$0.04 negative for the quarter.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. And year-to-date?","Art P. Beattie","It's about $0.08 for the year-to-date period.","Thomas A. Fanning","And it was $0.08 for the year-to-date and 13 -- we were $0.13 positive year-to-date, so $0.21 negative year-over-year, $0.08 versus normal.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And, Art, you gave an answer to Steve's question about 1%. Were those pretax numbers, were those revenue?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, yes, yes, they were.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The couple just -- I want to think about risks around authorized ROEs. You have the Georgia Power rate case next year, so authorized returns will get set during that normal TRC process. Can you talk a little bit about how the process in Mississippi will work in terms of the ROE dock that they have kind of looking at the methodology for reviewing ROEs there? And can then you also touch on, in Alabama, when do they -- in the RSC process, do they actually even look at authorized rates of return in that annual process, or does that not happen until some other process down the road?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, I'm going to let Art. Art was for many years the CFO of Alabama, I'll let him handle that one. Mississippi is really just an informational hearing, as I understand it, and it's not at all clear how that's going to go forward. You do know that by the structure of the test mechanism, they, in essence, go through a theoretical cost of capital calculation by the mechanism. And then that mechanism is adjusted by a performance, and Mississippi has always performed well with respect to safety, customer satisfaction, operational excellence, et cetera. So they've always -- they historically anyway, have earned a premium to the theoretical cost of capital that it calculates, so it's interesting to see how that will work together, but it is not has been set, it is all not clear. Art, Alabama?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Mike, as you know, when we chatted before about this, the discrete conversation in Alabama occurred constantly. There's not a specific date for review of those, but those conversations take place between the staff and management on a continuing basis. But I'll remind you in Alabama, their equity ratios are lower than the industry average. If you look at their return on invested capital, it's more in the second and third quartile compared to peers rather than the top of the quartile. So the amount of return reflected in price is not near severe when you lower the balance of equity in the equation. And I'll also point out that Alabama ranks in the top quartile when it comes to customer satisfaction. So it's not a one-element issue. It's a multifaceted issue that has lots of elements to it.","Thomas A. Fanning","And the other thing that people should just understand, too, this model that we have been very faithful in following -- that is to provide the highest level of financial integrity in running our business -- has served our customers exceedingly well. And I know we've shown you in many times in the past, this kind of efficient horizon curve -- where you look at cost of debt by the average life of maturities of the debt portfolios of us versus our competitors -- and frankly, Southern Company, all of the operating companies, look terrific on that basis. At the end of the day, when you look at the decisions that our regulators make, in a, generally speaking, a constructive business climate part of the United States, there is no reason for any of our commissions to take punitive action against the company. We are performing well in customer satisfaction and reliability in any notable measure. And so we think we'll continue on in that vein for years to come.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","Just wanted to ask you about Slide 16 and your coal gas comparison in the third quarter. It looks like you continued to burn more coal than -- I mean burn more gas than coal with the gas plants continuing to run at higher capacity factors. I'm wondering sort of, as you look forward over the next 12 months, sort of how you view that, because you obviously dispatched on a very economical basis. And just, are you sort of maxed out on coal gas switching? Or do you think now that gas prices have come up a bit, that it's -- you're going to be burning more PRB, sort of how are you thinking about that and also inventory levels?","Thomas A. Fanning","Listen, I think we can -- I have to look back at some prior data. I'm going to go from memory here, so hopefully, I'm not wrong as I say this, but we have still a great deal of optionality in our fuel mix. So let's go through that, for example. If gas prices are cheap and coal prices are expensive, we, in the future -- and I think this is a 2015 number -- could take our gas-fired energy generation up to around 55% and back our coal down to around 25% is my guess, round number. If the reverse happens, if for some reason gas gets very expensive and coal gets cheap, I think we can take our coal up to about 45% or so and back our gas down to around 35%. That's kind of the broad range of optionality we have going forward. One way to think about that is to think about kind of where are the breakeven dispatch curves going forward. So gas at $1.25 per million btu, it has to fall below that before dispatch is ahead of nuclear, and frankly, Kemper County. Kemper County is going to be in that same neighborhood. When we think about PRB, you kind of have gas in the range of $3 to $4, call it $3.50, somewhere in that range for gas to dispatch ahead of PRB. So that would be sheer Miller [ph], the big units there.","And then the Central App coal. Now one of the things that you will see is that we've been moving, transitioning away from Central App to Illinois basin. Some of that depends on how we unfold. In the years ahead, we signed a HashMac and a variety of other things. But in fact, those numbers have come down just a bit with the move more to Illinois coal. We used to say Central App coal was kind of $6, $6.50, now with Illinois being a more important part of our future as we conform with MACT, that number looks more like $5 to $6, somewhere in there per million btu. Does that cover it for you?","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","Well, so that would sort of imply looking forward to 2013 that you'd continue to run your gas plants really hard?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","Okay. And then secondly, just to circle back to the lower nonfuel expenses, the $0.07 a share year-over-year, I mean, that's a really big swing. Could you give me just a couple of examples of the kinds of things that you've been doing, or do you sort of budget for normal weather? And then, if it's not normal weather, there's less sort of maintenance that needs to be done?","Thomas A. Fanning","To everyone's dismay at Southern, I could talk about this for hours. I'll try and be economical here. We go through what we call a flexible budgeting system, whereby we identify a financial plan based on a level of O&M. We already planned for certain normal variances of weather above and below. So we basically find ourselves with a slug of O&M that we kind of keep in reserve pending the results of third quarter weather. We call those approved, but not budgeted -- I mean they're budgeted, but not approved. I'm sorry, I said that backwards. So in other words, we keep that powder dry, if you will. And so as we see weather become either mild or the other way, then we turn on or off that flexible budgeting part of our program. The other thing that's interesting about our budgeting process right now really goes to where we've gone with the generating fleet. So recall the O&M associated with the coal fleet is bigger than, say, with the gas fleet. I think people would mostly get that. So when we think about the MACT issue, recall we had about 20,000 megawatts of coal. It appears that we will maintain, I don't know, 12,000 to 13,000 megawatts of coal in the future. Some of that will be through fuel switching like from -- I'm sorry, from Central App to Illinois basin. So for the remaining, say, 7,000 or 8,000, some of that is fuel switched to gas, some of that is just retired. As we evaluate the plants that are subject to be retired, obviously, we have opportunities to scale back while maintaining safety, scale back some of the O&M that we otherwise would dedicate to those plants, but we will let their EFOR statistics rise up, whereas otherwise in the past, we would really be very hawkish about keeping those in perfect condition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just to go over sales growth again, what's your current projection? I think it was 1.3% at the end of the first half of the year.","Thomas A. Fanning","That's right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Where are we now, and where do you think it's going to be for 2012 now, weather-adjusted?","Thomas A. Fanning","I don't know, man. It could be somewhere between 0.5% and 1%, somewhere in there, 0.5%. It just depends. We've had some strange things happen in the third quarter -- I mean strange. They happen regularly, but like DuPont, we had a major facility undergo a prolonged outage in order to retool. Art?","Art P. Beattie","That's correct. Silicon manufacturer -- silicon metal manufacturer in Alabama was down a lot in the third quarter. They came back in the fourth and we expect them to operate in the fourth. And another major issue that nobody thinks about anymore after Hurricane Sandy was the effects of Hurricane Isaac. Hurricane Isaac shut down a lot of our large industrial load on the coast for periods of a week or more. OLB [ph] and our biggest industrial customer was down for a while along with Chevron and some other major consumers of electricity. We don't normally weather-normalize our industrial loads, so you see those effects impacting some of the sales loads in the third quarter.","Thomas A. Fanning","And some of that weather effects where they couldn't get railcars and product in.","Art P. Beattie","That's correct.","Thomas A. Fanning","It was things like that with the railroad problem as opposed to the [indiscernible] problem.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Let's look beyond industrial, though. I mean, if we look at leap year, the leap year impact, not too many, around 0.37%, 0.4% approximately. And we add that into these numbers, it looks like residential commercial industrial roughly down about 1\/2 -- leave industrial out, but 0.5% down. And I mean, I'm just trying to get a sense as to what GDP growth has been, at least what you guys are now looking at being. You mentioned that there was some concern on the industrials. But leaving the industrials because that's going to evolve through all the reasons you mentioned. How should we think about what's going on here?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, Paul, this a great question. Listen, we've got as much uncertainty as everybody. I always feel like we do more homework than anybody else that I know of in terms of understanding economy and holding these customer groups. There is -- one of the trends out of this call will be that there is a general heightened level of uncertainty in the economy. At this point, there is a tremendous amount of pent-up economic activity pending the resolution of some of these really important issues. It is clear to me that while the year started out great, it started to slow and now it has really slowed in the third quarter. There are all of the kind of chemicals in the sea, if you will, for economic growth to resume. But we've got to deal with those issues.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","If we look at GDP for the third quarter, I'm thinking, at least my recollection is around 2%. It came in a little bit stronger than what people had expected. I mean, is it different in the Southeast or are you talking about something that just isn't being picked up by regular GDP numbers, if you follow me. I mean, I guess, one of the concerns, I guess, that I have, at least, is that on the natural gas side, we saw for many, many, many years a reduction in absolute sales growth due to, basically, efficiencies. And I'm wondering whether or not we're beginning to see this on the electric side, because you guys are relatively thought of as being relatively strong economically compared to the rest of the country. In other parts of the country, we've seen, in some cases, negative sales growth weather-adjusted for 3 years.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, look, what we've done, and in fact, we ought to share this with you, being interested in the call after the call, the blurb we call it here, but we've done a lot of research on kind of looking at, really diving deeply into this notion of what's really going on with existing home sales. In other words, if you strip out all the noise on housing, or who was the customer before and who is the customer now, what we're finding is that from existing premises year-over-year, actually it goes back something like 5 years, we have found that absent kind of 2009, we have seen a continued increase in per capita usage. Now we know that there is some small effect of energy efficiency and everything else, but we think that is getting washed out by a greater electrification of the economy. Now the ratio that we have found as a rule of thumb still works, and that is electricity sales will probably be around 50% of GDP, so if -- you tell me what GDP is going to do, hit it by 60%, that's what electricity sales will do.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But GDP was 2% in the third quarter, right? And for some reason, it's not translating -- leaving out the industrial, it's not translating that way for the other guys. That's why, I guess, that's what I'm missing.","Art P. Beattie","Paul, Tom mentioned this earlier, but there's lots of stuff going on that makes us believe that the third quarter numbers, especially for residential, are far worse than what we actually experienced.","Thomas A. Fanning","Far better.","Art P. Beattie","Well, yes, far better. Excuse me. I misspoke. But the first issue I want to talk is weather normalization, which I've always talked about as more of an art than a science. And so when you compare quarter-over-quarter to that, you're going to get some noise. And more importantly, the second issue is, what Tom mentioned earlier, is the fact that we're now using to estimate our kilowatt hours yet to be billed or unbilled kilowatt hours, we're using our new digital platform, our new metering system to provide those estimates for us, which are much more accurate than our prior methods. They can cause noise year-over-year when comparing to a year that did not utilize that. We think this is a abnormal reflection of what's actually going on in the residential market.","Thomas A. Fanning","But Paul, I mean, even as you suggest, even if residential is flat and not down for the quarter, there is still some really interesting issues and we'll just see how they evolve. When we peel the onion on the effect, we think there is still reasonably, there will be economic growth. And I would tend not to get distracted with quarter-over-quarter results. When you do the kind of analysis you're thinking about, which is exceedingly valid, you're better off using long-term trends, and I would rather focus on year-to-date results rather than a quarter-to-quarter conclusion.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I don't want to belabor this. I appreciate your guys' input and would love to talk to you guys further about it off the call. But just finally on the Georgia PSC election, any thoughts, I mean, we should see here or anything you want to share with us, you being there on Ground Zero?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, look, we have 2 commissioners up for reelection, Stan Wise and Chuck Eaton. We'll see. The whole Georgia Commission has been, I think, very tough, but very fair. And we'll see what happens.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Just a question actually on the storm and just kind of -- I guess, you said you allocated 2,200 workers?","Thomas A. Fanning","Over 2,400.","Andrew Levi","Over 24. How is that allocation set? Are the power companies here in this region, do they kind of contract beforehand, or how does that work? And also where did your -- the majority of your people go?","Thomas A. Fanning","Okay, so there's a -- let me start real quick. There's a process where, for example, we're part of SEE, Southeast Electric Exchange mutual assurance group. There other mutual assurance groups in the United States. Of course, there are in the Northeast, New York, et cetera. Before it even hits land, we plan well in advance and then what we do is start to deploy before the storm hits the resources necessary to effectuate the restoration. I know that before Sandy hit the Northeast, we had deployed something like 2,000 personnel from Southern. Then the storm hits. One of the things that people must understand, and I've tried to be very public about this in all my Sandy -- Bloomberg and CNN and all the other stuff I've done, is that assessment process is so critical when you consider what you all had faced. And it's been very challenging, snow, wind rain, flooding. Some of the areas that had been impacted had been inaccessible. And therefore, without an assessment, it's been very challenging to deploy in the most optimal way. So there's been some time associated with that. Then they are deployed to the region to fix and then there's an iteration that goes forward. When you think about the total resources that we committed, it started at around 2,000 and now around 2,400. Our resources were deployed to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. And pretty quickly, they moved some resources up to Atlantic City. In this iteration that I described where they fix, reassess, fix, reassess, our folks are all over the Northeast right now. So when I get a report every morning, they are in every affected area you can imagine. I know one of the big issues, our folks came in after the initial damage, were an underground crews in the Con Edison area, particularly in Manhattan. So they're all over the place right now.","Andrew Levi","And do the companies up here kind of need to -- I don't need know if the word is contract, but I understand the assessment aspect. But do they have to kind of make arrangements with Southern Company beforehand that these assets will be allocated to them?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes. Hey, I'm sorry, I should have answered that one. Yes, so what happens is every -- like the Southeastern Electric Exchange mutual assurance group has, essentially, a contract in place that exactly calls for the reimbursement and the safety conditions and a variety of other things, conditions under which people will affect the restoration. So among the different mutual assurance groups, they basically adopt the same process, so that anyone requesting help will pay for the help that they receive and that work will be undertaken in the manner in which we are used to providing it.","Andrew Levi","So basically you need to be part of these mutual system programs.","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, but everybody is. And then the mutual assistance programs work with each other when the damage occurs outside. There's been plenty of SEE resources that have been put into non-SEE regions.","Andrew Levi","And I'm just trying to understand why your men didn't come further north at first.","Thomas A. Fanning","That was the original deployment and I can assure you they went north as soon as they were needed. When the reassessments were done. Remember that assessment is the big issue. And once the assessments were performed and the re-prioritization of the areas of critical need were performed, people were moved in, in the most effective, safest manner possible.","Andrew Levi","And is there a cost to the utilities up here to be part of these mutual assistance programs?","Thomas A. Fanning","Nothing more than overhead costs, people associated with the administering the group.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Can I just -- I have 2 kind of like things I want your comments, one on the macro, one more towards Southern Company. Can I just ask you -- this my opinion -- I think so the utilities have shortcut themselves by going to these programs where you share employees and they have cut their own resources of employees. And hence, I feel that the U.S. is, I guess, getting more hurricanes and things and all that. But the amount of interruptions we have versus a #1, you can call it, or Tier 1 country is horrible at least versus other Tier 1 countries. And I don't know, I think so, this is my just feeling. I think that the EEI has to think of some way to get this thing up. It's just occurring -- so much reoccurring and we lose so much output because of this. And the service is -- the breakouts for the time period that they're out is just not acceptable for a country like U.S. I don't know what it is. Either the infrastructures is really bad or you guys have cut through so many people that they can't respond in a manner that it takes 2 weeks for service to come back. To me, in a country like U.S., that's just not acceptable under any scenario.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, Ashar, look, I absolutely get the fact that a lot of people in the Northeast -- I'm originally from New Jersey myself -- are really disadvantaged and really going through a lot of pain right now. I completely understand that. The -- I would just dispute the notion about the state of our electric network. The electric network in the United States is the best in the world and the data supports it. We have to continue to focus on that and we have to deal with different regulatory models, frankly, that deal with it. We, in the Southeast, at least I can speak from Southern, we spend nearly $1 billion year on these issues. And our reliability, the statistics are SAIDI and SAIFI, that one deals with duration of outages and one deals with frequency of outages. We're on now more than a decade-long track record of performance and the system works great down here. We get buffeted with storms and I think what we're dealing with right now in the Northeast, and I know it's really hard being in the middle of it. And please understand, I certainly understand what you guys are going through, having gone through it a lot down here. It's just that, that storm, the misnomer of the perfect storm, level 1 hurricane being hit with a cold front that produced snow, wind, rain, flooding and an unprecedented amount of damage in a very highly concentrated area of population has just produced some unique circumstances. It is worthy always in evaluating lessons learned from these circumstances and understanding how we can serve customers better; that is always something we should do. But please understand you're dealing with an immense storm, unique circumstance, unusual part of the United States. We'll get through it. And when we learn something new, we will apply it in the future.","Ashar Khan","Tom, I get that. It's very unusual, but I'd still think that the workforce cuts in this mutual assistance programs in which the utilities have tried to shuttle this, this is just not working, okay? This is, I think, so what's hurting us, the customers. It's that you have these programs where you have kind of people coming in from all over the thing and not local people. Like I have a truck coming in from KCP&L. How does a KCP&L truck guy know about Manhattan? I think that's like waste of resources and efficiencies, okay? He cannot have a good view of how the underground network at KCPL truck, knows about what they would do in Manhattan. I mean, it's just like you throw these guys around and then, okay, whether they have the resources to get them back on, will just tackle with time. Just going to the second question. Based on what you gave us for the fourth quarter, what are we -- or is Southern, Georgia Power going to earn in 2012, can you share with us?","Art P. Beattie","Southern Power will earn...","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Georgia Power, Georgia Power. GP.","Art P. Beattie","Okay. Well, we outlined a range of $0.38 to $0.40. So Southern Company will be $2.62 to $2.64 within that range from our annual guidance.","Thomas A. Fanning","About 12.5%.","Art P. Beattie","Yes. And for Georgia Power, it's roughly 12.5% -- excuse me, from a Southern perspective and about 12.5% ROE.","Thomas A. Fanning","It's both. It's 12.5% for both Georgia and Southern.","Ashar Khan","Southern. And then Tom, just to remind us, when does that mechanism hit or when can we -- is it like at 9.5% or 10.5%, that we can go and get help under that mechanism?","Thomas A. Fanning","10.25% is the bottom of the range.","Ashar Khan","So 10.25%. So if you can go below 10.25%, we can go and ask for help?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Ashar Khan","Okay, so we have about 2 percentage points based on -- right now, of cushion right now, that we have?","Thomas A. Fanning","We gave you a corporate return there. So remember that Georgia corporate return is different than the allowed range. That's 10.25% to 12.5% with a midpoint -- I think they reset the midpoint at 11.15% last time.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So the difference between the corporate and the retail is, what, like, 150 basis points or something?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, more like 100.","Ashar Khan","More like 100. So it's more like 11% than 10%?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP.","Vedula Murti","Let's see, I apologize if you addressed this earlier, but going back to Plant Ratcliffe. If you don't get the interim increase next year and then you have to put the full plant into rates in 2014, from, I think, previous meetings with you guys, I want to make sure that I'm clear about this is, is that unlike in the past where you would take a plant like that and maybe be able to do a couple-of-year phase-in with deferrals and things of that nature, that the accounting rules no longer permit that, such that you would, under that scenario, need to put the full plant into rate base or ask for rates in one fell swoop and that to the extent that rates would be -- that it would be considered excessive that you'd have to -- possibly have to come back again as opposed to having the deferral mechanism and that type of thing. Am I correct about that?","Thomas A. Fanning","So, yes. So Vedula, part of it is and part of it isn't. In general, you're correct, let me say that. Now the part that I would agree with is, I think, Vogtle 1 and 2 may have been the last ones under the old accounting rules that you can do phase-in accounting essentially, if that's what you're referring to. There may be other ways to attack the problem. In fact, Art and I met recently with Moses Feagin -- he's the CFO of Mississippi Power -- Ed Day; they're regulatory people. We meet regularly on this project. We always call this kind of a \"What's in the house\" The \"what\" are building the plant and houses, how we're working with the regulators and with customers and all that. And in fact, I just went down and talked to the customer group of Mississippi about some of these things. I think we have some constructive approaches that we will work with the commission in which to be able to handle this plus all the other issues at Mississippi, and we're evaluating those options as we speak. I'd rather not speculate on those because it's just premature, number one, and we really want to kind of handle that in a very fulsome way with our regulators before we say too much about it in public.","Vedula Murti","Okay, and then secondarily, given that you're in front of the Supreme Court for CWIP, can you just remind me what the issue is there, why it's in court and kind of at this point in time, kind of like your level of confidence that CWIP would be permitted such that would help alleviate some of the issues in '14 or are you like maybe not expecting that to come through?","Thomas A. Fanning","Sure. So the Supreme Court is dealing with -- actually, it's in the Chancery Court now. It's dealing with an issue related to the certification. It's not dealing with CWIP. It's dealing with certification of the project. We believe what's going to happen -- I mean, I believe so, write this down or whatever. For whatever it's worth, I believe we're going to be upheld at the Chancery Court. If we are, the Sierra Club could appeal to the Supreme Court. Now, the issue related to CWIP has not been contested as a legal matter right now. The commission voted to defer putting CWIP in place until the matters related to the certification of the plant were concluded, okay? It's at the Chancery Court, we've got a good decision there. It goes to the Supreme Court. If we get a good decision there, we put CWIP in place, at least that's what the regulators say. That's where we are. As a practical matter, you must understand that by the timing of whatever is going on with the Chancery Court and then it would have to be resolved in the Supreme Court, we're going to be in service, we believe, May of 2014. So as a matter of prudence, we are planning for the potential of not even having CWIP for Mississippi Power Plant Ratcliffe.","Vedula Murti","But when we think about 2013, though, irrespective of whether you have CWIP or not, it will not be an earnings issue for 2013 because you'll simply capitalize otherwise. So simply, it's a cash issue but not an earnings issue?","Thomas A. Fanning","Precisely. We are booking AFUDC. And we have been very clear -- in fact, the commission has been very clear, I should say, about their support for the project. I mean, I think we've read on maybe the last earnings call, specific language out of press releases that 2 of the 3 commissioners gave. And I've even spoken to one of the commissioners there. They remain resolute in their support of the project. They just didn't feel that it was appropriate to put CWIP in place while matters relating to the certificate were still being considered.","Vedula Murti","But it sounds like, though, that they are very supportive of CWIP also as a means of managing the rate trajectories while that they have a very clear understanding of that.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, I think so. I absolutely say so. But if we defer putting CWIP in place until we resolve all the matters relating to certificate, we may have an in-service plant before those matters are concluded.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin.","Dan Jenkins","Just first, a couple of follow-ups related to the demand -- customer demand issues. I was wondering what the customer growth is you're seeing? Is that in line with what you expected or is there -- or has that been slower as well?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Dan. We thought we'd get about 19,000 new customers this year. And so far, through the first half, we got all of those. We didn't add any great amounts in the third quarter, but we still retain those. So we're ahead of where we thought we'd be from a customer perspective.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then on the industrial side, what sectors or what indicators are you kind of looking at to see if that's more persistent or have you talked -- I know you occasionally have a roundtable of manufacturers and so forth that you talk to. Have you done that?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, we didn't do that this quarter. We do it every 6 months, but this is the off quarter for that. But automotive is doing very strong and it has continued -- expected to be strong. And obviously, the suppliers and other industries that fabricated metals that support that, so we expect that strength to continue and that's on the fact that the age of existing inventory is so old. I think the average age of automobiles today is like 11 years. So that is expected to continue. The ISM Indexes are positive. They had been negative slightly in the second quarter, but now they've turned slightly positive. So that is a good indicator, and we've seen some indicators lately that there's more strength in the economy. Housing is beginning to come off the bottom but it's not -- it's coming off such a low level, it's not really going to make a whole lot of difference in the numbers that we're looking at. Really, it's the export-related industries like chemicals and primary metals that have been impacted the most. And we think as we look around what's going on in the export markets, it's the global economy that's beginning to slow a bit.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, Dan, one more thing. Art mentioned this is our off quarter for doing the customer touches. Every operating company this quarter, I think, held a customer convocation where they bring 100 of their top customers whatever end [ph], and I know I visited all of Gulf, Mississippi and Georgia. I know Alabama did one also. So we stay in touch with our customers on a real-time basis all the time.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. Then I had a couple of questions just on your Slide 17, which is the financing plan. And are those primarily add issuances, or does that include your equity issuance for those projections?","Art P. Beattie","What year are you talking about, Dan?","Dan Jenkins","Well, for both -- for all 3, '12, '13, '14?","Art P. Beattie","Well, we talked about equity issuances and the fact that we're actually repurchasing shares there, so we don't expect to issue any new equity this year or in 2013. We do plan on raising about $700 million of new equity in 2014, again, to support the capital program that we have in play. We've got about roughly $800 million of additional refinancing opportunities in the fourth quarter that we're hopeful to take advantage of. And then you can see the debt issuances in '13 and '14, I think they're roughly equally distributed, about $3 billion each.","Dan Jenkins","And then on your note there at the bottom, about potential DOE Loans, is that over '13 through '15 or does -- because it says over the next 3 years, I just want to clarify?","Art P. Beattie","Well, we're still negotiating those particular terms and conditions on the loans. And as soon as we're able to close those, we would begin to draw on the loan guarantees. But I wouldn't look for anything in 2012. I think 20 -- early 2013 would be a better date for the likelihood of that.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then the last thing I was curious about is you also have a note there that you're evaluating some callable debt for refunding and I think you could give a little more color on what acute problems are on those and what the criteria would be for you to call that.","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Dan, I don't have those. We can get back to you with that information as to specific issues. But roughly, it's about $800 million in issuances at Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, just briefly. Look, thank you so much for being with us. I know this was a long call. A lot of interesting topics to talk about. And please understand, too, as a matter of empathy, I know you are all going through a lot of hardship right now. Our hearts go out to you. I guarantee you, the industry is working as hard as it can to get the power back safely and as efficiently as possible. We'll continue that effort until every last one person has their power back. Thanks very much. Enjoying being with you today.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call.

Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. There are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning.","We'll also be including slides as part of today's conference call. These slides provide details on the information that will be discussed on this call. You can access the slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com if you want to follow along during the presentation. In addition, we are now making these slides immediately available for download on our website.","Now at this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning, Southern Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Thomas A. Fanning","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Before we turn to Art for a review of our second quarter performance and latest outlook, I'd like to make a few -- take a few moments to update you on our recent progress on several important operational and strategic fronts. As we continue our shift away from coal and increase our use of lower priced natural gas, we are passing the benefits along to our customers. For example, at our largest subsidiary, Georgia Power, we recently reduced fuel rates by 19% and overall retail rates by 6%, which represents a $567 million reduction. At Gulf Power, several incremental fuel rate adjustments had cumulatively reduced fuel rates by 25% and overall rates by 10% since the end of last year.","As we look ahead, our energy mix will continue to shift along with fluctuations in the cost of various fuel sources. But no matter what the future holds, we will continue to seek the best combination of available sources for the benefit of our customers with the goal of keeping retail prices as low as possible.","With that in mind, we remain focused on promoting a sensible national energy policy, first by preserving all available sources of generation, including new nuclear, 21st century coal, natural gas, renewables and energy efficiency; and second, by leading our industry in driving energy innovation, creating real solutions, not rhetoric, to meet the needs of this nation's energy future.","Two excellent examples of such innovations are Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County, Mississippi. Once online, these 2 projects are expected to provide value to our customers in terms of very low energy costs and relative price stability.","The significance of the Ratcliffe and Vogtle projects cannot be overstated. While natural gas appears plentiful and inexpensive today, it is not a panacea, and there are many reasons to be cautious about its future. These include the need to resolve potential environmental issues related to frac-ing; the need to develop infrastructure, including both pipelines and storage; the need to reach decisions about exporting natural gas, both quantity and time frame; evaluating the price and volatility impact of a shifting demand curve; and improving the relatively high counterparty credit risks that hinder our ability to hedge long-term gas exposure. Because overreliance on any single fuel source is never a good idea, we must continue to preserve existing sources, such as coal and nuclear, even as we cultivate new ones, such as renewables and energy efficiency. And as seen on this slide, even relative to a combined cycle plant burning natural gas at $3 per million BTU, the variable cost for electricity from plants Vogtle and Ratcliffe are expected to be significantly lower, with natural gas at $5 per million BTU, the cost differential is even more dramatic.","The relative energy cost benefits at Plant Ratcliffe are driven by the low cost of the project's abundant mine amount of lignite, as well as the benefits of long-term offtake agreements for CO2 and other by-products.","For Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the value of production tax credits, which are not included in this analysis, are expected to further lower the variable cost for the first 8 years of commercial operation.","Now please understand, we remain convinced that natural gas generation will continue to be a dominant solution in a balanced portfolio. In fact, we expect to have more natural gas capacity in our fleet than any other resource over the next decades. But clearly, the innovative new facilities we are adding should help preserve our fleet's diversity and provide relatively stable, low-cost energy to our customers for many decades.","With that in mind, I'd like to update you briefly on our recent progress with both of these major construction projects. Construction continues at the Ratcliffe site as we move toward our target completion date of May 2014. Our most recently filed status report reflects an estimated cost for the project of $2.88 billion, including a $62 million contingency. Earlier this year, the original certification order for Plant Ratcliffe was remanded back to the Mississippi Public Service Commission. The PSC acted quickly to enact a temporary order so that construction activity could continue while it considered the remanded order. The PSC later issued a new order with 70 additional pages of supporting detail and 300 references to the original record to protect against future challenges to the certification.","In its original order in 2010, the PSC agreed to allow Mississippi Power to recover its financing costs during construction. This agreement was a key to Mississippi Power's initial decision to proceed with this project. The revised order included in April -- issued in April of 2012 contained the same provisions.","In June 2012, the commission decided to deny CWIP recovery pending the resolution of outstanding legal challenges to the certification. Mississippi Power has asked that Mississippi Supreme Court, consistent with the stipulation reached with the PSC staff earlier this year, to allow it to begin recovering these costs subject to refund until such time that the court makes a final ruling. Denying these rates will increase costs for Mississippi Power's customers over the long term, and we are, therefore, hopeful for a timely resolution of this matter.","In the meantime, our current analysis indicates that the overall cost to customers for Plant Ratcliffe will be less than projected than the original certification due primarily to the lower cost of debt financing and the proceeds from the by-product sales mentioned earlier. In the end, our intent is to provide customers in Mississippi with the benefit of a cost-effective cutting-edge technology that exceeds even the EPA's proposed new source CO2 standards.","Construction is also proceeding on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with approximately 1\/3 of the project now complete. This project is expected to provide tremendous benefits to the state of Georgia over the next several decades, contributing to job creation and increased tax base and fuel diversity.","Our next regulatory milestone for this project will be the decision by the Georgia Public Service Commission on the costs included in our sixth construction monitoring report, which was filed earlier this year. This decision is scheduled for August 21. It is important to note that the commission's independent monitor has stated repeatedly that Georgia Power continues to manage the project well. It is also recommended that the commission approve all costs incurred during this reporting period.","Georgia Power is scheduled to file its seventh construction monitoring report on August 31. Tremendous progress can be seen at the plant site and at supply chain facilities located around the world, where some of the major components are being manufactured, all of which are on schedule. Testing on the heavy lift derrick commenced last week, and significant foundation work has been completed on the turbine islands, cooling towers and nuclear island.","As we look ahead to the next several months, major progress is expected to be made in the nuclear island's turbine building and module assemblies. Perhaps the most exciting progress will be the arrival of major components of the site later this year and early next year, the first of which is the reactor vessel for Unit 3.","In the meantime, we are continuing discussions with our contractors over the current project schedule and costs, and we'll continue to make decisions that are in the best interest of our customers. Any adjustment in cost or schedule is dependent in part on the outcome of these negotiations and must be approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission during the semiannual review process. We are keeping the Georgia PSC updated as these negotiations continue.","We are also reviewing the loan guarantee terms and conditions, including the new issues raised by the United States Department of Energy since the Solyndra default. Recall the nuclear loan guarantee program was put into place to incentivize utility companies to pursue new nuclear construction for the first time in decades. However, if we determine that the final terms and conditions for the DOE loan guarantee will not add value for our customers, we will finance the project through more traditional means. Even without these loan guarantees, we believe that we can still deliver up to the $2 billion in potential benefit to Georgia Power's customers from this project.","In addition to the work being done at plants Ratcliffe and Vogtle, we are continuing to place new units into service that reflect our commitment to innovate to innovative and diverse energy resources. In April this year, Georgia Power placed a second combined cycle gas unit in the service at Georgia Power's Plant McDonough-Atkinson. This 840-megawatt facility is one of the most efficient gas plants in our portfolio and will benefit customers with lower fuel costs. The final unit of Plant McDonough-Atkinson, another 840-megawatt combined cycle gas unit, is scheduled to be placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2012.","Meanwhile, Southern Power's new 100-megawatt biomass facility near Nacogdoches, Texas, began commercial operation in June of this year, ahead of our schedule and under budget. The Nacogdoches project is the largest biomass plant in the United States, utilizing the world's largest bubbling fluidized boiler. It will provide energy under a 20-year contract to the City of Austin, Texas.","Southern Power is further expanding its renewable portfolio by announcing a new project with its partner, Turner Renewable Energy, for a 20-megawatt solar photovoltaic plant in Nevada. The Apex Solar Project began operation this week. It is supported by a 25-year purchase power agreement with Nevada Power Company. This is Southern Power's second joint venture with Turner, the first being the Cimarron Solar facility in New Mexico.","We are increasing our use of other renewable resources as well. Alabama Power recently procured 200 megawatts of wind energy from Oklahoma and also filed an application with its Public Service Commission for another 202 megawatts of wind capacity from Kansas. We anticipate a hearing on the Kansas agreement in August and are hopeful for a positive ruling sometime this fall.","In a few minutes, Art's going to share our current projections for environmental compliance capital. As a reminder, there were several changes made to the EPA final mercury air toxics or MATS rule that provide for more flexibility than the originally proposed rule. Our public comments on the proposed rule were part of an effort to protect our customers from the significant and unnecessary cost of this rule and its burden on an already fragile economy.","Although these efforts have resulted in a lower expected cost for MATS compliance, this is still a very expensive rule that will be difficult to comply with on a continuous basis. Utility MATS is part of a combination of well intentioned, but overreaching rules and regulations that will eliminate a significant portion of America's current coal generation fleet and effectively prohibit new coal plants from being built. EPA, which is responsible to no electorate, is essentially creating America's energy policy, which is the job of Congress. We will continue to be engaged at a national level on these matters.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Art for a review of our second quarter performance and a few other economic and financial updates.","Art P. Beattie","Thanks, Tom. In the second quarter of 2012, we reported earnings of $0.71 a share, equal to our earnings of $0.71 a share in the second quarter of 2011. We recorded a $21 million net benefit during the second quarter of 2012 for an insurance recovery associated with the 2009 settlement that rose out of the 2003 bankruptcy of Mirant. This insurance recovery resulted in earnings of $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2012. Excluding this item, earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $0.69 per share compared with $0.71 per share for the second quarter of 2011, a decrease of $0.02 per share.","Our year-to-date as reported earnings for the first 6 months of 2012 were $1.14 per share compared with $1.20 per share for the same period in 2011. Excluding the insurance recovery item, year-to-date 2012 earnings were $1.12 per share compared with $1.20 per share for the same period in 2011, a decrease of $0.08 per share.","Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our numbers for the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. These drivers will exclude the insurance recovery item mentioned earlier. First, the negative factors. Weather reflects -- weather effects reduced our earnings by $0.06 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. Warmer-than-normal temperatures contributed $0.01 in the second quarter of 2012 compared with a $0.07 impact in the second quarter of 2011. Increases in nonfuel O&M expenses for our traditional operating companies reduced earnings by $0.02 a share in the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. Increased depreciation and amortization, representative of our growing rate base, reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. An increase in interest expense reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.02 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011.","Now the positive factors, retail revenue effects in our traditional business added $0.05 a share to our earnings for the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. Usage and economic growth increased earnings by $0.02 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. A reduction in income tax expense increased earnings $0.02 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011. Finally, parent and other added $0.01 a share to the earnings during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011.","In conclusion, we had $0.12 of negative items compared with $0.10 of positive items or a negative change of $0.02 a share, excluding the insurance recovery item.","Moving now to a discussion of our second quarter sales and our economic outlook. On a weather-normalized basis, our residential sales grew 2.1% during the second quarter of 2012. This reflects the nearly 20,000 new residential customers we have added across our system since the end of 2011. Improving economic conditions and migration into the Southeast are translating into positive signs for the housing market, with surveys of regional brokers and builders by the Atlanta Federal Reserve indicating increased buyer traffic, increased sales and declining inventories.","Meanwhile, Atlanta was recently ranked as the fifth most popular moving destination in the United States by the American Moving and Storage Association. As expected, residential growth was a leading indicator for commercial energy sales, which had a modest weather-normalized growth of 1.2% for the second quarter of 2012.","Our industrial sales for the second quarter of 2012 were essentially flat compared to 2011. These results reflect a broad range of drivers that vary from slowing global demand to increases in self-generation to increased production. Sales to our largest industrial segment, chemicals, were flat in the second quarter of 2012 due to slowing global demand. Our second largest segment, paper, continued to grow while its electricity demand declined as a result of an increase in self-generation. Finally, a number of industrial segments increased their usage as their production expanded. These include pipelines, up 12%; auto production, up 9%; lumber, up 7%; and fabricated metals, up 6%.","Meanwhile, our region's economic development activity for 2012 is well ahead of its 2011 pace. Some 7,200 jobs were announced in the second quarter alone, a 134% increase over the same period a year ago. And our project pipeline remains robust across a variety of industries.","In just the past few months, Airbus announced it will build passenger jets in Mobile, Alabama, beginning in 2015, adding up to 1,000 direct and nearly 3,000 indirect jobs. This project is transformational and could be as significant to Alabama in the aerospace industry as Mercedes-Benz has been in the auto industry.","State Farm Insurance, meanwhile, will bring 500 new jobs to Atlanta later this year as it consolidates a customer service center. We are also very encouraged by last week's announcement that the Obama administration will support the fast tracking of the proposed port deepening project in Savannah. This project, which is in concert with the expansion of the Panama Canal, will enable larger cargo vessels to enter the Savannah Port and is expected to spur greater economic growth for our region.","Earlier this month, we reconvened our economic roundtable group, which consists of selected economists and representatives of several large and commercial and industrial customers in our territories. Overall, the consensus from the roundtable was for U.S. gross domestic product to expand by about 2% in 2012. The group generally agreed that the global economy is slowing and that this is slowing the expansion of industrial production. Low natural gas prices are offsetting this trend, and we continue to see signs of onshoring activity due to a shrinking cost advantage for Far East markets when compared to the U.S.","The group has seen indications of improvements in the housing sector, but believes that continued recovery will remain slow. Finally, the group expressed confidence in the ability of the Southeast to grow faster than the U.S. as the economy improves due to faster population growth, a strong industrial base and a continuing trend of foreign investment into the region.","Before I discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and estimate for the third quarter, I would like to provide an update to our environmental compliance capital forecast along with our revised financing plan. As Tom indicated earlier, the final utility MATS rule provides [indiscernible] compliance flexibility than the original proposal. While we still have a few decisions to make on certain coal units, we have completed most of our analysis and have revised our 3-year compliance capital forecast to reflect our updated expectations. This forecast is subject to change if the current challenges to the rule result in revisions to the standard.","As you'll recall, we previously provided a MATS compliance capital projection of up to $2.7 billion for the 2012 through 2014 time frame. We also indicated that this amount could be reduced by $500 million to $1 billion, depending primarily on the number of baghouses in our final compliance strategy, bringing the final number to between $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion.","Based on our current analysis, our projection for MATS compliance for 2012 through 2014 now totals $1.8 billion, representing a reduction of $900 million from our previous estimates. While the number of baghouses has been reduced to 4 or 5 from a high of as many as 17, other costs have been added to our plan to reflect the need for additive injection systems and related plant modifications. As before, this plan also includes significant investment in transmission projects as well as fuel switching to natural gas.","Additionally, as part of our review, we have revised our other compliance capital needs to include current estimates for coal combustion residuals, effluent guidelines and 316(b) requirements. While this portion of our forecast includes a reduction of approximately $1 billion over the 3-year period, this primarily reflects a change in the timing for coal ash compliance spending. We expect to spend this money eventually, but that money might not -- might now occur outside the 2012 through 2014 time frame. Our strategy now calls for approximately 13,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation to be preserved for the long term. Of the remaining 7,000 megawatts, about 4,000 megawatts remain potential candidates for retirement. Most of the remaining units will utilize alternative fuels, primarily natural gas, to provide needed capacity.","As a result of this CapEx update, we have updated our debt and equity financing plans. This slide shows our 2012 year-to-date financing activity, as well as our current forecast for the remainder of 2012 through 2014. Based on revised CapEx projections, our updated financing forecast no longer reflects the need to issue equity in 2012 or 2013. As a result, we plan to use the proceeds from stock option exercises for 2012 and 2013 to buy back the incremental shares issued. This will keep net proceeds from equity at 0 for the 2-year period.","We continue to have success in the debt markets. Thus far this year, we have issued $2.5 billion of long-term securities with an average yield of 3.68% and an average maturity of 23 years. Our equity ratio target of approximately 44% is unchanged. By 2014, we see the need for approximately $700 million of new equity as our environmental spending ramps up. We currently anticipate the ability to fulfill this equity need through our existing dividend reinvestment and employee plans.","Now I'd like to share our earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2012. Our earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2012 is $1.12 per share, and our guidance range for the full year remains $2.58 to $2.70 per share.","Now, I'd like to hand it back over to Tom for his closing comments.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thanks, Art. In closing, I would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to our many employees who responded recently when devastating storms struck our neighbors in Florida and also in the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic regions. Even though our own service territories experienced damage from these same storms, we managed to dispatch nearly 1,800 workers to assist 10 utilities in the most severely affected areas. It's always awe inspiring to witness the pride and dedication exhibited by these crews, whether they're working in their own backyard or in some other parts of the country. That pride and dedication is the backbone of our business and expresses itself and the value we provide to customers year in and year out.","At this point, we're ready to take questions. So, operator, we'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First off, I guess in Mississippi with Ratcliffe, can you just walk us through kind of expectations of when you get a court decision. And if it goes your way and the commission feels like it's all cleared, how is the resolution going to get -- put back in place for cash recovery on financing costs?","Thomas A. Fanning","Dan, it's not clear. There is a procedure within the state, such that if the Supreme Court does not rule by 30 days, we get 1\/2 of the rates under bond put into effect. And if they don't rule by 180 days, we get the full asking put into effect. But as to when the Supreme Court will rule, it's just not clear. We hope it is quick.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the environmental CapEx changes, I guess baghouses accounted for a piece of it, but for the other compliance issues, is this just kind of the delay on 316(b) and that sort of stuff is just pushing out the CapEx? Do you think that those underlying capital expenditure numbers are still the right cost base for what you know today?","Thomas A. Fanning","You got it exactly. We think this is just movement in time rather than a change in magnitude.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the comment on maybe firing some of these coal plants of gas, can you just walk through how that works, the ability of the plants to run that way. And do they functionally distributed sort of like a peaking asset for super peak moments, or are these assets going to run more regularly?","Thomas A. Fanning","No, you got it. Essentially, you change the fuel feed system, so you're going to change a cold feed into a gas feed. Burner tips obviously change, so the production modifications are not that significant. So capital costs associated with changing is not that big. You are, however, going to be using gas in a relatively inefficient manner, but recall, we're doing this in order to accommodate EPA's own kind of onerous schedule requirements. We think that in general, the heat rates of these units will be in the 10,000 to 11,000 range and will serve essentially as heat made as a peaking capacity.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Tom, do those serve as a permanent solution or is it just an interim kind of fix to make sure you maintain reliability with the need to replace those with a CCGT or some sort of base load resource later?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, look, over time, we'll transition these units out, so it's hard to say kind of when that will occur. When you look at kind of our expansion plan on generation right now with Vogtle 3 and 4, with Kemper County, with bringing the Miller units, recall we did that last year, back from wholesale into retail in Alabama, with the McDonough units at Georgia, and then I guess another third-party capacity purchases that Georgia PSC has undertaken this year, I guess that's about 1,000 megawatts, when you add all those together, that really speaks pretty well to our capacity needs, including these MATS transition issues through 2020. So you're really asking a question post 2020, we'll see.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a clarification on the Mississippi filing. So what legal provision allows you to implement the rates if you don't hear from them? Is that under some kind of provision of the Mississippi, just general law or specific to this project?","Thomas A. Fanning","It's a state statute. It's state statute #77372. And the other thing that I just wanted to make sure everybody understands, when all this happened, 2 of the commissioners there, Leonard Bentz and Lynn Posey, came out with their own press releases. Let me just quote these guys. Bentz said, \"It is imperative to understand that I believe that the IGCC Plant is the best option for the customers of Mississippi Power.\" He goes on to say some other things. And then Posey says, \"I am still in support of the Kemper County plant and believe CWIP will ultimately save the ratepayer millions of dollars.\" The issue really arose with their reluctance to put CWIP in place while the other challenges in the state Supreme Court continued.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and we don't know when the other challenges will be ruled on, that could be whenever?","Thomas A. Fanning","You're right. We don't know.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just I'm curious on the coal to gas switching, did it change much even just first quarter to second quarter, though, or has it been pretty consistent this year?","Thomas A. Fanning","If you look at the appendix, we have some stuff in there -- in the appendix, we show kind of how it is changing. And I would argue that kind of as time goes by, it's fascinating. So for the first half, we're kind of 45% gas and 38% coal. Recall, we kind of projected for the year kind of a 47-35 relationship. So for the year-to-date '12, we're pretty well there. Now what's interesting is, during the third quarter, you should expect the ratio to kind of flip back a little bit more centric on coal. That's because we still have a lot of kilowatt hours. And I was just looking at kind of late-breaking data, we may set a new peak today. We're going to come very close for a yearly peak today. So these are things that we're keeping our eye on. And as total demand increases as a percentage just because the capacity is there, we'll burn a little more coal. But we'll keep our eye on it. We still feel confident with the 47-35 relationship with gas to coal for the year.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then one clarification on Vogtle 3 and 4, it sounds like the resolution of the $400 million of claims will also be, whenever that happens, is also a likely time frame to update any -- to do any overall cost updates, as well as timeline updates for the project. Is that the fair way to look at it or could they've all come at different times?","Thomas A. Fanning","I would argue that is the dominant theme of any change. I mean, recall that, that commercial issue really arose kind of with the delay originally of the DCD, which kind of was 11 months long; and then ultimately, the delay of the COL as a result, which was, I forget, 7 months long. And so their claim kind of centers on that circumstance. And recall also that the construction period uses, as a trigger point, the DCD and the COL, so that kind of starts the clock on the contracts. So that really is the kind of commercial issue on discussion, who's responsible for the DCD delay and also, therefore, the COL delay. So my sense is, Steve, there really hasn't been anything material since then. We talked about rebar last time, and just to remind everybody, we did that intentionally to say that we will always have issues and we shouldn't measure success or failure based on the presence of issues and challenges, rather how well we find success paths to solve those challenges. Well, in fact, I think we've got one on rebar, and we don't believe that the rebar issue will be at all any kind of material effect on cost or schedule. We'll file a license amendment request, and we'll get that done expeditiously. So it's just one of those issues where we're going to work through it and continue to derive constructive results. So I would say now, going back to your original question, it probably will coincide with the resolution of the commercial claim with us in the consortium.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jim von Riesemann from UBS.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The question I have is on a totally different topic. Can you talk a little bit about some of the industrial cogen that might be going on in the system and if it really means a longer term trend over there -- that we're going to see given the natural gas deck?","Art P. Beattie","Well, Jim, this is Art. Obviously, in the paper segment, you're going to see more of that than anywhere else. They're beginning to use a little more natural gas in that self-generation. It's an economic decision for them. In terms of size of that, I don't have any. I can get back to you with some of that, but I don't have any data at hand to talk about megawatts and how many are being impacted. But that's a normal operation that we would expect with companies like that.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, so in terms of like industrial growth going forward, we shouldn't expect to see a material change. Is that what you're saying at the end of the day?","Thomas A. Fanning","No, I wouldn't think so. Look, I think our industrial growth is still pretty robust. We want to go through this math. If you adjusted for cogeneration and kind of the major plants that we knew were on sort of maintenance outages -- in fact, we've gotten some intelligence that one of the maintenance outages is going to result in greater consumption once they come out, they're actually expanding. We think industrial sales quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year would have been a little less than 1%.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Switching to just usage and everything else, what do you see in terms of residential usage with some of the pickup in customers? It looks like it was up in the quarter.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, yes. So if you look at weather-normal residential sales, you were 2.1%. And if we had to break that out between kind of increasing customers and then usage, you would get to a usage increase of about 1.6%. But you got to be careful in how you view that because we've been adding new customers, and especially, it seems like we're gaining momentum there a little bit. When you think about usage, let's think about kind of a couple of things. One, unemployment is coming down, jobs are showing up, and as a result of people getting more jobs, personal incomes rise and so you see a normal cause-and-effect relationship with usage. More money begets more consumption. Another issue that is important really goes to when the new customers arise and how we keep score here. Whenever you look inside a quarter, you've always got to kind of be careful as to the longer term implication to the annual trend or the sustaining trend. Say, for example, we get a new customer in March, so they come at the very end of the first quarter. It will show up as a new customer, but very little increase in usage because they've just joined us. In the second quarter, you won't see the new customer, you will see the new usage, and therefore, there's probably an effect tied up in that 1.5% or 1.6% increase in usage. It really is kind of the catch-up effect as we add new customers. So look, there's a variety of effects here. We're gratified with the trend. We think the increase in customers is something that will provide sustainable benefits down the road to our growth projections. And even as Art mentioned with his economic roundtable, if they expect 2%, and that's interesting in terms of GDP growth for the Southeast, we're still staying with our about 1.3% electricity sales growth for the year.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. The follow-up question is a different topic, but on the highway bill, in the recent act, is there any impact on you guys with your funding contribution or potential funding contribution requirements going forward?","Art P. Beattie","Dan, we're still looking at that.","Thomas A. Fanning","We think it's beyond 2015, is kind of what we're guessing right now.","Art P. Beattie","So nothing in the short term.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm kind of following up on Steve and Dan's question on Ratcliffe. And I understand, I guess, in 30 days, Mississippi Power can institute or recover 50% of, I guess, the CWIP. Is that accurate and is that your plan if no decision comes out of the Supreme Court?","Thomas A. Fanning","Sure. Yes, that's what the statute provides.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And will you guys introduce the interim rates?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Do you know when the 30 days is or roughly?","Thomas A. Fanning","Let me make sure I get the right date. It's around August 8.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Tom, I just -- I think you've probably answered half of my question on customers and usage, but I want -- you also made a comment that you felt you're picking up momentum and you have this 20,000 customers in the first half. But you have 15,000 in the first quarter, and so that would sort of suggest that the -- yes, the sales showed up in Q2 rather than Q1, but the pace of additions dropped off pretty sharp in Q2.","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, that amount that you're referring to was the positive income impact. And recall also that sometimes the addition and subtraction -- the ebb and flow of customers is seasonal. So we think there's still reason to believe that we have good growth ahead of us here.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that normal seasonality, you'd see more hours in Q1 than Q2, if you look back to when you were adding, I guess, in the past?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, but we still believe there's some ahead of it as well.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then -- and could I just follow-up also on the rebar issue. I remember before, you were kind of talking about the fact not having to make a license amendment request, which is kind of the right path forward, but now you are going to have to do that, or it sounds like you're going to have to do that, but you still think it can be done expeditiously. Can you talk a bit more about -- why that won't impact the schedule, how long you think it's going to take and what you can do in the meantime -- can you keep working in the meantime? How we sort of get into the details of that statement?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, I'd be glad to provide you information. I remember at our recent Vogtle executive oversight meeting, Buzz Miller shows us essentially a schematic of work that continues in the nuclear island, even besides, the fact that we're working on a rebar. Now let's kind of go through the blow by blow a little bit as to what happened there. So in an inspection, we found that the configuration of the rebar along a particular wall was not per the DCD. We stopped work, we tried to figure out, along with the NRC, what the right path was. Recall, too, this is a new procedure that we're borrowing with. In the old days, you build a plant and then you had the NRC basically certify it. And now we have a design certified and we've got to build to the design. So this is a little bit of a new process for everybody to come along with. We thought that we had -- that really, Westinghouse Shaw had a design that was not going to require a license amendment. We're the licensee here, and one of the things we did was to send a letter to the NRC to basically seek clarity. You know that we have a conservative [indiscernible] towards these things, probably didn't need to do it, but we sought their oversight here to make sure that the changes that were being proposed met the NRC requirements. And so what we got back from the NRC was actually helpful, that is, that the NRC responded, in fact, we probably should pursue a LAR, a PAR, a license amendment request, preliminary amendment request. So we know now that we're building to the license and the path forward is as we've suggested. My sense is that with all the other work going on, this rebar issue is not critical path, and we do not believe this endorse to our cost responsibility in completing the plant.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So in terms of any sense of how long it might take to -- how long is that the case?","Thomas A. Fanning","I'm a little reluctant to do that, but what's in my mind is a number of weeks, like 3 weeks, something like that. But that's all dependent upon how you get the license amendment request turned around. We hopefully will complete all the rebar by the fall of '12, but the weeks I'm talking about is the amendment request from the NRC. But we think that'll be turned around expeditiously.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Depending that, we should think -- look for that to be turned around in less than a month kind of thing?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, yes, that's my estimate now. [indiscernible], but that will be my best judgment as I sit here.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A very, very, very brief question. We, I guess, had not assumed that your compliance forecast would ultimately come in near the high end, so I think net of this $1.945 billion reduction, is it fair to say when we, because I'm not in front of all the data, that this takes you to your budget just down to the $16.3 billion that's closer to the midpoint of what you had laid out when you gave that big analyst presentation a year or 2 ago?","Thomas A. Fanning","So it's -- so at least in terms of kind of what we said before with respect to MATS, we said $2.7 billion. And then we -- as we got kind of the new rule, not the proposed rule, we said it could be between $0.5 billion or $1 billion less, and therefore, we said $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion. Well, sure enough, it ended up at $1.8 billion. When you think about the total amount of CapEx, it was $18.2 billion or $18.3 billion, and now we kind of think it's going to be $16.4 billion, $16.3 billion, somewhere in that realm.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Certainly -- probably, it takes some of the pressure off on the financing side, which is [indiscernible].","Thomas A. Fanning","Well -- and in fact, that's why Art was very clear about the lack of equity needs over the next 2 years.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And you feel like relative to the long-term earnings growth aspiration of the corporation this keeps you inside the skids on that?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mark Barnett with MorningStar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. I know you had already given some good detail on these splits. When you're looking at the 20k number of customers for the year, just a little granularity, if possible, on new connections and newbuild versus maybe some reconnections and kind of what's driving that in the mix.","Art P. Beattie","Yes, we've done a little more research on that, and it appears that we've got a good mix of maybe some homes that have been foreclosed that had meters removed from the premises that have now been reinstalled and sold. The inventory of unsold homes is down in Atlanta, and that's a reflection, we think, of that fact. That is also supported by the fact that most of the 20,000 customers, 60% of them are in Georgia, about 25% in Alabama and the remainder would be in Gulf and Mississippi. So it's not just one state, it's across the system that we're seeing this increase in customers.","Thomas A. Fanning","A little more color, too. One of the effects you have to consider are the tornadoes that impacted Alabama. And we think the people stayed in the region, so what you see is kind of this interesting migration of people that may have been living with relatives or in temporary residences now moving either into multifamily homes or moving into primary residence looking homes. And another just data point that underlines what Art just told you, unsold housing inventory now is about 2.8% relative to kind of a normal level of about 2.3%. You may recall during the depths of the recession, we were in the 4s, so we're really making good progress on eating up that excess inventory.","Art P. Beattie","And, Mark, I guess one other element of that is we saw some multifamily additions as well, so it's not just new homes, it's some new apartments. And we're just surmising that folks that we're doubling up before are now creating new households and that's begun to take shape.","Thomas A. Fanning","And in fact, I hear you've credited the Fed, I joined the board of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, the multifamily housing sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in housing in the Southeast.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. And quickly on kind of the roundtable discussions that you've had and obviously some really positive news there, I guess just going forward from a big picture, how do you sort of view the, like, a strengthening dollar, the prospect for a strengthening dollar on the region's export economy, mixed bag between final assembly and maybe more domestic supply chain? I mean, how do you see that developing?","Art P. Beattie","That's a good question, but it's not one that we discussed at the meeting. It didn't come up amongst the economists or the chemical folks who would probably be exporting a lot of their goods with this low natural gas price. They were more concerned with global demand and where that was going. Especially in China and South America were more of their concerns. But obviously, the dollar is a factor that they will have to keep up with. And about 25% of the goods in the Southeast are, we think, are going toward -- the value of that is going to exports. So it will impact the Southeast.","Thomas A. Fanning","And it's fascinating stuff. I mean, the value of our exporting has gone up 8% year-over-year, so that continues to be an interesting area. But I would say most of these businesses are adjusting off of because they will also talk about their fear of the continued malaise in Europe. And even though China has a 7% GDP growth, it's reduced from what everybody thought it was going to be. My sense is businesses in the Southeast are adjusting on the fly. We still benefit from the fact that even with potentially a stronger dollar -- but recall, we have our own challenges. We've got our own cliffs at the end of the year. We have our own fiscal challenges. It is not clear that we are inevitably heading towards a stronger dollar, perhaps we will against the euro, unclear about other worldwide currencies. I guess, people are watching this like they never have before and they are responding accordingly. At least we can stay in the Southeast, as we have in the past, but we have the prospects for a more robust economy given a business-friendly climate, willing and able workforce, et cetera. So we'll see.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. One, Tom, going into the quarter, you guys had guided us to like a $0.65 number for the quarter. Weather obviously came out relatively normal. So what was the real driver in your mind that caused you to do $0.04 better than what you guys thought going in?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Ali, it's -- if you look at the revenue effects in 3 of the 4 operating companies, those certainly offset the weather that we had compared to last year. Nonfuel O&M was a piece of that as well as we were able to -- even on a year-over-year basis, O&M were up, but on our expected basis, we reduced a good bit of that. I think on a year-to-date basis, we're some $100 million below our original expectation there, so we've done quite a lot to drive those numbers.","Thomas A. Fanning","And I would like to -- as I said, Art and I obsessively compare for this call and everything else, we would like to look for kind of interesting relationships of data. And one of the things that we were just looking at, kind of that's true for the quarter, true for the year-to-date, it looks like 2011 year-to-date and for the quarter had much more favorable weather from an earnings standpoint than did 2012. And it completely masks kind of the increase so far we've seen from customers, usage and the revenue increases that we've seen through regulatory processes. So if you just look at it, year-to-date, we've increased on a cents per share basis $0.13 out of customers' usage and other revenues. Weather was negative $0.14. My sense is, as we go through the rest of the year, if weather is nearly the same as last year, you'll start to see the power of the earnings capability through the regulatory mechanisms and improvements in customers and usage come to bear.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Tom, second question, one of the interesting anecdotes that came out on the ongoing Duke hearings out of North Carolina was the sudden Progress discussions that apparently had gone pretty far along before not getting completed. So just curious, if would remind us what your thinking is on the M&A side and what works, didn't work, or I mean, how are you looking at the toleration in the industry today?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, I always laugh about this because we're just remarkably consistent here, and you guys could probably get the same speech I'm going to give, but I'm going to give it anyway. Our view is it is part of our fiduciary responsibility to always seek ways to accrete to shareholder value. We think about M&A as a how, not a what. The \"what\" would be that we like our integrated regulated business model even in the competitive generation business, we structure it with long-term bilateral contracts of creditworthy counterparties not taking fuel risks in order to essentially replicate the model that we like that avails our customers, our shareholders with essentially -- our customers with reliable electricity at low prices and the best service possible, and our shareholders with reasonable returns with the lowest risk profile as possible. That serves us, we think, awfully well. During Franklin's tenure, even when I was head of strategy, we coined the phrase, \"The business we know, with the place we know, with the customers we know.\" We really do like and believe in our model and think it serves our customers and shareholders exceedingly well. Now we always do look to seek ways to improve it, and that is an ongoing responsibility of management and we continue to do that. But I would just remind everybody, when you look at our track record over almost any time frame, our stand-alone proposition is awfully strong, so we're always looking for ways to improve upon an already strong value proposition.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So fair to say price was one of the key issue that gets in that specific discussion?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, obviously, I think having given you the generality, we won't comment on any specific situation.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. Last question, if I could, Art, perhaps to you, given the reduced CapEx numbers that you're talking about now, what kind of rate base annual growth should we be thinking about for Southern?","Art P. Beattie","Ali, I believe the number that we're looking at is going to run at 6% to 7%. Remember, that's adjusted in the short run. Those projects wouldn't come online until '14, '15, so -- and recall that rate-based growth is lumpy, so you're going to see it occur in spurts rather than evenly over time.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","6% to 7% annually?","Art P. Beattie","Yes.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions for you, Vogtle and Ratcliffe related, I'm going to -- going back to that slide you talked about, Tom, where you showed the variable cost on a per-megawatt-hour basis, do you mind giving that same information but all in, so including both variable and fixed?","Thomas A. Fanning","Say that again?","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well, just -- I'm trying to think about the total -- customers have to pay for the return on and return of capital, so it's not just a variable cost economic analysis. What would be the all-in dollar per megawatt hour or cents per kilowatt KWH numbers for Ratcliffe and for Vogtle relative to like a new combined cycle?","Thomas A. Fanning","I don't have that in front of me. You guys may be able to deliver. But it's -- the numbers I have in my head would be on a dollar per KW basis. You're going to look at a new plant like 4,500. Kemper was like 4,200, but I think that's a $14 billion number for the nuke and a $2.4 billion number. So it's going to be slightly higher than that. We went through this math last night. We will be able to get it to you later. That is kind of the number that -- what I've always said is it's a sad thing about Kemper, it's a coal plant that has an environmental profile better than natural gas and has an economic profile roughly equivalent to a nuclear plant, and I think that's what that slide shows you. That's how it will dispatch.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. You also, in one of the slides on Vogtle, you referenced some comments from the independent monitor, but if I go back and look at Bill Jacobs' testimony filed in late May, he makes some interesting comments about his concern that there's not -- I think he calls them integrated project schedule that's been published lately or has been disclosed in the public domain lately. He references a number of potential change orders above and beyond the rebar issue that could impact the timeline. These items are redacted in pages 16 and 17 of that testimony. Just kind of curious, at what stage do you have to go back to the commission and say, \"Hey, look, here's what the new schedule is, here's where we'll take it forward?\" Or is that really not mandated on you by the commission until you actually get everything resolved?","Thomas A. Fanning","So, Michael, the way you ought to think about our relationship with the independent monitor and the staff and even the commission, it is continuous and not discrete. We have an exceedingly transparent process as we go through this effort together. So that's point one. Point two really goes back to Fleishman's question. When you think about kind of the major factors that could impact cost and schedule, I guess we have arrived all the time kind of commercial issues that we deal with and have settled and continue to deal with. It's just this one, this $800 million claim by the consortium against all of the owners, that's kind of gotten the most interest by people. Now obviously, we've already disclosed that we dispute the claim and all that. But I would argue that as we settle the commercial difference that we have with the consortium, if there is a change in the cost or schedule, it would likely be in association with that settlement.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Alli [ph] with Decade Capital.","Unknown Analyst","Quick question, I think I might have missed this a little earlier in relation to Greg Gordon's question about growth CAGR, still intact? Could you just remind us what it is and what the base is?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, the base is our current range of guidance for this year of $2.58 to $2.70. Grow the top end of that by 7, grow the bottom of that by 4. And that, over the next 3 years, would describe the growth in earnings range that we see as possible within the model. With the change in CapEx, remember that, that would probably only affect some AFUDC during the 3-year time frame, so we still see it as possible with a strong economy, with supportive weather. And with Southern Power having the opportunity to do more as well, we still see that range as being reflective of possibilities for earnings growth.","Thomas A. Fanning","If I'll just add to that, the change in CapEx through this 3-year period, you almost can't see the difference. It's -- over time, you'll start to see more, but in the near term, it -- the ones don't hardly matter. And remember, we're not going to be issuing -- we'll be issuing less equity as we have less CapEx, so that kind of offset some of the effects. We're very comfortable with the range.","Unknown Analyst","Got it. And then just the load embedded in those ranges?","Art P. Beattie","Talk about growth in sales?","Unknown Analyst","Yes.","Art P. Beattie","Yes, that remains unchanged. That was the original forecast we put together. And we update that. We'll update you in January of next year, about 2013.","Thomas A. Fanning","And we're still good with our 1 3 estimate this year.","Art P. Beattie","Right.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, excellent. Just on the Kemper County issue, the NPSC, they then filed, is it a brief, asking the Supreme Court to rule faster? Or what was the, I guess, their last filing in that case?","Thomas A. Fanning","The Public Service Commission basically argued against the base -- I mean, the rates under bond just to reject the interim issue. All they're doing -- and it was very brief, there wasn't any kind of associated testimony or underlying facts or whatever. It was really just kind of restating the conclusion that they reached when they decided to defer the inclusion of CWIP rates until the state Supreme Court issue related to certification was settled. It was just that they didn't feel like they should put in CWIP until the issue with the Supreme Court was resolved.","Unknown Analyst","Got it. Does that create any -- I guess, if you guys continue along the path and the, say, the Supreme Court doesn't rule for, call it, 220 days or something you guys are already collecting, does that create any issues for the NPSC? I mean, they're supportive of the plant anyway, but why would they -- or I guess why would they oppose to the automatic collection?","Thomas A. Fanning","I can't speak as to what was in their minds. We were surprised by this vote because if you think about it, when the plan was originally certified in the new order, it all contemplated having CWIP. The legislation that was passed in Mississippi contemplated CWIP. We think CWIP is warranted for a project of this magnitude.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I kind of want to follow up on that last question by John and your answer there. I mean, do you think that they're concerned about what the ultimate decision will be in the Supreme Court? Or because, I mean, like you said, it was a little bit of a surprise and, I mean, it would suggest, I don't know, again -- me without -- not knowing all the legal intricacies that maybe there's some issue there, or is there? What -- can you elaborate a little bit on that?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, okay, so this is my opinion. I don't believe there's an issue there at all. I think when you look back at the testimony, when we decided to go forward with this plant, a lot of what Mississippi was concerned with was fuel diversity. If they had not built this plant, they would have been relying much more on natural gas. And we all know that, that is a higher beta energy policy, if you will. We've already seen some volatility in natural gas prices. Even though they're historically low, they're now creeping to about $3 per million BTU. And it's interesting there, since I've been out there in the weekend interview on The Wall Street Journal and some of the other speeches I've been giving lately, I think more and more people are realizing that while it's a wonderful circumstance we find ourselves in to have cheap natural gas, it's not hard to come up with data. I would argue that -- and if you want me to, I'll go through this, but I'll save it if you don't. It's not hard to say that you could go from an average daily consumption of natural gas in the United States from, say, a 67 million Bcf -- I mean, 67 Bcf per day to something well over 100. It's not far a put to get there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, I think -- no, I don't want you to get into a lot of details. Just was -- I mean, I hear what you're saying. I just -- it just is sort of a little bit of a surprise, I guess...","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, it was a surprise to us.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right. Okay. And then just finally, the DOE loan guarantees, I mean, so what is the hang-up there? And I know you guys feel that you can finance it either way, and I just -- it seems like it's going on a long time now and I just was wondering if there's any sort of -- if you can give us sort of just a feeling as to what the specific issue is? And would it make an impact, I guess -- the financing numbers that you guys have, I assume, I guess, you don't have the loan guarantees in there, correct?","Thomas A. Fanning","Correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right. So any deal you'd come up with would be even a lower deal for customers, I would assume. So could you just sort of give us a little bit of a flavor for what's going on there?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Paul, this is Art. As Tom kind of explained in the script, ever since Solyndra occurred, the DOE has gotten much more deliberate in its negotiations around terms and conditions of these loans. The conditional agreement that we had with them was around a corporate finance perspective, and where they are going is more towards a project finance-oriented terms and conditions. And some of the requirements that they have outlined for us are things that may increase cost to customers. And we're simply saying that at -- the bottom line for us here will be value to customers. We're not going to do anything to jeopardize the value of those elements that we represent. So that's kind of the bottom line that we'll use to measure as to whether or not we pursue these to final resolution or whether we bypass them and just go the credit markets for the capital.","Thomas A. Fanning","And let me just add my own color here too. And Art said deliberate. I would add, it's not just deliberate in terms of slow and pedantic in style, it is new, and that really goes to these notions of project finance on a corporate finance deal that doesn't make sense and unnecessarily burdens our financial integrity and financial flexibility. We are making good progress. We are working through, and we're very hopeful that we can get all this done, but time will tell.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on the tax, the income tax, I noticed that, that's been going well for the last couple of quarters here. Is there anything in particular that's causing it to be -- is that kind of unusual? Or do you think that, that's pretty much the run rate we should be expecting here at34% rate? And just the $0.01 at parent, other than the nonmarket benefit of parent is a guess what I'm talking about, what was that?","Art P. Beattie","I'm sorry, Paul. Your question on taxes was around the $0.02 in the second quarter?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","The $0.02 in the second quarter, right, just -- and just -- it looks like it's been good the last couple of quarters, so just -- is that just the sort of the run rate we're thinking about here or there's -- were there any sort of special sort of settlement gig or there's something that [indiscernible]...","Art P. Beattie","There were some ongoing normal routine kind of adjustments through some reserves, but these are normal recurring kind of things. Sometimes they move positive, sometimes they move negative. Our effective tax rate was 34%, so it's pretty stable as well in the second quarter.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just the parent benefit at $0.01?","Art P. Beattie","That was lower financing cost at the parent year-over-year.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Just a quick question, and I guess you've kind of touched on it as far as your long-term growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, but I guess kind of just playing with some numbers, changing some of the CapEx numbers and then obviously just understand -- on the common stock, so you're not going to issue any next year, right, and in fact, I guess you'll be buying back stock for your various plants, right, in the open market, is that correct?","Art P. Beattie","That's correct.","Andrew Levi","Right, so you'll basically have flat shares next year. And I guess this $872 million number you had on the second quarter, that'll probably be pretty close to what you have for the year this year, and then I guess you start issuing stock again in 2014. But kind of looking at that and looking at also what you've done as far as your financing plan on the debt side, would it be fair to say -- now, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but just kind of the numbers I'm looking at that you'd probably be closer to the 6% to 7% earnings growth rate, everything else equal, versus being down to the 5% range, is that kind of fair?","Art P. Beattie","Well, Andy, there's lots of moving parts in there. As I mentioned earlier, it's going to take weather, it's going to take a strong economy, it's going to depend on the O&M flexibility we have within those same time frames. So yes, it's difficult to isolate one variable and make a -- and give you an answer on that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ashar Khan from Visium.","Ashar Khan","Can I just ask the third quarter guidance, what are the things that kind of, like, help in the third quarter versus last year, positives and negatives?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Ashar, hold on a sec, I got something here to help me. We look at the revenue effects that you saw through the second quarter, those will continue into the third quarter at -- that's at Georgia, Alabama and Gulf. You should have some additional help from Southern Power as they picked up some new contracts this year around Nacogdoches and with Cleveland County. And they should be additive in the second half of the year. We continue to have O&M initiatives, which we think may add as well. And I think growth may be an add or dependent upon how our commercial and residential numbers look in the third and fourth quarter.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And then can I just ask, as you stand at the midpoint of the year, based on what you have earned, it seems like -- is the midpoint the better point where you can end up for the year as we are still trailing on an LTM basis? Or is there still a chance that you can end up at the higher end, upper end of the guidance?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, you could still end up there. There's lots of moving parts...","Thomas A. Fanning","What we always do is we'll update you at end of the third quarter. You know the third quarter is so important to our earnings profile. And so far, we have reasonable weather in July. The one thing I would just point you to is that kind of interesting data profile I gave you for the first 6 months, and that is when you look at customers and usage and also the revenue changes we've had in some of our jurisdictions, that was up $0.13 in the first 6 months. Now year-over-year comparisons, we were down $0.14. So, so far, for the first 6 months, the adverse comparisons on weather have basically wiped away the other positive earnings profiles that we've been able to show. So far, if you look at the last 6 months of the year, if weather is the same -- and actually we had a mild fourth quarter in 2011, but if weather is the same for the next 6 months and you'll see the power of these new earnings profiles, new customers usage, et cetera, come to bear. So obviously, we'll update this later, but I think that's kind of interesting profiles, including what Art told you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Dan Jenkins","I had a couple of questions, first related to your update to the financing plan and first focusing on 2012, that's up quite a bit from what you issued earlier. And I was curious how much of that is just, let's say, additional refinancing or callable debt that you did versus new net issuance versus the original plan.","Art P. Beattie","Let's see here.","Dan Jenkins","You originally had, like, 35.50 for 2012 and that's 42.59 now. So...","Art P. Beattie","So let's see. We're at about $300 million ahead, so I would estimate that $300 million is probably some refinancing opportunities that we took advantage of.","Dan Jenkins","So you haven't increased your net debt issuance plan for 2012, it's all just out?","Art P. Beattie","We still have a number of other issues that are candidates, possible candidates, potential candidates, for refunding. But what we've outlined to you is either maturities or new money needed to finance the ongoing needs of the construction program in our business.","Dan Jenkins","Any refinancing wouldn't add to the net issuance, that would only -- because what you retired would subtract and what you issued would add and then it would net up to 0. So I guess -- so is that the entire reason for the increase in 2012 versus the 35.50 that you...","Art P. Beattie","Yes, I believe it's just refinancing opportunities. Now if it can reduce CapEx, you may see some reduction in the second half, so we'll see.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then I also had a question related to the industrial, you've shown some industrial highlights on Page 10 of the presentation. And overall, industrial was flat. So I was curious kind of 2 things: One, what were the areas that were negative that kind of offset the positive highlights you showed. And then of the positive highlights that you showed, how many of those or what portion of that was related to, say, new plants or new pipelines that would be -- that continue in later quarters versus just expanded capacity here at existing facilities?","Art P. Beattie","The segments that were down for us, the biggest one that -- I don't have it in front of me, but it is paper, and that I believe we covered that in our information around self-generation. They've opted to self-generate with the low price of natural gas. The others -- hold on just a second. Paper was down. The military bases were down. That may be somewhat weather-related there. And textiles, which is really housing-related, is down about 10%. So those are the biggest elements of the negatives amongst the industrial segments.","Thomas A. Fanning","And in line with the maintenance outages, right?","Art P. Beattie","That's correct. But that was in chemicals. Chemicals were basically flat year-over-year.","Thomas A. Fanning","But it was a great big one.","Art P. Beattie","Yes.","Dan Jenkins","So for the ones that were up though, how much of that do you expect to continue going forward? Is that for mostly new facilities and so forth?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, if you look at transportation, auto production, they've added new ships to their production lines, so it depends upon how that demand relates to that. The pipelines, there was a new pipeline customer in Gulf, in our Florida Panhandle, so that would be an additive customer that would help that number to be positive through the rest of this year.","Thomas A. Fanning","And then you go to the economic development thing as you start to build out Airbus and a variety of other things, Caterpillar.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. Further out, further out.","Art P. Beattie","[indiscernible] in the near term.","Dan Jenkins","And then just to follow up on -- earlier on your -- when you were asked about the marginal cost versus the all-in costs for those new facilities, I'd be interested in that information as well.","Thomas A. Fanning","You bet, we'll give it to you.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning","I just want to say thank you all so much for joining us here this afternoon. It's always a pleasure to chat about the business. And we see a bright future ahead for the rest of this year and look forward to chatting with you about it in the months to come. Thanks for joining us.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Wednesday, May 3, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Aaron Abramovitz - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Carlos. Welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you, we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during today's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Each of our major business units had a great start to the year. Despite headwinds from unseasonably warm weather during the first two months of the year, our traditional electric and gas operating companies performed well and they are on track to deliver on their targets for 2017 and beyond. Southern Company Gas, including its seven premier state-regulated gas utilities, performed exactly as expected.","Art will update you on our financial results in just a minute, but I'd like to first provide brief updates on the status of the Vogtle and Kemper projects. First, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As you know, Westinghouse, the primary contractor for the Vogtle expansion, declared bankruptcy on March 29. Georgia Power and the co-owners of Vogtle were well prepared for this event. The owners immediately entered into a 30-day interim agreement, which was, as announced last week, extended through May 12. The Interim Assessment Agreement allows work to continue and maintains momentum on the site while we develop comprehensive schedule and cost assessments for the project. Thanks to the Interim Assessment Agreement and close coordination between Georgia Power, the co-owners, Southern Nuclear, Westinghouse and Fluor, approximately 6,000 workers have remained on site, safely completing multiple concrete placements and other work within the two nuclear islands in the balance of the plant.","In fact, we've seen meaningful improvements in productivity since our last earnings call in late February. Currently, we are working on an agreement with Westinghouse that will allow work to continue even if current EPC agreement is rejected as a part of the bankruptcy proceeding. Westinghouse has indicated its intention to reject the EPC contract.","The limitations on Westinghouse's execution of the project imposed by the bankruptcy creates uncertainties that are not good for the project, especially over an extended period of time. If Westinghouse is not committed to perform under the EPC contract, Southern Nuclear is well positioned to manage the site. The agreement we are negotiating is intended to ensure a smooth transition and continued access to Westinghouse resources. This should put us in the best possible position, whether the ultimate decision is to complete the project or not.","Separately, we are seeking to add structure to Toshiba's payment obligations under the $3.68 billion parent company guarantee. Ultimately, Georgia Power's objective is to be positioned with sufficient information to make a fully informed recommendation to its regulators within the next month or two. It is possible that we will need more time to ensure that we have the best information possible and to reach consensus with the co-owners regarding the best path forward for customers and all other stakeholders.","More importantly, the conclusion of our assessment and development of a recommendation will merely begin a regulatory process that does not yet have a definitive timeframe. An important consideration as we move forward will be ensuring that the regulatory recovery framework for the project continues to support the financial integrity and strong credit ratings of Georgia Power.","Now let's turn to an update on the Kemper County project. Over the past two months, Mississippi Power has continued its efforts to improve gasification reliability as we work towards reaching sustained operations using both gasifiers in the production of electricity.","As we discussed earlier this week, the ongoing challenges with various systems had led to extending the estimated in-service date to the end of May. Mississippi Power expects to file its Kemper rate case with the Mississippi PSC by the June 3 deadline.","In connection with this filing, Mississippi Power expects to request an accounting order to defer all costs incurred after in-service that cannot be capitalized, are not subject to the cost cap and are not already included in rates.","As a reminder, Mississippi Power's current strategy is to file both a traditional rate case and an alternative multi-year rate mitigation plan as provided for under Mississippi law. A negotiated settlement with interested parties that would be subject to PSC approval is an acceptable outcome. We don't want to get ahead of that process on today's call. Our goal remains to achieve an outcome that balances the interests of customers and other stakeholders.","I'll turn the call now over to Art for a financial and economic overview.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2017, reporting earnings of $658 million or $0.66 per share compared with earnings of $489 million or $0.53 per share in the first quarter of last year.","First quarter results for 2017 include after-tax charges of $67 million related to increased cost estimates for work at Mississippi Power's Kemper County integrated gasification combined cycle project. First quarter results for 2016 included after-tax charges of $33 million for the Kemper Project.","First quarter results for 2017 also include after-tax charges of $20 million associated with Plant Scherer Unit 3 as a part of Gulf Power rate case settlement, approved by the Florida PSC. This settlement resulted in Gulf Power's remaining $240 million investment in Plant Scherer being placed into retail rate base.","Additionally, the settlement provided for an increase in the equity ratio from 46% to 52.5% while preserving the 9.25% to 11.25% allowed ROE range. Overall, it was a very constructive result. Excluding these and adjusting for other items described in our earnings materials, Southern Company earned $652 million or $0.66 per share during the first quarter of 2017 compared to $536 million or $0.58 per share in the first quarter of 2016.","The major earnings drivers year-over-year for the first quarter of 2017 included results for Southern Company Gas and improved performance at Southern Power, offset by increased shares and interest expense.","Moving now to an economic and sales review for the first quarter. Collectively, the economies of Southern Company's regulated electric and gas markets continued to enjoy increased population and employment growth in the first quarter of 2017. While consumer spending is tepid, measures of consumer confidence are at record high.","Similarly, leading indicators of industrial activity are improving and suggest that the U.S. economy should continue to expand in the first half of 2017 with real GDP projected at 2.4% for the year.","The ISM Manufacturer's Index remains in a solid expansion mode at 54.8 in April. The increase in this index mirrors the jump in consumer confidence seen since the election last November and bodes well for improving industrial sales throughout the year.","Year-over-year, weather-normal retail electric sales in the first quarter of 2017 were down 1.1%. Customer growth remained strong in both our regulated electric and gas markets. We added 13,500 new electric customers on the residential side and 7,500 new residential gas customers in the first quarter of 2017.","This strong growth was offset by expected declines in use per customer in our electric, residential and commercial classes, driven by energy efficiency and increase in multifamily housing, e-commerce and the closing of brick-and-mortar retail store. Overall, we continue to believe our forecast of retail electric sales growth in 2017 of 0% to 0.5% is achievable.","Before turning the call back to Tom, I want to provide our earnings estimate for the second quarter and share a brief reminder on our financing plans for this year. First, we estimate that Southern Company will earn $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Second, our various equity plans continue to operate throughout the first four months of this year and our current plans are to continue issuing new shares consistent with the outlook we've provided at our Analyst Day. We remain steadfastly committed to the financial integrity of Southern Company and our major subsidiaries.","I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Art. Following an eventful 2016, Southern Company has entered 2017 with strong momentum. Our franchise businesses performed at a high level, solidifying our position as an industry leader as our customer-focused business model continues to serve us well.","Finally, I'd like to highlight that our Board of Directors recently approved an $0.08 increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.32 per share. This is our 16th consecutive annual increase and for 69 years, dating back to 1948, Southern Company's paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. But more importantly, the Board's decision to increase the rate of growth of the dividend speaks to the resilience of our long-term plan, which is underpinned by a firm foundation of premier state-regulated electric and gas utilities. Moreover, it supports our objective of providing superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long term.","In conclusion, we believe Southern Company is well positioned for continued success in 2017 and for years to come. Now, 32,000 employees strong, we remain committed to providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to the customers and the communities we are privileged to serve.","We're now ready to take your questions. Operator, we'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Good afternoon. So if I'm thinking about the timeline here, you have the next month or two, to make a what you consider a fully informed decision, get all the stakeholders involved. And at that juncture, you'll then proceed with the dialogue with the Georgia PSC, is that right?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No. You should view our relationship with the staff. You know, they have independent monitors. They're commissioned. It's kind of real-time, so it's continuous, not discrete. The notion of the 1.5 months or 2 months or whatever it is, is really this idea of getting consensus among us, our co-owners, our Board and the Commission staff as to how to proceed.","Based on what our assessment is at that point, we will work constructively as we have, gosh, since, I don't know, 1992 or so, to develop a constructive approach. The reason why we're kind of vague as to what that approach is, it may change based on what our recommendation to the Commission is. So until we kind of get a better feeling within this next month or two, we really won't have very much to say about what the continuing process of the Commission will be and what timeframe it will occur over.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Understood. I'm just trying to get a sense of the milestones, Tom. And so at some point, there'll be a path that you've decided to...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Recommend.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","...go down which you're going to file with the Commission or a menu of paths.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's it.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","That you want to potentially go down, with you filing with the Commission in a formal proceeding, correct or incorrect?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No, that's right and I was just picking on a couple of words, you said a decision before. This is going to be a collaborative dialogue, I think, between the co-owners, us and the Commission about how to proceed.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, and then \u2013 but you will continue, and I may be presuming incorrectly. It sounds like you will continue to build the plants, continue to keep construction moving forward until you get to an end of that process.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's exactly right.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Because you may continue to build all the units. You may continue to build one unit. You may continue to build no units, but until you know the path you're taking, you'll continue to construct as on the front schedule?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Because that preserves the option.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's exactly right.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Well, my last question, because I'm sure you've got a ton. You have the $920 million letters of credit that were posted. Have you requested from the banks to pull down on those letters of credit and at this juncture, have you actually received any cash as a result of those requests to draw down on the letters of credit?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Greg, there is a process under which you propose to draw under those letters, and we're following that process to the letter. So as of today, we've not drawn on those LCs, but we're following the process.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","But you've requested to draw, but you've not yet received. Is that what you're saying?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","There's a period in which you provide a notice to draw.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So, you've provided that notice?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks, Tom. Sorry to be a stickler. Take care.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, no problem.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. On the Vogtle subject, I noticed in the 10-Q, there's a number of aggregate liability under the Interim Assessment Agreement of $470 million, of which your share is $215 million. Is that a current, like through right today number, or is it \u2013 because it also says that $245 million was paid or accrued at the end of March. Just trying to get a sense of the pace at which that number's increasing during this period.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So that would be an assessment as to the first 30-day period plus any liens that have been placed on the property in order to clear the liens, so we can continue to progress the work. It really represents kind of how much we've spent.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But it seems to imply couple of hundred million a month is sort of the spending rate. Is that about right?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It's a decent guess, yeah.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just on the other, I mean obviously you made the disclosure as well this morning that your current assessment is that the cost to finish the plant would exceed the value of the parent guarantee. Can you give us any more sort of indication of by how much or is that a close-to-call currently or how do we think about that in the...?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, but I wouldn't view that as a conclusion at this point. Let us do our work and we'll figure out kind of what we believe the hours remaining to complete, the costs remaining to complete. And certainly along the way, we will evaluate the $3.7 billion in round numbers guarantee and what remains, and whether that all looks like a good deal for our co-owners and certainly for our customers and we'll be \u2013 I can assure you in ongoing dialogue with the Commission about that. So let us continue to progress over the next 30 to 60 days and we'll figure it out. And certainly, we'll absolutely use the LCs to offset damages we've incurred and will incur going forward.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But you're not \u2013 it is that you have disclosed though that you already think it's more than the guarantee, right?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It might be, that's a possibility and we'll just assess it when we get to the end. We're not in a position to say what that amount is.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I get it. And then can I just quickly on Kemper, if the plant hasn't entered service by the June date for filing, do you still file?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Jon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Anthony.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","How are you doing, Tom?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Super. How are you?","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Another day in sell-side paradise. In the Q, it stated that I guess the owners of Vogtle do not believe the revised in-service dates are achievable. If, I guess, we think of a best case option through this interim period, what do you think your new in-service dates are?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We really haven't reached that conclusion, that's the whole point. So if you recall the process from back, I guess, earlier this year, it was that we were going to review all the documentation and all the schedule and all the cost information associated with that schedule. And then along the way, before we complete that, Westinghouse files bankruptcy.","Now as part of our agreement in working through the bankruptcy, Westinghouse has completely opened their books to our valuation of time and costs remaining to complete, that's what we're in right now. So it's almost as if we're in one track and now we're in another track of evaluation because now, we can't rely on them. We have to look at an option other than Westinghouse finishing here.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","What \u2013 if we think about it, is the option of a fixed-price contract, the next stage of Vogtle even likely? Or should we all be thinking that the type of contract to finish this project is going to be more of a, like a cost-plus type contract?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It could take a variety of different forms. Certainly, we could find a third party to kind of give you a fixed-price. That would be most likely a Fluor, Bechtel kind of thing. We could certainly take over the project ourselves and act as general contractor.","And all this really has to do with what we think is the best way to most economically complete the plant and in concert with our regulator, an equitable kind of division of risk and return as to how we intend to proceed. So all of that is part of an ongoing discussion.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","And just lastly, do you get that feeling at all that Westinghouse, even through this bankruptcy, would like to continue on the project, or there's no sense in that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I think, they pretty well signaled the reason they went into bankruptcy was to insulate themselves and so we'll see. As we said I think in the comments, in the script that we believe their intent is to reject the contract. They'll do that once we conclude these interim agreements.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. And hey, Anthony, let me just be very clear what we're referring to, you and I were both referring to there, were their obligations as a general contractor in the construction. They still have the obligations to play ball on things like intellectual property and whatever else they're going to do to finish the plant.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Bud.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Wanted to discuss the Department of Energy and approaches that the DOE could take in support of Vogtle. What sort of the range of possible options and the range of types of support that we could potentially see?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. And let me just be \u2013 I'm going to be a wee bit coy here, because there's lots of conversation going on. Let me first say that the most obvious thing the United States government can do is to lend support to extend the in-service or the timeframe on the production tax credits.","My assessment is, they are absolutely willing to do that. This is an issue that is bigger, I think, at the United States government level, certainly bigger than Vogtle and Summer. This is a national security issue and it follows on the heels of what, by all accounts, is a very successful visit with Abe and Trump, and recall that as a result of those successful meetings, I guess the Prime Minister and the President instructed Deputy Prime Minister As\u014d, along with Vice President Pence to set up essentially a commission, an effort to evaluate lengthening and strengthening the kind of infrastructure investment opportunities that we could collaborate on between our two great nations. There were three segments of activity. One of those segments was energy infrastructure and then some weeks following that, we have a bankruptcy in Westinghouse.","And so I think this is something that has taken the attention of our elected officials. I would assess the support of the Trump administration and the relevant Cabinet officers as A-plus. They had given us all kinds of support and we have constructive dialogues underway with them ongoing. Likewise, in Congress. I think we have tremendous support because I said before, this is bigger than Vogtle and Summer. This is a national security issue. If the United States wants nuclear in its portfolio for the future, we've got to figure out a way to be successful here. I'd rather kind of leave it there, if you don't mind, Stephen, rather than go through and explore specific options.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very much appreciate that given where we are. We'll wait for the....","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Thanks.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","...study outcome and recommendations.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you, sir.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","If I could shift gears over to just philosophically, thinking about how you think about the risk of further cost overruns and the regulatory treatment for that, assuming again that you decide to continue to move forward, are there certain sort of philosophical guideposts that you would want to secure in terms of how you think about addressing and sort of allocating for that (27:21) further overruns?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, right now, I mean, we have an agreement that was entered into in 2016 that essentially doesn't have a cost cap. So theoretically, one approach is that we could live with the prudent stipulation; that addresses return levels during construction. And then following construction, presumably, the amounts of capital will revert back to GPC base rates.","And even when you think about Georgia law, it really has been very consistent over the years and this is now decades for the recovery of all reasonably and prudently incurred costs for a certified IRP resource, regardless of the original certified cost and let me also remind you of the math, when this thing was originally certified, the amount of price increase we thought we would have would be about 12%. Now we estimate it will be in the 6s to 8%.","So we feel that we have at least the structure to begin a dialogue. Certainly as we have to make a recommendation. Once Westinghouse decides to reject the contract, which they'd given us every intent of doing so, then we, Georgia Power and the co-owners have to make a recommendation as to whether to proceed or to recommend not completing the plant. We have structures available for both of those.","Certainly, it's a different risk posture and that will be part of the conversation with the Commission. And certainly, all of this, as we have in the past and we've demonstrated it over with Mississippi and others, Southern Company has always been committed to supporting the ratings of our subsidiaries and I think we've shown our hand and that we are faithful in that resolution.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Tom. Thank you for taking my questions.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Turning to Mississippi. If I read the detail in your SEC filings correctly, you've got $25 million per month or so of costs, including the depreciation that are not in rates once the plant goes online and that doesn't necessarily include a return on capital of the plant, the PP&E that's not in rate base or that's not in customer rate.","So $25 million, 12 months, that's $300 million a year, plus the return on capital of, pick a number, but it's not a small one. On a utility this size, that's a pretty big rate increase. Are you having conversations in Mississippi with the legislature, the governor or others about potentially expanding the use of things like securitization, which I think you need a legal change to do to be able to mitigate some of that rate impact?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, look. I think we've said this in the past, but remember what we said in the script here is that we're going to file traditional rate case and then we had, as provided by law, a rate mitigation plan, the notion of the rate mitigation plan is to essentially put in place revenue requirements that are similar to the revenue requirements associated with the original order.","So if we provide the plant and the plant is operational consistent with the original owner, and we have revenue requirements that are similar to the original owner, that's kind of a way to approach. Of course, there are a host of other opportunities that we can engage in beyond those two things, and that's really what we were pointing to when we started talking in the script about the settlement conversation as an acceptable outcome. So rest assured that we're working constructively, being very mindful of the total rate impact in Mississippi's customers and the way, the best way to structure a regulatory outcome that meets everybody's needs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Are other folks within the state outside it, meaning are other legislative or folks in the governor's office involved in this process? And do you need legislation to implement some of the things that might come across the table in these talks?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","In terms of need, probably not, but we don't want to, again, get ahead of the process that we're going to be following through here as we approach any court settlement or as we approach the filing.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. One or two for Art, and these are just kind of housekeeping types. Southern Power recognized a pretty big benefit \u2013 tax benefit in the quarter, a little over $50 million, just curious what is in your guidance for the tax benefit at Southern Power this full year?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Are you referring to production tax credits and investment tax credits or?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm looking at the whole kit, kat and caboodle. I'm looking at Southern Power's income statement in your Q.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","In the Q. Okay.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Sir.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Let me address that first. There was a couple of timing things that went on in the first quarter. One of them related to the manner in which we recognize PTCs. When we gave our estimate for the quarter, it was $0.57. We assume that we would recognize production tax credits under a earnings before tax perspective for Southern Power. We actually changed that methodology during the quarter and went to an as-production basis.","So we recognized more income at Southern Power related to production tax credits in the first quarter, but we merely accelerated them out of the second and third quarter and you'll see that flip back around during the year. So we don't expect that to occur throughout the year and it won't have an impact on income. For the entire year, it's all based into our guidance.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, so your guidance, I'm just trying to think about how much renewable tax-related items is embedded within your full-year guidance.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Okay, so $53 million of one-time of those PTCs, ITCs and $178 million of ongoing PTCs.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And I think it's interesting to point out that when you look at the one-time events as compared to 2016 and 2017, something like, 50%, what was it, 51%, something like that were one-time events and 2016 and 2017, it's down to about what, 17% or something?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes, I think quarter, for the year, between PTCs and ITCs, we'll end up with $16 million less in total year-over-year.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, and last question...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","What you're losing on ITCs, you're picking up on PTCs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right. It seems pretty flattish year-over-year. And one last one, also a housekeeping one. At Southern Gas, if I \u2013 and I know you didn't own it in the first quarter of last year. But if I were to back out the mark-to-market in both periods, how significant of a change was net income at Southern Gas and what were the biggest drivers?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes, hold on just a sec. It was pretty flattish. You look at four distinct segments, the Gas Distribution operations was pretty flat. Gas Marketing Services was down a little, maybe $9 million in net income. Midstream Operations were bigger, mostly due to Southern Natural Gas being added and the other, there was some other mishmash of some couple million, so $13 million year-over-year increase.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And that fell within what you expected even after you considered things like rate base growth and O&M synergies, those type of items?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Every thing's in, yes.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It was amazing. It hit it exactly on the nose for the Fluor, what we expected and that's after backing out a really big positive in Sequent, which we will regularly do. We will not include Sequent as our ongoing earnings.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Paul.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey, how are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Awesome.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","My first question is if you were to go the abandonment route, is it reasonable for us to assume that it seems like through March of 2017, the total Vogtle investment is $5.4 billion including financing? Is that sort of a reasonable starting point in terms of a number to assume?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And then I think the Georgia legislation provides for recovery of your investment plus a return. In a proceeding to determine what that return would be, would that be the Georgia Public Service Commission who would decide that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, and the law provides for all prudently incurred costs.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And I guess the other question that I have is, it looks as if the banks financing Westinghouse took a collateral interest in the intellectual property or the, I guess, it's the EPC plan. How does that affect your situation if you decide to continue with construction?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, man, so that's exactly this filing that we've made with the bankruptcy court. Potentially, the debt financing wanted to have essentially access to everything. However, the funds used in the debt financing only applied to the so-called GoodCo , which is kind of the nuclear fuel processing business, their services business, O&M, decommissioning and others and don't flow to the benefit of our project.","And so we don't believe they should have lien rights on the IP or anything to do with our project. And frankly the Creditors Committee agrees with our position. There will be a hearing on that on May 10, but I think we're on pretty firm ground there.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","And then it would be up to the bankruptcy judge to decide how to resolve that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right. It would be odd for the debt financing to only apply to some of Westinghouse and not others, and then to get the benefit of \u2013 and then to get the benefit of all of the security potential to the debt financing. So it seems like an awfully logical position here.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Hey, let me just make sure that we clarify something. I think it was Michael \u2013 it was Paul that raised the issue. In the scenario for abandonment, the only amount at risk for the abandonment charge is $4.1 billion, not $5.4 billion. The delta is the financing cost, and that's already under recovery. So just want to make sure everybody understands that. Math was right, $5.4 billion, but the amount at risk for recovery under the abandonment scenario was $4.1 billion. Okay?","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Welcome.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Go ahead.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So most of my questions have been answered, but just wanted to clarify on a couple of points, coming back to Vogtle. If you don't find \u2013 if Westinghouse steps out and you don't find anybody who's willing to accept a fixed price contract and so Southern steps in to complete the project. Is there any sense of what that \u2013 how much overrun, firstly, that could entail given Southern's going to do it? And secondly, what does that actually mean operationally? Are you hiring all the people? Like, what will that actually mean practically to kind of complete that project by Southern itself?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Sure, okay. So let's kind of take it step-by-step. There's already been a tremendous amount of work that's been complete on the site. And then what you have to do is evaluate what is left, okay? So that would be time to complete, cost to complete. It is our intention that absent any kind of smaller changes in management, that the people that we need are already present on-site. We've been able to do that with these interim agreements to keep people working, and that's really important.","So we evaluate what's been spent, we evaluate what needs to be spent. Recall, we have the Toshiba Guarantee, so that would be round numbers again, $3.7 billion, that would offset those future payments. So then, we would evaluate if there was \u2013 if that was sufficient or if there was anything in excess even of the $3.7 billion in addition to the normal budgeted costs and we'll evaluate that in terms of schedule and potential costs within the construct of whatever our co-owners need and what we need via our regulatory regime at Georgia.","Recall also that I think we've got a great deal of flexibility in how we think about this. You must realize that Southern is pretty well unique in being able to fulfill these kinds of obligations. We have been involved uniquely in the supply chain efforts throughout the project. We have been involved uniquely in terms of the scope of presence on our site. I think we have roughly 400 people that have been engaged in oversight work even with Westinghouse and with Fluor. And now, we have provided for, as we started to see Westinghouse get under duress, a transition plan even before Westinghouse has filed bankruptcy. So we have a transition plan in place. The people are turned on. They're on-site. We won't have to go grab bodies if in fact, that's the course that we decide to take.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","I think it's important to add that we've got stepping rights to all the subcontracts, so we choose to do so, we can step in and contract with Fluor and any other subcontractor that has a primary contract with Westinghouse at this time.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's very helpful color. And just quickly on the $3.7 billion parent guarantee, that \u2013 there is no risk to it at this point as I understand. The only risk being if Toshiba files for bankruptcy, then you become just unsecured creditor, but apart from that, there isn't any other risk, is that correct?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, I mean, we're trying to be very rigorous in our approach here for all these things. When we think about the guarantee, we don't want to get into a position where there's an argument about the amount We don't want to get into a position whether that amount is available, whether we finish or don't finish the plant if Westinghouse rejects it and then we're in that position. We don't want to get into a position of arguing how the draws under the guarantee might be available and we want to have some assurance as to the security of those draws. So we're working through a lot of issues there.","Likewise, with Westinghouse, I never want to get into a position, look at them; they're in bankruptcy of relying on Westinghouse's efforts. I want to have clear, commercial agreements set forth for the IP that currently is under development and you know all the IP is not finished. There's some related to instrumentation and control that is currently under development. That's not a surprise to anybody, but we want to make sure that there is a commercial obligation for Westinghouse to finish that IP, to make available the skills and resources necessary to carry it forward.","Also, you should note too that there will always kind of be, along the way, some opportunity to change the intellectual property as design changes are manifested on the site. Further, you should know that this notion of transition is a critically important issue. It sounds like a detail, but getting all the clearances, getting the transfer of contract, the transfer of personnel, et cetera. We want to be very clear about all that, so we're taking a very rigorous approach to all these issues.","So these two big issues, the certainty around the structure of the guarantee and certainty as to the commercial relationship we have with Westinghouse, I think, are really important in order for us to even consider moving ahead should Westinghouse ultimately reject the contract.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's really helpful color, so you do expect to continue to update as you have further color on these discussions, I'm assuming.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Oh, absolutely. If there's material information, we'll put it out in an 8-K.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Ashar.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Hi, Tom. How are you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Fantastic. I hope, you're well.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","I just \u2013 what I can't understand is you guys, as you are spending on these projects, as we're going through this analysis, right, and you mentioned, you're spending at a run rate of about $200 million or so a month. So I guess by the time the decision takes place, it might be eight to nine months into the year, and that would imply another, I don't know, whether the $200 million was for the whole and your share is $100 million, but could be another $1 billion spent on the project by the time you make the decision.","Doesn't that make it \u2013 the real decision is going forward and how to recover the cost, how can you \u2013 I just don't get the chance of abandonment. If there was any chance of abandonment or anything like that, you should have slowed down and not let spend more on the project, because in the end, the customer has to pay for it and it would be really bad for the customer to be given a bill of another $1 billion that you make the decision.","So am I missing something? To me, the chances of abandonment are really low. If they were a little bit higher, then you should have slowed down the process and kind of like thought of it and that would kind of indicate the options are more there, or am I thinking through this wrongly?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. No, no, Ashar, you're raising a good point. Let's just kind of walk through it a bit though. As this next 30 to 60 days, we're working with our co-owners and, of course, with our board, and in conjunction with the staff, the independent monitors and the Commission. I think we'll reach a point where we're in a position to start making a recommendation and also as we finish the resolution of these commercial contracts I just talked about.","I think then we'll kind of be in a position to say, yeah, I think it looks likely that we're going to recommend going forward. Otherwise, if it looks likely, the best thing for customers is to not complete these plants. I think at that point, you may take a totally different posture on-site.","So long as it is viable for us to complete the plant, it is absolutely, I think, important for us to not only maintain, but improve productivity on the site so that the ultimate long-term cost is as attractive as it can be. Were we to start sending people home, the chances of us getting those people back on site would be awfully difficult.","The other thing \u2013 hey, the other thing is recall some of these first amounts that we've been talking about were amounts that were already owed, okay, so this is really just fulfilling the contract as it exists. And yeah, I think we said this before, but if we didn't, let me just be very clear that $200 million or so a month, it could be a wee bit less than that, but that's a decent conservative number, is 100%. So Georgia's share of that would be $45.7 million (49:59).","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay. That's what I thought. Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Tom. Good afternoon, Tom. It's been a long day. The $3.7 billion, is that inclusive of the $920 million?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And the $3.7 billion is for 100% of the project, both units?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Right.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then just switching gears, a big driver in the quarter was O&M. How much of that is sustainable?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Paul, some of that is certainly timing that will be spent later in the year. There were some outages pushed out of the quarter into the second, so you're going to see some of that, but a lot of that is going to be sustained as we move through the year. As you know, the third quarter of each year is our big quarter and will determine how much O&M is spent between then and end of the year. So we still believe that we can hit our targets in light of the under-run on O&M in the first quarter.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","The other thing though that we're doing, Art and I have been kind of pushing it at the Southern Company Management Council level is to approve the growth profile of the operating companies. And one of the things that we're looking at is are there some things that we can do that can maybe do capital investment, technology investment, a variety of other things that will actually improve the reliability, customer service and price of our product, associated with those investments, may be, some permanent reductions in O&M.","So we're pushing very hard to make the grid more resilient, to really understand and right-size the amount of investment in our fossil\/hydro fleet to automate what otherwise are some administrative processes. I think we have the opportunity to improve the organic growth profile of our operating companies and reduce O&M at the same time.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And is the permanent piece of the O&M, does that push you to one end of guidance, the top end there, or is it just one of the gives and takes that we're seeing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No. You know, Paul, we don't even mess with that until the end of the third quarter. We just keep our guidance where it is. What I'm really doing with that initiative though is not worrying about the tactics of where we are within a range in a year, but rather make even more resilient the 5% long-term growth rate that we referred you to.","I said before in October, I thought October 16, I know it was hard to knock us off the balance beam. We've been talking hard about resilience and how well-founded, I think, our long-term plan is. And remember I said back then, if you want to really see proof of where our board sees that and where we see it for heaven's sake, is let's watch and see what the board does on the dividend. And sure enough, they increased their growth rate and the dividend as we thought they may this April. I think that was a big vote of confidence in our long-term ability to hit the growth rate.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Understood. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you, guys. So just could you quantify how much the change in accounting for PTCs benefited the quarter versus what you had in your guidance for the quarter?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","About $0.05.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Art. That was it.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Hey, Tom. Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Just a couple technical questions on Vogtle. If it's going to take a month or two, you think, to decide why was the interim assessment only moved to May 12 and not further and why shorter than, let's say, what SCANA did?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I think it's very clear. We're working very hard on these agreements related to the Toshiba Guarantee and related to the ability for us to effectively transition the plant away from Westinghouse, should Westinghouse reject the contract, it is, I think, clear to us that once we reach that point, making the transition at the management on the site is really important as to the effectiveness.","So keeping a short leash on the relationship with Toshiba and Westinghouse, and ultimately, should Westinghouse reject the contract, having us take over the site, if that's what we choose to do, in a shorter timeframe is good for the project. Keeping Westinghouse in this kind of limbo role under bankruptcy is not good for the project for any period of time. We want to keep that as short as we can.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That makes sense. Second question is just I know you're kind of keeping the Commission staff apprised. I guess when we ultimately get your decision in a couple, a month or two, whatever it is, how should we think about how much they are onboard with it already or not?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I mean, Steve, you know us. I mean, we've been working with collaboratively with the Commission. I guess we had the original Vogtle decision back in 1992 with the last one there and then in 1995, we reached the agreement on these three-year accounting orders and every three years, we've put in place a series of interesting accounting orders.","It seems like every 30 years, we had a unique set of challenges in which to handle. We just have this track record of constructive regulation here in the south. And Georgia has been a tremendous kind of example of how an integrated, regulated system meets the needs of customers. We have the best reliability, prices significantly below national averages, the best customer service. It works.","And so our evaluation is we'll be able to work constructively with the Commission to handle these very challenging issues. And I think that with our no-surprises way of working with the Commission, I think when we reach the point of beginning a filing process, I would assume we have a decent degree of consensus around that approach. I would be surprised if we reached that and there were a lot of surprises on either side.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then last question, just on the nuclear PTC, unless something happens quickly in Congress, we're probably not going to have an extension to that prior to you making the decision. Should we just assume that your confidence level is high enough in that that you're going to assume in your analysis that that is going to get extended if needed for delayed dates?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, that's an important variable in all of this and I can tell you that the conversations we've had and it's just going to be broadly across government, whether it's Congress or the administration, have been very constructive and supportive. They understand that this is kind of bigger than Vogtle. This is a national security issue and that frankly, the cost of extending this timeframe is almost nothing as they scored in Congress.","So we've experienced a tremendous amount of support. We could come up with a variety of ways to evidence that support, but I'm just going to assure you that as we reach the end of our deliberations and make a recommendation, this will be central to that recommendation. And if we decide to go forward, it would be because we believe, and we may have evidence at that time of our belief that we'll be able to manage it. There may be ways we can demonstrate their support even without the law or the tax reform building path is my point. Hello, Steve? Operator?","Operator","His line is still open, sir.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Okay. Steve, you still there? I don't know what happened. Operator, you want to go to the next question? Steve, I hope that answered your question. Certainly if it doesn't, call us back. Sorry you got cut off. Operator, you want to go to the next question?","Operator","Yes, Sir. Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Ali. How are you?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good, thanks, Tom. Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","First question, Art, I may have missed this, but if I were to bridge the gap in the first quarter between your $0.57 original guidance and the $0.66 you reported, was that all coming from that change in accounting for the tax or what's causing that $0.09 delta?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","No, I think what you're seeing is a lot of it was from the PTC recognition of Southern Power. The vast majority of that, $0.05, the other $0.04 really came by better O&M management across the fronts of all operating companies to do a little better than what we had buried into our $0.57 estimate.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see, got it. And then, Tom, on Kemper, do you see at all any scenario in which the plant ultimately just ends up being a CCGT?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So I mean, the way you asked that question, sure, I mean there's that possibility, but that's going to be taking into account the deliberations in the state of Mississippi. Recall the nine cell (1:00:58) kind of red, green diagram they use in order to assess the viability of the plant, still under high gas scenarios, we still get green cells in there. And certainly, it remains a hedge. And along the way, as we have built into the technology the ability to operate under dual fuels, we've been able to demonstrate the ability to deliver whatever energy is the cheapest. So there is a possibility you could do that, we'll just have to see.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. Would that be part of sort of the rate case and prudency review or will that be outside of that scope?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, it's all part of the conversation. So the conversation is kind of underway and we don't want to ever get in front of that conversation. So Ali, whenever you ask a question, is it possible, there's a lot of stuff that's possible. Let the process run and we'll give you illumination when we get it.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, and then a different topic. As you pointed out, electric sales, weather-normalized, were negative 1% this quarter. In fact, if I'm right; I think that's the fourth consecutive quarter we've seen negative weather-normalized sales. I'm just wondering how you square that with the economic growth profile that you're seeing out there and how should we think about that going forward.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes. Ali, we got a couple things going on in both commercial and industrial classes. We began to see a reduction in use per customer in the commercial class in the second quarter of last year, if you go back and look at our history. And so when you're looking at the first quarter year-over-year, that trend continues in 2017, but it wasn't in 2016. So you still have the effect of that showing up.","And in the industrial market, it was kind of the same thing. We had some industrial customers who had announced that they were shuddering portions of their process or operating processes, mid-year, last year, that were in process for the first quarter of last year. So year-over-year, you're going to see some effects of that as well. More importantly, I think if you look at our sales compared on a weather-normal basis compared to what we estimated they would be, we were only down 4.3%.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, and let me throw in the other stuff, you probably heard this. But leap year, February of 2016 as compared to February 2017, that matters in the numbers. The other thing, and our numbers have been very consistent with what I'm seeing in my work at the Fed, and I said this on Squawk Box this morning, but January was kind of a bad month. February was an awful month year-over-year in comparison.","But then, holy smokes, March, especially the end of March, turned around and I would do not only a year-over-year comparison, but a momentum comparison. The momentum comparison for March as compared to the quarter showed that of the 10 largest industrial sectors, in March, nine of them were positive and one of them was reasonably flat. So it's fascinating to me that we saw a big turn.","The Fed saw that also for the nation. So very, very fascinating stuff. We're a little bit stronger than the rest of the nation in terms of our economic growth, job creation, 1.9% versus 1.5%. Listen, I think there is reason for us to hang with our annual projection of between 0% and 0.5% growth this year. Let's see what happens on the sustainability of that March performance.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And last question. Tom, if I recall, in your legacy regulated business, when we looked at the long-term growth, the expectation was that at the back half of the decade, environmental CapEx would likely pick up and drive rate base and earnings. That probably won't materialize currently in this scenario. What takes the place of that? What can you use to offset that growth in the future?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Sure, man, absolutely. In fact, boy, I remember showing this to my board almost day one I got on, and everything else. But we went through a period there where we were kind of at the end of David Radcliffe's timeframe. For a while there, I was CFO and then Paul Bowers took over I went over to COO where we were talking about really healthy EPS growth rates. That's where we were spending capital like crazy as compared to a rather modest net committed capital base. And so our earnings per share growth rate was going off the charts. And then as we started winding down on a lot of environmental construction, as I took over, and then as we saw the riskiness of Kemper and Vogtle at one time, our long-term growth rate got real flat. And I started saying that to you all and started saying that well, it may flatten out through the last half of the decade, but as you remember correctly, it should turn back up with environmental CapEx and then with new capital associated with new generation coming back in.","What we were able to do in 2016 was execute on a growth strategy. You may remember too, I had been talking for some time about the wisdom of natural gas infrastructure and getting ahead of natural gas being a primary source of fuel for the future, a bridge, if you will, between now and 2050. And we recognized early on in our strategy deliberations here under my tenure that I get gas, but boy, you know what, the gas resource isn't where the load is. And so there needs to be a new rethinking of natural gas infrastructure. And that's where we started pursuing ideas that ultimately became realized with Southern Company Gas. That is AGL Resources and the Kinder Morgan, 50% of the Southern Natural Gas pipeline. And now, we're adding to that a little bit.","So the last thing is just a tiny little thing, but PowerSecure is really an option for the future. It doesn't add meaningfully to earnings in the near term. But Ali, if you think about it, we have added to our growth rate, as I suggested, we drop down to, I forget where we were, 3% to 4%. And then when we went to AGL, it became 4% to 5%. And then when we added on the rest of Sonat plus everything else plus Southern Power, man, we jumped all the way up to 5%. And what we've been able to demonstrate, I think, is the resilience of that 5%.","In other words, we stress-tested that against a variety of scenarios and really put it through some tail risk and we believe our 5% long-term growth rate is, in fact, resilient against a variety of outcomes. So we're very happy with that. And I think frankly, we've accomplished through those series of transactions and through the strategy we play, and now for the future, what I'm suggesting is there may be a way to rethink the growth rate of the organic business in the electric companies that frankly has been a wee bit lackluster to improve that and really improve service to our customers at the same time. All of those things lead me to believe that we don't need new generation in the future until, say, the low 20s. We think we have a reasonable estimate as to environmental expenditures. I think we're in terrific shape to achieve the 5%. We've done that work last year and the work we're doing continuing.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, Tom. How are you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Awesome.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks for taking the call.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, thank you.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, in the event of abandonment for Vogtle, what's the possibility that prudence prior to 2016, through VCM number 16? What's the possibility that they could be revisited in light of the fact that the project would not be online, used and useful and as anticipated?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, the notion of prudence presumes we build the plant. And so I mean, it's a fair question. We believe that the costs were prudent, but it's a fair question. But anyway, we believe they were prudently incurred. I think you go through the process thinking you're going to build a plant. Who could have predicted that Westinghouse would have had the difficulty it had? So I actually think we're in reasonably good shape. But I mean, it's a fair question. I think it's a tail risk kind of question, in my opinion.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Do you think prudence includes a full return on capital though?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. Prudence under the Georgia law, that basically puts it in a rate base.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I mean, even though the current deal for everything above $5.44 billion, you only get a debt return through construction. I mean, could we see something like that? Is it possible that they could go back and say that you only get a debt return on an unfinished plant?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","When you say is it possible? I guess anything's possible, but recall, even under abandonment, what you would do is take the Toshiba Guarantee against those amounts. So kind of use that in your thinking.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, that's true. Also, is there a possibility that you could be held, I guess, in any way responsible for not achieving the production tax credits, if the plant schedule goes beyond 2021 and there is no extension?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's conceivable also. I just \u2013 we're dealing with little hypothetics. I think it's going to happen though. I think even if you don't get tax reform this year, I feel reasonably confident given the importance of this issue, given the fact that it doesn't cost anything in the OMB scoring that I think we'll get support to figure out a way to get it done, that's just my belief.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And just to follow up on Steve's question about those credits. Is that, is the $800 million that you're expecting to get in value, is that included in the comparison analysis that's in the back of the VCM reports when you compared with CCGT?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","I believe that's true.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Part of that, right?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes, but you need to remember, it's $400 million per each, so it's Unit 3 and Unit 4 split.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So I mean \u2013 basically, everything is assuming those credits are coming in and that's \u2013 yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","The only thing I would just add is that remember that the certificate assumes we only got 50% of those credits and we think we're going to get 100% now.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right, right. Okay. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah man. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with Citadel (01:12:49). Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hey guys. How are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Ken (01:12:54). How are you?","Unknown Speaker","I am good. Thanks. Could you guys provide some color on the decision-making process amongst the co-owners at Vogtle? And in particular, have your co-owners designated Southern to act as their agent on the decision whether to go forward or not go forward? Or does each individual owner make their own discrete decision?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, we act as agent in the execution of the EPC contract and all that stuff, but there are also provision for everybody to make their independent assessment as to how to proceed and if those assessments are different, what happens. But in general, the way you should think about that is we all generally agree on how to proceed. We've got a great working relationship. We've got a great working relationship with the co-ops and the munis in the city of Dalton.","So I think I would just say that there are \u2013 we are the agent in executing the contract. We have ongoing conversations. And generally, I think almost exclusively, we reach consensus on how to approach these things. We have a really good relationship with those folks.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And the parental guarantee from Toshiba, does that stay with the project? Or does that travel pro rata with the co-owners, if they choose differently?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, probably we'll choose the same, okay? I mean, there are scenarios where they could be different, but no, it would be a pro rata guarantee.","Unknown Speaker","The individual owners would have the right to their percentage of the guarantee individual of all the other parties?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. But it would be \u2013 I mean, I'm trying to think of an example that would fit your hypothesis. For example, that we only finish one unit and we decide not to do another unit, and somebody steps out and the other people stay in. The $3.7 billion would be divvied up based on the final arrangement that we enter into in this commercial agreement. We think that the draw schedule would be reasonably fixed and that they would access that guarantee on that basis, on a pro rata basis.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Dan.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi. Good afternoon. My question kind of relates to when you talked about your Vogtle update, you mentioned that you have seen some meaningful improvements in productivity. I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on what you've been able to achieve and then of \u2013 related to that, how do you incorporate assumptions around productivity into your assessment, both of the scheduled length and costs because obviously those would be key inputs.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Oh, absolutely, man. In fact it's a great, it's a great question. What we've seen since the last call is a productivity improvement of around 20%, from 20% to about 30%. Use those as round numbers and we don't know whether they can be sustained or not. But productivity on the site since the last call has improved by that amount, okay? We want to get that number up to more like 40%.","So Dan, in the evaluation of time to complete, cost to complete, we absolutely vary scenarios based on what we think we can sustain, from a productivity level. It's a very good question you're asking. And so what we do is take different cuts, okay? If it's 40%, it's this. If it's 30%, it's this. That's exactly how we're looking at it.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. So can you give me a little more detail on what kind of improvements you're seeing \u2013 like has it just been the amount of time that's taken to do things or the number of people that's taken to do things or what are the kind of...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, the key in improving productivity on the site is to reduce dead time. In other words, transit time from check-in to workplace, to have more effective management on-site, so that they do their job site briefings and then get work done. It's really that kind of thing.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then just on the details of the project. I just wondered \u2013 I know last time you mentioned that the steam generator installs were a key path item in that \u2013 for Unit 3. And then you mentioned the last CA modules for Unit 4. Are those upcoming? And I noticed they're still kind of in the same location on the slide that you included, so I just wonder if you can give us some updates on the critical path.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Dan, this is Art. Those things are constantly in motion around what gets prioritized. The steam generators had been moved back a little bit, but that doesn't mean that they were on the critical path to begin with. And so the critical path itself is in the nuclear island, but just those have now been put on the horizon rather than in the near term, but doesn't mean that we're not staying on schedule and improving the productivity within the nuclear island itself.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","How about on Unit 4?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Unit 4 is maintaining. You still have some modules yet to be placed, CA02 and CA03, but those are smaller modules compared to, say, CA01, which is already in place.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then, in terms of equipment on-site, what's the status of that and...?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, I think we've got 90%-plus of the equipment on-site already.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I think all major equipment is on-site, what you're really lacking now are commodities.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. How about the shield panels? Are those onsite (1:19:21)?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. That's doing \u2013 we're very well on the shield panels. I think on Unit 3, we're at the \u2013 at level or course 5 or 6, and on Unit 4, I'm not sure that we've started the shield panels yet, but we have. It's going to be much lower. But that's all on schedule.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead, sir.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Julien. Welcome.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thank you very much, team. I appreciate it. So let's hopefully wrap this up perhaps with a little bit of a question on the resiliency, you guys have talked about in the past. I'd just be curious, what are the positive drivers that you're thinking about that you'd like to flag, to kind of offset any potential risks whatever they may be across either Kemper or Vogtle?","And then a second specific question on the Kemper side of things, obviously, the previous conversations had suggested that you would get this thing in time for a June rate case. What does it mean if you don't necessarily trigger that? Is that all that meaningful?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, so let's hit the resiliency thing first. I think when we started talking about the balance beam and resiliency and all that early on, I know there were some questions about the ability of Southern Power to hit its numbers. Southern Power, I believe, has already done about half its CapEx round numbers this year and Southern Power already has the ability, I think, to hit its number this year as per our plan, which I think we flagged $300 million to $330 million last October. $315 million is a working number and they're going to hit that number unless the wheels fall off somehow.","And then from 2018 to 2000 \u2013 what is it, 2021, we struck the agreement with RES and others and I think they've basically spoken for the CapEx that may show up there. So to the extent we do more than what we've already signaled, there's upside there. Further, I think there is a plan underway to improve the growth profile of the operating company further from October, there, I think, has the ability to improve the pace of pipeline replacement programs that are associated with safety elements and the \u2013 all the AGL Resources jurisdictions. We've expanded that and hopefully we've expanded the pace of investment there. So I think we have plenty of opportunity to do a little better.","The other thing that you should know, you've followed us for 100 years or so, is that we are reasonably conservative in our estimates. When we say we're going to do something good or bad, that's kind of what we believe. We don't just throw about billions of dollars of CapEx filler; we really kind of know what we're going to do and we do that in concert with long-term regulatory relationships. When we put out a starting point, we do it with the notion of a no-regrets strategy. That is, we've already stress-tested against downside scenarios.","So what you should know is that even within our 5% long-term growth rate, we have stress-tested against negative outcomes, and we're still confident in saying that we believe our 5% growth rate long-term is viable. So for all those reasons, we're sticking with it and I think the evidence of that is the board's decision to increase, even with Vogtle and Kemper, the rate of growth of our dividends per share.","Second issue, was what?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Kemper.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, certainly would have been helpful. Let's not kid ourselves, to have Kemper up and running before the filing of the rate case. But you know, the rate case will take some period of time and so our expectation is that we will resolve the issues between now and then and be able to demonstrate performance.","Recall though that the evaluation of performance in terms of reasonable period is 2018 and so that's kind of the first time we have to step up to some disclosed performance. And I think we've already disclosed that in 2018, our expected availability was around 30% to 35%. So that's a 2018 number, okay?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right. Excellent. So basically, bottom-line, you could file a rate case nonetheless or is this more about just shifting the rate case timing irrespective and...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No. We will file the rate case. The law in Mississippi basically says within a reasonable period of time before the asset is in service, we could certainly do that. So the asset's in service in Jan 1, 2018, I think this is easy. So June 3 is the deadline to get that done.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, all right, so yeah, you'll just prove it up at some point during the pendency of the rate case.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. Thank you all gentlemen.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, and actually our performance criteria really goes to the year of 2018. Okay.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Excellent. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Appreciate you being on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","How are you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Awesome.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So just \u2013 most of my questions have been answered, but there was a comment by one of the Georgia Commissioners that he was sort of looking into the idea of a Kemper type of cap for Vogtle. And I just was wondering if you could sort of address how we should think \u2013 I know you guys are very risk knowledgeable and what have you. How we should think about your ability \u2013 obviously, it's early, but how you think about that kind of an idea? That's number one. And then number two, I was wondering if you could just address this Reuters story that seemed to be pretty critical of Westinghouse management, and whether you think the issues that were addressed in that article have been resolved, is that old history? Or just how you view that rather \u2013 that article, which seems kind of negative if you follow me in terms of Westinghouse.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, let's hit the first one. I think I've kind of gone through this at length a little bit. The relationship between Georgia and its Commission in terms of putting into place effective regulation for the benefit of customers and reliability and price and service, has served us all so well for so long.","There is nothing out there to me that indicates that that constructive relationship \u2013 I mean, they're tough regulators, don't get us wrong, but that constructive relationship will remain in place. And certainly, any sort of regime we consider in the future will be central to our belief as to whether it is appropriate should Westinghouse reject the contract for us to proceed with construction or not.","All of that is integral into how we intend to proceed. So my best advice to you guys is to believe that we will continue to have a constructive relationship. And certainly, anything that seems to go away from that would also seem to inhibit us from going forward with a commitment to build.","With respect to the Westinghouse thing, that's really a question for Westinghouse. I'll just say this. Steve Kuczynski is one of the best nuclear people in America today. He's come \u2013 I hired him away from Exelon, Steve, I mean, Steve. Christopher Crane is just a great guy, the CEO of Exelon. I think he might be the best nuclear guy in America, but he, I mean, Steve Kuczynski learned under his leadership, and Steve's brought a lot of those concepts to us and improved dramatically, I think, the whole performance of our nuclear fleet.","I believe that even with the short period of time where we had been a lot more intrusive, we've seen some improvement. I think our ability is rather unique in this regard in order for us to take over as general contractor as apart from Westinghouse. Commenting on Westinghouse's own shortfalls is really not productive at this point.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, and I'm not asking you necessarily to comment or to pile on them or anything like that. But the reason why I asked the question is because you guys may end up taking over the project. And if you do, I guess it's kind of \u2013 I guess, the idea obviously would be, what are you sort of taking over? Do you follow me? I mean.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's \u2013 yeah. I'm sorry, bud. Go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","No, that's basically. I think you understand what I'm saying. I mean, in other words, my concern is what one's concern could be is that if you take this thing over and it's been \u2013 what exactly are you taking over? Do you follow what I'm saying?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Are we taking over a bag of bones?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, yeah. No, thanks for the question and then it's a very fair question. Look, we have had \u2013 and just kind of to mention this. We had about 400 people on active oversight here and you can imagine there has been a lot of give-and-take as to our evaluation of what was going on first between Westinghouse and Shaw and then Westinghouse and CBI and then Westinghouse by themselves.","And we have always had suggestions for improvement and we didn't want to interfere with the fixed price contract that we had because that would limit our ability to collect under that contract and take away the liability of Westinghouse. So from a commercial standpoint, we had to be reasonably careful about how intrusive we were.","But you should know that we have, I think, great transparency into what we think it will be required in order to finish from an hours and cost standpoint. We'll have a darn good idea of what we're taking over and I think a darn good idea as to our ability to execute successfully given the different levels of productivity we may see.","I don't think we're going to go into this blindly. Steve Kuczynski is leading the effort to evaluate those issues. And I think given his background, given his performance with us, I think we'll reach an effective recommendation for go, no-go, sometime after Westinghouse rejects and within the 30- to 60-day timeframe we've suggested.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Andrew Levi with Avon Capital. Please go ahead.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Hey, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Andrew, how are you?","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","I'm all right. 100 years for Julien, as for me and Paul and you too.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I guess it seems like 100 years.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Julien is just a puppy, smart puppy, very smart puppy. I guess, I just wanted to get back to a question that was answered \u2013 that was asked earlier...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","And I don't know if you can kind of answer it, but just kind of how we should think about this because you do have two other partners, it's Oglethorpe and MEAG and I've kind of discussed this with some people internally, your company. And I'll be honest with you, I try always to be honest, but I guess that's like kind of my next concern is that they're much smaller companies than you, especially MEAG and so their ability to kind of absorb these incremental costs may become an issue. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. And then since I guess I wasn't always realizing that you are working as the agent and I don't know if that's kind of written in the contract or the agreement, partners agreement.","But I guess at some point, can they come after you in a legal aspect? Kind of what happened I think happened years ago with Vogtle 1 and Vogtle 2, not with these entities, but just kind of your thoughts on that and how you're protected in the agreement from that actually occurring beyond you guys having a good relationship.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. So Andy thanks, bud, don't forget about Dalton, they're in there, I forget what it is, 1.5% or something like that. So the city of Dalton is part of this also. Look, we have a terrific relationship with these guys. We have had \u2013 remember, they're part of Vogtle 1 and Vogtle 2. And so we've just had an ongoing relationship. It works exceedingly well, that's not to say we don't have discussions from time to time about issues, but we always seem to be able to work our way through them. I think their ownership shares are commensurate with their size.","And so yeah, they are a different size, but I think they have the wherewithal to be able to follow through on their obligations. They are certainly different. They're not regulated by a public utilities commission like we have, but they have their own ability to manage rates and make sure that they are viable. So I mean here again, it's certainly a fair question. But I think you should assume, as a working assumption that they're going to be fine and that we'll work constructively with each other.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","And then just the legal aspect of it too?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You know what...","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's kind of a technical issue. Here's the thing. If you want a briefing on kind of the legal aspects of lawsuits among or between the co-owners, let's do that offline and I'll get a lawyer on the phone and he'll...","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Okay. That's fair. Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, the only thing I just want to say, I probably should have said this earlier when I was talking about the resiliency of our long-term growth rate of 5%. I think what we've been able to do is demonstrate that we can operate that long-term growth rate at 5% within a similar risk profile.","Recall that 95% of our earnings are associated with super-high quality, state-regulated integrated businesses. And even of the 5%, you have things in there or they're under long-term contract, and even with the 5%, gosh, some of that is exceedingly consistent, for example, the Georgia Natural Gas Marketing business. That just doesn't vary from year over year over year, and they don't have much weather risk because they hedge most of it.","So the beta associated with our ability to deliver on the 5% on an ongoing manner is really good within the similar risk profile that we've demonstrated for decades. And I'm very proud of that.","I know there's a lot of headline risk out there with Southern right now. If you peel the onion, what you see, especially with the ash that the board took with the (01:35:59) dividend, you find a super successful company, one of the icons in our industry and a company that has demonstrated year over year over year.","Look at a chart of our dividend, of being able to deliver on behalf of its shareholders. We intend to continue to do that and we look forward to talking about it in the future. Thank you for joining us today and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you sir.

After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Tucker","Thank you, Jos\u00e9. Welcome everyone to Southern Company's first quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we've released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during today's call can be viewed on our Investor Relations Web site at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Tom Fanning","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Many of you've heard me speak before about the full portfolio and its significance to Southern Company and to our industry as a whole, simply put, we are inventing the future of clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for the benefit of the customers and communities we serve. Our full portfolio strategy which includes new nuclear and innovative new technologies for 21st century coal, as well as natural gas, renewable and energy efficiency is a fundamental component of that mission.","I would like to take a few moments to highlight how this all of the above approach continues to be beneficial to customers and to discuss several projects helping to shape the full portfolio for the future. To begin with, our diverse generation fleet enables us to quickly adapt to constantly changing market conditions with the ability to utilize the most cost efficient generation resources at any particular point in time. When natural gas prices are low, for example we are able to take advantage by burning more natural gas and less coal. Such was the case in the first quarter of this year, gas energy climbed to 48% of our energy production. Our use of coal for the quarter was the lowest in several decades falling to 32% of our energy mix.","And as a hallmark of our integrated business model we passed those savings along to our customers. Natural gas of course will continue to be a dominant solution. Recently our gas consumption was about 1.5 Bcf per day. This year it could approach 1.9 Bcf per day and by 2020 the amount could be as much as 2.3 Bcf per day. But natural gas is not a panacea as we cannot assume that current prices will endure indefinitely.","We must therefore, continue to pursue the development of a truly diverse generation portfolio, one that provides the necessary optionality and flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. In addition to natural gas 21st century coal and new nuclear, we are rapidly building out our energy portfolio with renewables including solar and wind.","With that in mind, I would like to take a more detailed look at how we\u2019ve expanded our renewable resources in recent months. Four Southern Company subsidiaries recently marked major milestones in the strategic expansion of one of the nation's largest renewable energy portfolios through the announced development or acquisition of large scale solar projects. Gulf Power and Mississippi Power recently announced power purchase agreements with solar facilities totaling 173 megawatts that are currently being developed on military bases in their respective states. Georgia Power broke ground at Fort Benning, the first of four 30 megawatt retail rate based solar project in development with the U.S. Department of Defense. And there is more likely to come.","In February our Southern Power subsidiary announced the acquisition of two solar projects totaling 99 megawatts in Georgia, the 80 megawatt Decatur Parkway solar project and the 19 megawatt Decatur County solar project, and most recently Southern Power announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in the 32 megawatt Lost Hills-Blackwell Solar facility in California from First Solar.","Also in March Southern Power announced an agreement to acquire the 299 megawatt Kay Wind Facility currently under construction in Oklahoma. This acquisition is expected to close in late 2015 upon successful completion of the project. Kay Wind will be the largest renewable electric generation plant in the Southern Company system and the first wind facility we will own. Upon completion of these projects that Southern Company system expects own or purchase the output of more than 3,100 megawatts of renewable resources system wide including 44 solar facilities in seven states.","Let's now discuss our two large construction projects which are equally important to our full portfolio of generation resources. Our new nuclear project plant Vogtle units 3 and 4 and our 21st century coal facility in Kemper County, Mississippi featuring coal gasification technology developed by our researchers in partnership with KBR and the Department Of Energy. Both of these projects stem from state specific resource planning processes that value generation diversity including the hedge that these new resources represent again potential Carbon Dioxide regulations in the future.","First, an update on plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. The primary focus of the project continues to be on quality and safety. Georgia Power has maintained an exceptional safety record for a construction project of this size which currently has over 5,000 people on site. During the first quarter our outstanding safety culture manifested itself as we performed over 1 million safe work hours without a recordable injury. The quality oversight from our nuclear team continues to be invaluable. This is a complex project with numerous challenges. We are proud of how well our processes and controls are holding up to the inspections of both the NRC inspectors and Georgia Power\u2019s regulator.","More importantly our own rigorous oversight is being manifested in the quality of the facility. The new Vogtle units are being built to serve Georgia customers for 60 plus years and the oversight in place today should help ensure that these units will function at a high level for decades to come.","Construction activities are tracking closely with the revised schedule provided by the contractors in January. The greatest risk to the schedule for both units continues to be in the timely delivery of structural sub modules. I\u2019m pleased to report that the quality at the Lake Charles facility has improved and we no longer expect sub modules from that facility to require remediation on site before being released for assembly. We anticipate continued delivery of panels throughout the year from Lake Charles and we\u2019ve been informed that the scope of work may be expanding there.","Critical path remains closely aligned with delivery and installation of panels for the shield building. These panels are fabricated by Newport News Industrial and quality has been good. Acceleration of work at NNI along with improving the panel installation process represents one of our best opportunities to improve on the schedule provided by the contractors. Critical path runs somewhat parallel with activities inside the containment vessel. The CA01 module is one of the major next step inside this area of nuclear island.","The final concrete pours necessary to install CA01 were completed late last week. CA01 is now projected to be lifted into place early in the third quarter of this year. A number of you have visited the site in person and the progress is obvious. While the entire project is proceeding well, the Unit 3 Annex Building is an area of noteworthy progress. The Annex Building is necessary for the initial energization of the control systems for Unit 3 an important early step in the startup process. ","The concrete foundations and structural steel for this facility are well underway. And in late February the first of 34 wall sub modules for the Unit 4 CA20 module was [up ended] [ph] marking the start of the assembly process.","On the regulatory front $198 million in expenditures submitted in the 11th Vogtle construction monitoring report were unanimously approved on February 19th with a cumulative amount approved to date of $2.8 billion. Additionally the procedural and scheduling order for the 12th Vogtle construction monitoring report was approved on April 7th, consistent with the long standing Georgia Law the order reaffirmed that neither the project certified cost nor the VCM 8 stipulation in 2013 constitute a cost recovery cap.","Georgia Power will be allowed recovery of all reasonable and prudent start up costs up to and above the certified amount and we believe the semi-annual VCM process including the testimony of the independent monitor continues to build a record that has thoroughly documented Georgia Power\u2019s prudent management of the project. The order also establishes a schedule for filings and hearings on our request of the commission to verify and improve $169 million in expenditures for the second half of 2014.","Georgia Power expects to file direct testimony on Friday, hearings are scheduled to begin on June 2nd and we anticipate a decision in mid-August. A full schedule is included in our slide deck.","Now let\u2019s turn to an update on the Kemper County IGCC project. The Kemper project also boasts a terrific safety record. With now over 2,500 workers on site no safety incidents occurred during the first quarter. In early March we completed the first firing with natural gas of the facility\u2019s gasifier burners, a significant milestone. We continue to make tremendous progress on our other start up activities as we look ahead to the first synthesis gas production plan now for third quarter.","In the mean time the combined cycle at Kemper continues to perform exceptionally well with the first quarter equivalent force outage rate of less than 1%, and a capacity factor in line with the rest of our combined cycle fleet.","Turning to the legal and regulatory fronts the Mississippi Supreme Court's order which deemed that the 2013 Kemper settlement unenforceable and reversed the subsequent rate order has been met with vocal composition from state wide industry groups, business organizations, the state economic council and members of the public utility staff and commission as well as other public entities through amicus briefs filed with the Mississippi Supreme Court. Most of the briefs emphasize that the rate plan agreed to in 2013 was of great benefit to the customers of Mississippi power and then a traditional rate case could mean rate impacts approaching 40% for some customers. This compared to the 25% rate increase contemplated in the original settlement 18% of which is already in place.","While we wait the Court's decision on rehearing we will continue to work towards a reasonable comprehensive settlement with the public utility staff. However as a possible alternative to a settlement we are also preparing to file a rate case by mid May. With the completion of the project and site we want to ensure that the rate recovery is adequately addressed in a timely manner.","I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview.","Art Beattie","Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2015 reporting earnings of 508 million or 0.56 per share compared with earnings of 351 million or 0.39 per share in the first quarter of last year. First quarter results for 2015 include a $6 million after tax charge related to an increased construction estimate for Mississippi Power's Kemper integrated gasification combined cycle project. The first quarter results for 2014 included a $235 million after-tax charge for the Kemper IGCC project or $0.27 per share. Excluding these items, Southern Company earned $514 million or 0.56 per share during the first quarter of 2015 compared to $586 million or $0.66 per share in the first quarter of 2014.","Earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were in line with our expectations and were positively influenced by retail revenue effects at Southern Company\u2019s traditional operating companies, offset by milder winter weather than in 2014 and increased operating and maintenance expenses.","Moving now to an economic and sales review for the first quarter. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2015 was modest but our retail sales across all customer classes are encouraging. Total weather adjusted retail sales grew 1% in the first quarter lead by industrial sales which were up 2%. We have now enjoyed eight consecutive quarters of positive year-over-year industrial sales growth in our region.","Industrial sales growth remained broad based across eight of our largest 10 industrial segments. The strongest industrial segments include petroleum up 10%, stone, clay and glass up 6% due to improvements in the housing market. Transportation improved 5% as automotive manufacturers expanded output. Weather adjusted residential sales were slightly positive for the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to strong customer growth of nearly 16,000, a 55% increase over the approximate 10,000 new customers gained in the first quarter of 2014.","Weather adjusted commercial sales were up 0.7% for the quarter, office vacancy rates continue to show signs of improvement and more office retail projects are being announced. Currently more than 1.9 million square feet of office space is under construction in Metro Atlanta, in addition a number of new Atlanta projects are expected to begin construction soon, including the Mercedes Benz headquarters.","According to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics non-farm employment increased in all of the states of our retail service territory between February of 2014 and February of 2015. Nationally Georgia ranked number five among all states for job growth and Atlanta was ranked among the top five metro areas. Meanwhile our economic development pipeline remains robust with more than 300 potential projects representing 37,000 potential new jobs and over $34 billion in potential capital investment.","The climate for business and investment remains strong in our service region. Alabama and Georgia were recently ranked number one and number four respectively amongst states in which to do business by Site Selection magazine.","Turning briefly back to Southern Power as Tom mentioned in his opening remarks Southern Power continues to find new projects that meet its investment criteria. In our fourth quarter call in early February we outlined two categories for Southern Power\u2019s CapEx projections, base CapEx and placeholder CapEx for growth. Base CapEx includes projects we have identified as likely even though we may not have reached final terms or received all regulatory approvals. In February our base CapEx included among others the Kay Wind and Decatur projects Tom mentioned earlier. Since then Southern Power has identified a number of additional projects for 2015 and 2016.","As a result we are shifting dollars out of the placeholder category and into base CapEx for Southern Power. The result is that we have accounted for all of our original 2015 placeholders and have moved 100 million from the placeholder to base in 2016. With our 2015 success thus far and the long runway between now and the end of 2016 we are confident about our ability to find plan solid projects to account for our remaining 2016 placeholders.","Before turning the call back to Tom let me cover two final items. First our earnings estimate for the second quarter which is 0.69 per share. Secondly I'd like to highlight dividend announcements last week. Our Board of Directors approved a $0.7 increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.17 per share. This is our 14th consecutive annual increase and marks 270 consecutive quarters dating back to 1948 that Southern Company will have paid a dividend equal to or greater than the previous quarter to its shareholders.","Over the past decades our dividend has accounted for nearly 70% of our total shareholder return. It is the corner stone of our value proposition and the board's decision of last week reinforces its confidence in the strength of our long-term financial plan.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Tom Fanning","Thanks, Art. After a successful year in 2014, Southern Company has entered the New Year with strong momentum. We see a franchise business that is operating better than ever, solidifying its position as an industry-leader in all phases of the business. We see important progress on major capital projects and we continue excel with our customer focused business model. We also see a strengthening economy and a region poised to grow in the months and years ahead.","In short, we believe Southern Company is well-positioned to succeed in 2015 and in the years ahead, behind the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to the customers and communities we serve. Southern Company is keenly focused on remaining an industry leader for the long-term and forward thinking decisions with regard to our generating portfolio a key aspect of that effort. But the evolution of our business does not stop there, we recently announced the launch of a energy innovation center to be located in Atlanta's Technology Square, while we remain stead fast in our commitment to excel the fundamentals of making, moving and selling and consuming electricity. We also understand that the way in which customers use energy may change over time. The energy innovation centers is just one way in which we are working to anticipate the future and lead the way with the development of new energy innovation.","Going forward we will continue to build on our long history of inventing the future by relying on the thinking of our entire work force and with potential such as [Meth] and other major established and new entrants to the energy industry. Initial possibilities involve expanding the motion of energy infrastructure to assets beyond the meter un-manned aerial vehicles, hydrogen production from underutilized generating facilities and desalination plants.","As Art indicated earlier the strength of our underlying franchise as well as our continued focus on remaining an industry leader through innovation underpin the Board's decision last week to increase our dividend which supports our objective of providing superior risk adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long-term.","We are now ready to take your questions. Operator we will now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Greg Gordon","So what is the legal path in Mississippi today that either gets you back to a settled rate deal or puts you in a formal rate case filing? What are the different paths that get us back into a settled low rate hike or just into a rate filing in May?","Tom Fanning","Just as we described there is two paths, one is we\u2019ve been having as you all know prolong series of discussion with the staff, we continue to think they\u2019re constructive. I think the result of a settlement could in essence preserve and form the rate structure that we put in place in 2013. Failing to reach a settlement, we will file a rate increase in a conventional rate case. It is conceivable you could file the rate case and file the settlement at the same time. But those are the two paths.","Greg Gordon","But the Supreme Court\u2019s decision has essentially closed off the creative approach you used to prefunding the capital prospects or is that not the case?","Tom Fanning","No, that\u2019s not the case. The settlement would essentially preserve the structure which would mimic what was approved in 2013.","Greg Gordon","Second question is on your continued expansion of renewables platform, when we look at - so essentially the announcement of this wind project acquisition it fills in some of the sort of notional space in your Southern Power CapEx budget?","Tom Fanning","That\u2019s right.","Greg Gordon","It\u2019s not incremental to the budget that you\u2019ve already articulated to us?","Tom Fanning","It\u2019s part of the \u2013 yes, it was in the base already. And what we\u2019ve done is I think the change here, it\u2019s on the graph we showed, is that we essentially have spoken for all the placeholders in '15, so we\u2019re very confident of hitting our numbers for Southern Power in '15.","Greg Gordon","And then how much of your total CapEx in '16 at Southern Power is currently sort of money projects that are definitely going forward versus placeholders or that\u2019s on page 12.","Tom Fanning","I think it's 400 million.","Greg Gordon","And could you articulate -- sorry go ahead.","Tom Fanning","We feel really good about hitting our placeholders in '16 also but we\u2019re not as the stage we're ready to declare those as part of base. We\u2019ve improved it by 100 million.","Greg Gordon","And then is there what you can articulate what you think the earnings contribution is going to be from the Kay Wind facility when it comes in?","Art Beattie","The Kay Wind facility the benefits are not investment tax credits, they\u2019re production tax credits. So I don\u2019t recall the '16 benefit but it should not benefit '15 at all, it will be a '16 addition.","Tom Fanning","It will be a little over $0.01 a year, something like that for whatever\u2026","Greg Gordon","And when is the next milestone if we have a firm milestone? This is my last question. Your conversations with your EP&C contractors Vogtle with regard to the delay they announced in service date.","Tom Fanning","So we continue to have constructive discussions there. One of the things I think we tried to highlight in the initial remarks it that we can see our way through to some ways to improve the schedule that the contractors have delivered to us. We\u2019ve been pretty clear about that in our disclosures. So we continue to work with them and we\u2019re trying to find ways to reach an amicable kind of resolution to that.","Greg Gordon","And is there a sort of definitive milestone to look forward there in terms of drop dead date or\u2026?","Tom Fanning","Not really. The ultimate conclusion would be litigation in the City of Augusta, Georgia.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of James von Riesemann from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","James von Riesemann","I have two questions for you, so the first question is can you guys provide a little bit more color on this continuing disconnect between the 3% GDP growth in the service territory and yet 0.2% residential growth?","Art Beattie","Jim, our expectation was for the year about 3% GDP growth that was underlying our forecast of low growth this year of the 1.3%. We\u2019ve had a very strong economy here in the Southeast, I think our numbers and results reflect that as we outlined in the scripts that\u2019s driven by the industrial sales growth. But we\u2019re beginning to see movement on the residential and the commercial land as well, this is the first quarter in about four years where we\u2019ve had positive growth in all three customer classes. So we think it\u2019s broad based and if we look at employment growth both in the manufacturing sector and in other sectors, it\u2019s beating the national numbers. So the economy in the southeast has been a bit stronger in our view than what we\u2019re seeing on the 0.2%.","Tom Fanning","Yes, at a risk of falling into fed speak too, there is fascinating development and some of the things we\u2019re seeing are better than but in some ways mimic what we\u2019re seeing nationally. Better than clearly in the industrial growth sector, even surprising to us how strong it is. And even probably better than what we\u2019re showing we think that chemicals for example was slightly negative but those were outages. So we expect to see chemicals rebound and recall a continuing theme has been segments which are dependent upon natural gas, well those are going to be really strong we think for the rest of the year. The only kind of cloud on the horizon there primary metals and we think that\u2019s kind of strong dollar, strong imports low oil prices and therefore metal associated with the pipeline is probably slowing down a bit.","But one the things that I think is really interesting that Art alluded to on the residential sector we are starting to see a pickup in household wealth formation, it\u2019s pretty modest but still a pickup. Interestingly the fed guys are concerned by that, in that it looks like they are not consuming this pick up in either the top line revenue or a reduction in cost like lower gasoline prices, they are saving it.","We are within kind of an historical range of savings rates so it\u2019s not particularly troubling to me. And frankly if households are reducing debt or investing or even just putting money in a checking account for now at least they are less exposed, they are more resilient to future economic dislocations. So it\u2019s not all bad, value is a function of risk and return, and GDP growth is return, increased savings rates is improvement in risk. So it\u2019s not all bad and when you consider that the United States GDP was 0.2% growth in the first quarter you look at our numbers clearly better. We feel pretty good about our prospects going forward.","James von Riesemann","So the answer to the question on the growth and the improvement leads me into my next question. So if I look at your trailing 12 months on a weather normalized basis you are 276, but if I remember correctly at the end of the \u2013 in conjunction with the fourth quarter call you had 276 to 288 which are your expectations for the year? How do you get to the upper end of that band or even the middle end of that band given that trailing 12 is at the very bottom?","Tom Fanning","Improvement at Southern Power is an easy way.","Art Beattie","Good weather, better than expected economic outcomes.","James von Riesemann","Okay. And then just on - there is nothing else that I am missing, am I?","Art Beattie","I don\u2019t think so.","Tom Fanning","No, if you remember too, one of things I think we said this before Art was the lower end of our range was down by Southern Power not filling in its complement of CapEx, it kind of lived with the base scenario. We think we\u2019re there for 2015 and potentially could even improve.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Chin","Just a quick one, the long-term EPS CAGR slide isn\u2019t in the deck, are we just to assume that it\u2019s still 3% to 4% longer term?","Tom Fanning","Yes. We only adjust that kind of once a year, right. We come out every January and we give guidance for the year on our long-term growth estimate and then we only update that in our October call once we\u2019ve gotten through the big earnings month in the summer.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett from Morningstar Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.","Mark Barnett","A couple of questions here one sort of bigger picture, you gave a little bit of detail around what you\u2019re seeing in the commercial sector and obviously from a usage perspective it\u2019s lag a little bit but we have a nice pick up here in the quarter. I\u2019m wondering is this about the level of improvement that you\u2019ve taken for expectations in your guidance here.","Tom Fanning","Actually, we\u2019re looking for a little more improvement. The expectations for the year in terms of segments.","Art Beattie","Like 1.4 on commercial about one on residential and 1.7 on industrial, so we\u2019re bit ahead of our industrial numbers. We're still about a little way to go on commercial.","Tom Fanning","Yes, 1.3 for the year total.","Mark Barnett ","Right, sorry that number is 1.4% on commercial that\u2019s the level that's been in your guidance. And then year-over-year obviously base business growth driving a lot of that OpEx I\u2019m sure, is this level kind of the year-over-year increase sort of a guide for the remainder of the year and you have lot of flexibility there.","Tom Fanning","Flexibility on CapEx is going to go to Southern Power\u2026.","Art Beattie","The first quarter was a bit of an anomaly, you may remember Mark that first quarter of last year we deferred a lot of the expenses at Alabama Power they were non-nuclear outage costs under an accounting order that they were operating under last year. And then also if you look at year-over-year there were more megawatts out this year across the system than it were last year. So there are more outage costs this year. And then you just got normal growth for the rest that's a big piece of it is well. So if we look at what we expect for the year I still think my guidance from the last call was about 3% to 3.5% growth in non-fuel O&M for the year still applies and the first quarter is just kind of an outlier that will correct itself through the year.","Tom Fanning","And when we came up with the $0.55 estimate for the first quarter, almost exactly expected this levels O&M.","Mark Barnett","Thanks for the reminder it has been a long day if somebody mentioned earlier. Last question can you just remind me if Governor Dean has signed the new solar bill, HP37. And generally what you expect to see as a result in terms of maybe your own programs or offerings in the state?","Tom Fanning","He has not signed it to our knowledge, but I can tell you all this is very consistent with our plan I have always tried to position the company as given whatever business circumstances exist for us to find ways to play often. And to the extent distributor generations becomes important to the customers to this state it is the clear mission of our businesses to provide that service and those assets to our customers.","So we fully support any development with respect to distributed generation whether that's rooftop solar or some ideas that they were storage or community solar or financing or anything else. Now whether we do that ourselves or do it through third parties our job is to find ways to succeed in this changing business environment. And I think we're demonstrating that in a superb way.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Crowdell","I just want to follow up on Mr. Gordon goes to Washington's question and Mississippi. Just it seem that there is a disconnect there when you look at that the two road maps you have over conventional rate case for the 30% to 40% rate increase or I'm not sure if you use this term but maybe a glide path or some type of nice trajectory of rate increases. It would seem like a no brainer if you were a regulator or you are running the intervene parties. Could you maybe highlight what that disconnect is and maybe handicap what you think to chances are of a potential settlement in Mississippi?","Tom Fanning","Anthony the only thing I can tell you I don't want to characterize the decision that's kind of in front of these folks, but if you look at the broad based support that the company has enjoyed to ask the Supreme Court to reconsider their decision in the amicus briefs, including the task to me it is an obvious decision that benefits the citizens of Mississippi to pursue the settlement or at least restore what the Supreme Court validated in its recent order, either one of those is I think in a broad sense the obvious way to go in the state.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Weinstein","First question is about pipeline to midstream opportunities wondering if you are still considering going forward with that and how serious is that consideration?","Tom Fanning","Yes, here's some fascinating supporting data. We're actually looking at several opportunities and active discussions, will see how that goes. When you think about it before I came into this role we were consuming coal 70% of our energy came from coal and then 15% from natural gas. When you look at recent history 1.5 bcf per day, now this year may be as high as 1.9 and depending on what happens with 111 (d) and a variety of other things that per day gas consumption can average somewhere around 2.3 bcf per day.","So, when you think about the attractiveness of Southern Company being one of the nation's largest consumers of natural gas, our value as a kind of key tenant to any of the infrastructure that needs to be build out to meet that kind of demand really gives us some opportunities to pursue a variety of investments and we're all over with that stuff, so we'll see what happens.","Anthony Crowdell","How about gas reserves and rate base?","Tom Fanning","This goes way back even when I was CFO and COO, so we\u2019re talking now 10 years ago we\u2019ve been kind of kicking that around. And back then we weren't consuming that much natural gas and it wasn\u2019t as important. But certainly it\u2019s an idea that has merits and as natural gas becomes more important to us especially given its volatility relative to other fuel stocks we we'll certainly keep that on the front burner of ideas. In any case we would not want to take price risk on molecules in the ground this would all fuel clause related issue.","Anthony Crowdell","One other question about nuclear. We\u2019ve heard recently from Commissioner Echols that he sees the need for another two units beyond the current and that it depends on how well the project goes and whether 111 (d) goes, so I am just wondering if you have actually been in conversations about that, is that something that\u2019s actually been planned out at this point or is it just talk for now? And also is this something that you can hold over the consortium's head so-to-speak, that guarantees some kind of good performance going forward also in the litigation?","Tom Fanning","So many of you on the call may remember in 2014, I want to say it was the summer and a Q&A session that\u2019s by far some policy center I think after a talk I made that I did alluded the fact that we would be I forget delighted to consider new nuclear. The steps that would be taken first would be to essentially begin the permitting process to undertake a new plant, not necessarily to commit to build a new plant. So in essence it\u2019s fairly modest dollars in order to secure the option. And we moved along and then we were hit in December with the change in schedule put forth by our contractor group. We were very clear that we don\u2019t believe that the contractors are doing everything they can do in order to fully mitigate their schedule per the requirements of the contracts.","And so what I said at that time was that I thought it was sensible for us to set aside a lot of talk about new projects until we came to more resolution as to the commercial dispute. It is clear to me that if the contractors want to succeed in the United States with AP1000 then they need to perform well on Votgle 3 and 4. It is in fact the benchmark plant for all AP1000s going forward. So, you can draw your own conclusions as to their motives.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Eggers","Tom just on the nuclear conversation can you maybe just share some of the things that you guys saw to expedite or to catch up on the delays of the EPC folks, number one. And then number two if you look at kind of how they got their delays and schedule, are there things you\u2019re going to be able to do to mitigate that from happening kind of going forward so we don't run into this 12 or 18 months from now them saying while we have the same sort of delay problems?","Tom Fanning","So we try to kind of suggest that in the prepared remarks at the outset. I think there is a clear opportunity to advance some scheduled mitigation with new Newport News, that\u2019s our opinion. And it\u2019s not only production of their facilities but also the installation of the panels. We need to make sure that all of that is done well. Also you must know that, especially those of you that have visited the site we encourage everybody on the phone if you can figure out a way to get to the site, we love showing it off. I think the people that were there were I think really struck with the kind of progress and quality of the work there.","We have an enormous quality assurance program and as licensee of the plant we ultimately are responsible for having the right kind of plant built there. Our QA program has been focused not only on site but also at places like Lake Charles, and I think our working with the contractors itself put them in the position where now we essentially have been able to accept production out of that facility and go ahead and put it in the production process.","As we move to more work inside the nuclear island that kind of process improvement, quality assurance and ultimately production on site is going to move the needle in the right direction. So we remained relentlessly focused on ways to work with them to do that. And I would argue in the past quarter or so I think we've made some progress in our thinking.","Dan Eggers","And then just to ask a question, but just on the gas reserves and rate base issue. The legislation in Mississippi seemed to open that as a little bit more of a window than previously discussed. Is that something you guys are going to look for sure how do you read that legislative action?","Tom Fanning","Well it\u2019s largely focused on E&Ps recovery of economic development projects. It does authorize the PSE to deem the natural gas reserves are used and useful as utility plan or whatever. So a similar concept -- so it is something we would consider as there is natural gas kind of generation in Mississippi I think once you're post Kemper rank with 3rd coal gas and Kemper. A similar concept that we have at Kemper is in fact that the Lignite mine. It\u2019s a similar idea where essentially we own the Lignite and it\u2019s in rate days and it serves to hedge kind of any future price swings. Remember that is almost no volatility going forward.","So it\u2019s certainly a valid idea something we consider and make sense.","Daniel Eggers","And I guess just on the renewable side of the business, I guess we\u2019re able to put renewables in right place in Georgia in PPAs in the other states, is there going to be an opportunity when you guys start putting or feel more comfortable putting some of those assets into your rate base rather than contracting out where the cost of capitals are.","Tom Fanning","Sure. I think to the extent those assets ever get flipped, so what have you. I think we\u2019re a natural buyer. One of the things that we always kind of think about is for any of our assets and although we tend to acquire some you know we sold some and swapped some, who is the best owner. And we always seek to achieve that position. So I think there will be opportunities for us, should those assets ever come to the market for us to be a strong player in acquiring that, that maybe a Southern Power or could be at the OpCo.","Daniel Eggers","But you don\u2019t necessarily see the utilities doing more to develop renewables in territory in rate base asset.","Tom Fanning","No, absolutely we could and in fact I try to suggest that in that little funny sense right there and there is probably more to come if you remember that sense. We\u2019ve done a lot of business in Georgia, we\u2019ve done four times 30 with DOD facility and there is more to come. So I\u2019m very bullish on that. We\u2019ve had a terrific relationship with the DOD. You know, that the DOD has a renewable mandate goal what have you and I think we were probably the first ones in the United States to work with them constructively to fulfill that mandate.","Operator","Our next question is come from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Ali Agha","First question Tom, just wanted to clarify your scenarios on getting closure on the Mississippi issue. I think one of the options previously was for the Supreme Court to overturn their ruling which I guess was 5.4. Is that still an option or are you really thinking if global settlement could address all the issues they raised in the original ruling and take care of it from that perspective.","Art Beattie","Ali, it\u2019s both of those I mean the Supreme Courte could certainly reconsider their decision that obviously and think about the broad supporting the state just about everybody in the state that we had huge participation in the amicus briefs. But tailing that we could reach a global settlement which would in effect mimic many of the characteristics of the original rate order that was entered into in 2013, we could get that as well. We think any those are better than filling for 40% increase in the rate case but we\u2019ll see how it goes, those are the path we will follow.","Ali Agha","And also be clear I think you mentioned thinking about filing that rate case about mid May just couple of weeks from here. So in your mind the other two parts whether a global settlement or a Supreme Court reversal realistically could happen within the next couple of weeks?","Art Beattie","Sure. And then I suggested on the call earlier today that another alternative for us to file the settlement proposal, at the same time would temper us with the conventional rate case.","Ali Agha","And then secondly this show cause notice that they put out there to you guys on market bought issues, how big of a deal is that or do you see that playing out?","Tom Fanning","We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal right now. Look, I don\u2019t think there is any evidence in my opinion there is very little evidence, no evidence Southern Power has any market power in the Southeast. I think it was a reaction by the first half that basically pointed out that there was not much activity in our auction mechanism that we had put in place, really up until 2014. In 2015 we introduced kind of a tweak on that auction process which increased the activity of the auction many folds. But you got to understand through this period we\u2019ve been a net purchaser not seller. So heaven sake I don\u2019t know how we exercise market power as a net purchaser of energy. ","Number two, the southeast has been traditionally a bilateral market and people are very happy. There has been no contention at FERC that suggest that there is something wrong with the auction process we have in place. This in fact was flow by the FERC that basically is raising a question where I am not sure there is any problem at all. So we have a chance to respond and we we'll provide our evidence and have a good constructed dialogue with FERC and we'll see how it goes. In the near-term you should think about that in the next three to five years. At least the thinking we've done so far there is almost no potential adverse financial impact from this.","Ali Agha","And then in your financial planning you still have assumed no equity issuance through '17. I was just curious how much cushion do you have right now so that that scenario different scenarios keep you in that no equity issuance mode or are you fairly close if you get more Southern Power activity et cetera that equity comes back into the equation.","Art Beattie","Yes, Ali just recall last year we issued 800 million versus the 600 week plan. So we're a bit ahead of where we thought we'd be. We don't really have any scenarios in which in the foreseeable future even with the Southern Power investments that we have outlined in our CapEx program where we would need more equity. It would have to be in access of the amounts that we forecast and you can see we filled up our bucket in 2015 on placeholder projects and we strive away to go 2016. So I think we're good to give you a feel for I don't have a number to give you about where we are in the limit, but I think we're in pretty good shape.","Tom Fanning","And I think we've suggested in the past that kind of as we start to wind down our CapEx and if you look at our CapEx slide kind of, what was it to 6.8 to 5.5 or to 4.3 or something like that. We're probably over-equitized to some degree. So there is not pressure to sell more equity.","Operator","And our next question is coming from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lapides","Congrats on a good start to the year and especially on the renewable side. One quick Mississippi question and then one natural gas question for you. In Mississippi the court decision referenced pretty clearly the need for a prudency review before the commission can grant any kind of rate increases. And given that the stems from a rate pair or customers acting as litigant here, do you need to have a prudency hearing of some kind as part of any settlement docket?","Tom Fanning","We've already filed a prudency record last year. So we think all the evidences there necessary for the commission to act right now.","Michael Lapides","So the commission could issue a prudency determination based on what's in the record right now and that should satisfy effectively what the Supreme Court said had not been satisfied when the Supreme Court made its ruling?","Tom Fanning","That is our belief.","Michael Lapides","On the natural gas side when you look at the infrastructure of the natural gas system throughout your service territory and maybe even slight neighboring areas. Where do you all see is the biggest bottle mix meaning where is there lack of midstream infrastructure that is needed to be able to over the next. I want say five to ten years because it's kind of hard to look much more beyond that to help alleviate some natural gas or other midstream related bottle mix in your area?","Tom Fanning","Yes. That's a fascinating question and I wish I had my map and my pointer and it really depends on what you believe at 111 (d) and what we do with other kind of the display co-assets should they arise, recall under their half [mac or math] we went from kind of 20,000 megawatt down the 13,000 with 4,000 total unit being retired -- being converted to gas 3,000 retired completely. By EPAs own math and I'm not going to stand by their math because I frankly don't believe it's a achievable in the timeframe as they do.","But they would have us retire enough coal down about 4,000 megawatt, so what do you do, do you convert that to gas? Do you build Greenfield gas where do you build it? If you want to think about the way the pipes work in the southeast there is kind of tow big themes. The normal conventional historical theme would has come from the west and you got a lot of pipelines that kind of run from the gulf of Mexico up through the North Western part of Georgia if you want to think about it that way. Where you don't have a whole lot of distance to cover, you have some embedded costs that are attractive. And we could certainly link in to systems to the west. And there is even if not just Gulf of Mexico stuff right, there is Fayetteville and some other areas out there that are shale gas related.","The other theme would come out of kind of the north and so you would think about pipes that may come down north to south and kind of approach our territory more from the east. And so we'll see how that goes, you are talking about probably more expensive pipes so can you get a basis difference than the gas between the north and say Henry hub looking and kind of proxy. So that's really the two big themes in gas infrastructure that we seem to see.","Michael Lapides","My apologies real quick back on Mississippi and this maybe our Art question. Art given the court case and where it stands now. What happened in the first quarter from a GAAP accounting perspective in revenues in Mississippi versus what had been basically going on to all of '13 and '14? And I am just trying to kind of match up our GAAP revenue numbers to the Mississippi rate increases, are they reflected in GAAP revenue I know the cash was collected previously. I am just trying to think through the puts and takes here.","Art Beattie","Michael we didn\u2019t record any mere equipped revenue in the first quarter but there were some impacts for equity return on some other pieces that actually went back into fourth quarter of last year where we un-book some of that but it was very -- it was all really deferred. I don\u2019t have a number to give you but I can give you some math to recall.","Michael Lapides","Just trying to think big picture you're basically no longer booking the revenue related to Kemper, that $156 million number.","Art Beattie","Well, all of that was never going to the income per se it was all being booked on the balance sheet as a regulatory liability and it was going to be used to offset rate increases as the plant went into service over time that was the whole design of mere [equipped].","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Shar Pourreza","Just real question quick question on Mississippi, I know you\u2019re kind of working on potentially striking a global settlement. So can you remind us if the asset has sort of a capacity factor hurdle it has to meet once it is live? It\u2019s good to see that it\u2019s running like a CCGT I am kind of curious on what the hurdles are once it\u2019s live?","Art Beattie","Recall that the combined cycle that\u2019s running right now is running on natural gas. Ultimately we have been working with the commission on an arrangement in which when you think about it when we had the project certified there was a capital cost component and then there was an energy cost component. And what we\u2019ve been able to kind of think about in the settlement is a way for us to essentially assure that Mississippi customers are held harmless from any comp over runs we\u2019ve done that painfully for all of us. And then otherwise to assure that the energy benefits are there for Mississippi's customers and I think we can get that done.","Now you all must recognize that when plant Radcliffe was originally approved this is a process that occurred in 2009 and 2010 and remember we only had 10% of the engineering done, there's been a host of changes in a variety of fronts including natural gas prices, commodity prices, all host of things. I think what we would undertake to do is make sure that we could deliver the energy benefit that the commission thought they were getting when the project was approved. We\u2019ve already spoken for the capital cost. I think we can get that done.","Shar Pourreza","And then, just one question on renewables Tom as we\u2019re starting to see some more contracts being designed post ITC step down. Curious on if you\u2019re seeing that within the Southeast? And then kind of what that placeholder could look like for Southern Power between wind and solar say post 2016?","Tom Fanning","So, what\u2019s interesting Shar is that right now there is an enormous rush to get stuff done particularly in solar before the end of '16. And certainly that has filled up our wheelbarrow of capital placeholders for '15 and we feel really good about where we are for '16. The wind deal was a way to startle in fact it was interesting one of our own directors used the phrase that did it and kind of the development activity of renewables and therefore earnings associated with the renewable.","The other thing that\u2019s fascinating is as we start to consider kind of beyond renewable to 111 (d) we\u2019ll probably have a final rule there in summer, say August. The States will now have to start providing for the reality of compliance with that rule and therefore we got to start thinking about gas. And remember as I suggested earlier on the call if we\u2019re going to do new gas generation we need new gas infrastructure. Those things can go hand in hand and filling in that kind of flat spot.","Shar Pourreza","And then just on any of the Southeast states, is anybody close to submitting the state implementation plan or we\u2019re like very far off?","Tom Fanning","You don\u2019t have a final rule to react to. Shar Art just pointed something out. Why don\u2019t you stay with it on the solar?","Art Beattie","If you look at our CapEx budget in terms of growth CapEx in 2017 it\u2019s like $200 million but solar projects so it\u2019s very, very small compared to '15, '16.","Tom Fanning","So there is 200 million anyway, it\u2019s way less than what we\u2019re seeing right now.","Operator","And our next question is coming from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Ridzon","It seems incrementally with each call you\u2019re embracing more and more renewables. I mean if this trend continues what are your current thoughts about when yield come into serious consideration?","Tom Fanning","So we\u2019re really following through on what we said we would do. It\u2019s funny. It\u2019s kind of what you say and how you say it, I guess. What we\u2019ve been saying here been pretty consistent for a while now that we thought that renewables will be important certainly solar renewables through '15 and '16 while you have the 30% investment tax credit environment, and that kind of beyond \u201816 into '17 and '18 where 30% goes to 10 all of a sudden wind starts looking like a way to address that gap. Also you should know the strategic synergy we started procuring wind energy via contract. So for us to take an equity position and win puts us in a different posture than we have been before.","With respect to the YieldCo you know that we\u2019ll consider anything but I think on balance we felt that Southern Company itself was a YieldCo anyway we have really efficient ways to raise capital. I think it introduces complexity into your balance sheet and long-term I\u2019m not sure that north of the benefit of shareholders it certainly has short-term appeal but I would never want to impair the long-term viability of this company by doing financial engineering or tricks.","The other thing you should just know and let\u2019s just point out again we haven't really talked about on this call but we have another call. We have terrific tax appetite and given our scale, given our tax appetite you know that we\u2019ve always been conservative; our tax appetite remains the competitive advantage for us to play in these fields. Linking that with our experience with the major vendors our low cost of capital, access the capital markets, I think the developers they want to do something significant look to Southern as the premier partner right now. That\u2019s why we have been able to fill up our [advance] card.","Paul Ridzon","And then it was refreshing to see in the Kemper charge kind of immaterial this quarter, how you look there?","Tom Fanning","Tell me about it. Look, we\u2019re in start up right now. There is a submission of construction left but we\u2019re essentially in start up, and the team there is working wonderfully. We brought in a guy that has had a tremendous amount of experience in start up of these types of processes Chip Troxclair, he and his team have really done a dynamite job of stay on the schedule and working around the issues. It\u2019s refreshing to us as well. They\u2019re doing a great job.","Operator","Our next question is come from the line of Dan Jenkins from State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Jenkins","First questions on Slide 18, your financing plan I notice there are couple of revisions from slide from last quarter the big ones being Alabama in '13 went from 713 to 75 and then Mississippi bank debt in '16 went from to 0 to 900. I was wondering if you could talk about what\u2019s driving those change?","Art Beattie","I believe the Alabama took advantage and issues from vision of that this year. It actually did some refunding that probably wasn\u2019t reflected in the schedule we showed you on the last call. Mississippi bank debt was really a renewal of bank notes that were maturing this year that was about 775 million maturing this year and we actually renewed those plus a couple of hundred million or 175 million or so of additional money and really that's serving as bridge financing for until we get into position where we can either go to capital markets or do our securitization financing.","Dan Jenkins","And I want to go back little bit on your retail sales growth. You talked about change in the weather normalized sales. So I was wondering if you could give us a little color on the customer growth how -- is consistent with your expectation or how is that playing out?","Art Beattie","Yes, well we talked a little about customer growth in the residential side. We added 16,000 new I think last year we added 10 in the first quarter. So pretty good jump in growth. I think if you do a year-over-year look it's about 37,000 increase if you look at year what we have added since the first quarter of last year 37,000 you may recall that prior to the recession we were adding almost 60,000 or more a year, so it's not back to where it was but it' showing stronger growth.","Dan Jenkins","Then last I was looking at the global construction update on Slide 5, I think it is then I noticed you didn't really change any of the information related to Unit 4, and I was wondering if that was according -- still according to plan or if there has been some slippage in the near-term and on the horizon are essentially the same as what you reported last quarter.","Art Beattie","I don't have last quarter's slide in front of me but I believe that what you're seeing there is still kid of consistent with where we are the biggest new module, CA04 module is not a very big one neither are CD-65 or CD-66. So the next biggest module for the Unit 4 will be CA20 and we mentioned that in the script that is just now beginning assembling in the MAB the module assembling building.","Dan Jenkins","So the schedule hasn't really changed for Unit 4 and then to what you reported last time?","Art Beattie","Not that I'm aware.","Operator","And at this time there is no further question. Mr. Fanning, are there any closing remarks?","Tom Fanning","Yes. Thank you. Listen everybody we appreciate you been on the call. I think the company's is off to a great start as we've said to franchise for some time now has been in a good as shape as it's ever been. We continue to execute like champions and we're going to do our best to make sure that our shareholders here are handsomely rewarded. Thanks very much. Talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company's first quarter 2015 earnings call. You may now disconnect."],"19568":["The Southern Co.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Southern Co.'s First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Aaron Abramovitz - Director - Investor Relations","Thank you, Benjamin. Welcome to Southern Co.'s First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Co.; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during today's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investors.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We appreciate your interest in Southern Company. We had another good quarter to begin 2016, a great start to the year, and we are making excellent progress on many fronts. Art will provide an overview of our financial results in just a minute. But first, I'd like to provide you with a brief update of our regulatory calendar in Georgia, and updates on the Vogtle and Kemper projects.","As many of you are aware, 2016 is a busy year for regulatory filings in Georgia; an IRP filing, two VCM filings, a merger approval application, a potential rate increase and the Vogtle contractor settlement filing, which has been extended by the Georgia Public Service Commission to review all costs of the project incurred to-date.","To summarize, first, Georgia Power filed its triennial integrated resource plan, or IRP, in January. The PSC is expected to vote on the company's plan this July.","Second, the PSC unanimously approved Georgia Power's 13th Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report in February. And later that same month, Georgia Power filed the 14th VCM Report to be voted on in August.","Third, Southern Co. and AGL Resources received unanimous regulatory approval of our companies' proposed merger from the Georgia PSC earlier this month, with all intervening parties in support of the settlement agreement.","Fourth, Georgia Power has agreed to extend its current rate plan until 2019, and to keep base rates flat for the next few years.","Fifth and finally, as you may recall in January, Georgia Power filed an application with the Georgia PSC for review of the $350 million settlement with the Vogtle 3 and Vogtle 4 EPC contractors. The Commission voted to move forward with an expanded process which will examine the full project cost and schedule. Consistent with that February order, Georgia Power filed a Supplemental Information Report, which provides compelling support that all project costs incurred to date for Vogtle Units 3 and 4 have been prudent, and that the current cost and schedule forecast is reasonable. The filing includes reports from several subject matter experts, which support that conclusion.","Over the next six months, Commission staff and Georgia Power will review this information, which may result in an agreement this fall for the Commission to consider. Let's move to an update on the construction status of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. The Vogtle 3 and 4 nuclear expansion project continues to progress with multiple milestones achieved in the first quarter. The transition to Westinghouse and its affiliate as the single contractor is complete. Fluor is fully engaged in providing on-site leadership to the construction efforts. We've seen increased productivity at the work site, including 24-hour coverage in critical path areas of the project.","Expected near-term milestones include the placement of the final large construction modules in the Unit 3 nuclear island, CA02 and the 400-ton stainless steel CA03 module. For Unit 4 four, we anticipate setting the CA05 module and getting the five-story, 1,100-ton CA20 module ready for hook later this summer.","Now let's turn to an update on the Kemper County project. We're making good progress on modifications and improvements to the refractory lining of both gasifiers, and addressing issues identified during the initial fluidization and refractory cure-out on Gasifier A. We are also in the process of remediating issues with the lignite feed and drying systems as we approach testing of the gasifier using lignite.","In March, we completed the refractory cure-out of Gasifier B, reaching full operating temperatures while successfully operating the gasifier in pre-lignite feed mode. Over the next couple of months, utilizing Gasifier B, we expect to achieve first syngas production, and later this summer, initial power production using syngas.","We continue to estimate an in-service date for the entire facility in the third quarter of this year. Reflected in the financial results we released today, we have recorded additional dollars to account for the projected schedule cost through September largely to accommodate the revised schedule for Gasifier A.","I will now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2016, reporting earnings of $485 million, or $0.53 per share, compared with earnings of $508 million or $0.56 per share in the first quarter of last year. First quarter results for 2016 include after-tax charges of $33 million related to increased cost estimates for the construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County project. First quarter results for 2015 included after-tax charges of $6 million for the Kemper project.","Earnings for the first quarter of 2016 also include after-tax charges of $14 million related to the proposed acquisition of AGL Resources and PowerSecure International. Excluding these items, Southern Company earned $532 million, or $0.58 per share, during the first quarter of 2016, compared to $514 million, or $0.56 per-share, in the first quarter of 2015.","The major earnings drivers year-over-year for the first quarter of 2016 included retail revenue effects across all our regulated operating companies, and lower nonfuel operating and maintenance costs, offset by mild weather and higher depreciation expense. Southern Power also contributed positively year-over-year as a result of anticipated benefits from renewables projects expected to be in service in 2016 and increased revenues from renewable projects placed in service in 2015.","Moving now to an economic and sales review for the first quarter. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2016 was modest and our retail sales results are encouraging. Total weather adjusted retail sales grew 0.4% in the first quarter, led by strong residential sales, which were up 1.4% for the quarter. Growth in our residential class continues to be driven by strong customer growth as a result of faster population growth compared with the rest of the nation. Regional market fundamentals are strong, and we expect our regional economy to outpace the national economy. The housing sector appears poised for a modest uptick, and the economy continues to add jobs at a decent pace.","Residential construction spending continues to grow, driven by the integration of millennials into the workforce. Atlanta added the most new apartments in the nation in 2015, and even more units are expected to come online in 2016. Nationwide, Atlanta's multi-family forecast is second only to that of Brooklyn, New York.","Weather adjusted commercial sales were up 0.8% for the first quarter. This marks five consecutive quarters of positive growth in commercial sales, and we expect to continue this momentum into the second quarter. Atlanta's office market vacancy rate was 16.2% at the end of 2015, the lowest rate since 2008. This marks a move from absorption in existing properties to accelerated new office construction. Industrial sales were down 1% in the first quarter. Our regional manufacturing sector continues to adapt to weak demand, and U.S. dollar remains a challenge for export-oriented businesses.","I think it's significant to note that some of our largest industrial segments experienced maintenance outages during the first quarter. We expect them to return to operations soon, supporting our positive outlook for stronger industrial sales for the remainder of the year.","We are also encouraged by certain economic indicators that suggest an improving industrial production outlook. The ISM Manufacturing Index increased to 51.8% in March, signaling a prospective expansion in industrial production for the first time in six months. New orders in production improved for a second consecutive month, with new orders posting the largest monthly gain since 2009. Manufacturing employment in the U.S. declined in March, but our service territory has experienced a strong rebound with manufacturing employment up 1.8% year-over-year. All four of our states posted manufacturing job gains.","Four of our 10 largest industrial segments saw increases in sales year-over-year. Paper and transportation, along with lumber, stone, clay and glass, led the way, largely attributed to a continued recovery in the housing sector.","Our economic development pipeline continues to be strong. There has been a 69% increase in year-to-date jobs announced compared to the same period in 2015. We have also seen a 19% increase in the year-to-date capital investment announced compared to that same period in 2015. The geographic region we serve continues to attract businesses that are seeking well-established transportation networks, lower cost of living, a capable workforce, attractive climate and low-cost energy.","Before turning the call back over to Tom, I will briefly cover three final items. First, our earnings estimate for the second quarter. We estimate that Southern Co. will earn $0.70 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Secondly, I'd like to highlight our dividend announcement last week. Our Board of Directors approved a $0.07 increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.24. This is our 15th consecutive annual increase and marks 68 years, dating back to 1948, that Southern Co. has paid a dividend to its shareholders that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year. But the decision to increase the dividend isn't about the past, it's all about the future. It's the strength of our underlying franchise, together with our continued focus on remaining an industry leader through innovation that underpin the board's decision to support our objective of providing superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long run.","I would like to note that with the five-year extension of bonus depreciation, our expected cash coverage of dividends is approximately 10% higher than before the extension and 20% higher than our recent historical average.","Finally, I want to provide an update on our financing plan. The year is off to a great start. We completed a $1.2 billion syndicated term loan for Mississippi Power in the first quarter. This term loan provides much needed liquidity to Mississippi Power. Also in the first quarter, Georgia Power became the first retail regulated utility in the U.S. to issue green bonds. In doing so, they follow Southern Power, which became the first investment-grade power producer in the U.S. to issue green bonds last November. Demand for both of these green bond offerings exceeded our expectations.","As we look ahead, executing our holding company financing plan is a key priority. This plan includes issuing approximately $8 billion of debt and a minimum of $1.2 billion of \u2013 in equity in 2016. Our internal plans, which were deployed last fall, have generated approximately $270 million so far this year. We will look to supplement those plans with additional common equity, and we are taking steps to preserve several options for achieving this. We expect to issue the debt in most, if not all, of the equity in advance of closing the AGL Resources transaction. While these issuances are intended to accommodate all of our holding company needs for 2016, our financing needs could increase to the extent that incremental investment opportunities present themselves, including Southern Power growth projects. Southern Co. is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity, and our financing plans are intended to support our current credit ratings.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Art. Following a successful and eventful 2015, Southern Co. has entered 2016 with strong momentum. Our franchise business continues to perform at a high level, solidifying our position as an industry leader in all phases of the business. We are seeing continued progress on major capital projects, and our customer focused business model continues to serve us well. Our pending merger with AGL Resources is progressing through the approval process. The proposed merger has been approved by AGL Resources' stockholders and the Federal Trade Commission. And we're making good progress with relevant state approvals, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of this year.","We are also excited about our pending acquisition of our PowerSecure International. Subject to the PowerSecure shareholder vote on May 5, we expect to close in the second quarter. PowerSecure is a premier provider of distributed infrastructure, offering primarily commercial and industrial customers, innovative solutions to meet their individual reliability, energy efficiency or green objectives.","Our business model has traditionally focused on making, moving and selling energy, predominantly in front of the customer meter. PowerSecure accelerates our opportunity to extend our make, move, and sell business model to the other side of the utility meter as innovative new technologies emerge and customers' need evolve.","In conclusion, we believe Southern Co. is well positioned for continued success in 2016 and for years to come. Bolstered by the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to customers and communities we serve, we are enthusiastic about the future. We are now ready to take your questions.","Operator, we'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. One moment please for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI Team. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good afternoon.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So the financing plan with the $1.2 billion of equity, $930 million remaining this year, should we presume that's the totality of the equity that you envision needing to fund the AGL deal? Because when I look at the 2017, 2018 projected financings, you have no equity there.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's the plan, Greg. I did say in the script that should there be additional opportunities either from Southern Power or other accretive investments, that we would finance those plans or any of those additional investments with a balanced \u2013 with an eye towards maintaining our credit support.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and, Greg, the other thing that Art alluded to a wee bit, but I think we talked about it on prior calls, that we had a \u2013 I forget. For Southern Power, I guess we have $1 billion of CapEx in 2017. We're seeing probably more \u2013 a larger opportunity set to increase that number in 2017. So as Art said, to the extent we do see further investment opportunities, we will be supportive of our credit ratings in that.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Because you have Southern Power at $1.2 billion this year, and then you have that drop into $500 million in 2017 and 2018 on slide nine. You're saying that you could theoretically be double that?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, it's hard to say what multiple it would be. We just have, as Tom said, opportunities for success.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Greg, I'll go to the CapEx. In CapEx, I think we're showing that we were $2.4 billion this year in CapEx for Southern Power, and $1 billion next year and $1.5 billion in 2018. I'll bet you, we'll be bigger than that in 2017 and 2018. That would just be my guess right now.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Got you. And is this mostly in utility scale solar or is it a mix of solar, wind, and other sort of \u2013 type of generation?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's going to be more of a tilt towards wind if you were going to make a projection on that. But we'll have solar in there, for sure. As you remember, we had a lot of success in 2015, way beyond what we thought. Some of those are CapEx numbers that will show up in 2016. Some \u2013 and remember, now that we've had the extension on the tax preference item, some of that could push over into 2017. So you'll still see solar, you will see more wind than we've traditionally done in the past, would be my guess.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Got you. Got you. I was looking at the wrong slide. I should've been on slide 16, sorry. So the \u2013 and you guys talked about a sort of a $300 million earnings contribution from \u2013 on the last earnings call from...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Southern Power.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","...Southern Power this year.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","And you sort of weren't certain whether that was a sustainable level of spending, but you seem much more confident now than you were on that last call relative to this \u2013 am I implying too much there in terms of the sustainability of the earnings contribution with Southern Power given this CapEx outlook?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So remember, it's hard to track because you'll spend money and then net income will show in a current year. I wouldn't go overboard on CapEx contribution and one \u2013 mean net income contribution in one year equaling net income in the next year. What I will say is I am reasonably confident that we're going to spend more CapEx, and therefore, you should see net income contributions be a little bit better, and recall, than what we've had in our kind of base case. And what you recall is to the extent there is more of a tilt towards wind, those are kind of 10-year production tax credits as opposed to the single shot you get from solar. So the net income profile following that CapEx investment will look a little different.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Overall, we're seeing a very bullish market for Southern Power.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Awesome. One more question, then I'll cede the phone. Can you talk about the earnings ramifications of the deal, the AGL settlement in Georgia for Georgia Power?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We expect Georgia Power to perform consistently with the past. It's going to be a lot of hard work, but Art got some data, but I think, look, when we see Georgia, probably among all the states in the Southeast, seven, eight dynamite kind of relative economic performance, and I think Georgia has traditionally shown that they've been able to hit their targets in all levels of performance; operations, customer satisfaction, safety, including earnings. And I think Paul Bowers that runs that business and his team has shown their ability to hit their target very well. We think it is manageable.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Greg, I think it's important to note that the Vogtle NCCR tariff will remain in place. So that will \u2013 that's not part of the rate extension plan. With the economy being very strong in Georgia, with no major capital additions such as new environmental needing recovery, they think that the rate plan extension is manageable during that timeframe.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fantastic, guys. Have a great day.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You, too. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Julien, how are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good. They got my name right there.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","(24:48) I don't know. At least I got it right. Thanks for joining us today.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thank you, rather. So perhaps a follow-up on Greg's last question, just to hit you with this quickly. Why a little bit more wind in the mix rather than solar? Just to pick on that before going to another thing.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Just opportunity set is bigger. I think with the extension of the PTCs, we're seeing a lot of interest there. I think you also see certain state kind of policy level encouragements. You're seeing companies getting ahead of the Clean Power Plan. We're just seeing a good market for it. And remember, as we have shown in our solar business so far, the fact that we can strike good, strategic relationships with developers, you recall the one that we've done the most, this is within solar, is First Solar...","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Recurrent.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And Recurrent has been a great partnership. We're starting to strike those same relationships in the wind business. And so we kind of have a favored position to be able to strike large-scale deals. We are seeing that develop.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. And then turning over to the Vogtle side of things just quickly. You talk about, I suppose, a potential for a deal this \u2013 agreement this fall. Could you elaborate on what you need to see to get there? Just what are kind of the key milepost, more importantly? Perhaps some of the sticking points or moving pieces?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, this process is set up, and most discussions of this nature are best held in a quiet form. Let the company and the staff evaluate all the evidence in front of them, and come up with what we believe will be a constructive result. That will then get presented to the Commission, the Commission will undertake whatever is necessary to approve it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then just turning to the PowerSecure deal. Congratulations, moving in a new direction. Just curious, how do you think about that in the context of the earnings of Southern Power and where you want to scale that business? I mean, how should we think about that, call it tomorrow after you close, but then years down the line as part of the growth trajectory?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It certainly contributes to our growth trajectory, but it's a really small deal. Despite its small size, we think it is important for us to learn. See, I don't really view this as a new business. What I've been saying pretty consistently is that this notion of evolving the make, move, and sell, then pass electricity through a meter into where, because of technology enabling, because of customer requirements, think data centers or other customers in the industrial or commercial space which have enormous reliability requirements, which is necessary in this kind of new kind of digital community we find ourselves in, look, I think this is just a natural evolution of \u2013 particularly in areas where they are challenged with reliability or price or service, for customers to want us to provide them solutions.","So this is \u2013 we may do some business in our territory, be glad to do it, we'll probably do it under the brand of the operating companies, and we had done some of this already. But I think the ability to grow this business, to learn in markets other than our own, will be positive for us all. It will add to our earnings trajectory, I don't think it will be enormous because of the small size of this thing initially, but I think it certainly enhances our ability to compete in the future. And we're very excited about it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Excellent. I'll leave it there. Thank you, gentleman.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, my friend.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jim. How are you?","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","How are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Awesome.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Perfect.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Jim, buddy.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey. Hey, Art. Can you just talk a little bit about how your thinking is evolving with the equity needs? I know the $1.2 billion, how much of that is broken down between internal plans versus the external dribble? Could you refresh my memory? And at valuations at these levels, why don't you just go out and issue the rest of the equity right now?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Jim, and I think we've said this pretty consistently since the announcement of AGL last August, was that we'll consider all of our options as we move through. We began with internal programs, but we always have the option in front of us to raise the equity in different ways.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And switching over to the dividend, congratulations on that, but when is it time to actually start bumping up the growth rate instead of just the absolute dollar amount of the dividend?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we talked about that. I want to say when we announced the AGL deal, given our belief in the growth contribution from AGL, recall, we increased our corporate expectation, our long-term growth rate from 3% to 4% to 4% to 5%. And what we said back then was, of course, this is the purview of the board and it is ultimately their decision, but we saw a pathway to increase the rate of growth from $0.07 in a year to $0.08 in a year. And recall, as Art mentioned in his comments, even since then, because of bonus depreciation and everything else, we are substantially better from a cash flow coverage standpoint than we were.","So, the financial integrity underlying that decision even to increase the rate of growth of our dividends has improved since we spoke to you by 10%. It's over kind of recent historical averages by 20%. So if anything, our ability to do that as measured purely by financial integrity is even higher than what we suggested. So I think we'll keep it right there for now...","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...and look forward to the rest of the year.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey, and then one last thing on Vogtle. I know we're getting a little out of our skis here, but when do you think it's time to decide whether or not you take bonus depreciation on those two new units?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We are. That's in the plan.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Just making sure. Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ali, good afternoon.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good afternoon, Tom and Art.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","First question, going into the quarter, you guys have budgeted $0.53 for Q1. You ended up at $0.58. Where would you say things that came out better than your original expectations?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Ali, it's pretty simple. You break it down, most \u2013 about half of it came out of the operating companies and half of it came out of Southern Power. We announced a couple of new projects on Southern Power that weren't in the plan at least in terms of the first quarter. And then with the OPCOs, there are a lot of moving parts there. We had, obviously, a headwind on weather. It was $0.02 below normal from an expected perspective, but we offset that with non-fuel O&M and some other moving parts that gave us the other piece of the $0.05 of outperformance.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And on that non-fuel O&M, you've been fairly consistent talking about that growing, call it, 3% or so on an annual basis. But it was actually down in the first quarter. So how should we be thinking about that from a full-year perspective?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think on the full year, you're going to see the whole measure of it. In the first quarter of last year, we had a lot of outages going on versus not so many this year. So that's a big driver. But as you do your plan, I think we're still in that range of 3% to 3.5% growth. But remember that there's never such a thing as a normal year of \u2013 for non-fuel O&Ms.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. And just remember, our historic \u2013 I mean, ever since, I guess \u2013 well, certainly since I've been CFO here, so that spans quite a bit of time and even before that a little bit, we've always had this ability to \u2013 we have a flexible budgeting system here that takes out the volatility of weather. So, we've been able \u2013 I think we're one of two companies in history, anyway \u2013 there's no promise for the future \u2013 where we have always hit our earnings. Now, again, I can't promise that or the lawyers will throw me in jail, but we have been able to demonstrate our ability to manage our spending, and at the same time, show industry-leading reliability and customer service kind of statistics. The other challenge, Ali, which is kind of interesting, is as we now have committed to hold Georgia Power's rates flat through 2019, there is likely to be some impact on O&M. But remember, it's not going to be done just with O&M. It's the economic growth. And we believe this all to be manageable.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, as you pointed out, on a weather-normalized basis, first quarter was up 0.4%. You guys have been budgeting 1.1% for the year. Is that still a good target for the year?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, call it a percent, and we beat our PhDs in Economy here. They're really good guys here \u2013 we have a great staff \u2013 beat them up unmercifully getting ready for the call. They absolutely believed that from a bottoms-up analysis, when we look at some of our major customers, particularly in the chemical sector and then some other large sectors, with the outages that were undertaken, as those outages now go away, we'll see industrial production and sales return to where we thought they would be.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And last question, Tom. Can you remind me, the year guidance you have out there, $2.76 to $2.88, had that assumed that AGL would close sometime this year and contribute? And if not...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","...does that give you some extra cushion within this year if you close AGL before year end?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, we \u2013 yeah, we have evaluated that without AGL. And remember, we said that AGL is kind of an interesting animal for this year. They get most of their earnings in the first half of the year. We're going to close probably in the second half of the year. So their earnings to Southern won't be much at all. When we gave you that guidance, that was ex-AGL. So you'll see AGL start to contribute in 2017 and beyond.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. So coming in perhaps even earlier than expected wouldn't really move the needle for the bottom line this year.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I would focus on Southern standalone for this year. And then, we'll certainly give you new numbers for next year. And we've already kind of indicated what the contribution on the margin will be from AGL 2017, 2018, 2019.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon. Tom, how are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Super. Hope you're well.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I am, thank you. It seems as though you're getting a bigger opportunity set around Southern Power with the renewable. And you've kind of talked about this in the past, but what's the right size from a percentage standpoint of earnings for Southern Power to be?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so if I remember this right, they are currently around 6%, somewhere around there. We think very easily, we could take Southern Power to about a 10% number. And recall, 10% would include AGL. So the net income contribution could really grow pretty high if you're just talking about an appetite kind of number.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. So you've got some runway there.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A lot of runway.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And you said you think Southern Power will do about $300 million of net income this year?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then just a little...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And the other thing \u2013 hey, excuse me, Paul, just real quick. Everybody should just remember that this isn't a merchant business, this isn't something that lives and dies in the so-called organized markets. We do long-term bilateral contracts, credit-worthy counterparties, no fuel risk, no transmission risk. This is a credit quality kind of profile similar to our own.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then just what's happening in the A-trains and B-trains? What's the current state, just review that?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so \u2013 yeah, yeah, yeah. So, we're actually reasonably happy with our progress. The refractory repair on A actually has taken longer, and there's been a few more things we found with refractory. They're called \u2013 I forget what they call them, rat holes or something like that. But we've gone in and evaluated. So it's really, it \u2013 and this is not a high tech kind of operation. It's just in a fairly closed space, hour-intensive thing. And really, the schedule of A is really what had pushed out kind of from August to September. The schedule of B has been delayed some weeks, but we still believe that we will have syngas and ultimately, electricity this summer. We're very happy with the way that's going.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So B has been brought up to temperature and any hotspots have been addressed?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then on your prepared remarks, you said something about the syngas, some issues that you found. What's happening there?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not aware of that. I don't think we've \u2013 we haven't made syngas yet. The other stuff that you may be remembering, let me kind of \u2013 I'm trying to remember what you're referring to. Lignite dryers had been one. But that's been something we've talked about for some time, and again, you've got to remember the lignite is essentially 40% moisture. So as we move the lignite from the field into the plant, it goes through a process where we essentially remove the moisture. In fact, one of the cool environmental aspects of this plant is that it actually produces water. We capture the evaporation and use it in the plant.","One of the feeders for the lignite dryer had blades, if you can imagine, like an old-timey \u2013 I always use these metaphors, but it's like an old-timey, non-power lawnmower where you would push behind it and it would actually feed the lignite into the plant. What we've done is expanded the distance of the blades of that feeder that would allow us not to experience clumping and some other thing. So it's just stuff like that we continue to work through and in a rather pedantic manner. And that's really what startup is all about. You operate certain areas of the plant and we make improvements where we see capable.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Mark.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Hey. Good afternoon, everybody.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","I know you can't talk to specifically about any figures, and you kind of touched on the subject of managing around a settlement at Georgia Power a little bit already. But I am curious, given the size of the annual investment that you're making there, and again, some of the investments that you're making for growth. Outside of the nuclear recovery and kind of the other ongoing cost recovery mechanisms, what are your principal levers on the O&M front, on the capital front, for managing under that?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So outside of capital, you're asking what levers would we pull to manage O&M, essentially?","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Well, O&M, yeah, and outside of capital that you kind of get the more concurrent recovery on.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, that's outside a clause.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Right.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, so, obviously, I think one of the things anybody would look at in terms of looking at O&M first, as you have seen demonstrated with us in the past, we put an enormous priority on giving for our customers, the best reliability in the United States, and we've demonstrated that for years. So one of the areas that we look at is attacking from an O&M standpoint, non-reliability related areas. So that would go to overhead. Any sort of thing in terms of corporate governance or those kinds of things. We think we have some capability to effectively manage reducing overhead inside our financial plan. And that's both at the parent and at the operating company.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Mark, I think you also need to think about it from a capital perspective, and bonus depreciation will certainly give a little headroom to that opportunity. But as you look forward to 2019, that should be concurrent with the time when Unit 3 of Vogtle comes online, so it all fits pretty nicely into a plan as we move out in time.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","And could you remind me, with the settlement with Georgia, is there anything in there that you'd have to go back and re-examine, if you had like a timing delay from another approval, or is it pretty much Georgia is kind of set and tied up at this point?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If you look at the regulatory calendar and those five items I enumerated earlier, I think we're pretty well committed to the three-year deferral. And I think that given everything we've talked about, we can perform as we have in the past within that construct. I think we're in good shape in terms of evaluating everything else. The \u2013 I think AGL is behind us and Georgia. I think we're in good shape.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Okay. Appreciate that, guys. Thanks.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Hey, how are you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Super, I hope you're well.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm okay. So...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Come on, you got to do better than that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Oh, okay. The sales on slide seven, do those \u2013 were those adjusted for leap year or not?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then with respect to the changes and everything that's going on at Kemper, how do you guys \u2013 I mean, do you guys still feel comfortable about the 2012 CPCN and operationally being able to bring the plant on \u2013 I mean, is there anything that \u2013 I mean, I know there are obviously delays and what have you, but in terms of what you've seen so far, and I know there's testing to be completed and what have you. But so far, do you see anything that gives you any pause in terms of being able to have the plant operationally active (45:59) as you guys had planned on?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. Yeah, no. And I think one of the things that I think is distinguished by our operation at Mississippi in Kemper County plant (46:09), sometimes painfully, is that getting it done right the first time is really important to us. We're not going to rush and try and slam this thing in. And what we will do is essentially demonstrate a reasonable history of reliable commercial operations and then file the rate case. We think that's the right way to go. And we continue to do everything along the way. So this hasn't just been, oh, something broke and let's fix it. We are making improvements along the way.","For example, one of the things that we demonstrated beautifully during 2015 is our ability to run that plant on natural gas. It provided, I don't know, 40% of the energy to the citizens of Mississippi Power \u2013 or the customers of Mississippi Power, and did so in an extremely economic way. So as you think about the ability for that plant to provide not only electricity from syngas, but in a dual fuel sort of way to provide a really high level of reliability by supplementing any outages or whatever with natural gas-fired electricity, it's exceedingly attractive, and in my opinion, more than meets the obligations we're setting forth when this plant was originally ordered.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. The rat holes and the corrosion...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","...was there \u2013 I mean, we've heard about this with other similar operations. Is there any issue there that's changed at all?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, we fixed it. But \u2013 so remember, there were some gaps from these nozzles. If you can imagine the riser \u2013 remember this thing \u2013 I always view it as a letter D, is what it looks like. And the riser is essentially where the lignite comes in and then gets blown up into the air in this kind of beautiful helix design. So you have both fuel stock moving into the riser, as well as a very intricate set of air-fired nozzles. What we found in the original fluidization test \u2013 even though the fluidization test went beautifully, the nozzles worked well, the material circulated amazingly, and remember, I was there the day it happened.","We found that because there was a lack of seals among and between the refractory and these nozzles, some of the material got behind the refractory and the hard face (48:45) and caused what we call these rat holes. But these are really small, really small kind of tunnels, if you will, that were filled up with material. As we had \u2013 and the way you fix it is you tear the refractory back off and put it back on. It's not a high-tech operation. What has taken a lot of time is it's a confined space and has just been time intensive. And the more we've looked around the refractory, we found more of these rat holes, we had to tear more of it off and put more back on. We have not seen, to any sense, that degree of rat holing with B. And recall, I think B finished its fluidization test like in one day. So we learned a lot going from A to B.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. I really appreciate it.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Dan. How are you?","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Pretty good. How about you?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Terrific. Thank you.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So, just a couple here on the earnings for the quarter. You had the $0.08 positive from the revenue \u2013 retail revenue impact. I was wondering if you could break that down a little bit in terms of jurisdiction, or were there specific rate actions and will they lap coming up, or how should we think about that going forward?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","If you look at Mississippi, start there, we got a couple cents from the Kemper in-service assets. Alabama had some CNP adjustments of \u2013 that I think were related to environmental assets. It's around $0.03, and then Georgia had a number of adjustments that in total was between $0.02 and $0.03.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then on the $0.04 from the non-fuel O&M, I know in the past, you've adjusted your discretionary maintenance when \u2013 to kind of match when sales are impacted by weather. Is that kind of what's going on here or is that there's something else involved?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On a year-over-year basis, there's lots of moving parts there. But as I mentioned earlier, there was lower other production expenses, there were more outages in the first quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. There were other expense reductions in, say, our distribution area and then administrative in general, generally relate to reductions and pension expense and some other cost in that particular category.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then I had a question on the decline in your fuel costs and revenue. I know \u2013 realize that doesn't have any impact on the bottom line, but just kind of thinking about that, is it \u2013 that driven more by volume or price or mix or...","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's \u2013 actually, loads were down quarter-over-quarter from a year ago, but gas prices are down 31% year-over-year as well. So it's been about...","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","How about coal? Any impact from coal pricing or transportation or not so much?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say it's negligible. It's most of the load is being driven by gas at this point, at least in the first quarter.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then just a couple questions on Vogtle. I know last year \u2013 or last quarter on your near term, you had for Unit 3, the setting the containment vessel ring 2 (52:48), and I was just wondering what the status of that was. Is that upcoming or where are we...","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think when you think about Unit 3, the next big things would be CA03 and CA02, which are the kind of the two big remaining modules into the nuclear island for Unit 3. And then I believe the other ring will be added beyond that timeframe. That's my understanding of the schedule.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","And then just on your slide, this time you have for Unit 4, setting the CA05, but I assume that has to \u2013 that can't occur until the CA01 is completed, correct?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. Don't get any idea that these are in the order of insertion. CA05 goes in well before CA01.","Daniel F.

Tucker","Thank you, Carrie. Welcome to Southern Company's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. There are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","We'll also be including slides as part of today's conference call. These slides provide details on the information that will be discussed on this call. You can access the slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com if you want to follow along during the presentation.","Now at this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning, Southern Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.","Thomas A. Fanning","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a solid year overall in 2011. I'm especially pleased that in a business environment filled with challenges and uncertainties, our systems still performed in an exemplary fashion, delivering exceptional value to customers throughout our territory. I'm also proud to report that on January 5, we celebrated our 100th anniversary as a holding company. You may be aware that on that day, Art Beattie rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. We were tapped by the New York Stock Exchange as a charter member of their new century club, and we held a celebration in Atlanta that featured our 4 most recently retired CEOs: Ed Addison, Bill Dahlberg, Allen Franklin and David Ratcliffe. ","Few businesses can claim to have been around for 100 years, but Southern Company is now one of them. And even as we honor our past, we're already building for the future, harnessing the energy and innovative spirit of our more than 26,000 employees to begin our next 100 years.","Against that backdrop, I'd like to take a moment to update you on where we stand with our 5 strategic business priorities. First, remaining committed to our business model. We continue to provide superior customer value in the form of industry-leading reliability, low prices and exceptional customer service. The 2011 peak season equivalent forced outage rate for our fossil\/hydro generation was 1.3%, the second best in our company's history, and it compares to a historical industry average of around 7%. We also continued a long-term trend of improved performance for our transmission and distribution assets. And our employees performed heroically in restoring service to customers throughout 2011, during a series of catastrophic storms that included ice storms and tornadoes. ","Meanwhile, the price of our products remain well below the national average and our customer satisfaction is among the best in the nation. These results and others are indicative of our strong commitment to customer value and are also a major reason Southern Company was named Power Company of the Year in December at the Platt's 2011 Global Energy Awards. ","Second, achieving success with our major construction projects. Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County Mississippi are progressing well. All targets related to cost and schedule remained achievable. We see that the combined construction and operating license, or COL, for Units 3 and 4 Plant Vogtle is imminent. ","In the meantime, nearly 2,000 workers are moving ahead with work on the site under the parameters of the original Limited Work Authorization. Once the COL has been obtained, we will begin placing rebar in the Unit 3 Nuclear Island to prepare for the pouring of the first concrete for the containment structure. By year end 2012, we expect to increase the number of workers at the Vogtle site to 2,650, ultimately reaching a peak of approximately 5,000 workers in 2014. ","The Vogtle project will ultimately impact some 25,000 jobs across the country, offering a much-needed boost to our nation's ongoing economic recovery efforts. At Plant Ratcliffe, we continue to make progress as we prepare to introduce 21st Century Coal technology to the United States. As of December 2011, we have already confirmed 2\/3 of the project costs and expect to have confirmed nearly 90% by the end of 2012. We have 1,100 workers on site today and expect to have around 2,000 at the project's peak.","Third, arguing for a sensible national energy policy. We continue to promote the concept of a common sense national energy policy that leverages all the arrows in the quiver, nuclear, 21st Century Coal, natural gas, renewables and energy efficiency and develop technology solutions, not rhetoric, through proprietary research and development.","On the regulatory front, we are currently reviewing and assessing the EPA's final 1,100 page order for utility MACT, now referred to as mercury and air toxic standards, or MATS. Our focus remains on finding the solution that's in the best interest of our customers. We are also involved in other key constituencies in this review, including the communities we serve, as well as our state and public service commissions and permitting agencies. We will discuss the MATS rule in greater detail later in this call.","Fourth, promoting Smart Energy. We are focusing R&D efforts on promoting clean, efficient and economic electro technologies to grow our share of energy sales. This year, we expect to achieve major progress, adding to our Smart Grid infrastructure, as we near completion of the addition of more than 4.6 million Smart Meters for customers throughout our territory. This initiative will lead to better data gathering, faster restoration times and improved power quality, and provide one more illustration of our commitment to enhancing the value we provide to customers.","Fifth, developing our people. I think it's interesting to note that our results in 2011 were achieved with about 25% of our officers in new positions. In addition to leveraging our own outstanding bench strength, we also brought in a few key leaders from outside the company, and we completed more than 400 transfers of employees between our various subsidiaries, further proof of our commitment to keep developing our workforce. The result of this is a more diverse, more experienced and better functioning leadership team. ","Elsewhere, we continue to make strides in our efforts to build our reputation as an employer of choice. Since our last earnings call, we've been ranked by G.I. Jobs Magazine as the number one military-friendly employer among all U.S. utilities, and the second highest among all U.S. industry. We were also recognizes as one of the best places to work in America by Business Insider Magazine. ","In summary, as our business continues to grow and evolve, we will pursue the successful achievement of these 5 priorities, all for the benefit of the customers and the communities we serve.","At this point, I'll turn to Art for a discussion of our financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year, as well as our guidance for 2012 and a summary of our financial outlook for the future.","Art P. Beattie","Thanks, Tom. First, I will review the fourth quarter and full year 2011 results, then I will discuss our sales data, economic outlook and sales forecast, followed by our capital budget in 2012 financing plan. I will conclude with our earnings guidance.","As Tom said, our performance for the fourth quarter of 2011 was solid as was our performance for the full year. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we reported earnings of $0.30 per share, compared with $0.18 a share in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of $0.12 a share. For the full year 2011, we reported earnings of $2.57 a share, compared with $2.37 a share for the full year 2010, an increase of $0.20 a share.","Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our numbers for the full year 2011, compared with the full year 2010. First, the positive factors. Increased industrial demand added $0.02 a share for the full year 2011 compared to the full year 2010. Retail revenue effects in our traditional business added a total of $0.60 a share to our earnings for 2011 compared with 2010. Most of this increase was the result of regulatory actions at Georgia Power that became effective in 2011. ","Other operating revenues, primarily increased transmission revenues, added $0.02 a share to our earnings in 2011 compared with 2010. Changes in our non-fuel O&M spending for our traditional operating companies increased our earnings by $0.06 a share in 2011 compared with 2010. This effect is due primarily to reductions in O&M spending in 2011, as compared to increased spending in 2010 that result -- resulting from better-than-expected weather-related revenues in 2010.","A reduction in interest expense for our traditional operating companies increased our earnings by $0.02 a share during 2011 compared with the full year of 2010. The addition of new long-term contracts and higher energy margins in Southern Power, driven largely by the low price of natural gas, increased our earnings by $0.04 a share in 2011 compared with 2010.","Finally, lower parent and other expenses increased our earnings by $0.01 a share in 2011 compared with 2010.","Now let's turn to the negative factors that drove our earnings for the full year 2011. Weather effects reduced our earnings by $0.21 a share during 2011 compared with 2010. Weather was actually positive for the year, coming in at $0.09 above normal, but was negative when compared with the same period in 2010, which came in at $0.30 above normal. ","Lower wholesale revenues at our traditional operating companies reduced our earnings by $0.05 a share in 2011 compared with 2010. This decline in revenues is primarily due to the expiration in May of 2010 of a long-term capacity contract. ","Increased depreciation and amortization reduced our earnings by $0.15 a share during 2011 compared with 2010. Most of this was due to the expiration, at the end of 2010, of the Georgia Power cost of removal accounting order and also to increased environmental transmission and distribution investments.","Other income and deductions reduced earnings by $0.05 a share in 2011 compared with 2010, the most significant contributor being a transition from AFUDC to cash recovery or Plant Vogtle cost construction financing cost. Income taxes in our traditional business reduced earnings by $0.01 a share in 2011 compared with 2010, while taxes, other than income taxes, reduced our earnings by $0.02 a share in 2011 compared to 2010.","Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.08 a share in 2011 compared with 2010. ","In conclusion, we had $0.77 of positive items compared with $0.57 of negative items, or a positive change of $0.20 per share over the full year 2010. So overall, our performance for the year came in at $2.57 per share. ","Before I discuss our earnings guidance for 2012, I'd like to update you on our 2011 sales and the outlook for 2012, as well as our capital budget and financing plans. We'll begin with a look at our 2011 retail sales. ","In 2011, weather normal retail sales grew 1% compared with 2010. Meanwhile, GDP growth for 2011 was 1.8%. Sales growth was driven by the continued recovery of industrial sales, which grew 3.2% in 2011 compared with 2010. Industrial growth continued to be led by primary metals and fabricated metal sectors, which grew by 15% and 11% respectively in 2011 compared to 2010. These sectors were driven by demand for flat steel in the auto industry and steel pipe associated with oil and gas exploration and delivery. Petroleum refining and pipelines increased usage by 13% and 8%, respectively, in 2011, following expansions and production capacity.","Other steady performers in 2011 included the transportation sector, up 4%, and chemicals, up 1%. As we have reported all-year-long, construction-related sectors, particularly related to housing, continued to experience weakness. Analysis suggests that a great deal of the positive industrial performance can be traced to increases in export activity. The value of exports from the region is 25% higher today than in 2007 and market diversity has increased, with exports to Europe dropping by almost 1\/3 and market share to Asia and Central and South America expanding. Residential and commercial sales continued to be flat in 2011 due to weak job growth.","Now let's move on to the economic outlook for 2012. Earlier this month, we reconvened our economic roundtable group, which is composed of regional economist and major industrial and commercial customers served by our operating companies. The observations of the group, which are consistent with our own view, can be summarized as follows: The national economy is expected to grow in 2012, but growth will be weak and sensitive to shocks; GDP growth is expected to be between 2% and 3%; The industrial sector will continue to lead the recovery, with exports playing a major role; The European economy will be a risk factor that could slow global economic growth; Employment is expected to grow, but not enough to significantly reduce unemployment; Job growth and increased availability of credit are keys to improving the housing market, which is a linchpin to the improvement of residential and commercial sales growth; And political and regulatory uncertainty is contributing to the lack of clarity about the pace of the recovery of the economy. ","Translating this into implications for sales, we project that based on a GDP growth assumption of 2.6% in 2012, retail sales growth will be 1.3%. Industrial activity is expected to continue to lead our sales growth at 1.6% as export volumes remain strong and domestic demand increases. Manufacturing productivity is expected to continue to increase, aided by the ability of our regions' outstanding port facilities to reach out to new markets and create new opportunities for growth.","Weak job creation is expected to continue, tempering residential and commercial sales growth. Residential sales are expected to grow at 1.3% in 2012, while commercial sales growth is expected to be 1.1%. ","The good news is that once the economic fog clears, stronger growth in the Southeast economy should return, given the strong long-term growth fundamentals of the region. Economic development activity remained steady, with more than 250 prospects considering locating within our territory, representing more than 40,000 potential jobs.","The auto industry remains a strong player in the recovery. In 2012, Kia will expand its manufacturing capacity, adding 1,000 jobs, and a variety of auto-related companies will likewise add jobs this year. Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz has already begun work on its previously announced expansion, which is scheduled to be completed in 2014. ","All of these indicates a continuing preference to locate in the Southeast, which reflects our region's low cost of living and of doing business, abundant labor and favorable climate. We remain confident in our region's ability to continue its ongoing recovery.","Now I'd like to move to a discussion of our capital expenditure forecast for the next 3 years. Similar to last year, our forecast is composed of 2 major elements: our base forecast; and potential compliance investments, which represents the uncertainty associated with MATS, as well as anticipated new coal, ash and water rules. ","Our base forecast for 2012 through 2014 totals $14 billion. This reflects new generation for our traditional operating companies of $4 billion, including $2.2 billion for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and $1.5 billion for Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County, Mississippi. Other major components of this base forecast includes maintenance capital of $4.3 billion and $1.8 billion for transmission and distribution growth investments. ","A crucial factor in the potential compliance investment portion of our capital forecast is the impact of the EPA's new MATS rule. As Tom indicated earlier, we are reviewing the final rule issued in December, but a number of uncertainties remain. I would like to summarize those briefly.","In the process of going from proposal to the final rule, the Edison Electric Institute recommended 11 modifications to the EPA. One of these was related to the compliance timeline, while the others were more technical in nature. The final rule, which we expect to be published by mid-February, did not grant much additional relief on the compliance timeline. There were some technical adjustments, particularly to the particulate matter standard and the plant-wide averaging, which may provide some additional flexibility. There were other changes as well, including emission limits during startup and shutdown that were offered. Much more analysis is needed before we know whether these changes afford us additional flexibility.","As Tom indicated earlier, we are engaged in discussions with community officials and state regulators to incorporate their input into our compliance plans. We are fortunate to have strong community leadership and knowledgeable constructive public service commissions and staffs in our territory. The participation of those entities will have an influence on our compliance plan and schedule decision and we cannot finalize our plans until those discussions are complete.","Based on our initial assessment, the compliance plan for Southern's 20,000 megawatts of coal-fired capacity could include the following: new emissions reduction equipment, primarily baghouses on up to 12,000 megawatts of our flagship coal-fired capacity; potential retirements of up to 4,000 megawatts; and fuel switching on up to 3,200 megawatts of coal- and oil-fired capacity to other fuels such as natural gas. Our plans also include significant infrastructure improvements, including natural gas and electric transmission upgrades to ensure adequate reliability on our system. Based on that, our potential compliance investments for 2012 through '14 are projected at a total of up to $4.4 billion. Of that, up to $1.6 billion represents potential compliance investments for other proposed rules around ash and water. ","Overall, our 3-year capital forecast for 2012 through 2014 is for a total of up to $18.4 billion. The major trend reflected in this forecast is that the potential compliance spending is ramping up as some of our base projects are winding down. The 3-year break down also reflects that our potential compliance spending of up to $400 million in the first year is not a major component for 2012. We will continue to update you on our capital forecast as new details emerge. ","Now let's turn to a summary of our financing plan for the same 3-year period. Long-term debt issuances are expected to be up to $10.4 billion over the next 3 years. In addition, DOE Loan guarantees for Vogtle 3 and 4 and for Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County could represent up to $4.3 billion or about 40% of the total. Our 3-year financing plan assumes common equity issuances of up to $1.9 billion. We stopped issuing new shares through most of our equity plans in early 2011. Since then, we have only utilized stock option exercises to provide new equity.","We ended 2011 with an equity ratio of 44%, and our current plan assumes modest common equity issuances over the next 2 years. We anticipate turning our other equity plans back on later in this 3-year horizon, as potential environmental compliance spending increases. Overall, our financing plan continues to support our industry-leading financial integrity while maintaining our well-managed debt portfolio and a common equity ratio of approximately 44%.","To begin our earnings guidance discussion, I'd like to take you back to what we shared with you during our fourth quarter earnings call a year ago and at our analyst day shortly thereafter. At that time, we provided long-term EPS guidance that was based on our 2010 earnings guidance range of $2.30 to $2.36 per share. We profiled a trajectory that grew the bottom of the range by 5% every year and the top of the range by 7% every year. ","And as we've said, our 2011 guidance was slightly higher than our long-term trajectory, largely due to the significant year-over-year improvement in earnings we saw coming out of the recession and some of the constructive -- and some of our constructive regulatory results. We are providing a 2012 earnings guidance range of $2.58 to $2.70 per share. This guidance reflects current uncertainties and normal variability. We believe our 5% to 7% long-term growth trajectory, which is anchored to 2010 guidance, is still appropriate, and our 2012 annual earnings per share guidance is positioned largely in the top half of that range. ","That said, we recognize that continuing to anchor long-term growth to 2010 guidance may be impractical over time. Therefore, we will now characterize our long-term earnings per share growth trajectory as being 4% to 7% as indexed against the 2012 earnings guidance range.mAs you can see from the slide, this is essentially equivalent to our original long-term trajectory. In fact, it narrows expectations in the near term to the higher end of the range we provided in 2010. ","In summary, our earnings guidance for 2012 is $2.58 to $2.70 per share, and our longer term growth trajectory is 4% to 7% off of that range. As always, the variability and long-term range is based on several factors, including uncertainty in our compliance investments and uncertain pace of economic recovery and other considerations. We remain confident in our ability to pursue our goal of growing earnings and dividends in a sustainable manner. Lastly, our estimate for the first quarter of 2012 is $0.45 per share. ","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thanks, Art. In closing, let me reiterate that our business model, priorities, and financial objectives remain in place for 2012. We are well positioned to continue providing exceptional customer value, which should translate into exceptional shareholder value in the form of reasonable EPS growth, with an attractive dividend yield, at one of the lowest risk profiles in the industry. Despite the uncertainties that remain, we are confident in our ability to navigate the challenges of 2012 in much the same way that we have navigated the challenges of 2011, by staying true to our fundamentals and delivering on our commitment to customers, employees, communities, and shareholders. ","At this point, we are ready to take your questions. So operator, we will now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just kind of now we have MATS in place and you've put some numbers out there for what the environmental CapEx could be. Are those numbers cumulative to what you'd have to spend over the entire compliance period or is that just the 3-year period and there would be additional spending in \u201815, \u201816 to get the full compliance that you see right now?","Thomas A. Fanning","Just 3 years.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So that should be that 3-year period? So there will be more money in that Q beyond that.","Thomas A. Fanning","That's correct. Absolutely.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","When did you guys expect to kind of get to the process with the regulators to formalize that CapEx plan?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, I think we need to get clarity on the proposed rule. And from time to time, we move from proposed rule to final rule to published rule. I think haven't [ph] we seen in cross states that from final rule to published rule, things can change. So we still wait with a lot of interest to see what the published rule will be. And like I said, we're going to have to go through with the stage and just -- and all the people we mentioned that kind of fully assess. Because remember, this is not some academic exercise. What happens here when you start talking about changing out plans and retiring or mothballing some or converting some, you're impacting tax base of local communities, you're impacting unemployment in largely rural areas, you're impacting real income of people out there. These are not bloodless decisions. These are things we take very seriously when we think about how we engage with customers on a day-to-day basis. Look, the time frame varies from state-to-state. You know that we deal in Georgia and Alabama and Mississippi and Northern Florida. So each state will have it's own process and own timeline to go through. It's hard to say, in kind of a general statement, what that might be.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Then, I guess, with the 4% to 7% growth rate, is that taking into -- would 7% reflect if you had to do the full amount of spending? Or would that -- or how does, I guess, this environmental CapEx fit into that band?","Thomas A. Fanning","That's generally correct. The more CapEx we spend, the higher you are up [ph] in the range. And of course, there are other factors too, right? But that's a reasonable way to think about it.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And the slide has vanished in my screen, but it seemed to go to the right -- further than a couple of years. Is this kind of a decade-long growth rate? Is that -- how are you guys thinking about it now?","Thomas A. Fanning","No, 3 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Chin with Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sorry, if I missed this earlier in your prepared comments, but that base environmental number, would that -- does that already include some element of CSAPR in it? Or if the CSAPR rule gets finalize at some point in the next 12 to 18 months, do you expect [indiscernible]?","Art P. Beattie","The base CapEx includes projects that most of which are currently ongoing. I believe the Daniel scrubber might be in that particular project, but when you talk about CSAPR, most of the -- we'll address most of the CSAPR issues through the MAT compliance. So you won\u2019t have a whole lot of extra stuff on top of what we're doing for MATS to comply with CSAPR.","Thomas A. Fanning","Let me just add in a different way too. It's a very important point we raise right here. It's one thing to say your CapEx budget is going to be influenced by MACT, by CSAPR, what you really have to do and what we've been consistent about arguing about here is that the whole litany of cascading regulations coming out of the EPA will have some bear on what our CapEx, and ultimately, our generation and transmission expansion plans ultimately will look like. So we could make estimates on that. So we can make estimates on CSAPR, but ultimately, it's the whole consequence of what's happening with ash and 316B and a variety of other things. The other thing that I think we should point out here, too, CSAPR, cross state rule, has never been all that important on its own for Southern. In other words, we would handle that mostly through our dispatch, and it would show up in energy as opposed to capital.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Very, very helpful. And then just one other follow-up question. That is the retail sales growth outlook for 2011 was, I think, 2%. Now it looks like the outlook's closer to 1.3%. Just any -- a little bit of extra color on what's causing that deceleration?","Art P. Beattie","Well, we're looking on a lot of uncertainty out there, Brian. One of the economists in our economic roundtable group kind of described it as fog on the road and there's not a whole lot of clarity out there. And when there's fog of the road, people either drive a lot slower or they don't drive at all. And so with that uncertainty and the range of GDP estimates you have out there, I think that's kind of describing the outlook we have. So it's cautious on our regard. There are still risks out there. But the data, economic data, we've seen here of late is on the positive side so...","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, [indiscernible] we've seen unemployment tick down, in December, particularly in the Southeast, about 0.5% round numbers in the Southeast. So it looks like jobs are starting to be created. We do a survey, companies that are going to either, there are kind of 3 states in nature, increased hiring, keep hiring constant or decrease hiring. Some time ago, it was 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3 among those 3. And the Atlanta Fed now projects that it's about 45% round numbers, 45% it will increase hiring, 45% it will keep it constant and then 10% that will decrease hiring. So we're starting to see signals. The other things we've talked about are all coming to fruition. Everything we've suggested in the past about economic development is, in fact, happening. So as we start to see these expansions at Chevron or at Austal, or at Mercedes, or at Kia, or at Gulfstream, those things are happening and they will generate jobs as they come to fruition.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on drivers of 1Q earnings guidance? What are the drivers 1Q earnings guidance?","Art P. Beattie","Go ahead. I thought you had a specific question. Okay. Actually, a lot of it was driven by the same revenue effects that we described for the annual period, about $0.16 there. Weather was an offset at $0.08. Non-fuel O&M was a $0.05 positive. Depreciation and amortization was negative $0.04. I believe this is outlined on the slide at the top end of the earning slide. Did you want Q1 of '12 or did you want Q1 of -- Q4?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, I wanted Q1 of '12.","Art P. Beattie","Well, you've got some rate effects that go into effect -- that were outlined in the same rate settlement at Georgia last year. The weather effect from last year, we had some positive weather in the first quarter of last year. So on a year-over-year basis, you would expect some mitigation there. Our estimate of growth last year was stronger for sales growth in residential commercial. It's a little bit weaker this year. So are you trying to get to our 45% -- $0.45 earnings estimate for the first quarter?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes. I'm just trying to reconcile 50 to 45?","Art P. Beattie","Well, we have a lot of weather in last year, first quarter. I think that's the biggest driver.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You have that offhand?","Art P. Beattie","We can probably get it. Hold on.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Opening that big black book?","Art P. Beattie","Yes. Are you kidding me? That's $0.02.","Thomas A. Fanning","And you know -- everybody knows that we do our estimates on weather-normal basis, so any comparison will just be...","Art P. Beattie","Yes, correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So, I guess, I got to ask because as I look at the tail of the tape and think about the economic assumptions that you baked into your forecast since '08, '09, you generally erred to the conservative side pretty much running out the strings since we came out of the recession in terms of the ultimate level of economic activity, sales growth, et cetera, that you've experienced. Is there a scenario that drives you -- what scenario would drive you to the high end or above the high end of your earnings guidance range? Or is there one that's even within the tails of your analysis?","Thomas A. Fanning","Sure. I mean, the question of is there a tail in our estimates that would drive us one way or another, that's absolutely right. Now we've got to figure out how likely that is, I guess that's the key. But obviously, when you think about it, if you look at \u2013 and help me out with the numbers here -- 1% change in sales is worth about $120 million -- I'm looking here real quick, $120 revenue, something like that. And so if we project $1.3 million, so if we get up to $2.3 million, you're up that much, right? If essentially sales are flat, you're down that low. What we've been able to do is just kind of manage our systems to adjust to the normal variables. That's how we've been able to be very consistent over time. For example, weather. For example, changes in the economy. For example, what's going to happen with commodities? One of the stories I think that's interesting in our industry over the past year has been what's going on with natural gas. Southern Power, obviously, has benefited from that. What's going to happen with oil prices in the Strait of Hormuz? And what's going to happen therefor to the weight of oil in the economy? What\u2019s going to happen with Europe? What's going to happen with our ability to generate real job growth and sustain the growth of the economy in light of this fog that Art metaphorically spoke for? But hopefully, kind of this notion of tail risk is kind of that plus or minus 1%, $120 million, with our ability to manage our business to accommodate those changes? Greg, over the years, we've been pretty good at both managing our business to fit within the variables that we normally face and providing the best operations arguably in the industry for the benefit of our customers.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I see that. I listen very closely to what you guys say about economic activity because you appear to be very diligent and plugged into your customers, and that shows up in lots of ways. But I guess, I look at the earnings forecast, and I contextualize it based on what you've actually earned relative to the guidance ranges for '10, '11 and now for '12, $2.37 and $2.57. Now the guidance range. So as investors look at the actuals, we're looking at 0.4% growth at the low end and 5% on the high-end off of what you've actually earned last year. And I understand that, that you contextualized it in terms of anchor aspirations off of '10. I think it's just giving some people some pause that maybe there's something going on in terms of economic activity not being as robust.","Thomas A. Fanning","No. I think if you just look at weather compared to normal in past 2 years. Remember, we're weather normal; it's the way we estimate. You had big weather 2 years ago, good weather, I mean, positive for the last year.","Art P. Beattie","I think, another thing Greg, if you look at weather-normal sales growth in residential commercial, we've had basically flat growth for 2 years now. So our estimates about economic growth continuing there are still kind of tentative. We're still waiting for that to catch and start moving northwards, so we've estimated increase in sales again this year not quite as robust as we did last year. But we were able to offset that loss with what Tom just mentioned, some positive weather.","Thomas A. Fanning","And if you go back, I'm interested in your comment about the context of earnings growth. That's why we show these charts that say we started with 2010, 230 to 236, and we grow at 7% and 5%, and we explained why we thought we will be higher in '11, sure enough we were, and we explained why we think we're in the top half roughly in '12. One of the benefits of the way we run our business is that we provide a business, I think, that provides a regular predictable, sustainable growth and earnings per share. That's been our history, and I hope it will continue to be our history. There's nothing -- there's no lack of transparency in, I think, our assumption of the economy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Tom, I wanted to come back to your comments on the MATS rule that's come out. If I'm hearing you correctly, is the implication that the rules are now final? I know you said final wasn't published. There could be something tinkering there. But unlike CSAPR, should we not assume any legal challenges? Should we assume that you're going to plan around this? Can you just give us a little more insight on your strategy on this?","Thomas A. Fanning","Sure. Strategy remains the same, really, for any of these issues that are in front of us; and that is to represent the interest of our customers, to provide the cleanest, most reliable most economically sensible product available. And so therefore, we will engage constructively in any front that represents the interest of our customers, whether that's a regulatory issue, a legislative issues or litigation, if necessary.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So, I mean, is there a scenario in which you could see some kind of delays or MATS legal challenges to this MATS rule?","Thomas A. Fanning","Sure. I mean, there always is. If the question is if there's a scenario, the answer is yes. But you have to assess kind of the fact that the situation at hand and what the issues are.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","My other question was given the CapEx that you've laid out for us and whether you layered in the extra environmental CapEx above of that. Can you remind us what kind of annualized rate-based growth over those 3-year period that supports?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Ali, this is Art. Roughly, about 7%, but remember, that that's a lumpy growth as plants go into service. So you'll see fits and starts there. But on average, about 7% will run.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, 7%.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","That's an annual number, right?","Art P. Beattie","Correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes. And does that include the extra environmental CapEx in there as well?","Art P. Beattie","Probably, that would be on top of that, but it's further out. Remember those projects won't go into service until after the 2014 time line we've outlined for you.","Thomas A. Fanning","And remember, that's the difference, is what clears in the rate base and what's spending before that.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So I mean, on that note, last question, I mean, if you look at your CapEx budget, and if you layer on top of that, the environmental CapEx, that's going to go in at some level. Does that have implications to that earnings growth rate you've layered out for us or does that still give you in that 4% to 7% range, even factoring in that extra environmental CapEx?","Art P. Beattie","It's what we said before, I think. The more CapEx you will see, the higher in the range we will be.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Like in the range?","Art P. Beattie","Yes.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Barnett with Morningstar.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Quick question on the retirement forecast. I know this is something out in 2011, but does that include, I can't recall if it included any impact from the ash and water rules? I know you give the kind of CapEx sensitivity there, but is that a number that might move higher if there's kind of a more aggressive case regulation?","Thomas A. Fanning","Certainly, it could. I mean, we believe that -- for, example, ash -- coal ash should not be classified as a hazardous waste. To the extent it was, that certainly would change our thinking on what our portfolio looks like.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. But you don't really have kind of a number around what that might look like?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, what we've said about ash and 316B, I think, is that we're looking at 3-year CapEx about $1.6 billion. And I think our assumption there is that it is...","Art P. Beattie","It's non-hazardous.","Thomas A. Fanning","Non-hazardous. Hazardous designation would change the game of energy supply in America in a really dramatic way.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. So when I look at that $1.6 billion number then, that's almost all coming from the coal ash and not necessarily the water or -- I'm sorry, that's both.","Thomas A. Fanning","That's both.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Levi with Caris.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. As far as the slight reduction in the growth rate, I mean, that's, primarily kind of uncertainty around sales, is that...","Art P. Beattie","It's really tied to the economy. Yes, and I wouldn't denote it as a reduction in the earnings growth rate. If you look of the slide, it actually still outlines the same cone of growth that we expected. before. So the 4% at the bottom, yes, you might justify it based on some combination of scenarios that work against you, but it's still no different than what we outlined a year ago.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, and if we were using 2010 as a base, it's still 5% to 7%. All we're doing is the guidance we're giving you is in the top half roughly of the range that we've laid out here for 2 years.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And again, that -- so that growth rate is off in 2011, not off of 2010?","Art P. Beattie","No, it's off of 2012.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","By 2012, excuse me. Okay. That's very important. Okay and then just as you're thinking, I mean, the Fed came out today, said they're going to keep interest rates low through 2014 versus 2013. In your assumptions, what were you assuming as far as just future financing and kind of where interest rates would be in '13 and '14 as an example?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Andy, I don't have the specifics of what we're assuming. But we take generally the input off of what we get from the economic advisers to us. They maybe may be a little higher than what the Fed kind of forecasted out today, but we can call you back and get you that number.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I'm just thinking maybe there would be some type of benefit for you considering you guys do a lot of financing.","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, we do.","Andrew Levi - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","And the last thing, just any update on when we're actually going to get this deal out. I mean, obviously, the process is basically done, but anything you'd like to share with us?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes. [indiscernible]  I said was imminent. It's any day now. I know we're all impatient on getting this COL, but you got to remember this whole process undertaken by the NRC has been really thorough, it's been thoughtful. It's had the participation of all the different constituents that have an interest and whether or not nuclear is built in America. This thing all works to all our benefit. So getting it right and having everybody satisfied, dotting every I and crossing every T, at the end of the day is a good thing. Because we've got a lots of years ahead of us and lots of money to spend, so we all are impatient to get it, but I think it's actually a good thing at the end of the day.","Operator","Your next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. So I just wanted to go back to the discussion about the low-growth assumptions and the potential conservatism that is built into those numbers. I'm looking at your actual weather-normalized data for 2011, and your sales grew about 1% versus 2.2% that you expected. Looking at the March presentation. And also you are assuming quite a significant pickup year-over-year for commercial and residential sales. Can you actually, I mean, I don't quite understand what could drive this. I mean, do you have maybe limited visibility on the economy, as we all do? But what would be the drivers for commercial and residential growth?","Art P. Beattie","Angie, this is Art. What we are assuming there is, as we mentioned in our script, I believe that job growth would begin. It wouldn't be a lot to alleviate the unemployment situation, but enough to stimulate growth in both our residential and our commercial areas. Tom alluded to an Atlanta Fed survey where CEOs of companies around the Southeast are now indicating that more of them are in a hiring position than they were 6 months ago. These are all indicators that we have that will lead to more job growth, more household growth, create increases in customers on both residential and commercial side.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","But isn't your residential demand more driven by migration into your space than maybe growth in usage or accounts?","Art P. Beattie","Well, there's lots of factors there. And [ph] migration is still continuing. but it has slightly dropped since the recession. So we continue to look at those and try to evaluate what it really means for us as we move forward.","Thomas A. Fanning","But Angie, I mean, that's a good point. Look, industrial activity creates jobs; jobs create opportunities for people to move in. It unlocks the housing sector, and that creates more activity in stone, clay, glass and building materials and a variety of other things. So it primes the pump to restart the engine. Our belief is, that we'll just start seeing the jobs and, in fact, this whole process will start to regenerate. The key, I guess, is housing, at the end of day. That's something that we look for very closely in all our statistics.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Great. And then when I look at your fourth quarter results, there is at least a chunk of the earnings came from lower O&M. And it's already -- we've been a couple of years into managing expenses. Should we assume that if sales were to disappoint you, that you have enough of the cost that you could trim to meet your expectations -- earnings expectations?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Angie, in 2010, you remember we had a lot of weather-related revenue, and we spent a lot of that money in the fourth quarter of 2010 doing extra maintenance. We actually pulled some outages out of 2011 into 2010. And so when you do a year-over-year comparison, O&M went down. But that ability to do that, to fix the roof when the sun's out actually gives -- puts us in great shape to be more flexible on O&M as we move forward into 2012.","Thomas A. Fanning","And I think if you look at our longer-term trend, don't go year-to-year, if you went back 3 years, 4 years, I think our number's around 2.8%.","Art P. Beattie","Correct.","Thomas A. Fanning","Compounding of growth in O&M. So it's a decent number.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim von Riesemann with UBS.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of simple questions. The first one is on financing, if you don't mind. So back in December, Congress was considering this extension of the bonus depreciation to 100% in 2012 and then into 2013, and they are largely expected or they're expected to take it up again in February, right?","Art P. Beattie","Right.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So if it's passed, what are the sensitivities with respect to your equity needs going forward?","Art P. Beattie","All right, good question. I think the assumptions we have for bonus depreciation, assuming the 50% level, are $450 million to $600 million. And if we were to get the extra bump, we\u2019d pick up somewhere around $300 million to $400 million more, and that's just kind of rough numbers.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then incrementally into 2013, what does that look like?","Art P. Beattie","I don't have anything on '13, but it be more, and our ability to actually use it. So -- and the effect on equity would certainly reduce the effects, but we'd have to manage that as we move through time.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Second question, I'll use your phrase, \"fog on the road,\" you talked a lot about sales. Can you talk a little bit about what your customer growth expectations are?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Jim. We actually had flat customer growth last year, which is again reflective of our results in the residential and commercial side. We're expecting about 14,000 customer growth in 2012. And that again reflects the assumptions we are making on job growth within those particular areas.","Thomas A. Fanning","It's hard to mention that, in the good old days, back when I was CFO, we had something like, growth of like 50,000 customers a year. Our number this year, we're projecting like 15,000, round numbers. And customers were flat last year or have even -- some people had slightly negative. Remember, we had these enormous tornadoes go through Alabama, for example, that have devastated a lot of dwelling. And so, we had some effect, you've got to kind of look through those numbers to see what was the tornado effect. But anyway, so 15,000 is kind of what we're expecting out of a normal number of 50,000, but we certainly haven't been there in a couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple of things. One was, I think some of the commentary around your ability to manage a slower recovery kind of seems to have being focused on 2012. What kind of sales number do you need in that '13, '14 to kind of keep you in that growth cone, if you like? And how long do you have? And how far beyond '12 could you keep sort of moving the expense needle to keep you in that channel?","Thomas A. Fanning","That's an interesting question. I suppose, normally, what you have seen with Southern is variability. Remember, we went through all of these other factors. It's not just economic growth, it's weather and a variety of other things, right? If you saw sustained low-economic growth, likely that would have some impact on the stress on your system and a variety of other things. In other words, you're not running your plants as hard, you're not having to stress on the wires part of the business, et cetera. So there is some correlation, if you will, between a slowing economy and a slowing O&M spend rate, number one. Number two, the folks that run our business that make, move and sell electricity, do a terrific job in thinking about the optionality of best bang for the buck with every dollar they spend on their base level of expenditure. And then they have very clear ideas as revenues start to appear with the variability of weather, where they spend it and where we get the best bang for the buck. The truth in that shows up in operating statistics, our industry-leading EFOR, our now more than 10-year trajectory of great performance in our transmission and distribution business. My sense is, Jonathan, through the period, I think we can handle, within the range that we've given you, a sustained very low-growth economy. Where wouldn't we, if that's your question. Where...","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Tom, can I just frame the question a little differently, like how much of the 4%, if you like, is coming out of capital spend and environmental? And how much is coming from just organic growth in the business? Could that frame it a little better?","Thomas A. Fanning","I don't know. So how much of the low end of the range? The low end of the range will be hit if you have bad economic growth, milder weather and low CapEx. That's kind of how you get there. To the extent CapEx picks up, to the extent you have better weather, you're going to be in a different spot.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Add to that low -- the economic growth you'd define as?","Thomas A. Fanning","Like 0.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's clear. Can I ask on one other topic?","Thomas A. Fanning","Sure.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could you give us a sense of whether your contracted position on coal look sort of any different going into 2012, than say it did going into 2011? And a sense at these kind of very low gas prices, how much incremental kind of shift on the system we could see from coal to gas and probably due to contract and price?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, look, we've been very kind of transparent in the past. We've got some really interesting stuff to talk about here. In the fourth quarter, wait, let me back up, 4 years ago, or way back when I was doing CFO or COO even, we were about 70% of our energy from coal, and about, I don't know, 16% from nuclear, about 12% from gas and the balance from hydro. In the fourth quarter, this was really surprising to me, -- maybe not surprising considering how cheap gas is now -- our energy production was 40% coal, 39% gas. I used to say, we would reach a 40-40 split sometime after 2015. Well, sure enough, we hit it in the fourth quarter of '11. Now moving forward, given where gas prices are, we will continue to see much more gas production, so it'll become more important. In terms of how we're managing our fuel stocks, we have already, going back into '11, started thinking about in light of what may come down the road with HAPs MACT, now MATS and a variety of other issues associated with new regulations out of EPA started putting more optionality into contracts, shortening up the term of those contracts and thinking about how to be flexible in transportation arrangement. So all of that is being taken into account. Kind of what I used to say 4 years ago would have been that if you looked at our weighted average coal supply, we were kind of in the 3.5 to 4-year range, remember it was 100% committed in the year and then it would go to 80% and 60% and 40% and all that. Imagine that being shrunken a bit, so it's shorter in its duration and it is probably more flexible in any given year. So what may be 100% today, maybe 60% tomorrow, may be 40%, maybe 20%. So we've already started working all that through the system. Is that okay?","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Tom, do you think you could go north of 40% gas in Q1 here? It sounds like you've put it on the threshold?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, you were on the threshold. Time will tell.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two easy, two quick questions for you. One, Art, have you ever framed what your EPS sensitivity as to every 1% change in retail load? That's the first one. And the second one is, do you think you're at the early stages when it comes to residential and small commercial usage in terms of a structural change in the kind of the megawatt hour demand versus GDP correlations?","Thomas A. Fanning","I got the last one. You get the first.","Art P. Beattie","The first question was sensitivity to 1% change in sales? Was that it, Michael?","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, that is it. If sales was 1% higher or lower than forecast.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, I gave them revenue before.","Art P. Beattie","Right, it depends on how it's spread, Michael. If you do it across all classes, it's about $98 million in revenue and if you assume that you don't mitigate it in some way in your spending side, then it would be about $0.075.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay.","Art P. Beattie","Okay?","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Thank you. And on the other item?","Thomas A. Fanning","So on the other item, that was the relationship between GDP growth and electric sales, right?","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, especially for res and small commercial.","Thomas A. Fanning","This is fun. I love this stuff. So we argue with each other all the time what's going on here, and we had used in the past a relationship -- it has really born its math. It carries its water as a theory. But that you should look at electricity sales as about 60% of GDP growth. Now what we've done here in our projections is use a number like 50%, not 60%. So we, in our normal conservative nature, backed off a little bit. But there's a very interesting development in our numbers. As we were peeling the onion, getting ready for this call, there is an interesting trend. If you look at usage, usage is flat among our customers, particularly in residential and commercial. And there is always this interesting question about, \"What's the penetration of energy efficiency?\" And yet usage was flat. One of the things that we're debating right now is this idea that the economy is actually getting more electrified, if you will. That as the economy grows, more and more of the energy share is going to electricity-driven technology. And I think you can see that with these beautiful plasma screen TVs and iPhones and iPads and all the other stuff we have. So that's kind of interesting. So what you may see is maybe some energy efficiency, certainly as you replace an air-conditioner, you got a more efficient air-conditioner. So I think you're seeing share of electricity as a part of GDP growth grow and some effect on either active or passive energy efficiency. So the relationship appears to be constant. But the components within the relationship appear to be changing. Fascinating stuff.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nathan Judge with Atlantic Equities.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","Just on general kind of macro question here. As we look across the United States and there's been a lot more gas, natural gas coming to market than some had expected, at least I had a year ago, it seems to be continually -- the price was continually falling. Just thinking about how that relates to your CapEx forecast and options as it relates to what you do as far as EPA-related retrofits and how close are we -- for you instead of using a backhouse, you can perhaps convert some more old plants into nat gas plants?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, sure. Piece of cake. So let's kind of dive through that a bit. So of the 12,000-megawatt, those are our flagship unit, Bowen, Scherer, Miller, some are Wansley, some are Barry, et cetera. Those will vary. The maximum amount of baghouses I think we're considering right now is 17. As we suggested, there could be a variable nature of that. We may require less, which gives us the spread that we try to indicate to you, and please let me reinforce with the community out there, we're trying to give you the best estimate we can. There is still a significant amount of uncertainty there, okay, number one. Number two, when you think about the expansion plans going forward, remember that one of the advantages we have being in an integrated regulated market as opposed to the so-called organize markets or merchant markets, is that we are able to account for expansion planning as a portfolio, and we are able to iterate around optimal solutions between the types of generation and transmission solutions, and they are iterative. So when I think about what's in front of us here, remember, that some of our portfolio divisions have already been cast. That is 1,000 megawatts or so from Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4, McDonough, 2,500 megawatts or a little bit more. Georgia Power is out for a solicitation, marginally it's going to be gas, I think of around 1,500 megawatts. That's coming a little bit later. We have Kemper County in Mississippi, which is going to have an environmental signature better than or equivalent to natural gas, 582 megawatts. Remember some time ago we moved Plant Miller, one of the greatest coal plants in America in terms of efficiency and cost profile to our customers into -- moved it away from wholesale into retail. So Alabama is pretty well spoken for. So those decisions have already been made, so what you're talking about is really decisions around the margin. In other words, shutting down, mothballing, whatever the right word is, 4,000-megawatt, that kind of appears to be a dominant solution right now. We'll see. And then of the 3,200 megawatts we talked about, in more specificity, what we have said is, likely candidates for that are: older, smaller, coal units that currently don't have SCRs or scrubbers that will be converted into rather high heat rate units like 10,000 to 11,000 heat-rate gas-fired units. Would we do more of that? No. That's about the right level, I think. And there's not a lot of future bandwidths for variability in how we had to the system going forward. There's going to be some around the edges, but I wouldn't expect big changes. As I suggested to you, we're already committed on a portfolio that we think meets all the needs of our customers in a clean, effective, low-cost way.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","That's very, very thorough. Just as it then pertains onto the nuclear plant, could you provide some type of timeline or some type of idea what risks there are if -- I'm not suggesting there it will be, but let's say in 6 months\u2019 time or a year time or whatever it may be, investors should start looking at the NRC's lack of giving this COL out as being concerning?","Thomas A. Fanning","In my opinion, either the delay, whatever, of the COL, the reason we haven't gotten it -- it's imminent at any day, whatever you believe about that, that shouldn't be concerning at all. In the bigger scope of things, like I said before, I think I applaud the process we've gone through. Do I wish it's gone quicker? Sure, but I think given the scope, given the timeframe, I think you're kind of quibbling around the edges here. I think it's more important to get it right and have all the parties involved either completed satisfied, and that's where we are. Recall, too, that the process that we follow in building Vogtle 3 and 4 is a commercial relationship between us and the consortium that is Toshiba, Westinghouse, Shaw. Recall, too, that we have a very transparent relationship with our commission, independent evaluator, the staff, the PSC itself. And recall, too, that from the time the plant was originally certified, we have delivered to the customers of Georgia Power company over $1 billion of incremental value. Remember and recall that it takes kind of 4 forms. One is, the fact that we had a variable contract, and we fixed portions of that contract, and you can look at our disclosure because otherwise it's protected under our commercial agreement. Secondly, that we got loan guarantees. Third, that we got CWIP that will inure to the benefit of our customers by about $300 million. And fourth, CWIP -- production tax credit, that's the other one. And I even think we're reasonably conservative there because remember the production tax credit amount was dependent upon how many nuclear projects were going to get built. Well, it's often SCANA it looks like. So I think our estimate there is conservative. So when we say that we've delivered over $1 billion of value and you do recall that, that is part of the testimony in the August proceedings in front of the Georgia Public Service Commission, I think we're in great shape. I think the Vogtle project Units 3 and 4 are going to deliver tremendous value and I think that is shared by the people in the state of Georgia.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","If I could just redirect that question, could you just give us a milestone and perhaps a magnitude of -- and I appreciate that, unfortunately, some of the investors including myself don't have clarity into the processes as some do, and I just wanted to see if there's a milestone that we could look to. I just take it in consideration of what you said in, I think in your Analyst Day as about being year-end and we're just past that now."," --","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, but I mean, okay, look, it's a 10-year project and the delay has been about a month. Remember the DCD was real important. We got 5-0 vote on the design. I wouldn't attach a lot of angst to the delay of the COL. We still have -- we've been able to work through the LWAB. Remember we put in the LWAA, and we still have 1,000 people or more on-site, they're doing productive work. We have been able to work within those structures in order to be efficient and effective. Recall, too, we talked about, when we say that all thresholds are achievable, that is in relation to cost and schedule. We have flexibility going forward. How we decide to execute that flexibility in some respects is a commercial matter between us and a consortium and us and our regulators. So I wouldn't personally feel angst about where we are right now. I actually think that the project is doing great.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","Great. And just if I may one...","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, I'm sorry, was that responsive? Can I hit anything else specific? We have milestones, yes, you mentioned milestone. One of the things that will be interesting as we go forward will be the development of what they call ITAACS. It's an acronym for some I-T-A-A-C-S and I never remember what that stands for. But what those are, are tests that will be developed around the systems of each of the units as we go forward, there'll be hundreds of them. So it's almost like as you're building a house. You want to test the AC system. You want to test the kitchen. You want to test the -- and so, there will be several of those going forward. And one of the challenges that we have said to ourselves in our -- and we meet regularly on this project, is to be able to talk about developing the threshold to talk about clumps maybe of systems as we go through them to let you know how progress is occurring. I think it's a very fair question. We need to kind of give you better clarity going forward. We'll work on that.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","I really appreciate that. I just have one last question. It's more of an informational question. Could you remind us how the Georgia riders work for the environmental spend, specifically as it relates to this potential up to 2 or I guess, $4.4 billion in Georgia? Is there -- more specifically, could there be regulatory lag there?","Art P. Beattie","Well, they're covered within the 3-year rate hearings that are normally -- that Georgia Power has been going through for the last 4 or 5 processes. They'll defer them if they're not covered in the last rate case until the next rate case. So if they're under construction or if they've been approved for construction, then they'll collect AFUDC and that will be the normal accounting process.","Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP","Okay. So just so -- if I do understand, if there is a fair amount of -- if there isn't [indiscernible] on those because they will have basically come in between interim rate case, is that...","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, and as I said, having been CFO at Georgia, you'd make an estimate, a forward estimate of the 3-year period essentially, and then you essentially count your rate base going forward every 3 years and it's an accounting order. The commission has shown in the past -- has shown a great deal of constructive thought as to how to recognize that over time, and we've been reasonably flexible over time. So there's a contemplation as to what it might be. To the extent there's a variance, there will be an AFUDC accrual, there will be a deferral in rate, it'll be captured in the next 3-year accounting order. Recall, too, that we have never lost $1 of expenditure associated with environmental.","Operator","Your next question comes from Leslie Rich with JP Morgan.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","I just have a quick question on fuel. So you're running your gas plants more, you're running your coal plants less, that's got to overtime, since it flows through to customers, result in some rate decreases. And I'm just wondering sort of that's a nice tailwind in terms of benefits to customers. Is that going to be happening? Has it been happening in '11? And do we see a big adjustment there in 2012?","Art P. Beattie","Leslie, this is Art. If you look at the balance of unrecovered fuel around the system, I guess Georgia's got the biggest balance at $130 million or so, $137 million under recovered, and to the degree their benefit from increased gas burn, that balance will be mitigated sooner than they expected. So -- but no word yet on when that fuel rate will change for customers. Mississippi, actually, they're commission approved a fuel rate reduction this month, a few weeks ago, that will begin in April, I believe, about $22 million. Alabama has under recovered about $31 million, so I wouldn't expect anything immediately there and Gulf has actually over recovered about $10 million. So it just depends on the company and when the -- what the balance is and when the commission will take action on it.","Thomas A. Fanning","But, you know, it's so fascinating. So John Row [ph] and I got into this at one time. Southern Company benefits by low-energy prices. It's good for our customers; it's good for our us. We pass through the benefits of the lowest land [ph] that we can offer. And to the extent gas prices remain low, that is great for us and great for our customers.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","And then does it have incremental positive benefits for Southern Power? Are those units, to the extent that they are not fully hedged, can they run more?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, you bet. I'd give you \u2013 [indiscernible] tag-team there but, Southern Power did better than we expected, significantly in 2011 as a result of that. Their energy margins were substantially higher. And we have designed that company to be gas-fired in the Southeast, and so as there are issues relating to retirement of assets in the Southeast and gas becomes a dominant solution, the ability for Southern Power to sustain its performance on energy margins and grow more, they have a lot of expandability on their site. We think it plays right into their strike zone.","Art P. Beattie","Yes. And Leslie, if you look at capacity factor of Southern Power's combined-cycle units, they were up 10% year-over-year. And if you look at the capacity factor in the fourth quarter, I believe some of them were up in the 70, mid-70 range.","Thomas A. Fanning","So in 2010 and for the year, we were 47% capacity factor. In '11, we're 57% and if you just want to look at trends in the fourth quarter, it was 65%.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Ali [ph] with Decade Capital.","Unknown Analyst","Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. Jonathan Arnold was talking about getting to the bottom end of your growth rate, and you said you have to have lower CapEx. Is that just base CapEx?","Thomas A. Fanning","It'd be lower everything. I mean, however it is, it's hard to -- you don't want to ever get in the business of tracing dollars. If we were substantially lower than what we're projecting, so we're projecting $18.4 billion over 3 years. I mean, I don't know what number would have to be to fall out. We described mild weather. We described no growth in the economy. We described less CapEx. That's kind of how you get there.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. And it looks like base CapEx applies around 7% rate base growth?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And Southern Power, are they experiencing any pressures from lower commodities or CSAPR delay in '12?","Thomas A. Fanning","Southern Power benefits from lower commodities. Remember the way we structured their contracts. We have this very kind of well-developed notion here that risk matters as much as return in creating value. And so, when we thought about at the inception of Southern Power, we set up on a set of contracts that served us very well over time. That is, for any contract they enter into, it really has 2 segments. One segment deals with return on brick-and-mortar investment, and which is known over time through the length of the contract. The other deals with largely energy win, and largely that's a fuel pass-through to the customers. So when you think about the economic model of their contract business, it was very much like an integrated regulated utility. Okay? They do have the ability to earn some margins above what we projected in the base case should we sustain this low-commodity environment. That's what happened in '11.","Unknown Analyst","Got you. Okay, I'm just a little bit, I guess, not confused, but curious why the bottom end of the CAGR dropped if all these things point to at least sticking to what it was in...","Thomas A. Fanning","Gosh, I hope we didn't confused people. If you go to the original projection we gave you on 5% to 7%, it was based off of 2010 and, in fact, we are exactly there. We haven't deviated a bit. When you look now at '12, so just from '10 to '11 to '12, if you use '12 as a new base instead of '10, we are projecting guidance in the top half of that range. So the math of staying within that range -- so if we're in the top half of the range, the top remains 7%. If you want to go to the bottom side of the range, 5% goes to 4% because we're in the top half. It is exactly where we've been, it just uses a different base.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So we shouldn't be reading into this if there's any more increment risk than there was...","Thomas A. Fanning","No, not at all. In fact, I would argue there's incremental benefit. If you go to the slide in the package, you have a wonderful picture of what I'm talking about. Let me just say it a different way. The math is -- we are exactly where we said we would be way back in 2010, except that, because we're starting the top half of that cone of uncertainty, we may be in the near term better off.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a clarification. You mentioned that there could be a change within the published and the final rule. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on that?","Thomas A. Fanning","See Cross State.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Oh, just Cross State?","Thomas A. Fanning","No, no, no, that's the example.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, that was the example. Okay, I was thinking...","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, from the time you get a proposed rule to a final rule, you think you kind of know where you are. But from the final rule to the printed rule, to the published rule, there could be some minor tweaks. We saw that in CrossSstate. So I can't sit here and tell you today that what has been put forth as the final rule, until it is finally published, is going to be, in fact, the same.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, I got you. But when you say minor changes, I mean, I know that minor changes can mean big things. How should we think about, I mean, in other words, I mean, are you thinking -- I guess, I was just wondering is there a potential chance that this could change a lot or?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, I mean, if you ask Energy Future Holdings where Texas became part of the printed rule under Cross State, it was major to them, it wasn't major to us. It just depends on what the tweaks might be.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But no clarity on that?","Thomas A. Fanning","No, no idea what might change between now and the published rule.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, I thought there might be something.","Thomas A. Fanning","And Paul, one more thing, if I could just add to people. There is still uncertainty in the final rule. For example, in the startup and shutdown, there's all kinds of language in there about standard work practices and a variety of other things. Really understanding what that means will have some bearing on compliance. So there still needs to be clarity even though we have a final rule.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then with the -- just to clarify some things here, you guys obviously had no customer growth, I mean flat customer growth last year. Is that right? Nobody, no increase in customers at all?","Thomas A. Fanning","Correct. It was marginally negative, I think...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And this was...","Thomas A. Fanning","And you can write that off to storms and stuff.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. That's a good -- okay. So in other words, you had storms that knocked people out, I guess, is that what you mean?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, yes. If you recall the tornadoes that went through Tuscaloosa, that was a big deal. And I think one of the dynamics in housing that we're looking for, a normal unsold housing inventory in our area would be around 2%, 3%, 2%, 4%. We're kind of 3.5% right now in the Southeast. So what we got to do is make sure that we eat into that inventory over time.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, in terms of what, occupied houses, is that what you mean?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So we're not like -- you're not concerned about a housing price rebalance. We're not talking anything like that?","Thomas A. Fanning","No, no, no.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I just want to make sure. And when you say 15,000, 14,000, 15,000 customers, I'd assume this is pretty much residential customers. Is that what we're talking about here?","Thomas A. Fanning","Oh, yes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, and what is that as a percentage of just -- of a growth rate? What would that equate to?","Thomas A. Fanning","So if usage is flat, it's going to be like, I'm looking around the table, 1%, maybe.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So it's got 1% customer growth...","Thomas A. Fanning","Let us get back to you on that. Let's get back to you on that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I mean, what I'm sort of just trying to figure out here is that basically, if I understand you guys, you guys are basically looking at 2.5% growth rate in your service territory in the Southeast, in general, is that right? And that's equating into about 1.3% retail sales growth rate, is that sort of roughly how we should think about this?","Thomas A. Fanning","Say that again? I'm sorry.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","You got 1.3% growth and you mentioned that you were using I guess of an algorithm that basically came up to 50% GDP growth equals that, right? So I'm just saying, so you're basically using like a 2.5%, a little more than that for what you're expecting will happen in GDP, is that right?","Thomas A. Fanning","That is exactly right. Correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And -- okay.","Thomas A. Fanning","And the growth in customers is 0.4%.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Customer growth is 0.4% that you guys expect.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And so really what you're expecting is a rebound in usage and that's being driven by people feeling better about the economy, is that how we should think about that?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, if that...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Leaving industrial customers out, I mean...","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, yes. It's people moving out of apartments into homes. So usage goes ways up, but that's really just a factor of more homes getting occupied.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gordon Howald with Doyle Trading Consulting.","Gordon Howald","This has been kind of touched upon, but I'm going to ask you maybe in a little bit of a different way, looking for different answer. I recognize all the uncertainty surrounding what the final regulatory EPA rules will be and what natural gas and power prices will ultimately be. But could you provide some color on the EPA-related CapEx? What could the financial impact be on customer bills for that incremental $4.4 billion number that you put out there on a percentage basis, less than 15%, greater than 15%, any color on that?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, we've been pretty consistent with this and I'm sorry I'm going to be a little vague just because we don't know yet, it depends on what state you're in and all that. But what we have said is that after all of these expenditures cleared in service, you're talking about 10% to 20% across the United States, depending on where you live.","Gordon Howald","Right. That's fair. And could you give me a little color on what the base environmental spending is over the next 3 years?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, we'll get you that in a sec. And when I gave you that 10% to 20% remember, I go back to something I said earlier. It's always hard to point out one rule. You really have to look at the consequence of all rules and the change in your generation and transmission expansion plans and the whole bit. All of that has to be taken into account.","Gordon Howald","Absolutely.","Thomas A. Fanning","Okay, Art?","Art P. Beattie","Well, the base environmental is on this slide, I believe, and it's about $1.5 billion over the next 3 years. But it would include the completion of projects that are under construction now. I believe a lot of those are in Georgia and some in Mississippi as well.","Gordon Howald","So essentially spending that you would have done irregardless of -- that you would have done even without EPA proposed regulations, such as CSAPR, which has obviously been stayed, and just things that you would have done anyway?","Art P. Beattie","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","Can I ask a slightly different question? Can you just tell us what the rate base growth is from '12 to '14?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, it\u2019s 7% to 8%.","Ashar Khan","7% to 8%.","Thomas A. Fanning","Per year, but it's lumpy. And it's lumpy.","Ashar Khan","So in the 2 years from '12 to '14 on -- it grows by, if I can just say, like 15%, is that correct from '12 to '14?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes. I mean, if you just do 7% to 8% per year and it's a little lumpy. So yes. Round numbers, you're right.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And that includes the environmental? Or that doesn't include the environmental, that number?","Thomas A. Fanning","It does not. The environmental will be incremental with that.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So the environmental, if I'm right, if you include then the higher end, then how much does it become?","Thomas A. Fanning","So there's -- I don't know. It would clear after in service. So a lot of the environmental will clear in service after '14. So we'll be having AFUDC and a variety of other things. But in terms of rate base growth, which is a different question, that will clear when it goes into service. So a lot of that would be after '14.","Ashar Khan","Okay. But you would get AFUDC positive impact, right?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, yes, yes.","Ashar Khan","So then Tom, what then is, I guess, because we are cash flow deficient, so I guess we can use a rule that we are losing like 2% or 3% of that growth in the earnings because of being a cash flow negative company, is that correct? Is that the way we should kind of like think through this thing going forward?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, I wouldn't think about it that way. I mean, let's -- at a practical matter, when you look at Southern Company, you go operating cash, less dividends, you look at CapEx, we kind of look cash flow negative, but that's because we're growing. We're getting AFU -- I mean, we getting CWIP on Vogtle. We're getting CWIP on Kemper County Plant Ratcliffe. So either it's been contemplated in a forward mechanism, so that would be Georgia, or in Alabama and in Mississippi, we have annual mechanisms, which capture this stuff and those are forward-looking. So it depends on what jurisdiction you're talking about. But they generally self-regulate. In other words, to the extent you spend more in Alabama, the next series of RSE would pick it up.","Ashar Khan","So -- what I'm trying to get from is that if you take the average growth rate, there's a discrepancy between rate base growth and the EPS growth. What would you attribute that to? Are you -- some are producing as regulatory lag, is that what you're saying? I'm just trying to get a more precise way to -- what are the reasons between the 2% to 3% difference between the 2?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, as you grow assets, you're going to grow some O&M and you're also going to have shares involved, right? More shares supporting it, that drags down -- the relationship between adding assets to rate base is always a function of how much more O&M do you have, you have more depreciation as a result of more assets, but you have more shares supporting the mix of capital supporting every dollar of investment. So you can't just say that a 9% rate base growth equates to 9% EPS.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So basically, it's a function of -- it's really that your -- as the rate base is growing, are ROEs on that rate base, actually earned ROEs are declining over that period of time?","Thomas A. Fanning","No, no, no. It's not earned ROEs. It's the revenue requirement calculation on any investment. That really is constant. So if you -- go ahead, Art.","Art P. Beattie","The forward-looking rate mechanism address a lot of that. As it goes into rate base, it's either -- it's picked up by rate mechanisms and it's earned upon.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, there's no, we're not missing anything, anywhere. In fact, if you think about it, if you contemplate Georgia's structure as a 3-year forward look when it's put into place, so it renews itself every 3 years to the extent you miss your projection, it's deferred and you earn AFUDC on it. Alabama is forward-looking and adjusts annually, [indiscernible] is forward-looking and adjusts annually. I guess the only other one you would think about is Gulf, Gulf's in the middle of a rate case.","Ashar Khan","No, I understand that. I'm just thinking through it. Tom, I guess EIX says they can grow earnings equal to rate base. I guess, they don't do any equity and they haven't done equity for 14 to 10 years, I don't know how long. Con Ed can't do it because they have to do equity. So I'm thinking if Southern is getting bigger and bigger and the CapEx needs are becoming bigger and bigger, I guess the ability to be able to grow earnings equal to rate base is now becoming more difficult because of the larger CapEx that is kind of like coming in because we have to issue equity to kind of finance it, and I'm just trying to think through the paradigm.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, Ashar, it hasn't changed. This has been the relationship at Southern. Go back and look at our rate base growth over time, we'll be glad to kind of take you off-line and go through the numbers. But our rate base growth has always exceeded our earnings per share growth for a variety reasons that we talked about, depreciation, shares, a variety of other things other than that. We'll be glad to take you through that. There's nothing changing in Southern. This is a constant relationship.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Could you have alternatively recast your growth rate by keeping it on a 2010 base but saying 6% to 7% off of that base? Would that have been the same in the same situation...","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, what we would have said is 5% to 7%. You're reflecting the fact that we're in the top half of that range. I mean, conceivably you could go there, but we're conservative. We like to have enough spread to accommodate a challenged economy, worries about Europe, a variety of other things. But yes, I mean, you're catching the point. If you start with '10, we are at 5% to 7%. And we're in the top half, that's where you come up with 6% to 7%. All we're trying to do is just use a more recent base.","Art P. Beattie","Yes, we just recharacterized the same growth.","Thomas A. Fanning","The math is the same. We're not guiding down on growth.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","You caught people by surprise the way you cast it.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning","No, we just want to thank everybody. I know this was a long call, but we always respect the fact that you guys are interested enough to call in and listen to our story, and we thank you for your interest. And hopefully, you found the time valuable. I know we did. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

My name is Marion. I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company\u2019s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, October 30, 2019.","I will now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Gammill","Thank you, Marion. Good morning, and welcome to Southern Company's third quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Tom Fanning","Good morning and thank you all for joining us.","This morning, we reported strong earnings per share substantially above our estimate. Year-to-date earnings through September have also exceeded our expectations and the fourth quarter is off to a strong start for our electric utilities with unseasonably warm temperatures in early October. Drew will further discuss our earnings results and expectations in a few minutes.","Before providing you with an update on our progress at the Vogtle site, I want to highlight our outstanding operational performance this quarter. We experienced record heat in the Southeast this summer, recording all-time September peak load days, four times during the month. Our electric system demonstrated resilience with record peak season generation in transmission performance, resulting in exceptional reliability for our customers.","Importantly, even amid these conditions, a diverse field mix enabled Southern Company system to reduce our carbon emissions by approximately 35% compared to the strongest demand of 2007, our benchmark year for carbon emissions.","Let's now turn to an update on Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4. The site continues to make progress as demonstrated by the achievement of several milestones during the quarter, including the start of integrated flushing activities. We remain focused on meeting the November 2021 and November 2022 regulatory approved in-service dates, and we continue to maintain an aggressive work plan on site as a tool to help position us to meet those dates. There is no change in our total estimated cost to complete the project.","Last quarter, we discussed at length the contingency we established for the project in the second quarter of 2018. Recall the total amount we established is $800 million for the entire project of which Georgia Power\u2019s share is $366 million.","For the quarter, Georgia Power has allocated $30 million of its project contingency into the base project capital cost forecast. There are a host of factors both positive and negative that go into that analysis. But the biggest factor in allocating contingency was probably increased costs forecast related to craft attraction and retention. To give you context, contingency as a proportion of the estimate to complete is larger today than when it was established 15 months ago. We continue to believe that we have sufficient contingency to meet the budget associated with the November regulatory approved in-service dates.","Overall, including engineering, procurement, and initial test plan activities, the entire project is approximately 81% complete with Unit 3 direct construction currently 77% complete. The project major milestones for 2019 have been achieved, or are expected to begin as planned later this year. We continue to successfully attract and retain craft labor. And currently, we believe, we have the resources necessary on site to support our aggressive work plan.","Over the past several quarters, we have experienced periods of fluctuation and productivity around significant startup and construction activities. This variability has resulted in a sawtooth or S-curve shape in our performance charts, an effect we discussed on our last earnings call. In August, as we started our integrated flushing activities, we saw a similar effect on Unit 3\u2019s productivity. Production levels have improved in recent weeks, and we are seeing the positive impact of a mature workforce with an increased ability to balance the needs of both construction and testing on site.","The site has averaged nearly 150,000 earned hours over the past four weeks, with two recent weeks at about 160,000 hours, a record on the site.","Cumulative CPI remains near last quarter\u2019s levels, reflecting the construction and testing balance I just mentioned.","On previous calls, we have focused on both Units 3 and 4 in the aggregate. At this point in the project, Unit 4 is progressing slightly ahead of its aggressive site plan. As you can see on Slide 7, Unit 3 construction is currently lagging its aggressive site plan. The primary driver is a backlog in the installation of electrical commodities and increased system turnover activity, trends we discussed last quarter.","Southern Nuclear and Bechtel are implementing a productivity improvement plan to address the electrical backlog. Additionally, project leadership is utilizing specialized teams to focus on commodities installation and adds further enhanced night shift efficiency and has streamlined preparation for system turnovers. These initiatives have demonstrated initial success, as I have already noted, and further improvement is expected. With these actions, we believe there is sufficient flexibility and margin in future testing and startup activities to maintain Unit 3\u2019s aggressive site plan milestone targets.","To that end, we began the start of integrated flush activities for Unit 3 in August consistent with the aggressive site plan. Integrated flush is proceeding as we expected at over 60% complete and continues to support the start of open vessel testing later this year our next major milestone expected for 2019.","Open vessel testing will continue through the first quarter of 2020 as we prepare for cold-hydro testing. Additionally, we expect to have the ability to test plant systems from the main control room before the end of the year. Each of these major milestones is important to the successful startup and operation of the plant and will lay the foundation for commercial operations.","We continue to believe that working to an aggressive site plan is the right strategy in support of our primary goal of bringing Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 online by the regulatory approved November 2021 and 2022 in-service dates. This is a very exciting time for the Vogtle project. Within a year, we expect construction to be largely complete for Unit 3 and we expect to be preparing Unit 3 for fuel load.","Consistent with past practice, we will continue to provide updates on our earnings calls and through the regulatory process as we move towards these major milestones.","I will now turn the call over to Drew to cover our quarterly performance in greater detail.","Drew Evans","Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone.","In the third quarter of 2019, we achieved earnings per share of $1.34 on an adjusted basis. That's $0.24 higher than the estimate we provided on our last call and $0.20 higher than the earnings per share on an adjusted basis reported in the third quarter of 2018. A detailed reconciliation of our report and adjusted results is included in this morning's release and earnings package.","A key driver but not the only driver of our quarterly results compared to last year was warmer than normal weather at our regulated electric utilities. Temperatures across our Southeast service territory were significantly warmer than normal during the third quarter of 2019, including the warmest September in the last 50 years, resulting in $0.09 of benefit compared to last year and $0.15 of benefit versus normal.","Emphasizing Tom's earlier remarks, our operational performance over this period of prolonged high temperatures was nothing short of extraordinary.","Excluding the impact of weather, our $0.11 increase over the prior-year was primarily driven by higher revenues at our regulated utilities. The revenue increase reflects the impacts of Tax Reform and related changes in capital structure. You will recall that the majority of tax benefits accrued to customers and we retained a portion at our regulated utilities to maintain credit metrics within those entities. The increase in revenue also reflects other pricing effects and customer growth net of changes in customer usage. All of these factors more than offset the impact of divested entities.","We've also been successful in mitigating inflation related to O&M expense as we operate more efficiently.","Taking a look at customer growth, through September, we have added over 30,000 new residential electric customers and over 21,000 residential natural gas customers across the regulated utilities. These additions put us on track to meet our full-year expectations for residential customer gains across our electric and gas franchises and are comparable to the growth we experienced in the same period last year. Customer growth continues to be driven primarily by strong job and population growth in our Southeast service territory.","For the third quarter, weather-adjusted retail electric sales were down about 2% year-over-year versus last year due to a combination of factors including continued energy efficiency, technological advancements across all customer segments, and continued weaker Industrial sales.","Industrial sales, particularly primary metals, petroleum, paper and textiles were down due to global trade concerns, as well as changes in production levels and demand response programs. These trends have persisted throughout 2019 with year-to-date electric sales down 1.7%. While the overall usage trend is negative year-over-year, it is consistent with our expectations.","Weather normalization is also less precise in these extreme circumstances and we do not foresee a significant change either positive or negative in our service territories in the near-term.","With adjusted earnings per share through September of $2.84, we expect to achieve full-year earnings at or slightly above the top-end of our guidance range of $3.10. Remember fourth quarter earnings can vary materially year-to-year due to sharing mechanisms at our regulated electric franchises that help mitigate the customer bill impacts related to extreme weather, a situation we have certainly seen to-date this year.","Turning now to some updates on our capital requirements. In early August, Southern Company completed a $1.725 billion equity units offering when combined with our year-to-date equity issuance from internal plans to approximately $625 million and projected internal equity plan issuances through the end of 2019, this offering is expected to completely satisfy Southern Company\u2019s total equity need through our five-year plan period.","We do not plan to utilize our at the money equity or ATM programs issue shares, and in 2020, we expect to begin open market purchases to satisfy the dividend reinvestment plan. Financial stability and strong credit metrics remain main top priorities for us as they provide significant benefit to our customers and investors.","Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I'd like to give you a brief update on our regulatory calendar. We started the year with a full slate of regulatory proceedings, some of which we recently concluded. Earlier this month, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase for Nicor Wet Gas including $65 million related to Nicor\u2019s multi-year pipeline infrastructure replacement program already in rates under the investing in Illinois program. New rates also include a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers. This outcome is representative of a credit supportive Illinois regulatory environment and was in line with our expectations.","Also, Virginia Natural Gas received approval to extend and expand its SAVE infrastructure replacement program with an estimated investment totaling $370 million through 2024.","In Georgia, we're in the midst of a base rate case proceeding for both Atlanta Gas Light and Georgia Power. We expect these proceedings to conclude in the fourth quarter of this year.","Further, Mississippi Power expects to file a base rate case with the Mississippi PSC before the end of the year and we'll keep you posted as that schedule evolves.","In addition to these proceedings, in September, Alabama Power filed with the Alabama Public Service Commission, a comprehensive proposal that addresses how the company is strategically planning to meet customer demand during the winter peak.","Alabama Power\u2019s proposal include 2,400 megawatts of new generation capacity, comprised of long-term power purchase agreements, acquisitions, and new constructions with an expected capital investment totaling approximately $1.1 billion. The proposed generation mix is diverse calling for 1,800 megawatts of new gas fired capacity, 400 megawatts of solar projects with paired energy storage systems, and 200 megawatts of distributed energy and demand side management. We expect all regulatory approvals to be obtained by the end of the third quarter 2020.","Tom, I will now turn the call back over to you.","Tom Fanning","Thanks Drew.","As Drew outlined, we are very busy on the regulatory front. We've demonstrated over the course of many decades that we're able to effectively manage our business to bring clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy to our customers who are at the center of everything we do.","Our regulators share these same broad goals and we are confident that the ongoing proceedings will result in outcomes that support these objectives.","Now, before we move to your questions, I'd like to highlight a few accomplishments that are in recognition for the company during the quarter. Both Alabama Power and Georgia Power were named a top U.S. utility for economic development by Site Selection Magazine. Economic development has always been a priority for our regulated utilities. And we successfully partner with state and community organizations to bring companies, jobs, and investment to the states where we operate each year.","In addition, Southern Company's been acknowledged for our leadership on transparency and disclosure. South Company\u2019s 2019 proxy statement was named the number one proxy statement in the country in the inaugural U.S. Transparency Awards, sponsored by Labrador, a global communications firm specializing in regulated disclosure documents.","We were also ranked third in the U.S. for overall disclosure by the same organization. These are all outstanding accomplishments and I am proud of our team.","As we move towards the end of the year, we're very pleased with our performance from both a financial and operational perspective and believe we are well-positioned to deliver adjusted earnings per share for the full-year at or above the top of our guidance range.","We've also completed our expected equity need through 2023. In the fourth quarter, we should have clarity on some of our remaining regulatory proceedings and will be in communication with you as these cases conclude.","We have achieved several key milestones at Vogtle and remain focused on bringing Unit 3 and 4 online by their regulatory approved dates of November 2021 and November 2022.","Thank you for joining us this morning. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","The first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Greg, good morning.","Greg Gordon","Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter.","Tom Fanning","Thanks.","Greg Gordon","Couple of questions. I know you gave us a lot of information with regard to Vogtle and we're all as pleased to hear that it's going well, but can you just clarify what you're -- what you mean when you say that for all intents and purposes now the contingency is a larger piece of the overall budget. Is that because you're doing better on sort of the expected base cost of building the plant before contingency? ","Tom Fanning","Yes, sure, Greg. I think Drew's got some great details here. I'll let him fill in the blanks on real details. That is a pretty easy concept, when you put contingency in place as we talked about last quarter it's because it's an unknown cost that you expect to spend, it\u2019s part of the official budget of the plant. As you go through, really we do this thing all the time, but just imagine every month we add-up all the positives and negatives around cost, and all the different components of the plant and we net those out. Until this quarter, we have never had the negatives kind of outweigh the positives in evaluating the contingency balance.","This minor amount of $30 million that we just pulled out now represent costs that really relate to compensation that we put in place to attract and retain especially electrical workers on the site. When you take into account how much contingency as a percent of remaining cost was in place, when we set up the budget, even accounting for the draw of $30 million against the contingency account, the percentage left for remaining construction is higher now than it was when we established contingency in the first place. Drew has some even better data there?","Drew Evans","Well, certainly difficult to add to that. I\u2019ll just say that the estimate to complete is the denominator and the contingency is the numerator. And so that ratio is now larger than when we started. I think the only other feature that's worth noting is that, if you think about time in our contingency and time, we're 25 months out from hot functional testing. So we're pretty close to construction completion --","Tom Fanning","On both units.","Drew Evans","\u2026for the delivery of Unit 3. I'm sorry, 13 months. If you look at our delivery expectation, which is November of 2021, that's 25 months. If you look at the amount of time and contingency that we maintain today, it's greater than nearly 25%. So six months over those denominators. So I think both the cost factor and the time factor give us some comfort that we can deliver within the regulatory expectation.","Tom Fanning","So Drew big as a breadbox, 24%, 25% now. What was it when we established contingency round numbers?","Drew Evans","Little less than 20%.","Tom Fanning","Yes. So you can see as a percent of total cost contingency now is higher as a percent, even accounting for the $30 million than it was when we established it. And that really is a function of time.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. I've got two more questions. One is -- it's also a little bit remarkable in that despite the record demand you had this summer but you were able to keep O&M flat in the quarter. So I mean, that's actually, to me like a pretty positive marker, can you talk to how you were able to keep O&M under control, even though you had such high levels of demand?","Tom Fanning","Let me give some kudos. Drew used to be CEO of AGL Resources, and before that he was the CFO. And when we looked in the diagnostics of that company as we are making the acquisition, he and his team there had a great track record of thinking about effective ways to deploy O&M, technology, et cetera. So he's come over, Beth Reese has come over with a key player and they're applying a lot of those concepts here.","Drew Evans","It\u2019s -- cost control is, needs to be a long-term discipline, I would say that the vast majority of what's occurring here is not smart people moving over, but really the hard work of folks that operate underlying utilities. And as folks move into rate cases, they have to be very focused on cost control; we have to remember that $1 of cost saved allows $8 worth of capital investment and improvement in modernization of our systems. And so rather than looking for large belt tightening exercise, I think the right discipline for us is to be prudent about managing inflations within our business. And that's what we're trying to demonstrate this year.","Tom Fanning","And then there's just been the big technology substitutions. You may recall that I think we led the world in local offices for so many years. And that was really important to us. But with the advent of technology, I think Georgia Power has demonstrated that without the local offices, they can still increase customer touch through technology, by over 400%. So we can remove some physical costs, improve technology and improve customer service all at the same time.","Greg Gordon","Fantastic. My final question is milestones on the Georgia Power rate case, if we're going to get to a point where we can settle it, what's the usual cadence of that and how do you get to an answer that hopefully retains the integrity of the ROE band that you're currently put at risk\/opportunity for achieving in light of the initial staff position being such a low ROE number.","Tom Fanning","Yes. And Greg, you've been following us for 100 years, I think and so many of you on the phone have as well. Yes, look we've had this three-year rate process, the accounting order process in place in Georgia, since 1995. And I think every three years since 1995, we've gone through this process. The staff does what the staff does, and they'll - it's funny, we kind of went back and looked at prior iterations of these rate cases, what they've done in terms of their recommendation is not all that different than what they've done in the past. Look, let the process continue, typically in the past I think we've reached an agreement right before the Christmas holidays, I expect that will be the case this time.","Greg Gordon","Thanks guys, great quarter, congrats.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Michael, how are you?","Michael Weinstein","Hi, good morning. I'm doing good, how are you doing?","Tom Fanning","Terrific.","Michael Weinstein","Glad to hear. Hey, could you talk a little bit more about the low or the negative weather normalized sales growth on the electric territories? And whether that -- you think that that's kind of something that's maybe shaping up for the future as well or is this something that's only affecting this year, maybe next year?","Tom Fanning","Yes, I'm going to turn this over to Drew in a second. I'm going to offer my comment. If you look across the board, I always like to take kind of a mega look at this. When we saw these numbers, we said part of this is an adjustment for weather normal with the extreme weather we had, those adjustments are always subject to second guessing.","The other one, if you remember, and Mike, you\u2019re around go back to 2018, we had surprisingly high increases in retail sales. And in fact, I just have the numbers in front of me, for the same period for 2018, we were 1.7% up, this year we were negative 2.7%. In terms of residential, we were 1.9% up this time we were 1.9% down essentially flat over two years. Commercial, we were 1.1% up here a little bit down; Industrial we were 2.3% up now we\u2019re 3.3% down. My view is if you take a longer view, these sales are kind of within the range of expectations. There's a whole lot going on right now also in terms of the Industrial economy.","One of the things I always love to talk about is Industrial development, economic development, always kind of consider that the headlights. As we talk about a lot, capital investment, long-term investment, loves calm waters; they love nice stable environments in which to invest. While our economic development projects are about the same, or maybe 5% less year-over-year, but still a good number, the amount of long-term capital associated with our economic development backlog is down a lot around a half and the jobs associated with that are down a lot about a half. And you get into these arguments. Well, is this a function of the Fed, is it trade policy, is it -- I really think that long-term investment on the part of our customers is taking a breather.","It's kind of plateaued out a bit really as a function of the trade issue going on the skirmish, whatever you want to call it. When we pass new tax law, when we had the advent of smarter regulation, there was an enormous breath of oxygen in the economy and we took off. My sense is pending the resolution of the trade skirmishes and maybe even the election year in 2020, I think we have the ability of sustained economy going forward or not, we'll see.","Drew Evans","It's probably the only thing I'd add is, the way we plan long-term or have been planning in the more recent term for sales growth has been around an expectation that our customer accounts particularly residential would grow by about 1% a year. We offset that with the expectation that efficiencies will be persistent and that will lose, used for customer at about the same rate, maybe something a little bit less. This quarter actually this year-to-date, we\u2019re down about 1.7% in total sales across all three customer classes. And I don't know if we've detailed them for you in the slides, but it's effectively nine-tenths in residential, 1.7% in commercial and about 2.5% in Industrial.","This weather normalization is something that we have to construct internally; it is based on linear regression to be completely nerdy about it. And we've moved into non-linear portions of weather experience, which just means that we've hit some extremes. And some, I'm pretty certain that what we're seeing is maybe just a little bit of dissociation from our curves and not so much a result.","If you look at last year, we saw about a 1.4% increase in retail sales through the third quarter that probably had the same sort of feature in that, maybe averaging these two years gives us a better indication of what's happening in our economy.","Residential and commercial in particular, I think we're probably just seeing normal or expected declines in these areas.","In the Industrial segment, probably since the fourth quarter of last year, we have seen Industrial production which doesn't have sort of a weather feature, migrate a bit down over the past maybe four or five quarters, as Tom said, probably due to a little bit of uncertainty and some trade headwinds. But we also have to remember that these are off of pretty significant highs in terms of levels of production at the end of 2018. And so these are just trends that we're monitoring. I would suggest that we look maybe more toward full-year, weather usage as normalization will become a bit more normalized, and that'll help us get a better understanding of how we're budgeting for next year.","Tom Fanning","Hey, one last comment following-in Drew's nerdy comments. As I was with the Fed for so many years, one of the things I love to look at is essentially the first derivative of change. And the momentum statistics in other words, evaluating how the numbers were changing over time also indicate it\u2019s kind of plateauing. I don't know when this will resolve itself trading, the trade wars or whether it's the Election, but of the top 10 industrial sectors, year-over-year, you've seen about five of them go negative. So there is negative momentum. About three of them are flat, and about two of them are positive. And the two that are positive, are just less negative year-over-year. So I think all that data serves to underscore the fact that we are in a bit of a pause. And I think the pause can be resolved. So we'll see.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, one last question. Could you just go over maybe what your future plans are at Southern Power? Are there going to be more asset sales coming or we kind of settle down at this point?","Tom Fanning","Well, we've always been in the posture of recycling capital. I think if you look at our track record, broadly from an M&A standpoint, we bought well, and we've sold well. And we always look for opportunistic ways to improve shareholder value. What is it we reallocate about $500 million a year, that's way off of where we were? We had then about a $1.5 billion allocation a year, we've cut that now by two-thirds down to $500 million.","But you want to know something? A lot of that is a function of the market. We really see a tremendous amount of competition in the market with shorter terms on we love long-term bilateral contracts, those are getting shorter, and the margins are getting narrower. So when we look at the balance of capital allocation, I think, going forward for the next, I don't know three to five years, we're 93-plus-percent allocating to our core franchise businesses.","We think on a risk adjusted data that's more attractive in the so-called certainly the organized markets or even the renewables markets right now. We'll keep our eye on it. But that's our posture.","Drew Evans","Yes, Michael, it's fair to say, a lot of the work that we did last year was simplification of that business structure. And so we tried to get rid of assets that weren't gas assets that were not within our core service territory. Some of those things that we did around wind and solar were optimization of capital deployments, but not outright sale of assets. I think more importantly, we've just recently announced the purchase of Skookumchuck which is a wind generating asset; we're still very interested in investment in renewables. But as Tom said, we're going to be focused on the risk adjusted returns on those investments and be very careful of -- about what meets our threshold.","Tom Fanning","And it's just narrower than it was.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","The next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning.","Tom Fanning","Hey Julien, how are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great, thank you. Hey, so just wanted to follow-up on a couple little details here. First up, as you think about where you're tracking in terms of dates here, just want to be extra clear heard your commentary about Unit 4, how that's going fairly well. How do you think about the main date for Unit 3 here? Just want to clarify here, given all your more constructive commentary?","Tom Fanning","Yes, the site continues to work towards the aggressive plan. We have always characterized the main schedules, both for Unit 3 and 4 as aggressive. Okay, we think that is the right way to run the site. Steve Kuczynski, the CEO of our Nuclear business, Glen Chick, the guy that really runs the project day-to-day, believe that\u2019s still achievable. It is aggressive and we remain committed to that kind of work plan on site.","I always want to remind people, our regulatory approved dates are November. And I think I've been famous for saying this in the past. If we hit those dates, we hit anything before that Ticker Tape parade time. But we think this approach of keeping an aggressive posture on sites avails us margin to achieve ultimately our regulatory approved dates.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And I want to understand a little bit more on the contingency. So it sounds like the $30 million here the small utilization is more for construction and some of the higher costs to keep the qualified individuals around. But when I think about contingency conceptually here, as we pivot a little bit, should we think about that principally being allocated towards some of these in-service criteria and achieving those on time and on budget. And then even within that, can you clarify how are you thinking about these in-service criteria? Which of these processes or ITAAC should we be following or asking you or paying attention to most closely as best you see it?","Tom Fanning","Well, let me hit ITAAC first. I can remember geez three or four years ago, as we talked through this thing, we had ITAACs out there as one of the big risks. Now, let me underscore this. ITAAC must be done before we fuel-load okay, so it must be done. But I would say the work of the team in conjunction with the NRC over the years has brought that into a less risky posture. In other words, I believe we have a sound plan working with our regulator to achieve those milestones.","So when I think about the top 10 risks on the project, I don't think ITAACs are there right now. I think we see our way through, we're making great progress. You may remember, we started a concept called UIS. But essentially, ITAAC that are complete except for the results of a test that has been very effective in reducing the byways of testing that must be done.","So, I guess the other comment I would just make and I guess this goes to the contingency question. When we set that estimate in place, I guess it was July of 2018 that included for the whole project of $800 million contingency. There were actually buckets of contingency elsewhere like Bechtel has their own, we have our own. This is the one that we've called out specifically. And this is where the $30 million applies, Georgia Power dollars alone. And we call also that when we made this draw this $30 million, this is an evaluation, not of current period, but expected future period costs. So it is all the costs that we know about right now through the completion of the project that resulted in a $30 million draw. So I think we're in good shape, if that answered your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Or maybe clarify that, you're using this for construction and labor costs, but with respect to some of these in-service criteria, and just achieving those milestones, you feel pretty good. You haven't used any contingency. But should we be expecting updates on contingency to be principally focused on the in-service or the construction side of this, if one can buy anything?","Tom Fanning","I mean there's buckets everywhere. And so when we did the $800 million plus everything else I mentioned that, Bechtel may have or we may have in our hip pocket somewhere. That includes a schedule that concludes in November and includes all known future costs through November, okay.","Drew Evans","I think the only couple components I would add are that when we do a re-estimate of costs, it is a mark to completion of both facilities. And so we're estimating what we think it will take to complete both Units 3 and 4. And so this is not just a feature for the unit in the near, the Unit 3 in the near-term. In the end, though, Julien, money, time is money. And so a lot of contingency as we progress will be related to the amount of time, it will take to complete the project. That's -- I don't know that there are any expectations that there are system components that wind-up being more expensive than estimated.","Tom Fanning","The only thing I would reinforce though, is when we set that budget, that budget was set for November. So to the extent you finish sooner than November, you get pickups. That saves money.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hello Praful, thank you for joining us.","Praful Mehta","Yes, great call and great quarter. So congratulations. Just had a couple of quick questions, maybe just touching on Vogtle again, as you decide on trying to hit the November deadline and you have additional money to spend maybe to hit that earlier deadline versus allowing it to slip to November or it guess hit the November deadline. How do you choose on the cost side like are you looking to invest more to hit the earlier deadline the May deadline? Are you willing to allow the November deadline or target to kind of get to that and conserve on the cost side?","Tom Fanning","Well, it's any and all right, Drew said it a second ago, time is money. When you think about the hotel costs of personnel on the site, and the work that must be done. To the extent you're able to improve schedule, it takes a lot of cost to exceed the cost of time. So it's pretty much a dominant solution. If we can advance the calendar, if we can -- that's why we keep an aggressive site plan from that. That overwhelms generally speaking, the cost that we incur to do that. We always make an evaluation of that point however.","In other words, we're not going to do anything stupid in terms of cost, just to achieve schedule. We always balance that. But I'll just tell you, the math is pretty compelling. If you can achieve schedule performance that does a lot for cost performance, and we believe that is prudent behavior.","Praful Mehta","Got you. It makes sense, that's helpful and then maybe on the weather normalized sales, again just touching on that given you have all the CapEx plans and Alabama Power\u2019s investment as well. Do you think there's any implication on that load growth concern in terms of what that could do to bills given investment cycles and what you have going on with Alabama Power?","Drew Evans","I think that's why we've got to focus on our cost structure. I think we -- mentioned it earlier, but $1 of cost savings permits $8 worth of capital investment. Alabama in particular, I think is proposing a resource mix that's important for meeting their winter peaking and makes pretty progressive strides in terms of the environmental content of what they're generating with. And so and ultimately I think will reduce total costs if you look at the O&M costs structure around coal fired generation.","So what we're really trying to do is minimize in total, the impact on customer bills over time, but still have good investment in modernization. I suppose your question was, will lack of customer growth cycle it, it certainly makes it easier if you're -- if the underlying is growing but I don't think it probably reduces from our expectations.","Tom Fanning","Yes as me and Drew sit here and we sit in the management council meetings at Southern, the objective is no rate change as a result of capital investment. In other words as we increased revenue requirements, we must take commensurate revenue requirements out in our O&M cost structure. The idea keeping rates flat as we transition the generating fleet or invest to improve reliability and resilience.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Super helpful. And just a clean-up question, the income taxes in the third quarter, was the effective tax rate lower than previous and any particular driver on that tax rate?","Drew Evans","No, I think more the third quarter of last year was a little bit anomalous, we had to make the assumption that we weren't going to utilize all of the film tax credits that we've purchased at one of the subsidiaries and so the difference really is a little bit unnatural in that regard.","Tom Fanning","Hey, probably one more thing, somebody just warned me and I said, yes, that's probably right. Georgia Power recalled in its rate case deferred any rate action three years ago. And so if you think about where Georgia is, holy smokes, this rate case really covered essentially nine years of investment. So that's a whole lot. The formulation I gave you to have no rate change in the future as a design criteria as you were referencing in terms of the CapEx going forward, transitioning the fleet and building resilience. The design criteria is to make O&M adjustments that compensate and produced no rate increase to customers. That's the design.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Shahriar, how are you?","Shahriar Pourreza","Good. Good morning, guys. How are you doing?","Tom Fanning","Great.","Shahriar Pourreza","So most of the questions were answered. It's very comprehensive. Just one follow-up around the retail sales and sort of the comments around more of the industrial activity. We've seen similar weakness reported by some of your other peers, right. But what turns out is, is the rate structure of the customers are I guess more fixed versus volumetric. So the EPS impact for deceleration in volumes is diminished. Do you have a sense on sort of the industrial customers and how we should think about their rate structure volumetric versus fixed. And I guess what I'm trying to get a sense on is if you see a prolonged weakness and you don't see a recovering industrial activity and sort of the global macro concerns are more prolonged, is there -- do you see an impact to fundamentals over the longer-term, right. So like, obviously, short-term, it's within your plan, but I'm just trying to get a sense on what the sensitivity is to Industrial weakness?","Drew Evans","Well, from a corporate perspective, a 1% change in Industrial sales was about $16 million pre-tax and so pretty small impact. The Southeast generally uses Industrial customer rate design as a way to promote economic development and bring jobs to the region. So we're significantly less sensitive to it.","I've probably created too much of a sensitivity to this factor in this question because we did have some demand side management programs that that worked productively in the period to make sure that we didn't have to curtail any needed delivery to customers and that we had, so we had good reliability to commercial and residential customers. And so that that will impact some of the sales figures as well.","When we look at full-year though, I think we'll find that we're probably near our expectation which is around 1.5%, maybe 2% reduction in industrial demand in total.","Tom Fanning","Yes, and just to add to that, I think Georgia Power was the first and big -- probably remains the biggest in terms of RTP, real time pricing. That recall sends a price signal to customers and customers on their own can react to it or not, in other words, if they're making more money by driving through a peak period will be good for them. If they want to shut down during a high cost period, they can take that as well.","So these are customer driven demand side management kind of issues. This is nothing we do demand. We have the biggest program, I bet you in the United States, something like I think 40% to 50% of our Industrial and commercial load is subject to real time pricing. Over the year provides terrific value to our customer.","Drew Evans","Right, okay. So just to summarize if there is weakness in Industrial activity worse than sort of what your internal plan assumes, we should not assume that there's -- there would be a deceleration in your growth trajectory or fundamentals just given the fact that it\u2019s not that sensitive. Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hello Stephen, thanks for coming in.","Stephen Byrd","Congrats on a good quarter.","Tom Fanning","Thank you.","Stephen Byrd","Lot of questions have been addressed. I just wanted to touch on equipment testing at Vogtle, apart from the latest CCM just the status of overall testing, but any further color on where you stand with equipment testing, any lessons learned along the way, or just any further color on testing the equipment that's at the site?","Tom Fanning","Yes, thanks for that question. What was it? Maybe a call ago or two calls ago, there was a lot of conversation about the wisdom of early testing, does it cost a lot, does it reduce productivity, create the S-Curve et cetera. I think our posture has been to test as early as we could, even for partial systems. And we think that we have found the issues early and have been able to handle them in a very successful way.","Also, as we test early, we can bring lessons learned to other parts of the plant and to Unit 4, we think that's really, really helpful. It reduces risk. It assists in our ITAAC completions.","And just to tell you for Unit 3, we think our civil testing is now for construction is well over 90%, mechanical, over 77% and electrical testing on Unit 3 is at 50%. So this testing process we're going through right now is exactly what we want to have happened.","And here's the other thing that really also goes to the sawtooth or the S-curve effect. When we enter into an integrated flush, we start testing and we want to find problems. Part of testing is to identify where your weak spots may be as soon as you can, so that you can address them and have a successful completion of a milestone, ultimately. And we think that is really going well. As our testing organization has started out, we have found now over time, that their efforts have matured and they're more effective at testing the procedures, the deployment; the coordination with construction has all been getting better over time. I think our recent hours work kind of indicate that as well. This whole program while it has been the subject of some conversation has served us very well.","Stephen Byrd","That's really great color. And my next question is very, very broad, but I'm just thinking about your generation mix overall and the evolution of Solar Economics. And looking at your Plant Daniel in Georgia maybe just think about it, as you think about your generation mix and just the evolution of renewables economics do you see any potential changes you would want to make to your generation mix over time or you sort of generally happy with your current resource planning on that?","Tom Fanning","Well, so we do that we started this actually, when I was COO, we do a probability weighted kind of integrated resource plan, where we take different shots of different assumptions and probability weight them. In other words, we look at the cost of carbon. We already do that inside our math for our integrated resource plan. So we say there's no carbon price, and then there's $10, $20. We're now evaluating carbon costs prices as high as $50. We look at high medium low gas prices, coal prices, all kinds of things. And within all that scenario analysis, we come up with what we think are dominant solutions.","Those dominant solutions manifest themselves in an evolution of where the best generation resources are and because we're not in a so-called organized market. In an integrated market, you can iterate around generation solutions and transmission solutions, okay.","The other big thing I'm kind of nerding out now also, but I'll be -- I cover this quick is our reserve margin assumptions really change based on the penetration of renewables. The most important renewable resource for us and the Southeast is solar. We have pretty good resources, it's very cloudy here. But solar makes sense. We just don't have the kind of wind flows that support widespread wind generation. Our wind is imported through long-haul transmission systems, mostly from right now Kansas and Oklahoma.","Okay, we go through this analysis and we develop optimal solutions over the next 20 to 30 years at both transmission and generation. And we do this in conjunction with each of our states so that this is a well-known process.","As politics change, say for example, someone in a new administration wants to start a carbon tax, or there are different environmental costs associated with coal that we've seen over time. We certainly take those things into account. And so what we have is essentially a series of options-based solutions, where we can move the fleet. In general, what you find right now is Southern is between now and 2050, a much bigger share as you get towards the end date of renewables, that will mostly be solar.","We will see a continued importance of gas at some point, very high carbon prices; you would see gas with carbon capture. Over time because of these costs, we see coal diminishing and we see a constant share of nuclear. The big swing in how these resources may follow depends upon technology investment, particularly in the realm of storage and the cost of carbon capture.","You know that the objective function here is to provide low cost reliable electricity for the benefit of customers. And we have said low to no carbon by 2050. That low to no delta is really going to be spoken for by the advancement of technology, carbon capture, and storage. So we'll see. But that's the broad brush answer.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hello Sophie.","Sophie Karp","Hey guys, good morning. Congrats on the quarter.","Tom Fanning","Thanks.","Sophie Karp","Couple of questions if I may. First, I wanted to clarify and going back to Vogtle, I guess the SPI that you keep saying it needs to reach 1.5 in the next nine months, in order to be in line with the regulatory deadline and I guess looking at the VCM filing testimony last week, and just it's been built tracking below that. So far does it need to average at 1.5 or does it need to reach that number or does it mean that you are kind of eaten into that six months buffer you have like can you clarify that a little bit?","Tom Fanning","Sure. Yes, look, I think you were just reading it opposite. In other words, we like a low SPI number, okay. What we would say by that 1.5 would be -- we would have to average that going forward in order to hit November. To the extent we're below that number as we are right now, I guess cumulative 1.03%, Unit 3, 1.01%, Unit 4, 0.96%. Remember, we said Unit 4 is tracking slightly ahead of the aggressive plan, that's indicated by a number less than one, one would essentially say you're on the aggressive plan, okay?","Sophie Karp","Got it.","Tom Fanning","So the fact that we're below is goodness, that's where you want to be.","Sophie Karp","Got it. So you would want to be average no more than that, basically?","Tom Fanning","Yes, you want to be less than something over 1.5.","Sophie Karp","Got it. And then maybe a little bit of color on Mississippi as we have more visibility on who the nominees are for the commission. So how do you expect the regulatory climate there to shape up after the election and is that affecting your time and decision that gets in the rate case filing, do you plan to go after they have the election?","Tom Fanning","We don't try to time elections or try to guess who's going to win. We think this company again; you go back to my history I'm in my 39th year for heaven's sake. We go through political swings all the time. Our regulatory plans, our service to customers, our notion of reliability is something that transcends politics and must be long-term. We always start with long-term answers first, and we work like dogs to make the short-term results be beneficial to investors.","So we're going to file the rate case independent of any assessment of politics. And I think really, since Kemper, we've been treated really well in Mississippi; we think we've been treated fairly. We expect that to continue, no matter who's in office.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, good morning everybody.","Tom Fanning","Good morning.","Andrew Weisel","First question -- first question on financing. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to issue the equity units in August as opposed to the prior plan of using internal programs or even a block or more traditional equity forward? And just to clarify, when you say that the equity unit satisfy your needs to the five-year period, does that assume you will or will not use the full contingency for nuclear construction?","Drew Evans","Well, I guess, taking them in two pieces. I'll start with the second one first. It does assume that we use contingency that's embedded in the way we accounted for the cost re-estimation last summer and our expectations for construction. Although, I would say that the Delta is somewhat immaterial to the corporation in total. We will do $8 billion to $9 billion worth of CapEx every year for the next number of years or $38 billion or $39 billion over the plan period. And Vogtle represents only $3 billion or $4 billion of that in aggregate.","Your first question was related to the equity units offering which was a mandatory convertible preferred security that we issued in August. It had a number of features that I think drew us there, but not the least of which is that we are quite bullish or comfortable that we will complete the nuclear construction within the regulatory window. And we thought that issuing units that convert after the first unit goes into service is probably to our benefit. We think this share price has a bit of room to regain round to historical trading levels and that instrument allowed us to share in any upside and so we will literally share an upside through the high 60s, maybe low 70s in terms of its conversion when it does convert in August of 2022.","Tom Fanning","Okay. And let me just offer my own commercial here. I can tell you this; this instrument was debated a lot internally. We think it was absolutely the right decision. But the math to me is pretty compelling for the future. And there's no promises here. I can't say whatever. But when you think about Southern Company and people are already making bets, I think, in our stock price. When you hear about Southern Company ex-Vogtle, there's no question in my mind, this company's been trading kind of on par recently, we should trade at a premium.","So think about what a couple more turns may mean to the stock price and our P\/E ratio. And recall we're in a period in Georgia Regulatory framework where essentially our ROEs coming out of Georgia look flattish. That's part of the rate design we had when we had the thing approved recently. As we clear these assets to in-service, the trajectory of earning increases significantly. I think you've all done your own modeling. When you think about a healthier P\/E ratio, and you think about a much faster trajectory of EPS stock prices could be significant above this. We thought, though taking risk off the table, and at these attractive levels, made a whole lot of sense for us, and just took another issue of overhang off the stock.","Drew Evans","Yes, the only thing I'd add, just to be clear, we do not plan to utilize the ATM program at all throughout our plan period. And we thought it was an important signal to equity investors that we were complete in our equity issuance and the instrument that you're describing allowed us to do that.","Andrew Weisel","Great thanks, a lot of good detail there. And just to clarify this slide set that you will be issuing new shares for incentive compensation, what ballpark would be the annual need for that?","Drew Evans","Let me -- I don't want to give you a halfway answer. So let us handle that maybe in a call after we can give you an absolute number, we'll keep -- we will issue shares under the drift for balance of year, there are still some options that are open to be exercised, where we don't control the timing. And there'll be some modest issuance relative to the total shareholder base related to executive compensation but I can't -- I can't offhand give you a number with much accuracy.","Andrew Weisel","Not a problem, I will follow-up offline. Then just one last one, if I may, regarding the Alabama Power IRP or other petitions to certification, am I right that the $1.1 billion to the new gas plants and other capacity is incremental to the size of your CapEx plan that you previously laid out. And it still would be set that to the upside when you roll the plant forward with the fourth quarter results or would you de-prioritize spending either in that state or other states for things like affordability or the balance sheet or whatever else?","Drew Evans","No, we do think it's incremental to our five-year plan. And we're comfortable that we can handle it within our expected cash generation capitalization goals.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Augustina [indiscernible] from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Augustina, thanks for joining us.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Just wanted to clarify one thing, so around the time when the baseline review was filed. Basically, I think there were identified like a total of 1.4 billion contingency, which basically consisted of $800 million cost contingency and $600 million of schedule contingency. So just wanted to understand if those $600 million are still unallocated?","Drew Evans","Well, they're allocated the schedule assuming we hit November.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, perfect.","Drew Evans","To the extent you finish sooner than November, you wouldn't need any of that.","Unidentified Analyst","Exactly. Yes, okay, perfect. And then one other thing, if you just -- if you could just talk a little bit about what would be the top three risks for Vogtle going forward?","Tom Fanning","Well, that's a good one. So we think about that a lot. The limited to three is always fun. But here's what I would say. Top three risks are going to be probably hitting our milestones. I know we've put out hours, but milestones are the big deal and it\u2019s not just when we begin. It's when we finish. And did we run into the testing program where we had some equipment failure where we had some issues that we just don't expect that could prolong the successful test of any particular milestone. We know of nothing right now that would suggest that but I would say that is a risk.","Another risk will be just kind of maintaining the kind of recent productivity that we have had now, we are building margins. There\u2019s a wisdom on site of keeping an aggressive site plan gives us margin to November. And we want to preserve that as much as we can.","We went through a very tough summer where it was very hot, hard working conditions, the thought to the fact of new work fronts being open, new people coming in. Can we maintain the kind of productivity improvements that we have seen recently, the last couple of weeks 160,000 last four weeks about 150,000? That's really good performance. Can we maintain it? I guess that's the last thing.","And then -- and then I think just before fuel-load, that is going to be awfully important. Do we wrap up everything that even beyond hot functional test is non-critical path, I would say those three, people will argue about that. But I think that's it. I think that's a fair summation.","Unidentified Analyst","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Tom Fanning","Let me just say, most of that translates with schedule; there are cost elements to that. That's probably it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Ali, always great to have you.","Ali Agha","Thanks Tom, good morning. Good morning, Drew.","Tom Fanning","Good morning.","Ali Agha","Just a couple of things to clarify. One I wanted to go back, you ended up getting or earning $0.24 above what you have budgeted for the quarter. And I know you mentioned the weather as a factor but can you flush that out? Let me know what else came in better than expected and are these 2019 issues or some of them actually go into the future years, we should think about as positives as we're looking at, earnings in 2020 and beyond?","Drew Evans","So weather was certainly the single largest factor sort of $0.09 of the positive variance. The two things that were different than our expectation were levels of operations and maintenance expense. And so we were able to control to a greater degree than where we had budgeted. And then revenue related to real time pricing. The system lambda, the system average cost was actually quite low through the time period, but there was some congestion that led to a slightly higher rate signaling to some industrial customers.","Ali Agha","And so Drew is that at least the non-weather piece, should we think that that could continue the O&M and even maybe pricing as we\u2019re looking at 2020 and beyond?","Drew Evans","Certainly things that we're working on, our RTP, real time pricing is more a function of the condition in the period. And so it's not something we view as being persistent. And let me just correct weather is $0.15 greater than expectation, although it's only $0.09 higher than where we were year-to-year.","Ali Agha","Got it. And then secondly on Vogtle, Tom, if there was to be a change in either cost or schedule versus the way you're budgeting it right now, is the VCM the forum where you would give us an update, or would it be in some other fashion or forum?","Tom Fanning","I mean, Ali, it was significant; we do an 8-K. I mean it really just depends on the magnitude.","Ali Agha","I see, okay. And then lastly, can you just remind us as you\u2019re looking forward now, 2019 obviously is coming in well above what you were expecting at the beginning of the year. But can you just recalibrate for us the longer-term growth aspirations, the EPS growth aspirations that you're looking at? And what's the base from which you're looking at that growth?","Tom Fanning","Yes it was 4% to 6% --","Drew Evans","Off of 287 which was our 2018 guidance.","Tom Fanning","Yes. And even with this kind of base that we're in right now with Georgia, we're well within that cone. And when you start to clear these units into rate base, the trajectory really takes off. So it's 4% to 6% and of course, next year, we'll update all that. But we're well within what we said.","Ali Agha","And I think Tom, you said you could hit 4% to 6% every year, or is it like a cumulative growth rate?","Tom Fanning","It's kind of cumulative growth rate off of 2000, whatever it is 2018.","Drew Evans","But we do expect to hit within that 4% to 6% range in each year --","Tom Fanning","Yes.","Drew Evans","Off of 287 base, if you think about that as a cone of growth emanating from 287 will be within that band through the plan period is the expectation.","Operator","Our last question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys, thanks for taking my call and congrats Tom and guys on a good quarter. I have a question, there was something in the Georgia Power rate case testimony that stood out a little bit, which was one or two of the intervenors, I forget which one made commentary about instead of having coal ash spend run through rate base albeit on expedited amortization schedule. Actually seeing if it could get securitized that that would be better for the rate payor for the customer in terms of the bill impact, just curious for your thoughts on that whether it\u2019s even buyable under Georgia Statute and if not is there a mechanism or a method that would make sense to do stuff?","Tom Fanning","Yes, well let me give a couple comments. Number one, that idea whether it's a good idea or not will require legislation in Georgia, we don't have such a thing.","The other thing was I would also go back to the IRP discussion where this issue was considered and approved on in the IRP. But let the process workout and let the commission and the company and all the intervenors come to a successful conclusion, we think we will be treated well there.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. Thanks, Tom. Just housekeeping question for 2018 numbers for in the release for things like O&M et cetera, that includes or excludes the businesses sold in the last 12 to 18 months meaning last year\u2019s. I'm just looking at O&M; it actually shows it\u2019s down more than $100 million. I wanted to make sure that was apples-to-apples.","Drew Evans","The 2018 figure includes the O&M for the businesses that were owned in those years.","Michael Lapides","Okay. Can you -- I forget, you may have done it and if I missed it my apologies. Can you quantify what the O&M change would have been without those business so like-for-like?","Drew Evans","About flat I guess is the right way to think about it, but we can give you some detail.","Tom Fanning","So instead of a decrease it would be flat.","Drew Evans","Yes, okay.","Tom Fanning","And that's how we characterize I think the O&M for the call here. And Drew, kind of big, big plan is to eat inflation every year.","Operator","And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Tom Fanning","Well, just want to thank everybody for joining us. This is an awfully exciting time for us all. And I know we all get focused on Vogtle 3 and 4. But the thing I want to reinforce is the thousands of people at Southern that are making this business home that even despite these really extreme loads we had, really through the summer, and even into October, there was one day very early October, where we do a system-weighted temperature. That system-weighted temperature in October was 91 degrees. This is a time we are normally hitting outage season and you're taking a lot of resources out of play. The system responded beautifully, the transmission people, the generation people, and we proved our flexibility and resilience in this kind of extreme condition. We continue to serve customers well. By all front this company is hitting all cylinders right now.","So I know we all get excited and focused on Vogtle, I know I am. But I want you to know that the rest of the business is doing great. Thank you for your followership and look forward to talking with you soon. Take care.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

My name is Frank and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Wednesday, May 2, 2018.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Aaron Abramovitz - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Frank. Welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during today's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Each of our major business units had a great start to the year. Our state regulated electric and gas utilities as well as our other businesses are on track to deliver on their targets for 2018.","As we've mentioned before, tax reform provides an enormous benefit to our customers and the economy. During the first part of this year, we received constructive regulatory results in several of our states including our two largest subsidiaries.","Recall as a part of our tax reform strategy, we have been engaging with each of our state regulatory jurisdictions to provide meaningful rate benefits to customers while preserving the credit quality of each of our state regulated utilities. Thus far, tax reform has produced over $1.7 billion of benefits to our customers, and our regulators have demonstrated their steadfast support of preserving the credit quality of our utilities by accommodating higher equity ratios. As we continue working through our remaining jurisdictions we will keep you informed.","Let's now turn to an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4. With more than 6,000 workers on site, our focus remains on productivity and safe, efficient high quality construction. As of the end of March, total construction is slightly more than halfway complete. Significant progress continues in all phases of construction, with the setting of modules and equipment for Unit 3, setting up the reactor vessel for Unit 4, both commodity installation and major concrete placements across the project. In fact, several areas in the plant are already being transitioned from the construction team to the operations team.","If you can see on the materials provided this morning, the team at the site continues to work toward an accelerated construction schedule ahead of the November 2021 and November 2022 in-service dates that were approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. All critical path milestones are on track and our continued progress over the past several months is encouraging.","To be clear, there is a lot of hard work ahead, particularly associated with confined areas like the reactor containment structure. So there's a long way to go, but we are cautiously optimistic that our work plan will remain ahead of the commission-approved schedule. In the coming months, we are focused on securing additional skilled craft labor, particularly electricians and pipefitters in anticipation of the increased productivity requirements in the critical areas of the project.","As a final note on Vogtle 3 and 4, we are encouraged with the fuel load recently completed at Sanmen Unit 1 in China. Recall, Southern has had a number of personnel on site there and they look forward to learning more during the start of activity at these units.","I will now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thanks Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the first quarter of 2018, reporting earnings of $938 million or $0.93 per share, compared with earnings of $658 million or $0.66 per share in the first quarter of last year.","Excluding charges associated with the Kemper Project, Wholesale Gas Services and other items described in our earnings materials on an adjusted basis for the first quarter of 2018, Southern Company earned $893 million or $0.88 per share, compared with $652 million or $0.66 per share during the first quarter of 2017.","Major earnings year-over-year drivers for the first quarter of 2018 include revenue effects primarily driven by weather at our state-regulated electrics and by infrastructure investments at Southern Company Gas, as well as optimization of Southern Power state tax positions. These positive drivers were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization.","Now moving on to an economic review of the first quarter. The economy is performing well as GDP growth is expected to be 2.7% for 2018, which includes a slight lift from tax reform. In our state-regulated service areas, we are seeing this economic growth translate into employment growth on par with national growth of 1.5%.","In Georgia, where we serve both gas and electric markets, 1.7% job growth continues to outpace the nation and Atlanta was ranked third in population growth in 2017 across the 12 largest metropolitan statistical areas in the nation.","On the industrial side, the ISM Manufacturing Index averaged 59.7% during the first quarter, signaling a continuation of strong industrial expansion across the nation. We are seeing similar trends in our service territories where 9 out of 10 of our industrial segment showed year-over-year gains in electric sales. The ISM Index for April was at 57.3%, which while still expansionary signaled friction in the industrial supply chain that we will be monitoring.","Overall, we expect the economy to continue performing well, supporting customer growth and our energy sales projections. But we are keeping a watchful eye on potential policy interventions such as shifts in interest rates or developments related to international trade landscape that could affect economic growth.","Before turning the call back to Tom, I want to provide an earnings estimate for the second quarter and share brief updates on our financing plans for this year in Southern Power. First, we estimate that Southern Company will earn $0.65 per share in the second quarter of 2018.","Now for an update on our financing plans. As Tom mentioned earlier, we have been constructively working with our regulators to ensure lasting benefits of tax reform for our customers while preserving credit quality. The recent outcomes in several of our state jurisdictions are supportive of our previously discussed tax reform strategy. Continued success in the execution of this strategy should result in a financial outlook with less leverage and strong credit quality, which supports the value proposition from our state-regulated utilities.","Our five-year $7 billion equity need has not changed. Recall approximately 80% of this equity is to be invested directly into our state-regulated electric and gas utilities. The timing of fulfilling our equity needs could be influenced by the nature and the timing of regulatory outcomes, and by our consolidated credit metric objectives.","As mentioned on our last call, we will seek to optimize the timing and source of equity by seeking opportunities for investor-friendly funding. The sales of Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas and our planned sale of 33% of Southern Power's solar portfolio should be seen as past examples. The sale of Pivotal Home Solutions is a more recent example that is a small part of fulfilling our current need.","As an additional example of our thinking, we are also exploring third-party tax equity financing for much of our existing wind portfolio at Southern Power. Post tax reform, the economics of this financing vehicle could be more attractive given the extension of our tax credit carryforward position well into the next decade. Most of these projects were originally financed corporately at Southern Power. This opportunity could offset approximately $1 billion of Southern Company's $7 billion total equity need at Southern Company, with the potential to receive the funds in the second half of this year.","Additionally, we are updating our investment forecast for Southern Power. Post tax reform, it is clear that our optimal allocation of capital is reweighted towards our state-regulated utilities. We continue to expect success with incremental renewable projects, many of which will allow us to leverage equipment purchases we've made to safe harbor the value of production tax credits.","Our updated outlook for Southern Power reflects potential growth investments of up to $500 million per year, which is approximately one-third of what we outlined on our last call. These potential growth opportunities will require little to no incremental equity from Southern, as they are expected to be funded with a combination of internally generated cash flow, debt and third party tax equity.","Southern Power remains an important part of our business and the long-term contracted nature of these assets serves as a great complement to our state-regulated utility business model. The continued investment in renewable generation at Southern Power and our state-regulated electric utilities is also an important part of our broader, long-term low to no carbon objective.","Recall that our 4% to 6% EPS growth outlook is not dependent on unregulated growth. As a result, this more modest opportunity set for Southern Power represents upside within our 4% to 6% range. Moreover, our less aggressive growth outlook should result in reduced costs, further supporting Southern Power's value proposition to the overall enterprise.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Art. Southern Company has started 2018 with strong momentum. All of our businesses are performing at a high level. Our Board of Directors recently approved an $0.08 per share increase in our common dividend to an annualized rate of $2.40 per share. This is our 17th consecutive annual increase. And for 70 years, dating back to 1948, Southern Company has paid a dividend that was equal to or greater than that of the previous year.","The board's decision to increase the dividend speaks to the enduring strength of our business, which is underpinned by a firm foundation of premier state-regulated electric and gas utilities. Moreover, it supports our objective of providing superior risk adjusted total shareholder return to investors over the long term.","We're also excited about the forthcoming changes to our management team. As announced two weeks ago effective June 1, Art is retiring and Drew Evans, currently Chairman, President and CEO of Southern Company Gas, will become the Chief Financial Officer of Southern Company. On a personal note, I want to thank Art not only for his 42 years of distinguished service to Southern Company, but also for his friendship.","His sound fiscal discipline, strategic thinking and consummate professionalism have been invaluable to our company, as he has helped steer us through some incredible moments in our history. He will be sorely missed.","At Southern Company, we are committed to cultivating the best leadership in our industry. This announcement underscores the fact that we continue to advance the thought leadership and experience that serves to support our objective to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy with superior customer service.","Operator, we'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey, good afternoon. And Art, you're definitely going to be missed and congratulations. It's been a long and illustrious career.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thanks Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So a question on the $7 billion. So I think you were pretty clear, you need $7 billion over five years, average, $1.4 billion. But should I be \u2013 the $365 million you're raising from the Pivotal transaction, should I consider that as one of the sources of that $7 billion or is that outside of that box?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No. That's within our financial plan.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So it reduces the $7 billion or it's outside of it?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No, it reduces it.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Got you. Clear. Okay. And so the extent you can do this tax equity financing on the wind, that could reduce it by another $1 billion. You sell 50%...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","...of 1.8 gigawatts of solar, that reduces it further, et cetera.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","No.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So as we're thinking about...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Now, Greg...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","...how you whittle this down to the actual amount of common equity you might or might not need, is that the right way to think through it?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","The solar's already spoken for. (16:40)","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","The solar was already part of the plan last year.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So the solar's outside okay. And then you've got some really rational outcomes from the regulators here on doing what they ought to be doing to make sure the credit quality, your operating companies remain sound. But you have to fund that, right? You have to put that equity in to get the earnings and cash flow that they've deemed to be fair and appropriate, reasonable. So would that lead us to believe that the equity needs are sort of front end loaded because you want to get that equity into those subs so that you can get to the appropriate credit metrics faster?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Greg, we've already advanced to Georgia Power, I think it's $900 million of equity. We've taken that in the form of short-term debt until the time we're at a point where we can replace that with equity.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So would it be fair to assume, if we're modeling this, that you can advance the equity infusions to the subs through borrowing at the parent and then pay that off with either asset sale proceeds or equity over time?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Exactly.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Perfect. I'm sure there's a lot of other questions. So I'll get off. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Bud (18:02). Thanks for joining us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hello. Hey, just to clarify Greg's question. The $1 billion of tax equity proceeds in second half, that offsets the $7 billion of equity expected over the next five years?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah that's part of it. We have lots of flexibility on how to think about the equity raise going forward, flexibility in terms of content and time.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","In terms of timing, current plans can handle about $1.5 billion a year. Has the regulatory outcomes in Georgia, Alabama and a few other places, has the higher equity ratio require more equity upfront, like does it front load some of that into the current year?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Georgia, certainly, as I mentioned on Greg's answer, we've already advanced some equity to Georgia Power in the form of debt at the parent temporarily. Alabama's does not start \u2013 their process does not even start until 2019. So theirs is an achievement of an equity ratio over time.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So in other words, you expect the equity to be kind of evenly spread out throughout that five years and you would lever as necessary at the parent in between.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Basically the Alabama plan provides us a pathway in which to raise equity ratios over time. There's some flexibility around that depending upon a host of variables. So as we have the opportunity to raise the equity ratio, we will do that. And obviously, as we do that, that will have a bearing on the amount and timing in any given period.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And one last question on the tax equity. The $1 billion, that's just to refinance existing portfolio projects, or does that include the potential $500 million this year?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It's just the existing portfolio, that's right.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So in other words, there (20:11) could be additional tax equity for new investment?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's exactly right.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","(20:14)","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. Hi, guys. Just looking back to what you could have had when you set out the plan last quarter, I think you calibrated the FFO to debt metric improvement that you were meaning to go after, so like 2% to 3% at the subs and 3% to 4% at the consolidated level. Can you give us any sort of feel for how you feel you're doing with the mitigation achieved so far and other pieces of the plan against what I think was the target?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, look, we have to execute and time will tell, but we're very confident we're going to be right on the money in doing what we need to do.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So we can't kind of specify just kind of how much improvement we've seen yet or...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, again, it's going to be to the degree we can earn on the equity in the subsidiaries and the more postponed that is, we may have to take down parent debt sooner in order to achieve the targets that we have established. So we will get there one way or the other. We would rather do it in the least dilutive way possible.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah and I bet people are dying to have us kind of lay out what the investor-friendly equity sources are. We'll certainly update you on the next earnings call. And if there's activity before then, we'll certainly bring it to everybody's attention, but it really kind of deals with our execution on all those sources.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can I just pick up on the investor-friendly comment, Tom?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You, obviously, had a slide that showed this $1.4 billion a year and now you're sort of talking about it more as $7 billion over the five years. I mean do you guys consider investor-friendliness to be getting it behind you, or doing it \u2013 or pushing it out? I mean that's I guess the philosophical question in part.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, it's always better to get it behind you, I think. But the shape, just as we suggested on the last question from Michael, the amount and nature really depends on the execution on these regulatory plans. I must say, we've been very gratified with the response we've gotten out of our states in order to return benefits to customers and balance that with the preservation of financial integrity. We pretty much have execution in Gulf, in Georgia and in Alabama. We have plans in other subsidiaries, so we're working to do that.","Our bias in all of this is to preserve our metrics and really restore the financial integrity that we had prior to tax reform. So if we had a bias, I guess it would be to get it done sooner rather than just leave it out there. And always, I think, there's always this notion of overhang in equity issuance. To the extent you eliminate overhang, that's a good thing too.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Tom. And then just on Vogtle, I think in your comments you said that you were kind of cautioning that there's a lot of heavy work in front of you, but that you're cautiously optimistic you would remain ahead of the approved schedule.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You're currently \u2013 quite a decent bit ahead of that schedule. So are you signaling that you think you'll narrow the gap a bit here or do you think you'll stay...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, those of you that have been in my one-on-ones, I do these artful audio-visual presentations. I do this chart to demonstrate, to illustrate what hard work is. A lot of this reactor vessel containment area is tight spaces, a lot of commodity work, a lot of people, and I'm just cautioning everybody.","Yeah. The schedule looks fabulous so far. In fact, we are ahead of our April\/November \u2013 (24:55) April 2021, 2022, we're ahead of our April schedule so far, but we cannot count on that. I'm just cautioning everybody that with this very tough work, I would expect you to see some erosion in that. But our ability to perform ahead of the regulatory schedule, November 2021 and 2022, I think it's pretty good. I think we feel confident about that.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great. Thank you. And just on the cost side, can you give us a sense of just your confidence \u2013 you're obviously tracking above at the moment, but...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...what gives you the confidence you have the line of sight that you can sort of accomplish the schedule and bring the costs to into where they need to be?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. What's interesting about that cost chart is that we had \u2013 make the note, performance remains well within the thresholds of the approved estimate to complete. What we should note is that that cost chart is really tracking the kind of personnel efficiency, labor efficiency that is associated largely with the Bechtel work. That represents about 20% of the remaining cost in front of us.","So, yeah, it looks like it's substantially above the cost target. We really want and are working very hard with the Bechtel people at all levels in the organization. And in fact, I probably have been meeting with, via telephone or in person or whatever, Brendan Bechtel. To my level, I know Paul Bowers, the CEO of Georgia Power; Steve Kuczynski, the guys on site.","We are working in all levels within Bechtel to try and drive better performance on the cost index. And I think we see our way through to improving it somewhat. But you got to understand, everything we see right now shows that we will be within the cost thresholds that we've had approved at the Georgia Public Service Commission, even if we don't... (27:03)","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","(27:03) the message there, Tom, is don't take that sort of index and apply it to the whole cost, right?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That is exactly right. It's only about 20% of the cost. The rest of the costs are pretty well known.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Hey, Art, congratulations on your upcoming retirement.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Stephen. Appreciate that.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just wanted to go back to what you had walked through in terms of the tax equity and I'm sorry if I missed it. I was just trying to think about just from a GAAP point of view modeling, the cost of the tax equity financing. Could you just refresh my memory on just how to think about the GAAP cost of that financing?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","I'm not sure I know (28:00)","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","What do you mean GAAP cost?","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh, the earnings drag from the financing \u2013 from the tax equity financing?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, when we model these kind of things, we certainly do it against our current plan, and to the degree you're giving up the tax equity, which for us is really delayed, and then look at other potential buyers who can use it sooner than we can, we think there's value there.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. It's simply a cost of capital compared to a time value of cash calculation. We wouldn't do it unless it was accretive.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, understood. I can follow up just to make sure. Sometimes the accounting impacts just trip me up a little bit, I'll follow up off line. And then separately, just on, you've obviously had a number of questions around different approaches to financing. I think you've laid out a number of really creative and shareholder-friendly ways to approach this. Should we be thinking broadly? I know you don't want to get into too much specifics but just conceptually, more around financing options versus certain parts of the business that could be completely monetized.","So obviously you have a lot of very valuable franchises and low risk businesses that could be sold. So I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding just conceptually, is it more in the sort of financing realm or is it more in monetization or is really everything a possibility at this point?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, we don't want to talk about specifics, but clearly, I think when you look at our track record in the past, it is a portfolio of a variety of options. We'll consider any and all determined by what gives the best value to shareholders.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Completely understood. And lastly just on Sanmen, it's encouraging to see fuel loading. Do you have a sense for when they're going to go through sort of active testing of the equipment, meaning machinery is actually going to be spinning and they're going to go through real sort of, I guess, not being an engineer sort of operational testing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, we think it's imminent.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I think they're going to do some preliminary warm up. But when they start testing with actual fuel load, I believe that's scheduled for another \u2013 be a month or so.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I mean they'll be \u2013 the word you're looking for is hot. They'll be hot in four to six weeks. There is a lot of machinery that's spinning right now but hot in four to six weeks, if that's the question.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Perfect. That's all I had. Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Angie. Thanks for joining us.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. How are you? And Art, 42 years, wow, it's hard to believe actually, but congratulations.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, so $7 billion reduced by that $1 billion that you mentioned regarding wind, reduced by the proceeds from Pivotal, so the rest would be easily covered by your internal programs. So why do we even need to talk about timing? Is it just simply because the internal issuances of shares would assume some risk of the equity pricing and, hence, you would prefer to potentially front end load some of these issuances?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I mean, it's really a kind of a what and a how. Right? I think the what would be, as we demonstrated in Georgia, to the extent we have the ability to invest equity, reduce leverage at the operating companies and earn on it effectively, certainly that gives rise to an accelerated timing relative to the $1.4 billion per year.","And when you think about the knock-on effect, the parent company debt and a variety of other things, I think there are a variety of accretive things we can do that are associated with accelerating equity issuances. The other idea is not so much a what but a how. And that really goes to if we can demonstrate a shareholder-friendly approach to raising equity then, in fact, that takes this kind of overhang issue off the share price and also really speak to the bias of us getting our metrics fixed sooner rather than later.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's where it goes. Don't forget, we've got to address the metric issue and we can't wait forever to do that in order to maintain the ratings that we're seeking to maintain. So there's a lot of balancing around all these issues.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And you believe basically that these potential asset sales, if I understand correctly, would be earnings accretive?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Absolutely. We won't do anything that's not in a balanced way.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, Tom, Art.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Hey.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Tom, just to be clear, as you look at your portfolio and you look for investor-friendly opportunities, is it fair to say that your core electric utility businesses are core to the company not to be messed with, or is everything potentially available as you're looking at equity raising plans?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Ali, it's a very interesting question and, frankly, we've had a lot of debate even internally and even with the board and everything else. I'd, frankly, think almost all of what we have is core. Our business is low risk, infrastructure-driven, state-regulated integrated utilities, that's what it is. Even in \u2013 we've been that way forever in the electric side, when we did the gas side, and remember the underpinning of that strategy was safety-related pipeline replacement programs that provided a very low risk and attractive growth profile. I would argue all of that is core, okay.","Pivotal wasn't core. Right? And so that was clear. And there's a few things around the edges that aren't particularly that business. But even so, we would consider the whole portfolio of opportunity if it made sense for shareholders. The ultimate test here is what can we do to benefit you all. And we'll evaluate every opportunity we have whether it's structural or financial.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. And then also just to be clear on the commentary you've had, looking at these avenues but looking at acceleration, et cetera, one, can you remind us \u2013 and I haven't seen this \u2013 but through the first quarter, was there any equity issuance through the plans? And if so, how much have you raised? And secondly, would you take block transactions off the table, or that's still in the menu of getting this behind you?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","To my knowledge, very small amounts of maybe option exercises, but that's it, as far as equity in the first quarter. And as we've said in the past, we've got a toolbox that we can access and block is only one of the issues, we've got a lot of other options, so we're not going to get specific beyond that.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. But nothing is off the table is what you're saying.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","When we have something to say we will certainly say it. We just announced Pivotal. We just announced an idea we've discovered on the PTCs. Certainly, we have our earnings call in July. If we advance something, we'll certainly let you know in due haste.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then separately, looking at more near term from the financial side. So you went into the quarter budgeting or letting us know you were thinking you're going to be earning $0.84 ended up earning $0.88. So what came in better than what you thought, and I know it's early in the year, but could not be extrapolated as you're looking at the full year as well?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Ali, a little bit of that was better sales than what we expected on a weather-normal basis. So I think you've seen our numbers. Retail sales were on a weather-normal basis, up 1.6%. Our industrial sales were up 2.6%. So our forecast was pretty flattish around weather-normal load growth a year. (37:24) So we picked up some there.","But the other side of that is O&M, and O&M was really underspent throughout our business enterprises, which really goes again towards our modernization initiative to invest capital and replace it with lower nonfuel O&M. Certainly, there'll be some timing differences that will be part of that, but again, this is the effort upon which we've launched ourself.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","There's another interesting economic trend, the Fed has spoken about this. There was this announcement today, wasn't it, on AllianceBernstein, something like that, but folks moving out of high tax state and local areas into low tax state and local areas. Atlanta, I want to say, was the third fastest growing population of any of the MSAs in the United States. And when you think about kind of this potential megatrend, an unintended consequence of tax reform, we think the Southeast tends to benefit.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, afternoon team and congratulations, Art.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Absolutely. Thank you rather. So just to come back to the core earnings of the company, as you talked about sort of front end loading at least the Georgia Power piece here, how do you think about where you are with respect to your guidance within the range? And then sort of front end loading even the earnings growth within the period that you talk about, just want to kind of think about the timing of when these bigger factors phase in here.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, we don't really comment on guidance until after the third quarter. Yeah, we've had a good quarter, but again, it was better growth than what we expected, but our weather-normal models aren't perfect either. So we always have preached that. It's more of an art, no pun intended, than science. But our range contemplates all different kinds of scenarios and we'll just see where the rest of the year goes.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I think Art is right. We give the guidance in the year end, so it'd be the February call now, and we update it once a year. We've done that for years and years and years, and we'll do that in October, I guess.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But maybe to clarify here, the 4% to 6% as you guys see it, you would expect despite front end loading, the equity contributions into the utilities but there is still a pretty stable cadence, the 4% to 6%, through your forecast period?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Absolutely.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. That clarifies. Thanks. Let me come back just to the equity raise side of the house here just real quickly. When you say your utilities are \u2013 everything's core, utilities are core, did you have a preference in evaluating, say, Southern Power versus your utilities?","And then secondly, let me just also be exceptionally clear about this, because I think I heard you say it. With respect to needing to see something accretive, it needs to be earnings not necessarily credit and earnings accretive?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, we want to be both and we take it as a whole, right? Value is a function of risk and return. If we can buy off risk and at the same time packaged together with a variety of other things still be earnings accretive, that's a home run to us. With respect to Southern Power, recall we built that business with the idea that the long-term bilateral nature of that business as apart from merchant (41:18) with the low to no fuel risk, transmission risk, creditworthy counterparties is a structure that is intended to replicate kind of the risk-return profile of our integrated regulated utility business.","So it a part of our core business. We've already contemplated through financial transactions selling off, for example, a third of the solar portfolio. We told you that we would consider selling an economic interest in the production tax credits with the wind, we already have. But that is part of our portfolio of assets and if there is a better combination for shareholders, we'll certainly consider it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Excellent. And just real quickly, Art, if you can clarify this. You expressed a desire to sort of front end load your ability to hit the FFO to debt target you've delineated. Where do you stand again today and what are the agencies saying in terms of the timeline you need to get there with?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, again, I think we outlined in our last call, we're trying \u2013 if you exclude Vogtle, we're trying to get it back to a 16% to a 16.5% FFO to debt ratio. The timelines around that, we've communicated with the agencies about our plans and so they are aware of all the things that we are looking at, but we need to make progress on that at some point in time.","I think you asked earlier about front loading the equity in the OpCo, that's certainly true with Georgia, but you'll notice that it's not upfront so much in Alabama. It starts in 2019 and stretches out over a number of years. So I want to make sure and be clear that it's different in every operating company.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed.","Thomas A.

Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks for joining us.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And Tom, thank you for taking my question. A topic that hadn't come up today, how are you looking around the service territories? Really the entire Southeast and thinking about the opportunity to leverage your position in SONAT for incremental midstream or pipeline growth \u2013 organic growth?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Great stuff. I'm going to pull back on comments I made, I'll bet you, two years ago now. There's still is a lot of interest, because the unconventional gas, particularly Marcellus, that area, is different than the traditional gas, the deepwater or coastal Gulf Coast.","There has been a number of projects that people are looking at. And I think I spoke about several options that we were presented with from other people. We obviously are a big consumer of gas on our own, even without Southern Company Gas. Southern Company was, I think, the third largest consumer of natural gas in the United States.","You throw Southern Company Gas on there, I think we become the most important consumer of natural gas in the United States. And there continue to be interesting ideas of pipes, north to south, as well as pipes west to east. And in fact, our constructive arrangement with Kinder Morgan resulted in the Southern Natural Gas pipeline 50% interest.","What we said then was that there may be other opportunities associated with that. And we have executed on, at least one of those, wasn't particularly big. But what we told you also was that as the acquisition of 50% of SONAT gives us optionality, we still think that optionality exists and we'll just be opportunistic in terms of how we exercise it.","The opportunities are still out there. We still kick the tires. We still look. We still talk. And we have a guy over at Southern Company Gas, Pete Tumminello who runs a terrific shop, guy with him, Dat Tran, are very, very good gas pipeline people. And so we continue to actively survey the landscape.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks for joining us.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Thanks, guys. Hi. Thanks, and congratulations, Art.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","So, I guess, can't escape the equity question, so I'll come back to that quickly. In terms of the equity, is there a maximum size that you would look to do in a particular year? I get the front loading question, but obviously there is a cap that you would not want to go beyond. Is there any number that we should think of that generally you would not issue beyond that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I'd rather not kind of deal in that realm. What I said before is, that we would be both credit and earnings accretive with any of these ideas. In terms of sizing, I think that is just an area I'd rather not get into at this point. We've already suggested that the shape of our effort here will be highly influenced by, on the regulatory front, the ability to invest equity in an effective way at our regulatory jurisdiction. Let's kind of leave it there for now.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Fair enough. It was worth a shot though.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Praful, that's great. Celebrate good tries.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Yeah. Just following up on the regulatory question then. I guess on the higher equity ratio, is this seen by the regulators as a kind of almost like a bridge to help you get to your stronger metrics, but that you grow back to the lower equity ratios over time? Or is this seen more as a permanent solution going forward?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No, it's really just math, if you think about it, tax reform was just a wonderful thing, right? We were able \u2013 and we worked this on our own, we worked it through EEI. But look, we pounded the pavement up in Washington. It was really important for us to maintain interest deductibility, that would have visited (48:30) on our customers an almost immediate rate hike.","Then you say, well, we did that. We got lower tax rate which are obviously an advantage, and the quid pro quo must have been that we lost cash flows associated with accelerated depreciation. The commission's I think, we have this very constructive relationship we have for decades down here. Gee whiz, when you think about it, we were able to take the benefits by lower tax rate and use them on one hand to give customer benefits now over $1.7 billion and, at the same time, reduce leverage, increase equity ratios to fix (49:16) back to a coverage ratio. So that has been the plan.","Our regulators in the Southeast have always understood that good, healthy utilities are good ultimately for customers. Recall the old circle of life that I started back \u2013 gosh, now it's getting a long time \u2013 15 years ago, when I was CFO, the idea that if we are able to deliver relentless value to customers in terms of reliability and price and service, that generates a tremendous amount of value in the economy.","If we generate that value and therefore we earn the ability to have constructive regulation, that gives us an environment in which to invest capital and that gives us an environment in which to grow a good, healthy company. So I think our regulators get that model and I think we all understand that preserving that balance is good for everybody in the long run.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Got you. Super helpful, guys. Thanks.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Thomas A.

Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just quickly on the tax equity market. Has there been any characterization of any change that's happened because of tax reform that you guys have experienced, or is it really pretty much a non-event in the tax equity market for you guys?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I think there was talk during all of the passing of the bill that there was going to be a pinching of the market, that they're going to be penalized, so to speak, but I think all that was fixed. And to my knowledge, Paul, I believe the accessibility, and we got the same players in the marketplace that we'll deal with if we choose to go down that road.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah and I'll just give a little more nuanced answer. There has been a change but it hasn't impacted us.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And why hasn't it impacted you? Could you give us a little more flavor for that? Is it because the type of...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Because I think when you look at scalable high-quality issuers like us, we're always going to cultivate a universe of investors that is quick and easy and sophisticated. We know how to do deals. We've done deals in the past. We have a relationship. We get these things done.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on the China fuel loading, do we know what actually caused the delay for so long on that? And I just was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that, if you found out what that was and how that may or may not translate to you guys now?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No sir. Pure speculation. There were rumors everywhere, nobody knows.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then finally, you were mentioning something about, I guess, the tax code sort of assisting movement to Georgia, I think. I apologize for not gathering exactly what you were saying. Could you elaborate a little bit on what you were talking about? I'm sorry.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Sure, sure. So there's been \u2013 if you look at the macro trend of population shift in America, for some years, because of economic growth reasons, there has been a shift away from the Northeast and the Midwest, particularly the Rust Belt, into higher growth areas like the Southeast, the desert Southwest, things like that. When you look at the tax code where now you're limited on your ability to deduct state and local taxes, one of the things that now we're starting to see is that people are willing to migrate away from high tax areas, which have high state and local taxes, into low state and local tax areas.","And you know what, it was funny, 100 years ago when I was CEO of Gulf Power, I was on Jeb Bush's transition team. And my assignment there were two of his planks, one was education and one was economic development. And one of the theories about at least Florida that we used with Governor Bush at the time was the idea that physical location in this digital age increasingly didn't matter.","And so I think you're going to find people that are much more willing to go to places that are nice places to live, that have reasonable human-like commutes, that have affordable housing, that have good education, that have constructive business regulatory and legal environments. Now we have a tax code reason for people to move to those areas. Those are kind of the megatrends I was pointing out.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But these are still the high net worth individuals really, right? I mean with respect to the tax code changes we're talking about, those don't impact the vast \u2013 you're talking sort of like \u2013 is that what you're talking, you're talking about rich people, I guess, moving to Atlanta, Georgia?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, AllianceBernstein just moved to Nashville, they just announced it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I got you.","Thomas A.

Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Andy. How are you?","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Great. How are you guys doing?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Awesome.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","And congratulations, Art. I guess you'll get your golf game going, maybe you'll be able to beat Fanning now.","Arthur P.

And congratulations, Art.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No. (55:19) Art is the captain of the Southern Company golf team.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. I'll miss you, Art. You've been very helpful to all of us and will be missed.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Andy.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Obviously, all the questions have mainly been answered. I just have a question on Georgia Power. The $900 million, I understand that, will there be incremental equity that needs to be put down in there to get to the 55% level?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, we've already put it down there as equity, that we will replace it at the Southern level in some form or fashion.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And just as a matter of governance and process, there's always needs for capital contributions to the subs over time, and certainly that would include all of our subs.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So there will be other incremental equity down there in the future, but this speaks to the lion's share...","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","I guess, what I'm getting at \u2013 I'm sorry to interrupt \u2013 but what I'm getting at is to get to the equity ratio where \u2013 if I remember from, like, past comments or conversations with you guys, obviously, the first goal was to try to get the regulatory approval, which, obviously, you got very quickly. And then the second goal was to try to get the equity ratio to the maximum allowed level so you could start earning on that equity as quickly as possible. And so, I guess, what I'm asking is does that $900 million, which you put down into there, does that get you to that maximum equity level or do you need to put more equity down there this year to get to that maximum equity level?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Andy, yeah, it gets us to approximately the 55% level.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, we're there.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","(57:17) Okay, okay. Because I had come up with a different calculation, that's why I was confused. Okay. Let me see if there's anything else. And then just on the overall equity, you've touched on this before. So on the tax equity, the $1 billion that you plan to get later in the year, that will reduce the equity need from $7 billion \u2013 it's a hard word to say \u2013 down to $6 billion, and then another $350 million or so has been reduced by the sale to American Water Works, so you're down to about $5.5 billion, give or take $100 million. (58:01)","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You got to be careful using gross numbers like on Pivotal, because you always want to first retire the net committed capital associated with each of these companies so that you preserve your earnings profile. And then, to the extent the price is above, that is accretive, and also gives you the notion of net equity proceeds that you could then use to reduce leverage. Yeah. And I know, rightfully so, we gave you the example of the tax equity associated with the wind PTCs, that's one of a portfolio of options we're looking at.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay.

Overall, 2012 was an outstanding year for Southern Company. As we move into 2013 and beyond, I\u2019d like to provide you with an update of our five strategic priorities. The first priority is excel at the fundamentals. First and foremost, I want to commend our employees for one of our safest years on record. Nothing is more important than the wellbeing of our employees, which requires constant focus and an unwavering commitment that we will return each one of them home to their families in good health at the end of each workday. While we were not perfect in this regard in 2012, I\u2019m very proud of our employee\u2019s commitment to our target zero safety philosophy.We also recorded another year of outstanding operational results. The peak season equivalent forced outage rate for our fossil hydro generation fleet has been the leader in the industry for six years running and eight of the last nine. We have also continued our superior performance in transmission and distribution reliability and our customers continue to benefit from our trend of improvement over the last decade.We continued the ongoing transformation in our generation mix, generating more energy from natural gas than coal for the first time in our history, largely as a result of our diverse portfolio and the ability to respond to low gas prices. Our customers benefited from approximately $1 billion in fuel savings as compared with 2011.Operational performance, along with our strong commitment to service, resulted in top quartile rankings for customer satisfaction for all four of our regulated utilities in 2012. All of these operational accomplishments are evidence of Southern Company excelling at the fundamental. But this priority is a broader objective and indicated by any of these metrics. In fact, each of the other four priorities I\u2019ll discuss is an extension of this first priority.The second priority is achieving success with our major construction projects, specifically Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and The Kemper Project, both of which are continuing to progress in an outstanding manner. While projects of this scale and magnitude always face unforeseen challenges, we continue to demonstrate our ability to constructively manage those issues and achieve a favorable outcome. Since our receipt of the first ever combined construction and operating licenses from the NRC in February 2012, significant progress has been made on both the units, with construction now approximately one-thirds complete.Specific accomplishments include a completing of the unit 3 containment vessel bottom head. 40% completion of the unit 3 cooling tower, and 90% completion of the unit 4 containment vessel bottom head. We have also begun [assembly] of the unit four condenser. In addition, on Tuesday, the NRC issued no objection letter in response to our preliminary amendment request. This enables final work to be completed prior to the pouring of basemat concrete. We intend to pour concrete following the expected issuance of the license amendments later this quarter.We are anticipating the Georgia Public Service Commission response to the seventh Vogtle construction monitoring report on February 19, and expect to file the eighth construction monitoring report in late February. Meanwhile, the Kemper project is now 35% complete and remains on track for its May 2014 commercial operation date. To date approximately $2.5 billion have been spent on the project. The plant is scheduled to begin to start up activities this summer with first fire going to the [CTs] in June, and the first gasifier heat up taking place in December. Reliable SIM gas is expected to began flowing into the CTs in February 2014.As many of you are aware, Mississippi Power signed an agreement with the Mississippi Public Service Commission last week that includes a procedural schedule and framework for cost recovery for the Kemper project. This settlement demonstrates once again our long standing practice of engaging with regulators to achieve constructive dilution and provides a greater level of transparency on cost recovery for this project. We held a separate analyst call regarding this settlement last Friday. A replay and related documents can be found on our investor relations website.As an update since that call, Mississippi made its first filing under the settlement agreement this part Friday. The company asked for $172 million in rate relief which represents a 21% increase in customer bills. If approved, we expect those rates to be implemented as early as April 2013. Also, the legislation permitting securitization and multiyear rate stabilization has been sponsored by the chairs of the house of public utilities committee and the senate energy committee. Both bills have been referred and passed out of their respective committees earlier today. We look forward to monitoring their progress over the next few weeks.Overall, we continue to anticipate that Vogtle units 3 and 4, and the Kemper project will benefit our customers with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for decades to come. The third priority involves promoting sensible national energy policy. This is an area that is especially important right now with the fiscal issues the country is facing and the potential for economic recovery on the horizon. We have seen some progress in this area recently with the December passage of a bill that preserved a rational approach for dividend and capital gains taxes. A discussion in which we were particularly active.This development should help maintain our ability to attract capital for future energy infrastructure investments, but more work remains to be accomplished. And we will continue to have an active voice in those debates. We will continue to argue for a balanced approach to energy resources, an emphasis on energy innovation through proprietary research and development, and the importance of restoring America\u2019s financial integrity. All for the benefit of the customers we serve. The fourth priority is promoting smart energy. As you know, we achieved a major milestone in 2012, the completion of 4.4 million smart meter installations in Georgia, Alabama and Florida. We believe however, that the concept of smart energy involves more than just the building of a smart grid. It\u2019s a much broader concept that also includes generation, transmission, distribution and the beyond the meter uses of electro technologies. In fact, it\u2019s really more than all of that. It\u2019s really about energy innovation in the ways in which we can use technology to help drive better service and reliably for our customers. We will continue to dedicate ourselves towards achieving that outcome.The fifth priority and it\u2019s really the foundation of our business, is about valuing and developing our people. We will continue to drive performance and accountability in 2013, while also continuing our emphasis on succession planning and cross training. Over the past two years, we have transferred some 700 employees across system lines, improving the breadth and depth of our expertise and sharpening the skill sets of many of our key leaders. We will continue with this approach in 2013 and beyond.I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic review.Art BeattieThanks Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had strong 2012 results for both the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we earned $0.44 per share compared to $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year 2012, we earned $2.70 per share compared to $2.57 per share in 2011. Our full year 2012 results include a $21 million net benefit or $0.02 per share recorded during the second quarter of 2012 for an insurance recovery associated with the 2009 Mirant bankruptcy settlement. Excluding this item, full year 2012 earnings were $2.68 compared with $2.57 per share for 2011.As a reminder, our earnings per share guidance for 2012 was $2.58 to $2.70 and our adjusted results were in the top end of that range. Several factors affected our year-over-year results for 2012. Two of the most significant drivers were the weather and our ability to respond to it as reflected in our successful effort to improve operating efficiencies in our business units.Weather in 2012 for our service territory was milder than normal across most of the year, which had a negative impact of $0.11 per share. Weather in 2011 was quite the opposite, driving a positive $0.09 per share impact. This means that weather had a negative $0.20 per share impact year-over-year. Largely offsetting this impact was reduced nonfuel O&M for our traditional operating companies which drove a positive $0.11 per share contribution for 2012 as compared to 2011.The other significant driver for 2012 as compared to 2011 was retail revenue effects for our traditional operating companies which contributed a positive $0.22 per share. In our slides, we have provided a summary of all the year-over-year EPS drivers for 2012. We have also included drivers for the fourth quarter in the appendix for your reference.Turning now to a discussion of our retail sales results for 2012. Total weather normal retail sales for the full year grew 0.4% over 2011 and 1.7% for the fourth quarter. Industrial sales grew at 0.2% for the full year 2012. After a weak third quarter, fourth quarter industrial sales grew 1.2% over the fourth quarter of 2011. During the fourth quarter of 2012, six of our top seven industrial segments reflected energy sales growth over the same period in 2011. Chemicals, our largest segment, grew 2% for the quarter.Other highlights for the fourth quarter include automotive manufacturing with energy sales growth of 7%, petroleum refining with 6%, and lumber with 9%. This expansion in fourth quarter energy usage was supported by 3% year-over-year growth in manufacturing jobs, twice the national rate, and 1.4% growth in total employment in our geographic footprint. We ended 2012 with 23,000 additional residential customers. This helped drive weather-normal growth of 1.1% in residential sales, our strongest annual growth in that sector since the recession began.While our fourth quarter numbers reflect the benefit of additional customers, they also reflect the expect reversal of the year-over-year revenue anomalies to which we alluded in our last earnings call. As a reminder we explained that Georgia Power has refined its methodology for calculating unbilled sales using smart meter data. Which provides greater accuracy compared to previous years in which the process required more estimates.As we peel back the numbers and look across our operating companies, we are very encouraged by what we see in the residential sector with overall growth of 1.1% in 2012, about half of which is accounted by customer growth and the rest of increases in usage, indicative of a strengthening economy. Despite promising trends in industrial residential sales -- in industrial and residential sales, our commercial sales had remained essentially flat on a weather-normal basis. From an economic development standpoint, the potential project pipeline in our service territories remained robust.The current projection includes more than 300 potential projects represents up to 40,000 jobs and $9 billion in capital investment. The recent announcement of General Motors adding more than 1000 highly skilled IT jobs in Atlanta for its new IT service center is evidence of the type of projects our jurisdictions pursue. This announcement adds to a string of 1000 plus job announcement in 2012 that included major companies like, Airbus, Caterpillar, Ingalls Shipbuilding, and Baxter International. In fact since the fourth quarter of 2010, we have seen a total of ten such announcements, representing nearly $6 billion in capital expenditures.However, many companies continue to delay final decisions on expansions and relocations until Congress further resolves looming fiscal issues. These conditions which were noted during our last earnings call, continue to persist despite congressional action in December on income, dividend and capital gains taxes. Earlier this month we re-engaged with our economic round table participants. As a reminder, this group consists of several regional economists and executives from a handful of our largest customers. The round table participants help to validate the observations we glean from our fourth quarter sales results and the assumptions we made in our 2013 forecast, which includes forecasted GDP growth of approximately 2%.Most of the economists believe that most of this growth will be driven by the higher than 2% growth in the second half of 2013, offsetting what is likely to be a slow start for 2013 while Congress contemplates its fiscal issues. Most outlooks include an assumption for an improved global economy in 2013, which could positively affect exports out of our region. Industrial production is seen as improving with an emphasis on business oriented goods. Participants also observed that housing markets in the region are continuing to rebound, with foreclosures decreasing and inventories of developed lots falling towards replacement levels.These trends along with continued positive migration into the region, bode well for continued residential, customer growth in our markets. Finally, our round table participants were cautious in their outlook for the commercial sector, but do see growth emerging particularly in the private sector. That brings us to a forecast of total retail sales for 2013 which we are projecting at 1%. This forecast is usually the midpoint of a range of potential economic scenarios that result in sales growth of between 0.7% and 1.3%.Industrial sales growth is projected to be 2% for 2013. This growth rate is reflective of previously announced industrial expansions as well as a continuation of some of the increased activity we saw in the fourth quarter of 2012.Commercial sales growth is projected to be 0.5% while residential sales are expected to grow at 0.6%. Our residential customer growth assumptions for 2013 are consistent with our 2012 results of 23,000 new customers.Now I\u2019d like to update you on our latest capital expenditure forecast and our financing plan. Our three year forecast for capital expenditures total $16.5 billion. As in previous years, the largest component of our forecast is maintenance, which totals $4.2 billion for the three year period. Environmental compliance spending, including our capital cost to comply with the MATS rule is also significant at $3.6 billion.Of the $2.4 billion three year total CapEx for Southern Power, approximately $2 billion is allocated as placeholders for potential acquisitions for new self-built projects that fit Southern Power\u2019s rigid investment criteria, including a requirement for long term contracts with credit-worthy counterparties.These placeholders contemplate additional solo projects, primarily in the southwestern United States and efficient natural gas generation projects which are a prominent part of Southern Power\u2019s portfolio.As mentioned in our last earnings call, we are exploring opportunities to apply our low risk business model in other regions of the country where co-ops, municipals and perhaps even other investor owned utilities would benefit from securing long term capacity through bilateral agreements.Moving now to our financing plans, our forecast assumes long term security issuances of $9 billion for 2013 to 2015. This financing plan does not assume any refunding or refinancing of existing securities, something we have done extensively over the past few years to lower the average cost of our portfolio to 3.8%, while lengthening the average maturity to 15 years.We continue to target a consolidated equity ratio of approximately 44%. Based on the capital expenditure forecast of our traditional operating companies alone, we do not anticipate any equity needs for the three year period. To the extent Southern Power finds projects that meet its rigorous investment criteria, we could need as much as $300 million in any one year.Now I\u2019d like to share our earnings guidance for 2013. For 2013 we are establishing an annual guidance range of $2.68 to $2.80, which represents a growth rate of approximately 4% over our 2012 EPS guidance range and encompasses numerous planning scenarios for normal variances in weather, the economy and operating expenses. Our long term earnings growth rate is 4% to 6% represented by a range extrapolated from the top and bottom of our 2013 annual guidance.This slight revision in our long term growth rate is consistent with the significant reduction we\u2019ve seen in environmental compliance capital which has been further reduced in our latest update to reflect the longer compliance horizon for potential coal ash and water rules and the cumulative effect of slow economic growth over the past few years.One final note on our earnings outlook. Our first quarter 2013 earnings per share estimate is $0.51. As most Southern Company investors know, our common dividend has been a key component of our value proposition for decades. 2012 marked the 11th year in a row that our dividend was increased, a practice that continued even during the difficult economic times of just a few years ago.We have always taken the long term view of dividends and recognized that the informational content of our policy around dividends and actions is important. Supported by the earnings growth assumed in our guidance, our financial plan contemplates a growing dividend consistent with the path chartered over the past several years. I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.Thomas FanningThanks, Art. I am always proud and almost never surprised by our ability to deliver superior results. For more than a decade now, Southern Company has maintained a singular steadfast commitment to a low risk, customer focused business model, that in turn has resulted in an outstanding track record of operational and financial performance.Our ability to sustainably deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity continues to be the foundation for our success. We maintain that same focus for Southern Power, remaining committed to a low risk business model that deliver exceptional value to shareholders. As we do with our traditional operating companies, we keep it very simple with Southern Power. In short, we require Southern Power to first sign long-term bilateral contract, second, partner with creditworthy counterparties, primarily co-ops and municipals, and third, take no or minimal fuel or transmission risk.Sticking to this model has produced solid results for Southern Power since it was formed in 2001, and has kept that business unit poised to deliver continued value and growth going forward. Our ultimate objective is to deliver superior risk adjusted total shareholder return. Over the last decade this has been driven by strong earned returns for our traditional operating companies, steadily growing cash flow and earnings at Southern Power, stable earnings per share growth, and finally, a sustainable, growing dividend.All of this, while maintaining the best overall financial integrity and credit ratings in the industry. In today's uncertain world, none of in this industry know what challenges may lie ahead. Southern Company has demonstrated a track record of anticipating future challenges and managing them successfully for the benefit of our customers and our investors. We appreciate your interest in Southern Company and we take seriously our obligation to build successfully for the future.We are now ready to take your questions. So operator, we will now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.Greg Gordon - ISI GroupI can't complain. Always looking good on Bloomberg as usual.Thomas FanningThat\u2019s enough out of you.Greg Gordon - ISI GroupSo, I guess, when I look at your earnings growth forecast for the next several years as articulated by the growth rate, your growth rate, you know the high end is [plenty lower], you are at 4% to 6% versus what you thought you could do on a multiyear basis, off of last year\u2019s base starting which was 4% to 7%. And I know a lot of stuff moves around in your CapEx forecast, where you are spending money, how you are financing it. But if you could summarize what are the key factors that have caused you to reduce the high-end of the growth rate for us, that would be helpful.Thomas FanningYeah, it was simple. What we said last year -- I know we got a lot of questions before that, how do you hit 7% growth year-over-year-over-year. And it really dealt with the outcome on the MATS compliance. Remember last year and even the year\u2019s before, we were projecting with the proposed MATS rule, something like 17 bag houses. As a result of the final rule, recall there were like 11 major segments of comments that were filed by the EEI that we were influential in. One of those dealt with schedule, ten of them dealt with some technical issues that were critically important. And as a result of the resolution of it, at least four of those ten, it\u2019s caused us not to build 17 baghouses but 4.There were other corresponding changes but the net effect is that CapEx over the three year period is less than what we have projected. The other thing that is in our CapEx that you will notice is that we have pushed out CapEx associated with ash and water. So we\u2019ll see how that resolves itself, but in the three year period we\u2019re not showing any CapEx associated with proposed rules there. That\u2019s the difference.Greg Gordon - ISI GroupGot you. But it doesn\u2019t have to do in any meaningful way with a re-evaluation of what you think your authorized returns will be or whether or not certain assets are going to go fully into rates over time like Vogtle or the way that the Kemper County plant is going to be treated?Thomas FanningIt has absolutely nothing to do with those issues.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.Can you just comment your expectations for O&M relative to \u201912 and your \u201913 guidance? And then secondly, probably five years, six years back you were pretty bullish on the outlook for Southern Power and then you tapered expectations a little bit. It sounds like you\u2019re getting more positive. Is that a fair read of your commentary?Art BeattiePaul, let me deal with your O&M question first. If you look over the last three or four years, none of those years was normal in terms of our O&M spend. We were either holding back or spending more because of good weather. So it\u2019s an excellent question. But let\u2019s approach it this way from giving you a baseline to work with. If you take 2012 nonfuel O&M and you add $200 million to $250 million back to that number and then grow that number by 3.5% to 4% we think you\u2019re going to be in the ballpark of what a normal level of nonfuel O&M level would be that we\u2019re expecting. Now the second part of your question relates to Southern Power.Thomas FanningSo let me jump on that one. I guess it\u2019s on your slide pack on page 20. We have some charts that show a variety of statistics, including Southern Power net income. You may note that in 2012 we had our best year ever, earning net income at $175 million. We did have one downturn that was in \u201910 and that was really associated with the downturn in the economy. So that explains that. Yeah, we are bullish for Southern Power. They have this wonderful I think business model that we\u2019ve replicated to have a risk profile similar to our traditional operating companies whereby we have a long term bilateral contract credit-worthy counterparties, little or no, fewer transmission risks. I think that works wonderfully.We think frankly we\u2019ve been turning down business kind of outside the Southeast and think that we\u2019re willing to consider some projects outside the southeast, but which meet our rigorous business model. Frankly we think this is a gap that we can help fill in some of the deregulated markets, particularly in the near term Texas and MISO. So let\u2019s just see what happens there. Otherwise we\u2019ve been reasonably active in the renewable space. So you\u2019ve noticed our announcements on solo projects. We\u2019ve done the biomass deal, been immensely successful there in Texas. So I think we can continue that track record and continue to build for the future.Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.Then Tom just with your financing plans, you\u2019re not excluding any opportunity to Southern Power. Did I hear you say there\u2019s no equity need? Does that mean no DRIP or new program shares? How should I interpret that?Art BeattieWe would \u2013 in 2012, Paul, we actually bought back some shares with the proceeds from stock options that basically left us at a close to zero point in 2012. We would expect to do the same thing outside of Southern Power\u2019s equation in \u201913 through \u201915 as well.Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.So basically again excluding assumptions around Southern Power, a flattish share count for the next few years?Art BeattieYes.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.When I look at your, again going back to your \u201913 guidance, if I look at 2012, you reported 268 and then you told us that weather versus normal hurt you by about $0.11. So on a weather-normalized basis you would have been around 279 if my math is right. So your \u201913 guidance, 268 to 280, gets at best you are flat and it could be down if you take the midpoint or lower. I know Art talked about O&M, but is there anything else that\u2019s causing, assuming normalized weather, why would you guys be flat at best in \u201913 versus \u201912?Art BeattieWell, Ali, again, we talked a lot in the last call about the uncertainty around the economic outcomes in \u201913 and we are still allowing for, I guess, some of that downside effect. Because there is still a lot of unknowns out there. There is still a lot of people on the sidelines waiting for signals to move ahead. And that has nothing to do with, you have added back weather to the number without considering what we would have done with O&M. And that facts are, we cut a drastic amount of O&M in 2012 in order to offset that weather impact. And so you can't make the single assumption that your earnings would have been, if weather had been normal, just adding back that piece. It just doesn\u2019t work that way.Thomas FanningI mean, think about it. We improved earnings by $0.11 an we had headwinds of year-over-year weather of $0.20. So we have kind of been through this before I think. We do manage our O&M based on the strength of the system, based on weather. Also with the advent of weather related revenue, we take advantage too, in essence fix the roof while the sun is out. And actually [add to] our maintenance. The evidence that this all works is borne by the fact that our operational performance in terms of our generation fleet, in terms of our transmission, distribution, in terms of our customer satisfaction numbers, are spectacular.Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.Okay. And Tom, if I go and take it a little bit further, does in your assumptions you have assumed 1% weather-normalized sales growth, kind of mid-point for \u201913. Now, as I recall the old equation, that equates to about $0.08 or $0.09 of earnings incrementally in \u201913. So it looks to me that it\u2019s all coming back to the cost side, going back Art you talked quite about the comparisons. Is that fair, I mean because you are getting the weather-normalized sales growth in there and yet, again, you are seeing flattish comparisons. Is it all coming on the cost side?Thomas FanningI hate to say that it\u2019s all coming on one side. I think what we have been able to demonstrate on the cost side is that we have been able to manage our business exceptionally well from an operational and customer standpoint. And respond to changing conditions, be they economic, be they weather, be whatever. This notion of value on, counting Southern as one of the handful of companies they follow, is having an earnings predictability score of 100%. But we can never predict the future. We have been able to provide for earnings per share growth over the years that is regular, predictable, sustainable. And that strategy has enabled us to have a dividend policy that likewise is regular, predictable and sustainable and allows us to have dividend increases even during downturns in the economy when a lot of people pulled back.I think the strategy we are putting forward here with earnings per share range that we have and forward expectations of 4% to 6% earnings per share growth will enable us to continue in that vain for years to come.Art BeattieAli, I think there is another element there as well. I mean you think about economic growth, we certainly didn\u2019t get the weather-normal sales growth we expected in \u201912. So you are starting from a lower base there. And our growth rate around the economy and our sales growth continues to be less than historical levels. So until we get back all of our segments back into the full engagement, it\u2019s going to be difficult to move the range higher than what we have outlined here.Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.Understood. Tom, one quick one on the contractor dispute at Vogtle. Any updates to share?Thomas FanningNot really. I really don\u2019t have much to say there.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Dan Eggers with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.Kevin Cole - Credit SuisseThis is actually Kevin on the same side. I guess another question on demand growth. So I guess we fully appreciate your comments regarding uncertainty around DC policy and the evaluation that you're telling from cautiously optimistic to just cautious last quarter, but nonetheless it sure seems like the Southeast continues to outpace the rest of the country. So how should we think about the visible industrial recovery working into a residential demand recovery? And what do you think the likelihood is that we're actually receiving the residential recovery today but\u2026?Thomas FanningDan, I wish you guys could see how we obsessively prepare for these calls and we really work on our language and try \u2013 we really struggled with what our language should be about our expectations and I forget what we said, we were optimistically cautious this time. Listen, we are seeing signs of recovery here. While we did he see a flattening in the last half of '12 of industrial sales, when we look at our economic development backlog and we have \u2013 think about this, only 0.3% of manufacturing facilities employ 1,000 people or more, but Southeast over the last two years has gotten 10 of those and in fact, we've gotten five recently and some of those could be significant.Airbus has 1,000 people, direct employees but we think 4,000 indirect. You add on top of that Caterpillar and Baxter and Ingalls and a variety of other things, GM IT workers, and we're starting to see I think in the residential and the customer growth numbers the fact that we are adding jobs in the Southeast. Look, we could be conservative here. I'll admit that. But let me give you one more comment on the fiscal side. When we gave you the comment in October on that call, I have to compliment our economic forecasting guys and the marketing people at Southern that are very close to their customers. I think we were right on the money with what happened in the economy in the Southeast and I feel good kind of about where we are now. I think the issues \u2013 remember we talked about uncertainty related to fiscal issues and the fiscal cliff and all that. We did avoid the fiscal cliff in a so-called way but, I would argue what we really did was a tax patch. It was helpful and certainly helpful to our industry and any dividend related investment, but we still have fiscal issues to deal with.The constructive kind of evolution of that discussion really goes to the notion I think that Congress will not use the national debt ceiling as hostage in these deliberations. Rather, moving to a more constructive approach of proposing solutions for example that are sensible, like requiring the Senate to come up with a budget. So we still have big issues, but I think the issues are being handled in a more constructive manner. And I think, therefore, our kind of color on where we believe the economy is headed is slightly more bullish than we were, say, in the third quarter. We are expecting a backend loaded economic recovery but I feel pretty good about it right now based on what we see.Kevin Cole - Credit SuisseOkay. Then your comments on I guess with the \u2013 I guess give us \u2013 you have visibility into backlog of industrial drops coming to your region and then like to Greg's question, it seems like the growth rate today was lower due to a deferral of CapEx versus an abandonment of CapEx. Should we assume that the growth rate \u2013 I guess the legacy growth rate of 5 to 7% could possibly return for the next guidance season or for 2014?Thomas FanningWho knows what will happen in the future? But yeah, the near term \u2013 the Greg Gordon answer was exactly the right answer. How we got to 7% before was building a lot of bag houses with 17. It was that kind of CapEx environment, because we were successful in arguing some of the technical issues on HAP MACT for the benefit of our customers. We're not going to spend as much CapEx complying with MATS and therefore, because we're deploying less capital, the growth rate drops on the top side from 7 to 6, but the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Who knows what happens outside the three-year period? And recall, the CapEx associated with ash and with 316B and a variety of those issues, are really out of this three-year period. So the presumption as you're making it are in the next three-year period. We'll only comment on the three year period we see ahead. Look, I think the fundamentals for our business are exceedingly strong. And I think the cards we have, while we all have challenges, I am very bullish on our ability to deal with the challenges of the future and maintain this kind of growth rate. I think our track record speaks for itself.OperatorThank you. Our next question is from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please proceed with your question.Kit Konolige - BGCWith regard to Southern Power, does your interest in other regions now have anything to do with a perception that there is a lower growth rate in the core region?Thomas FanningNot really, but I mean it is a little slower. When you think about kind of our focus is one either renewables and that has been where the renewables are, desert, Southwest largely, a little bit in Texas, otherwise gas-fired generation. When you look at I think some of the flaws of the deregulated markets, the so called organized markets, they have not been able to build within those market structures long-term capacity commitments. We think we have demonstrated success in a business model which permits those kinds of investments to occur. So we see some attractive markets available.Southern Power has brought some of those deals back to us and we have kind of said, no, we like where we are. The question we have been asking ourselves over the past year or so is, why not. Why shouldn\u2019t we pursue those kinds of opportunities so long as we can still meet the rigorous business model that we have in place. I think we can do that.Kit Konolige - BGCAnd can you give us a little more color on the, kind of a little closer view of what types of projects you would be looking at what regions, I think you mentioned Texas and MISO?Thomas FanningWell, Kit, it would be similar to what we have been doing. Southern Power\u2019s capacity is something like 95% gas-fired. So it\u2019s going to be combined cycles, maybe some CT. And the other thing I would just add to you, when we think about the Southern Power strategy, this is not a significant contributor in the next year or two or three. Rather, our strategy here positions us well a long term. To say it another way, we are going to be able to hit the 4% to 6% growth even without Southern Power adding new projects in any other region.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.Mark Barnett - MorningstarJust a couple of quick questions. I know this is kind of a ball that\u2019s going to stay up in the air until it doesn\u2019t. But do you have any kind of update on your expectations for those DOE loans for Vogtle. I mean whether around timing or size? I know you can replace them pretty easily but just some general thoughts there?Art BeattieYeah, Mark, this is Art. We continue to negotiate with DOE. We have extended those discussion officially through mid-year. We have had some recent positive movement in those discussions and we still remain helpful that we will be able to come to an agreement. But at the end of the day we are still looking too at the fact that we have been able to finance a lot of Georgia Power\u2019s needs at record levels of interest rates. So we still have to make the judgment about what's in the best interest of our customer. So we continue to move in that direction and hopefully we can come to some agreement with them on the loans this year. But we will be hearing more about that throughout the year.Mark Barnett - MorningstarOkay. And I guess maybe a follow-up to some of the other questions about Southern Power. You know you mentioned there is going to be some upside, it\u2019s obviously going to be beyond the three-year window. Does that mean that you are not currently participating in any RFPs, whether in the Southeast or outside.Thomas FanningReally, I don\u2019t want to comment on anything they are doing from a commercial standpoint. I mean, in terms of participating with RFPs and everything else, if you just look at the trajectory of net income in the package that we have given you, I would follow, if I were doing planning assumptions, I would follow that trajectory.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock AssociatesGood morning, guys. I apologize if I missed this but the \u2013 I noticed that your growth \u2013 I was wondering whether that 0.6% sales growth for GDP was still the case with your 2013 sales growth forecast and if I am \u2013 if it is, am I looking at it that you guys are assuming something between \u2013 something basically at the top end of about 2.2% and something more likely in the midpoint under 2% for your GDP assumption?Thomas FanningGDP growth assumption is around 2.Art BeattieIs around 2, yeah.Thomas FanningAnd therefore our sales growth assumption is around 1 with a range around that.Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock AssociatesOkay. So you guys are now using about a 50% -- the 0.6% number is basically what you guys are still using. Is that basically the way to think about it, there's been no change in that?Thomas FanningYeah. And so you can argue formulation. You know us. We like to be a little conservative.Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock AssociatesOkay. And then when we look at the\u2026Thomas FanningPaul, let me add one thing. It\u2019s just kind of interesting (inaudible). There's been great interest in net of energy efficiency, are we still seeing consumption growth and in fact, we are. We've done more science on that work that we showed a lot of you all in October or I guess it was November, the financial conference. And in fact, what we're seeing is for the Southeast anyway, energy efficiency has almost no influence on the consumption of our customers. 88% or so of usage can be explained by either the income growth of our customers, the price of our product and weather. If you account for those three things, you're speaking for virtually all of the usage growth.Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock AssociatesOkay. So you're seeing very little impact from energy efficiency in your service territory so far?Thomas FanningWe are seeing energy efficiency, make no mistake. It's just not reducing usage. You may want to think about it as producing in essence a dividend to disposable personal income and therefore people are having money to spend or more stuff.Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock AssociatesI got you. So what they don't \u2013 so what they save with various appliances they're re-spending on other electric consumption? Is that the way to think about that?Thomas FanningYeah and just think about where the economy is going. We all have these goofy devices. We all have iPads and iPhones and bigger plasma TVs and everything else and when we see the progression that people are moving from small homes to apartments into you now primary housing, we see a growth in square footage per person, if you will. We also have seen associated with a recovering economy growth in personal income. All of these things contribute to usage growth.Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock AssociatesOkay. Now, with the residential sales growth does seem very strong in the fourth quarter and I'm sorry if I missed this again, why was it so strong in the fourth quarter? Was it because of the employment figures you were talking about? I wasn't clear on that exactly, 5% if that\u2019s right.Art BeattieYou recall in the third quarter call we talked about a lot of that unbilled issue that we thought was going to rebound in the fourth quarter and that is in fact is what happened. If you look back at the third quarter, for residential sales it was like negative 2.1%. In the fourth quarter, it was positive around 5%, I think.Thomas FanningYeah, a little over 5.Art BeattieSo what you saw here is a rebound. Now, the percentages aren't alike, but they shouldn't be because you're moving kilowatt hours out of a very heavy quarter of usage into a quarter of usage which is rather light, so the percentages are going to get skewed.Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock AssociatesOkay. And just on an annual basis, we don't have really any of that? Is that all evened out for the year pretty much?Thomas FanningYeah. I think you're more comfortable and more safe looking at the year-to-date number.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Brian Chin with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.Brian Chin \u2013 CitigroupGood afternoon. More of a federal policy question. There's been a lot of media chatter since the inauguration speech about Obama's conclusion of climate change in that. And Tom, obviously, you're pretty close with a number of the key opinion makers in Congress and on Capitol Hill. With regards to this thought that the executive branch could try to resuscitate carbon regulation on carbon tax, any sort of updated thoughts there that you can give us relative to what you told us at [EGI]?Thomas FanningYeah. So, I think there's very little chance of anything like that getting through Congress. So, you're right to kind of look at, will EPA be able to put something in place that will advance that cause. So, right now we know that EPA is evaluating or has made a proposal on new sources. Interestingly Southern is the only company still committed to robust proprietary research and development. We have developed our own technology. The Kemper County plant actually meets and exceeds the proposed new standards for carbon for new generation. So, that's kind of interesting. We'll see how that goes. There are lots of comments going in and we'll wait eagerly to see what the final rule looks like.But it is pretty clear that if the proposed rule is anything like, I mean, the final rule is anything like the proposed rule, conventional coal generation is just not doable. So, they are really making an energy policy statement there. One of the things that I have been pretty vocal about here lately, and that is this energy policy issue. I've been very clear that energy policy is the purview of Congress. Congress has the portfolio, really as we do, in thinking broadly about the ramifications of such policy mechanisms. For example, we say we need clean, safe, reliable, affordable energy. EPA will tend to focus on clean, without taking into account perhaps all the other issues that are so important to balance for our customers' wealth there.I go back to the families we serve, 48% of which make 40,000 or less, those folks make tough kitchen-table economic decisions every day. Their demand for energy is relatively inelastic, and so anything the EPA does which adds cost to energy tends to slow down our economic recovery and causes them to make choices for things like housing, healthcare, food, and education. These are broad policy areas that are better handled in congress rather than a single regulatory agency. We will be enjoined in this discussion as it evolves in the months ahead.Brian Chin \u2013 CitigroupGreat. And any thoughts on carbon regulation for pre-existing plants being executed by EPA without Congressional (approval)?Thomas FanningWe'll see. Nothing to say at this point.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.Michael Lapides - Goldman SachsTwo questions, unrelated to each other. First question, can you talk a bit about Vogtle just in terms of there was testimony in the seventh monitoring report. Regarding just potential delays, especially if the concrete pour didn't occur in the fourth quarter of 2012. Just kind of give a broad update in terms of just where you are versus the schedule and how the schedule may or may not move. And then second, when you think about Southern Power, there are more infrastructure funds and various energy funds out there than there probably are projects, and you have what is a collection of very good assets that many of which are contracted for very a long time. Just curious if you've thought about monetizing that business in terms of, is that a business that's potentially better off in the hands of an entity that might capitalize it with significantly more leverage than a publically traded utility company might use.Thomas FanningYeah, so I'm going to hit that last one first. We've kind of chatted about that for years. Wait a minute, we are EVA driven here. In other words, we always kind of look at what is the return on invested capital versus our cost of capital and if we can beat our cost of capital we create value for shareholders with every dollar we invest. So, that's kind of how we think about Southern Power, and from time to time there do kind of develop in the market opportunities to monetize those assets. We certainly consider that. You remember one time, it got pretty high. My caution to you there would be that we remain customer focused and many of our customers are co-ops and municipals who had entrusted us with full requirements obligations for long periods of time. We want to honor the relationship we have with those customers. That's why we get the business. And so we're not going to just transact to get the next dollar. We want to be very careful to take a long-term view on developing the customer base and growing as much value in a sensible way as possible. With respect to Vogtle, we've talked a lot about that in the past and I'm going to kind of point here to the VCM 8 that you're very aware of in terms of VCM 7 testimony that you obviously are very aware of and there was a lot of discussion back and forth about that.And recall that we were reluctant to kind of weigh in, in a very specific way in the VCM-7 discussion it was clear that our contractors were operating on mid-17, mid-18 schedule. There was a schedule that our contractors were following. We had not agreed to that schedule. Recall that the commercial dispute we have with our contractors deals with delays that came from the licensing, from the DCD to the COL and how that may manifest itself in the project. What I would do I think most constructively here is point you to our filing in VCM-8, which will be at the end of February in which we will provide more clarity about our point of view on schedule.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche BankGood afternoon. Sorry about before, I cut myself off. Tom, one question I have just on the growth story is you described 2013 as being a weak first half and then something of a rebound in the second half and then it nets out to 1%. So what kind of sales growth are you embedding in your 4 to 6 earnings growth assumption beyond '13 and how does the segment pieces look versus what you've shown us on '13 which I guess is a bit weighted to industrial and less residential?Thomas FanningThe longer term \u2013 I guess the longer \u2013 the question will go to Jonathan, make sure I'm answering this right is a longer term GDP expectations and we think that our electricity sales will migrate upwards into say a 1.4, 1.5 kind of range for years beyond this year. Is that helpful?Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche BankSo that\u2019s what underpins your 4 to 6 or if we see that could it nudge you back up again or\u2026?Thomas FanningYeah, yeah, correct. So, I'm sorry, go ahead.Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche BankNo, so just to be clear, the 4 to 6 is predicated on 1% or more like 1.5% or am I getting too cute with the numbers?Thomas FanningYou're little cute, but it's 1% this year and beyond this year 1.4 going forward. But the bigger indicator I think is watch CapEx. If you look at rate based growth based on the CapEx we're showing roughly $5.5 billion a year, augmented by whatever Southern Power does opportunistically, I feel very confident in our 4 to 6 range.Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche BankOkay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Tom. And then I'd also ask on Vogtle and there have been this press reports about the vessel being stranded in the port and issues with the Rail Corp. Can you give us your version of what's going on with that your story, how big an issue is it, is it not an issue?Thomas FanningI hope I don't offend anybody I think that's been over reported a bit. The vessel never really left the car. We turned the car back up. We put it back in the port and they\u2019re managing it. It provides interesting pictures, but I don't think it's particularly important. We'll be able to manage that little bump in the road, excuse the pun, and we'll continue with our progress in an outstanding way.Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche BankSo not something that will influence you one way or the other really?Thomas FanningNo sir.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.Anthony Crowdell \u2013 Jefferies & CompanyA question on Kemper. In the press \u2013 some of the utility press had a story on Monday about the Supreme Court in Mississippi was questioning the constitutionality of the, I guess, the settlement you entered into last Thursday. Could you provide any color on that?Art BeattieYeah, Anthony, this is Art. There are a couple of issues at Supreme Court, one being the Sierra Club's appeal. There is another issue that is brought by an individual out of Hattiesburg that is challenging the constitutionality of the Baseload Act. Basically that would provide for cash CWIP before the plant was operational.Thomas FanningAnd then the third one was this issue of actually the company, who is really kind of muted by the company and the commission agreeing to the settlement agreement in front of the Supreme Court. Those folks have basically put that issue in advance. Our expectation is ultimately that piece will be dismissed. So of the three pieces, one has kind of been muted by the settlement agreement, we think it will be dismissed in the future. The second is an individual from Hattiesburg, on the other side is the Attorney General of Mississippi, and then the third is just the Sierra Club appealing the second amended certificate, which we think is fine.Anthony Crowdell \u2013 Jefferies & CompanyIs there a time frame when the Supreme Court has to act on this or they actually don't have a window when they have to give a decision on it?Thomas FanningNo timeframe that we know of.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Andrew Wiesel with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.Angie Storozynski - Macquarie ResearchIt's actually Angie Storozynski. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I have a question regarding the O&M reduction in the fourth quarter. Could you tell us how much of that was associated with the Hurricane Sandy?Art BeattieYeah, Angie, there was a number of things that influenced the fourth quarter. One of those was -- you hit it right on the head, was our sending, I can't remember the number--Thomas Fanning2,400.Art BeattiePeople up north, some were there for up to two weeks. So, that helped offset some O&M that we expected to be spent in our service territory.Thomas FanningThat was about $0.01. Little under a $0.01 but you round up to $0.01.Art BeattieSome other issues were bad debt expense was way down. It was not only down in the fourth quarter but it was actually down throughout the (inaudible) compared year-over-year. That provided basically another $0.01 benefit.Thomas FanningAnd that was lower bills. So, you had the benefit of lower fuel expense. You had mild weather. You had personal income growth associated with the economy. So, as essentially disposable income went up, bad debt expense went down.Art BeattieYeah. And then there were a variety of small accounting adjustments that might add to half a penny, maybe a little more. I won't go into that detail but we also had lower O&M than expected. We kind of back ended our activities on O&M to the third and fourth quarter. So, that's why you saw more of it in the fourth. But the facts are that because we ran so much gas generation last year we were able to push a lot of maintenance outages that may have been scheduled on some of our coal units because they just weren't needed as much and we had some room to work there.Thomas FanningIn fact, what was it, our eastern coal units had a capacity factor in the high 20. So, they just weren't stressed very much. The other thing is, along with Smart Grid, along with our smart meters, along with a variety of other initiatives that we have in place, the system is just operating more efficiently. We make systematic improvements in our business practices. We create optionality in our expenses and I think our 26,000 employees did a great job.Angie Storozynski - Macquarie ResearchSecondly, the share buyback in the fourth quarter, I might have missed that in previous quarters, have you done that before?Art BeattieWell, we were trying to match our equity with what was going on in our construction program. And we target approximately 44% equity ratio. So in order to get there we had talked about, I guess two quarters ago, two calls ago, about buying back some of that equity that was being issued to keep us at a certain target. We ended up the year at a 43.7% equity ratio which is kind of where we like to see it. So, we're right on target with where we expected.Thomas FanningAt the same time, we also funded a pension. How much?Art BeattieWell, that's true, we put $445 million into our pension this year, the end of 2012. Our PDO funding ratio was 90% for the pension liability and its 84% when you throw in the non-qualified liabilities.Thomas FanningSo we're in great shape.Art BeattieWe're great shape in that perspective.Thomas FanningSo, we really take advantage of the good performance. Sorry, go ahead. I\u2019m sorry.Angie Storozynski - Macquarie ResearchMy last question is, the load growth assumptions. I heard your views on energy efficiency. When you look at the EIA so the Department of Energy's expectations of load growth, even they expect about 1% or even slightly below 1%. So your 1.4% assumption, is that a function of migration into the Southeast?Thomas FanningWeather. EIA does not account for weather. When you account for weather \u2013 in fact, if EIA dials down their national projections for the southeast and then you account for weather, they are right on where we are. That's the difference.Art BeattieI think also to point that nationally there's a lot of talk about weather being hotter than normal last year. Actually in the southeast it was very mild. So that's something that's influencing their numbers as well.Thomas FanningThat's a point. So if look at a hot weather year and then you go to a normal weather year, the assumption would be from EIA that growth is low. But when we do it, when we strip all the stuff out and we can get very granular, I really believe our numbers.Angie Storozynski - Macquarie ResearchI was actually referring to longer term numbers, but that's fine. Thank you very much.Thomas FanningYeah. It's the same thing.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Please proceed with your question.Ashar Khan \u2013 VisiumGood afternoon. Can I just ask you \u2013 I might have missed it, I apologize. Southern Power's profile of earnings starting from what you reported in '12, going forward is \u2013 what is incorporated in this three year outlook or in the growth rate? I apologize. I might be repeating the question.Thomas FanningI don't think we really specially said anything about that. We're kind of \u2013 we're 175 this year. We're looking at 190 \u2013 175, 190. We're looking at some projected growth every year out of those guys. We generally don't comment on anything beyond the current year for that. But you should expect some continued growth trajectory.Ashar Khan \u2013 VisiumOkay. So you're saying this year, between 175 and 190?Thomas FanningYeah. We're going to hold them accountable in their pay for improving on their performance in 2012.Ashar Khan \u2013 VisiumOkay. Because I was just trying to think right -- you're putting in like nearly 15% of your CapEx dollars into the sub. So there has to be some return coming from that CapEx dollars.Thomas FanningSo it depends on what the projects are. So like if you do solar projects which typically are much more near term oriented in terms of their cash flow as a result of tax benefits, you tend to get more of a near-term pop. If you're dealing with the gas combined cycle, those tend to have a longer construction period and longer-term profiles. So it just depends on what kind of projects they do.Ashar Khan \u2013 VisiumYeah, but let me ask you, wouldn't you be more inclined to like \u2013 even my home utility over here in New York has gone into solar. Isn't like solar near term getting that something more on your wish list versus building or getting, acquiring a gas plant?Thomas FanningYou know what, we really like long-term results. We are always cautious as a matter of corporate dogma not to invest in tax-advantaged investments as a primary strategy, because that tends to be addictive behavior. In order to provide a long-term growth trajectory you have near-term pops and you've got to double it for the next year and double it for the next year and double it for the next year and they you'll find yourself on the air because of storm activity or a variety of other things in tax carry forward positions. And therefore your tax benefits aren't worth what you thought they might be. I don't like particularly \u2013 tax-advantaged investing is a long-term good corporate growth strategy. The other thing is it could disappear into the hands of Congress at any time, right? We know that we're in a revenue-hungry Congress and how long can Congress afford to hand out preferential treatment to the renewables industry? So there will be some tax-advantaged investing in the form of solar investment, I get that, but we really like building long-term books of business that we've done successfully in the past.Ashar Khan \u2013 VisiumOkay. And then can I just \u2013 Tom, I guess there was this cooperation that you guys did with Turner, right? Where does that stand in this whole scheme of things?Thomas FanningTurner has been a great partner with us in co-investing. I guess, what is the ratio 90 to 10? So we invest 90%, they invest 10%. And they are great guys.Ashar Khan \u2013 VisiumSo how much investment has gone into that joint venture, can I ask?Thomas FanningWe don't disclose that. It's not much from their side. I mean, what we do disclose of the projects we've done.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed.Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment BoardI was wondering when we think about O&M, you talked a little bit about what's going on but you've also announced a number of plant retirements, particularly small coal plants and so forth. And how should we think about that affecting O&M? Will that just be replaced with some other costs or will those costs go away related to those plants?Art BeattieWell, they are factored into our plan. They'll disappear as we move through time but those units probably have capacity factors that are well below the number Tom mentioned a moment ago. So their O&M levels and operation levels aren't very high to begin with. So, they'll be factored into our plan or reflected in our earnings growth range.Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment BoardOkay. And then I was curious. In your last quarter, you included a couple of slides that showed some upcoming construction for both Vogtle and Ratcliffe. And I just wondered if you could give us an update? Are those still the key items that we should be thinking about in the first half of '13 or are there any revisions to those slides?Art BeattieYeah, we are, Dan. Tom already mentioned I think in some of his remarks we'll begin to finish up the rebar under these preliminary amendment requests that we have been approved by the NRC. We plan to pour our first nuclear concrete sometime in March. And after that we can set the cradle which will hold the bottom head and those are expected to be done in the second quarter of the year. So that will move things within the nuclear island along a good bit. So, that's kind of where we expect to go with at least this version of milestones.Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment BoardAnd given that you had a shipping problem with the vessel, when is that -- is that onsite yet or when will that be onsite?Art BeattieI would expect it's going to be onsite within the next few weeks. Sometime within the quarter.Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment BoardWhen is it critical that it\u2019d be there, just so we could monitor that?Art Beattie(Inaudible) It's way down the list.Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment BoardHow about with the Ratcliffe, you had a number of items that you listed there.Art BeattieWell, I think the pictures that we showed you on some of the slides do more justice than any of the specific descriptions because you can see just by the pictures alone year-over-year that plant has come a long, long way. We've got specific work on the gasifiers going on. That's going to be completed sometime within the next quarter and that is a critical piece of it. We still have piping that is being installed as well. So, those are kind of the critical elements at this point.OperatorAnd at this time there are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks?Thomas FanningYeah. Thanks very much, operator. I just want to thank everybody on the phone and I appreciate everybody's kind of economy in their questions. We love to engage you in a very transparent way. We hope we've done that on this call. Certainly if there is any follow-up, Dan Tucker, Art, myself, Jimmy Stewart, others are glad to engage you on any issues you want to follow up on. Thank you for following our company, we'll do our best to earn your trust in the months ahead. Thanks very much.OperatorThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.

My name is Tommy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome to everyone to the Southern Company\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remark, there will be question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","And also as a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Tucker","Thank you, Tommy. Welcome everyone to Southern Company\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides of this conference call. To follow along during the call you can access these slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Tom Fanning","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As you know, 2013 was one of our busiest ever from a regulatory standpoint. The constructive results our traditional operating companies achieved has our company well-positioned to execute our plan to continue delivering on our core commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to customers and communities that we are privileged to serve.","Our second quarter results were consistent with expectation. Weather was normal for first time in the past few quarters and the regional economies is gaining strength as anticipated.","We achieved major milestones in our two major construction projects and continue to expand our track record of solid operational performance. In a few minutes, I will provide an update on our financial results, as well as our sales and economic outlook. But first, I\u2019d like to begin with an update on the constructions activities at Plant Vogtle and Kemper County.","We continue to make impressive progress at Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 as you can see from the recent aerial photo we have included in our slide deck. Our next major milestone will be completion of the CA05 module for Unit 3, which will comprise one of the major wall sections with the containment vessel. That module is now outside of the module assembly building and it\u2019s projected to be installed in September.","The next key element for Unit 3 will be CA01, a large containment vessel module that will have the Unit steam generators and a series of concrete pours that will raise the structural concrete currently surrounding the containment vessel bottom-head and bring it to ground-level, typically referred to as elevation 100. This concrete will ultimately serve as the foundation for the Unit 3 shield building.","We currently have 36 of the 47 sub-modules for CA01 on-site and expect to install the completed module in late fourth quarter this year or first quarter next year. The concrete pours to elevation 100 should be finish near year end 2014.","Meanwhile, the latest Vogtle construction monitoring or VCM hearing are complete with a vote scheduled for August 19th. During the hearing, the commission independent construction monitor concur that project risk are consistent with those contemplated when the project was approved and that they are being managed well by Georgia Power.","The construction monitor also concur that -- sufficient oversight is being provided to contractors and global supply chain vendors. It was further noted, that Georgia Power has been successful in meeting requirements to secure the benefits of the DOE loan, production tax credits and other option to help mitigate risk for customers. We anticipate the filing of VCM 11 at the end of August.","I am also happy to report that Plant Ratcliffe at Kemper County had a good quarter, in which Mississippi Power achieved significant construction milestones. Pressure testing is complete on both gasifier train, a significant step towards the heat up of the first gasifier, which is targeted for late third quarter or early fourth quarter 2014.","We also have achieved pipe-tight status, meaning that all piping more than 900,000 linear feet is installed, sealed and ready for testing. Successful combined cycle testing is winding down at Mississippi Power prepared to place this portion of the plant in service.","On the regulatory front, Mississippi continues to engage constructively with the Mississippi Public Utilities Commission staff. There are a number of issues involved that we are working are to resolve. In the meantime, we remain optimistic about the outcome of these discussions.","Elsewhere, I'm pleased to report that the acquisition of the Macho Springs Solar Facility by Southern Power and Turner Renewable Energy closed during the second quarter. This 50-megawatt facility, the largest solar project in New Mexico is now in commercial operation and can generate enough electricity to power more than 18,000 homes. Southern Power continuing to seek new solar and natural gas projects with long-term contract and creditworthy counterparties.","I will now turn over the call to Art for a financial and economic overview.","Art Beattie","Thanks, Tom. For the second quarter of 2014 we earned $0.68 per share, compared to $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.34 per share. For the six months ended June 30, 2014 we earned a $1.08 per share, compared with $0.43 per share for the same period in 2013, an increase of $0.65 per share.","Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2014 included an after-tax charge of $235 million or $0.26 per share, related to increased cost estimates for the construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County project recorded in the first quarter of 2014.","Earnings for the three and six months ended June 2013 included after-tax charges of $278 million or $0.32 per share and $611 million or $0.70 per share, respectively, related to the Kemper County project.","Earnings for the first six months of 2013 also include an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013.","Excluding these items, earnings for the second quarter of 2014 were $0.68 per share, compared with $0.66 per share for the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.02 per share.","Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2014, excluding these items were a $1.34 per share, compared with a $1.15 per share for the same period in 2013, an increase of $0.19 per share.","A primary driver for our 2014 second quarter results was more normal weather compared to the same period in 2013, resulting in an increase of $0.03 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis.","Second quarter 2014 earnings also benefited from increased industrial sales and retail revenue effects at our traditional operating company, earnings were offset somewhat by increases in non-fuel O&M expense. A more detailed summary of our quarter-over-quarter drivers is included in the slide deck.","Economic activity in our region continues to be led by the industrial sector, as evidenced by our 13 consecutive months of year-over-year industrial sales growth. This growth is consistent with national trend such as the ISM Manufacturing Index, which has remained above 50, signaling expansion for the past 13 months.","In our region we continue to see exports play a big role. In the second quarter of 2014 exports from Alabama and Georgia grew at 4.1%, almost twice the rate of the U.S. as a whole. Container exports from the Port of Savannah grew 6.3% in the second quarter of 2014, compared to 2.5% for all of 2013.","This growth has been broad-based across all of our traditional operating companies and across all of our top 10 industrial segments. As an additional point of interest, 90% of our major customers say that they expect their sales for the second half of 2014 to be either the same or better than the first half of 2014.","In the housing margin we continue to see signs of a slow recovery. The most recent Atlanta Federal Reserve survey of brokers and builders indicates that home sales are up from last year. Inventory levels continue to fall and prices continue to increase albeit modestly.","Overall, builders and brokers expect activity in the Southeast to continue to increase. These trends are consistent with our internal measure of new housing activity, new connects, which were up 17% in the first six months of 2014, compared to the same period last year, with positive growth across all of our traditional operating company.","These findings which are consistent with our expectations for the period were underscored at the most recent meeting of our economic roundtable earlier this month. As a reminder, this is a group of regional economist and executives from a handful of our largest customers.","Overall, the economic roundtable affirmed our view that of the continuing momentum behind the industrial sector and the continued recovery of the residential sector. The group's consensus is that GDP during the first quarter of 2014 was not consistent with employment or industrial production trends and that quarter-over-quarter GDP growth of 3% can be expected for the remainder of this year.","Several of the economist on the roundtable noted that income growth continues to be weak and will likely remain so until underemployed workers are absorbed. This weakness in income growth is reflected in Southern Company's continued weakness in use per customer growth, as well as a signs of continued discipline on consumer spending patterns.","All of this data is reflected in Southern Company\u2019s sales results, industrial sales were up 3% in the second quarter of 2004, compared with the second quarter of 2013, with all 10 of our top sectors demonstrating growth.","For example, chemicals were up 5%, paper was up 6% and transportation was up 7%. As a group, the housing related segments of textiles, stone clay and glass, and lumber were all up 3%.","Meanwhile, weather normal residential sales were down 0.6% and weather normal commercial sales were flat in the second quarter of 2014, compared to the second quarter of 2013.","Looking forward, we continue to see this ongoing recovery reflected in strong economic development activity. One example of this is the Elba Island LNG Terminal where a joint partnership of Shell Oil and Southern LNG, a Kinder Morgan Company is adding natural gas export capability at its existing facility in Savannah. Once fully operational, the associated electrical load increase will be 180-megawatt making it one of the largest customers in our service territory.","Meanwhile, in Alabama we continue to see growth among Tier 1 and Tier 2 auto suppliers for assembly plants we serve, as well as inquiries for suppliers that will serve the future Airbus assembly facility.","Our economic development pipeline remains robust. We are currently tracking some 330 prospective projects, representing 37,000 new jobs and $14 billion in capital expenditures.","From this pipeline more than 8,000 jobs were announced during the second quarter of 2014, a 23% increase over the same period in 2013, with the potential for $1.3 billion in capital expenditures.","Now I'd like to share our earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2014, which will be $1.06 per share.","I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Tom Fanning","Thanks, Art. As I've said many times before, Southern Company values the opportunity to engage constructively at all levels of government for the benefit of the customers we serve.","This week we had another such opportunity in the formal public hearing on the EPA proposed rule for greenhouse gas emissions at existing power plant. Several of our company senior officers participated in the hearing yesterday and today both in the nation\u2019s capital and here at Atlanta.","We continue to have concerns about the impact of this proposal, particularly with regard to the reliability and affordability of our nation's energy supply. We are currently reviewing the proposed rule and will submit our formal comments to the EPA in keeping with the established timeline.","Our initial review, however, has revealed three primary reasons, why we believe the current proposed rule should be amended. First, the proposed rule significantly overreaches the EPA's authority by attempting to regulate activities that are clearly beyond the scope of the Clean Air Act and other existing legislation, and that have historically been under the purview of the states.","Second, the detail of the proposed standard do not appear to be workable, relying upon unrealistic standard of performance and violating long standing regulatory construct.","And third and perhaps most importantly, the proposal is not in the best interest of electric consumers due it potential negative impact on retail prices and system reliability. As we have in the past we will continue to engage constructively on all fronts in this important policy debate.","We are now ready to take your questions. So, Operator, we'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) And we will proceed with our first question from the line of Greg Gordon from ISI Group. Go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Greg","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. I apologize if you answered any in the beginning, because I was a little bit late. I saw that things were looking up at Kemper this quarter you didn't have any further cost escalation beyond your current budget? As we get into the list of activities on the bottom right of page six, at what point over the course of the year should, if you are going to have further slippage, should we be focus -- what are the key things we should be focused on and when will they be incurring?","Tom Fanning","So, yeah, we actually talked about this slide, getting ready for the call, year around our 95% of the way through construction. There will be tales of construction, when we say construction is complete there will be tales of construction that go right into just about in service.","So saying its complete is kind of a term of our, but we\u2019re very close to kind of being there in a substantive way. The real risk, I think, going forward relate to start-up and of course, there are the normal issues related to start-up.","But the one think we always say to ourselves is the unknown, unknown and that is, there could be as we go though the start-up process, potential equipment failure that we don\u2019t contemplate or have quick inventory or quick turnaround solution for that could impact schedule. But with respect to the risk associate with construction, those are winding down pretty quickly. The risks that largely remain in front of us are the risk that relate to start-up.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Okay. Second question, which is more of a tactical or short-term question just because we've had such a huge build in gas production, natural gas production and we've had a decline in the amount of gas being burned for power gen nationwide and so natural gas prices, partly because of weather, obviously, natural gas prices have fallen a lot?","As you look at the rest of the summer, how do you see your gas burn relative to what you burned last year, because if I look at the very short-term data, I noticed that, it's gotten cooler down there over the last few days but you are still burning off a lot of gas relative to where you would be burning it, where the weather was, let's say, a month ago or two months ago? Is there something going on where we should expect a higher gas burn for the balance of the summer or should we assume that if the weather continues to be cool, that you will back down on the gas?","Tom Fanning","Well, so, Greg, I think you are all over the question, right. We do steadfast economic dispatch, so whatever the cheapest energy is local provide and whatever energy resource provide the cheapest energy as what we will use.","Look a year ago when gas prices were moderately higher and you had coal prices moderately cheaper, I am sorry, just the opposite, gas prices were cheaper, we burnt a lot more natural gas than we did coal.","What we are seeing in this year is similar to what we projected and that is kind of in the 40% range for both coal and gas from an energy standpoint. We are slightly ahead so far in \u201814 on coal relative to gas. But I would argue with gas dropping down here recently right in the $4 range that gas will pick up a little bit. So my sense is kind of going forward is kind of where we thought we would be in the general range of 40-40 for both coal and gas. I can you specific number but I\u2019m not sure the differences are meaningful.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Okay. Thank you very much.","Tom Fanning","","You bet.","Operator","","Thank you. And we will go to our next question is from the line of Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Go ahead.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Dan.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Hey. Tom, can you just give a little your clarification as, the headlines hit on kind of the discovery process of new nuclear. Can you just maybe explain more broadly how you were thinking about that?","Tom Fanning","Sure. Yeah. Sure. Absolutely. It was funny how that got reported. It\u2019s actually on the YouTube website. I gave a speech, I think, I was keynoting at the Bipartisan Policy Center along with Energy Secretary, Ernest Moniz, and with all that energy innovation and after the talk was given, I had a few questions-and-answers. And I think this was the first question and it really went to, why isn\u2019t anybody else building nuclear and I went on to describe kind of what kind of companies could build new nuclear and what kind of had to be in place and I referred to different energy markets in the United States and at the very end of the comment, I said, something like, and what, I would love to be in position by the end of the year to announce that we are building that was starting even more nuclear.","In doing that, everybody should know, that the way you start the process is the way we start the process at Vogtle 3 and 4, and that is you would begin a permitting process. Remember too that from kind of beginning to end is 10 years or so. So we are really talking about nuclear generation that could be in service in the middle of next decade and the first process that you start is the permitting process, where we would only do that as we did with Vogtle 3 and 4 with concurrence of our state regulatory jurisdiction, whichever one was relevant at that time. That I was talking it and what that does is preserves the option to build a nuclear if in fact that looks like it desirable from a customer standpoint in the future.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Tom, with the carbon rule sitting out there or with the review going on, what do you think is going to be the legal course as you guys look at the rule if it stays roughly as written in the final decision and do you guys think there is a potential for a stay or is that too big of an ask?","Tom Fanning","That's a fascinating question, Dan. The overreach here to me is so clear and it\u2019s interesting. The EPA says we are giving everybody flexibility. They can\u2019t give you what is not there to give.","The inference must be the somehow Congress via the Clean Air Act gave EPA more power over the electric utility industry and new power over relatively what has been the purview of the state than even the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.","In other words, somehow EPA is taking the authority to require in some respect renewable portfolio of standard, state energy efficiency standards, they are taking the power to obviate what has been the long standing practice of economic dispatch and incorporate a concept of environmental dispatch and in the course raise prices significantly and perhaps, reduce reliability.","My sense is this overreach is so great. I think there is, number one, a significant opportunity to amend the rule before it becomes final, and number two, to work in whatever jurisdiction is sensible to achieve a better structure or better timeframe in which to evaluate it.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Will determination on a final rule have bearing on the potential construction of additional nuclear division -- nuclear, so you\u2026","Tom Fanning","Sure.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","\u2026 would starting this process now facilitate more?","Tom Fanning","Yeah. In other words, but, there is also some unintended consequences, the nuclear rule is written really doesn't it actually helps to penalize, people have taken early action. Since 2005 Southern Company has reduced our carbon emissions 26%.","We\u2019ve led the United States in the renaissance of new nuclear and essentially we don't get on to getting credit for those actions. And even in the plant, even if you haven\u2019t started, if you\u2019ve contemplated plant, they would include those in the calculation and you don't get credit for that.","Now, having said all that, any passage of further regulation around greenhouse gases does incent new nuclear, that is clear. And in fact, building new nuclear is in our view has been a hedge against future carbon regulation.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you guys.","Tom Fanning","Eggers, thank you.","Operator","Now, we\u2019ll go to our next question. It is from the line of Steven Fleishman, Wolfe Research. Go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hey Steve.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Hey Tom. How are you?","Tom Fanning","Good. How are you doing?","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","I\u2019m doing great. So, first, I guess just to clarify the clarification of the nuclear -- the new nuclear, excuse me. So, is this -- are you at a point, when you are doing kind of your RFP process or other stuff, where you need to be making decisions on the next round of baseload and, thus, looking at permitting nuclear or something else over the next 12 months or 24 months or no?","Tom Fanning","There is nothing new in the statement that we haven\u2019t said numerous times already. We believe nuclear is a dominant solution in the portfolio of Southern Company generation going forward. When all things considered, we need baseload, you need baseload intermediate peaking.","We know that coal is kind of moving away from favor in America. So to the extent, you\u2019re going to do coal. It looks like a Kemper plant. If you\u2019re not going to do coal, it\u2019s nuclear. And so if you\u2019re going to preserve nuclear as an option to add as a baseload resource in the middle of the next decade, you need to start thinking about the steps necessary to preserve that option, that\u2019s all I was referring to.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. And then switching gears, I think Georgia was going to do a pretty large solar RFP. Is there any update on that process?","Art Beattie","Yes, Steve, they have that process ongoing. There were bids that were made. I think it was late April. There will be a short-list notification sometime in the middle of August and then a final -- the final selection, I guess, would be mid October of this year. And we\u2019ll know by then, I guess, whether Southern Power or Georgia Power will be either in the short-list or the final list by the October call.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay, great. And then I guess, one last question, I guess for Tom. Just -- we started seeing some more utility M&A activity recently in the sector. Could you maybe just give us an update in your thinking on consolidation in the sector, and how Southern might or might not participate in that?","Tom Fanning","Well, here again, this is going to be a standard answer, Steve. We are not going to comment on any specific transaction, of course. And of course, it is standard for management to exercise its fiduciary responsibility to evaluate option enhancing -- the value enhancing strategy for its shareholders to the extent, any of those opportunities come to fore, of course, we\u2019ll pursue it and if successful, announce it.","But it\u2019s something we do all the time. We look all the time. And our position is we\u2019re reasonably conservative from a financial standpoint. We believe in maintaining the highest level of financial integrity. I know one of the invoke idea is these day is to use cash. I think the underlying presumption there is to use debt at least as a bridge underlying the cash.","But I really don't have anything new to add that I haven\u2019t said before. We\u2019ll look at it all the time. You look extraordinarily hard to complete successfully that really do accrete to shareholder value. But that doesn't mean we won't be trying.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay, great. Thank you.","Tom Fanning","Yes, sir.","Operator","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll go to our next question. It is from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies LLC. Go ahead.","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon, guys.","Tom Fanning","Good afternoon, Jeff. How are you?","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Just hopefully a quick question on the Southern Power project. I\u2019m just wondering, what type of returns are you seeing on solar now? And I think, with the advent of YieldCos and all these other type entities, has there been like a downward pressure on the returns you are getting from renewables?","Art Beattie","Well, we continue to look at that, Anthony. We\u2019ve got a process whereby we evaluate every deal on its own. There is not a one-size fits all approach here. We look at the terms and conditions around whatever they maybe, the offtaker, where the project is located, whether there is any other legal risk associated with the contracts within the states that we\u2019re looking at. And we\u2019ll adjust our hurdle rates based on those. But I\u2019m not going to comment on any kind of return number that we look at because it varies honestly with every project we did.","Tom Fanning","It\u2019s reasonably consistent, I think. We haven\u2019t changed our hurdle rates as we expect kind of what the market is showing us. I haven\u2019t seen a dramatic change of what yield curves are offering in the market.","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you guys.","Tom Fanning","Yeah, bet.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question. It is from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hey Mark.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar","Hey, good afternoon everybody. How are you doing?","Tom Fanning","Great.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar","This is going to be a tough question, but I know you can't really comment on the details. But I guess, maybe the larger items that we should really be focused on when we see the outcome of the Mississippi prudency process there. And can you maybe walk us through how that's going to -- how it will be announced and what to look for?","Tom Fanning","So we alluded to it in the opening comments and it really kind of go to the idea of global settlement. There is a whole host of the issues that could be taken into account in what we describe as our ongoing constructed dialog with this type of questions. I know you all will say about where are you in that. And I think the best thing for us to say right now is to let the people do their work and when we have something to announce, we\u2019ll announce it, to not say too much at this point.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar","Good.","Tom Fanning","We remain optimistic about our result.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar","Okay, okay. I guess the most likely outcome, like you mentioned is maybe more of a settlement between the related -- the parties involved.","Tom Fanning","Well, sure. We are then working on our -- so called global settlement that takes into account a number of issues and we think we\u2019re having constructive dialog about that issue.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar","Okay. Thanks. I know that's pretty hard to talk about at this point. Just a quick question on operations. It's a smaller item, but kind of an ongoing trend from the last quarter. You have a pretty major shift in your non-Powder River burn away from the Powder River Basin. Is this just a function of where your contracts and pricing are at or is there something else moving that needle?","Art Beattie","I think that\u2019s a function of outages. We had some of our Powder River units.","Operator","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Paul Rizdon with KeyBank. Go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hello, Paul.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Just any updates on the Vogtle dispute?","Tom Fanning","No. We have all engaged in conversations. There is kind of two ways to think about that. And I would direct you to go to their earnings call as well. But there is the nature of the conversation between Georgia Power and the Consortium. Recall the Consortium is Toshiba, Westinghouse, Chicago Bridge & Iron. And then there is a conversation within the consortium among and between Westinghouse, Chicago Bridge & Iron, and Toshiba. In effect, what I\u2019m saying is both of those have to be resolved in order for us to reach the settlement.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Any venture, I guess, as to the timeline until settlement?","Tom Fanning","No, I have said this before and I don\u2019t mean to sound glib. It\u2019s something that could happen quickly or something that could take a long time including going to litigation. Recall, venue is Augusta, Georgia.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","And then just back to the new, new nuclear, so anyone who is expecting an announcement out of Southern by year-end took your comments out of context?","Tom Fanning","Sure. Look that\u2019s something we said consistently. I was kind of surprised at the amount of press it got. Love to be in a position by the end of the year to announce and what you do when you start that process is you undertake essentially a permitting process. And we would only do that with the approval of the relevant jurisdiction in order to recover those costs.","Recall also that\u2019s not a commitment to build, that\u2019s a commitment to gain the option to build. So this is something that will -- these are first steps you take in order to achieve new generation by the middle of the next decade, for heaven\u2019s sake, something like that.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Okay. Thanks again.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll go to our next question from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hi Ali. How are you?","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Good. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. One, Tom or Art, can you remind us in your \u201814 numbers, what weather-normalized electric sales have you assumed for the year? And how are you looking at them on a longer-term basis? Can you just remind us of those numbers?","Art Beattie","Yeah. On the -- if we look at \u201814, total retail sales, we expect it to be up 0.7% over 2013 level. And then beyond that, it really is around 1% to maybe a little stronger than that. That\u2019s a function of how fast the economy grows in the \u201815, \u201816 timeframe.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","And year-to-date?","Art Beattie","Year-to-date we are standing at 1.1%.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","All right. And I know third quarter obviously is the biggest, but given the trends you are seeing, would that cause you to change your full-year outlook at this point?","Art Beattie","No, we don\u2019t comment on that until third quarter.","Tom Fanning","Yeah. And just to remind everybody, we only talk about guidance twice in a year. Once when we give it and once when we kind of update it in October.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay. Separately, Art, I know last time, I think it was in the last earnings call, you had mentioned with regards to equity, needs for equity that you were pretty much close to your limit in staying out of the equity issuance side. Are we still there or can you just give us an update on your latest thoughts regarding equity needs perhaps in the future?","Art Beattie","Yeah. Ali, what we talked about is issuing about $600 million of new equity this year. And through June, we\u2019ve issued $331 million. So we\u2019re well on track to hit our target. And our target hasn\u2019t changed.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Okay. And last question, Tom, for you. Again, you all have given us an update longer-term, talking about your earnings trajectory, slight slowdown next couple of years and then a pickup again down the road. Are you seeing opportunities that could change that trajectory and cause the near-term growth to go up as well or is that still the profile we should be looking at for the next five years or so?","Tom Fanning","That\u2019s still the profile. You know that we\u2019re a conservative company and so we wanted to give you kind of -- we've never really gone out that far talking about what our earnings trajectory might be. And the reason we did that because we felt it had a shape. And so we wanted to describe the shape to you all.","We continue to work hard on late to improve that shape. We have several things that we\u2019re kicking around internally here, opportunities with Southern Power, opportunities around the traditional business. But not that we want to give the weight that would be derived from conversation in this form, still kicking around a lot of stuff.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Got it. Thank you.","Tom Fanning","Yes sir. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. And we\u2019ll go to our next question. It is from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Association. Go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hey Paul. Paul?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Association","Hi. How are you doing? Sorry about that?","Tom Fanning","Sure.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Association","Hi, how are you doing? Sorry about that. A lot of my questions have been answered, but just to sort of fall back on Kemper. If I understood your comments earlier, it sounds like you guys pretty much feel that the boundaries are laid out in such a way that there probably isn't going to be much more of a cost increase potential there. Is that -- am I understanding that correctly?","Tom Fanning","So I am looking at all those risks. If I were to focus more on startup risks, what would the risk be and I used the funny phrase, unknown, unknown, right. So let\u2019s say as we go through startup, some piece of equipments failed that we didn\u2019t anticipate. We tried to mitigate or at lease be proactive in mitigating startup risks by providing I think extra man of inventory of we think -- what we think are critical parts to the plant.","But in startup if something does not perform well or needs to be redesigned or whatever, that could add more months to the schedule for example and that would require increased cost. Right now we have reserves through I guess the very end of May, June for us whatever you to call it. So we maintained that estimate. Obviously if we didn\u2019t have comments to that estimate we would have changed it. We had a good quarter in construction and I think being pipe-tight.","So that means essentially all the pipe is erected. Now we still need to test it and other things. We just had a good quarter and I want to make sure that\u2019s been on the site there. They are just working like crazy. Understand that we appreciate their effectiveness this quarter. The challenge now transitions I think largely become a structure project to a start project. That will have its own set of issues we will see.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Association","Okay. I did notice that the first fire of gasifier A's schedules have been pushed out. Would that be a key thing to look for in September or October as being one of key test?","Tom Fanning","That\u2019s right, Paul. I mean to the extent you can\u2019t made that kind of schedule that puts pressure on the back end, we move the schedule in concert with the new estimated, new member when we came up with the May schedule. So we changed a lot of the major components along that way. So that schedule is consistent with the completion date at the end of May.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Association","Okay. And then I think Steve was asking about M&A. And I remember previously that you guys had a preference for the super Southeast. And I was sort of wondering just geographically, does that -- I'm not sure exactly what that means. Does that include Texas? Or is that still something that you guys have a preference for the Southeast versus other areas?","Tom Fanning","Let me speak very broadly about that. The preference in something like a super Southeast would be where you could gain natural synergies. That\u2019s what that comment alludes to, okay. So let me just pick stuff out of the air. We would have more synergies operationally in a company that was inside our footprint or adjacent to it or whatever. Then, we would for a company in Canada. That\u2019s really the concept you are after there. So in preferring the super Southeast, it is the idea that you can more readily gain operational synergies and let me also distinguish between asset M&A where you don\u2019t really require synergy so much. That\u2019s like building a solar plant in New Mexico relative to corporate M&A which is I think what you are referring to.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Association","Okay. I got the picture. Thanks so much.","Tom Fanning","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we will go to our next question. It\u2019s from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Michael, how are you","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","I am all right, Tom. Thanks for taking my questions. Really a near-term one, and this may be more of an Art one. Third quarter guidance, if I back out all the one-time items from third quarter of last year is flat to actually down a little bit? How should we think about the puts and takes, not really just for third quarter, but also for fourth quarter -- meaning, kind of what's weighing on third quarter? Why isn't there a little growth year-over-year, of third quarter of 2013 to third quarter of 2014? And what does that mean or imply for fourth quarter? Is it an O&M timing issue? Is it a view on kind of the summer? Just trying to ask some of the near-term puts and takes.","Tom Fanning","Yeah, O&M is certainly an aspect that if you look at our history, we are second half spending company. And depending on actually how the third quarter goes because the third quarter represents fully 45% of our annual earnings, it\u2019s a big player and that points directly at four quarter earnings over the last five years. We have earned anywhere from $0.18 and $20.10 to 0.48 last year and that\u2019s a reflection of where we end up through the third quarter.","We also have weather impacts as well as you know and we\u2019re assuming normal weather throughout the remainder of the year, but that\u2019s certainly something we have to plan into account for. The other aspect is the share count and share counts are up. We talked about issuing new shares this year. So you got to weigh that into and once you factor all of that net, these are all the things that are as you say puts and takes on where the number went up.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And when we think about just the next year, year and a half, maybe year or so, what's next on the horizon going across the Southern system in terms of just thinking about rate filings, rate actions, that could involve not just pretty small numbers, but where there is stuff on the horizon that folks should pay a lot of attention to?","Art Beattie","Michael, this is Art. Georgia completed their rate case last year, right. So they are good through 2016 from a new rate filing perspective. And when you look at Gulf, Gulf power miss a -- well they filed the rate case last year that was settled. They are going through 2016 as well. Alabama as you know has filings every year and there will file hat something in the fall so you would need to look at their as to what particular filing would have.","There are also clauses at some of our operating companies that could operate as well. Alabama being one of those. You also have fuel issues at each of our operating companies .Right now systems wide we are 283 million underrecovered on fuel and some of our companies have had to file with their regulatory bodies just as information not necessarily for a change in rate, but some of them maybe dealt, with some of them maybe pushed out. And then Mississippi I believe is good through 2025-$016 as well from their PEP filings. So it varies but o think to a large degree al of those are pretty well settled. Alabama be in the annual filing that you would have to each year.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","And in Alabama, you would attempt to recover the deferral that you made in the prior RSE process?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, of the O&M deferral that what you were referring?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Yes.","Tom Fanning","That\u2019s correct. And that\u2019s over another period of time I think over 3 years. Any of that is always part of the calculus.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Yes, got me. And then last item, just thoughts on bonus depreciation. It\u2019s kind of been bantered around back and forth a little bit in DC. Just curious in terms of, A, what the impact would be on cash -- I don't know, needs and uses for next year, a little bit, if it gets extended? And, B, just the general -- from a policy, and from an impact on Southern's spending level, how you think about it in the broader energy policy framework.","Tom Fanning","Well, Michel has already in. At 2014 we are looking at anywhere 200 to 225, but when you look at 2015, it\u2019s would certain impact some of our assets and it will impact some of our match compliance. So I don\u2019t have a number to share with you, but it could dramatically impact the financing that we do from a cash flow perspective. The other side of that sword is the fact that it reduces rate based growth. So they are good and bad associated with bonus depreciation.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.","Tom Fanning","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Videla Marti with CDP Capital. Go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hello, Videla.","Videla Marti - CDP Capital","Good afternoon, how are you?","Tom Fanning","Great.","Videla Marti - CDP Capital","I have got two questions kind of first one is much more industry type of thing versus you guys specifically. Is there a lot of press recently about couple of years ago, there was a huge solar flare that came off with close to threatening our entire grid and doing that and historical even back in the 1859 that knocked out all the telegraphs and things of that nature. So I am just kind of wondering one kind of what yourselves and industry are doing to possibly prepared for that type of event that just like kind of tail end kind of things. And that is also tied into the cyber issues. Well, so if you can just kind of talk a little bit about obviously given your position in the industry, you have to sure you guys are extremely involved in all this, just like to get a sense of that and I\u2019ve got separate secondary separate question.","Tom Fanning","Yeah, so we are involved. I chair for the industry and that\u2019s not IOUs, that includes co-ops and municipal utilities, it\u2019s called the ESCC, the Electricity Sector Coordinating council. You may know that under the Department of Homeland & Security they have cut commerce in the United States, they segmented it into 16 pieces if you will. And so our sector is one of the 16 so I chair that electricity sector coordination council. And we are responsible essentially for proactive planning and adaptive responses to all things cyber, physical terrorism and natural disasters. And some of the things you suggest are absolutely part of our purview and there is quite a bit of activity going on. And in fact the government I think you can look this up.","They government has held the electricity sector up as -- I think the best sector in terms of preparedness and response to different threats. Lot of different things we could go into here. You know that we have been involved in response to the kind of request for additional physical security updates. So this kind of interrogatories back and forth between NERC. The cyber issue you may know that we have adopted a single kind of cyber threat regime, a set of software that\u2019s kind of under the offices of the government which we will be able to detect anamolies within electronic commerce, servers other things.","Access those anamolies and then be able to piece together information around the potential for threats and the best way to either protect or respond to a current threat. All of that is going on right now and I would say on the third sector this response of natural disaster CEO of AEP great friend of mine, great guys have been leading an effort in the industry to meet together a more effective response from what they call RMAX regional mutual assistance groups.","We actually I thin performed well with Hurricane Sandy, but I think even now we will perform better and I think we are much better suited from a comprehensive storm to be able to respond great. So I would be glad to fill it up, with a lot more details, but that\u2019s the quick flyby. The ESCC govern cyber terrorism, physical terrorism, natural disasters. We work hand in glove with the department of homeland security through the department of energy. We have I think unique among all the other industries deep CEO participation. This is nothing that delegated down. And I think we've already demonstrated, I think really good plan and responsive to threat.","Videla Marti - CDP Capital","How much is this costing a year or cumulatively over a period of time in order to address all these possibilities?","Tom Fanning","Videla, that changes based on each company. Each company is going to have a different kind of response to that question. So if you have somebody in mind, it\u2019s much better for you to ask them than me.","Let me just give you the aggregate answer. The amount of money that we\u2019re talking about pale in comparison to the benefit. As an industry, we have always been committed to providing the best reliability and we understand that the United States is in a new era. And we all understand that not only responding to but being proactive to defend ourselves against these threats is job one for us. So, yes, it\u2019s going to require some more money, but I think the cost pales in comparison to the benefit.","Videla Marti - CDP Capital","Okay. And I guess one last thing going back to the old M&A question couple of times. I mean, in my career, last time you guys ever did a corporate-on-corporate was when I first showed up in 1987 when you guys bought savanna. And I'm just wondering given the state of the industry, I mean other than finding something discrete. Is there anything that is within -- what\u2019s going on in the industry that makes your attention or interest in M&A any higher than what it\u2019s ever being in the past?","Tom Fanning","That\u2019s a very interesting question. My quick answer is probably not, not really. I think we are where we have been. We've always been very consistent in our love of the integrated regulated utility model. We always think that we generate the best long-term value for shareholders by providing the best risk-adjusted returns around.","We think that our jurisdiction have demonstrated that we can deliver attractive returns with low-risk profiles and therefore from an EVA sense deliver I think a terrific value proposition. For us to undertake M&A activity we have to be convinced in the long run that we can preserve that kind of performance.","That\u2019s just a big challenge. When you look around, the expression also don't chase fads. A lot of companies will pursue things in the short run. We really are focused on the long run. So we don't get kind of dazzled by short-term trends, we tried to keep our eye on the right long star here.","Videla Marti - CDP Capital","Appreciate. Thank you, Tom.","Tom Fanning","Yes.","Operator","Thank you very much. And we get our next question from line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hi, Andy. How are you?","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Yeah. I\u2019m good. Thank you. And I thought that was a very good question on last one, we are last. And I apologize ahead of time for asking this question, but I feel the question is need to be ask because I just had a notice it\u2019s coming up in one of the companies that your doing businesses.","So, if you look at kind of CBI and its stock price has dropped from 85 to 60. And I am by no mean an accounting expert or an expert in CBI, but obviously this is the financial issues that were brought up whether they are true or not. But I just want to know how kind of that affects your thinking and whether it\u2019s affected any of the construction or are there any concerns that Southern has relative to CBI.","Tom Fanning","Yeah. And Andy, thank you for the question. You all know this we\u2019re completely transparent, we love question. Anything you want to ask is fully fair game, so never apologize. The second thing is we think CBI is a great partner in this project. We think the performance frankly off the project.","The challenges have been redo some states comment. And I meet periodically with Philip Asherman, their CEO back. In fact, Buzz Miller and will flew to Houston two weeks ago to meet with them. Just go eye to eye on certain issues. We do that all the time. And frankly, I think this week we\u2019re meeting with Westinghouse and Toshiba personnel and DC. So, this is something that we do as an ongoing matter.","This is not constructing plant Vogtle 3 and 4, in many respects, it\u2019s not a delegated activity. But Buzz Miller certainly does a great job, but we\u2019re all involved. With respect of any challenges that CBI had recently that have been in the press look the right people that I ask about that is CBI.","We can't speak for them at all and we do look at their earnings call and at least from our position in terms of the interrelationship, we have on plant Vogtle 3 and 4. We think they have fully explained that to the investment community and we are very satisfied with their relationship in the consumer channel and their relationship to us.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Great. Thank you very much for answering that.","Tom Fanning","You better. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll get our next question from the line of Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Got it ahead.","Tom Fanning","Hello there.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi. Good afternoon. I have a couple questions on your slides on Vogtle, Kemper, and then some on related to your sales. And excuse me if these are repeats, but I kind of missed the beginning. I had some issues with calling in. But I just wanted to try to get a sense on slide 4, how we should think about the timing? The things you have listed as near-term and on the horizon are those things that will occur in the third quarter, or how should we think about the timing of those items that you have classified there?","Art Beattie","Yeah. Dan, this is Art. CA05, I think we get dressed in the script that we talked about this morning and we\u2019re looking at like it was September. Before CA05, that what we did comment there was, is out of the module assembly building but it is a waiting. It\u2019s going under further modifications but it will be lifted sometime within the next month or two into the nuclear island. But setting the containment vessel lower ring, those are already complete and ready to go.","They're going to probably do that after they insert CA05, so again, from a timing perspective, it sometime probably September. And then the cooling tower vertical construction, I guess on unit 3. I'm guessing Dan, and this is sometime in the next four months. But Dan, that really is not what we would call critical path. Critical path is all in the nuclear island.","In terms of unit four, again module fabrication has just begun on their major module. The nuclear wall installation will continue and by the way we\u2019re making great progress on unit four. If you compare activities, we\u2019re learning a lot of lessons from our construction in unit 3 and applying them on unit 4.","And then the turbine building vertical construction is certainly not critical path either on unit 4 but it is going very well and you'll see steel come up out of the ground, probably sometime late this year.","Tom Fanning","Yeah. If I do that real quick, I would say and it just goes back. Dan, maybe you miss the reading on the script. CA05 September, CA01 late fourth quarter or early first quarter next year, Elevation 100 concrete pour near year end.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then on Kemper, I was wondering just I was looking, prior to the call, at your presentation I think you did back in June. And I just want to make sure I understand the terminology. You've mentioned first gasifier fire expected late third quarter or early fourth, where earlier it set first gasifier heat-up targeted for mid-to-late summer. So is heat-up and fire different, or are they the same or how should I think about that? ","Art Beattie","Hey Dan, those are the same. And it\u2019s moved out a bit again. It\u2019s getting ready, doing a lot of the milestones ahead of that, like airflow testing and making sure the lignite dryers work like they are designed to do. So there are test all along of the way with equipment that Tom describes earlier in the call. But the pressure test on Train A took a couple of three weeks or whatever the pressure on Train B went very quickly. So we\u2019re very gratified with our progress so far.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","I know the last quarter, I think you talked a little bit about how the timing of these in-service dates on Kemper have some implications for the tax credits and so forth, or the investment tax credits. And you have here first syngas production expected late this year. Would that be enough to qualify that for those credits this year, or not, if you were able to achieve that?","Tom Fanning","Tax perspective, from a mix bonus depreciation perspective will be the combined cycle by putting it in service -- for bill. They push is bonus depreciation into 2015 as well. So we just have to wait. That probably wouldn\u2019t happen until later this year. But we really don't want to get into all the details of that because we don't want to front run the regulatory discussions going on.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then just the last question I had his kind of related to -- your industrial sales year-to-date have been up almost 3%, which is quite a bit stronger than, I think, your forecast. I wonder if you can give us a little more color just on\u2026","Art Beattie","","I\u2019ll catch you up. Yeah. It was broad based, you look at our top 10 industrial segments, all of them show growth most of the quarter and year-to-date period. Chemicals, our largest segment, was up 5.4% for the quarter. Primary metals are second largest was up 3.5%. So it\u2019s been very broad based and you think geographically it was across our entire footprint. All the operating companies participated in the growth and expansion on the industrial side.","Tom Fanning","And your roundtable, economic roundtable seems to suggest that people were bullish about prospects going forward. So we expect it to continue.","Art Beattie","","Yes, one other element that you may have missed, Dan, was that we also survey our top customers, about what their sales going to be over the next six months and 90% of the risk today through 2014. So that\u2019s a very bullish indicator to me that they\u2019re expecting similar sales of their products into the market.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, and then the last thing just on the residential side, in terms of customer growth. Is the customer growth in line with what you expected, or how is that tracking?","Tom Fanning","Yeah. It\u2019s going directly in line with what we expected. We\u2019ve added 13,300 residential customers since the end of last year. If you look at a year-over-year it's right at 25,000. So it is going directly in line with our expectations for the year.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Fanning","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you very much. And at this time, there are no further question. Sir, are there any closing remarks.","Tom Fanning","Yeah. Just want to say thank you again for participating with us this afternoon. The team here is working hard to generate value by continuing the attractive returns that we\u2019re able to demonstrate and manage risk, especially in our major projects as we go forward. We appreciate your attendance and will be with you shortly as we hit the road as we always do. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Good day everyone."],"19565":["The Southern Co.

Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning along with the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss on today's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Our traditional operating companies continued to operate superbly in the second quarter of 2015, making great progress towards our full-year objectives. Contributing to this performance is underlying strength in retail electricity sales.","For the first time in a decade, we've experienced two consecutive quarters of growth in all three retail customer classes: residential, commercial and industrial. In particular, we are encouraged by the developing strength of the residential sector, fueled in large part by healthy growth in the housing sector.","Our wholesale subsidiary, Southern Power, also performed extremely well in the second quarter. Year-to-date results for Southern Power represent solid growth compared to 2014 and we expect them to exceed their plan for 2015, and the outlook for 2016 is promising.","As we suggested last quarter, Southern Power has now confirmed solar and wind projects to account for all of its placeholder capital in 2015. The project pipeline remains robust and we could potentially exceed our forecasted placeholders for both 2015 and 2016.","We continue to leverage our full portfolio of generation resources to deliver low-cost electricity for customers. With our coal burn near record lows, our natural gas consumption is increasing and our gas burn is expected to increase to an average of 1.8 Bcf per day this year. This compares with our average gas burn of 1.5 Bcf per day over the last three calendar years.","We've also continued to grow renewable generation resources. Last week, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved Georgia Power's request to build a 46 megawatt solar project at the U.S. Marine Corp logistics base in Albany, Georgia. With this approval, Georgia Power now has 166 megawatts of solar generation under development on military bases in Georgia, which speaks to a strong partnership with the United States Department of Defense.","Georgia Power also launched its new solar sales and installation service on July 1. Through a variety of solar programs, Georgia Power will add thousands of solar panels to the Georgia landscape for customers who desire that option.","All of our traditional operating companies are now pursuing significant renewable generation projects, and Southern Power continues to grow its renewable portfolio. So, based on the currently approved project, The Southern Company system expects to own or purchase the output of more than 3,200 megawatts of renewable resources, including 46 solar facilities in seven states by the end of 2016.","I would now like to focus our discussion on the two major construction projects, both very important to our full portfolio of generating resources. Georgia Power's new nuclear project, Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and Mississippi Power's 21st century coal facility in Kemper County, Mississippi.","First, an update on the Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Construction is proceeding very well as the focus continues to be on quality and safety. We held our Southern Company Management Council meeting at the worksite last week, where our senior management team was able to observe progress firsthand.","For Unit 3, final preparations are underway to set the 1,000-ton CA01 module in the containment vessel, which is expected to occur in early August. Assembly of the CA03 module has begun, and concrete placements continue in preparation for the initial installations of shield-building panels expected in the coming months.","The Unit 4 nuclear island continues to benefit from lessons learned on Unit 3. Three of the smaller structural modules were recently installed, and assembly of CA20 has begun in the module assembly building.","Significant work has also occurred in areas outside the nuclear island, including work on the structural steel for the Unit 3 annex building. The annex building will be a critical component in the initial energization testing that is anticipated in 2016, a key milestone in preparation for the eventual testing and startup of Unit 3.","In ground work for the Unit 3 switchyard is also finished, and there has been significant progress on other transmission infrastructure. The Unit 3 cooling tower is complete, and the Unit 4 cooling tower is now more than 100 feet tall. Overall, we remain on target for the anticipated completion of Unit 3 in the second quarter of 2019 and Unit 4 in the second quarter of 2020.","On the regulatory front, the Georgia Public Service Commission staff has recommended approval of costs submitted in the 12th Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report, and we expect the Commission to render a decision on August 18.","Now, let's turn to an update on the Kemper County IGCC project. Kemper start-up is also progressing with first syngas production expected later this year. Operator training is well underway and portions of the plant have been turned over to the operations team.","Control system validation, an area of significant initial focus, is also on schedule to support these future milestones. Mississippi Power's continuing startup and checkout activity and, as expected with any project, is identifying and remediating issues along the way.","In some cases, equipment is being repaired by the original equipment manufacturer, while in other cases, the engineering and construction team is implementing solutions onsite. To a large extent, contingencies for cost and schedule have been sufficient to absorb these activities, and the focus remains on the expected in-service date in the first half of 2016.","I'll move now to a discussion of regulatory matters. Based on the Mississippi Public Service Commission's July 7 order, Mississippi Power has ceased billing customers for Kemper. As a result, Mississippi Power filed a rate proposal on July 10 for an 18% increase, primarily to recover costs associated with the project combined cycle and transmission investments, as well as Kemper-related regulatory assets. The combined cycle has been running since August of 2014 and performing exceptionally well.","In fact, over the last 11 months, Kemper's combined cycle operations have delivered more than 3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity and saved Mississippi Power customers more than $15 million, having displaced other higher cost methods of generation. Year-to-date, this unit has experienced an equivalent forced outage rate or EFOR of approximately 1.25% compared with an industry average EFOR of over 6% for natural gas combined cycles.","As the Commission is not expected to rule on any permanent rates for Kemper prior to November, Mississippi also petitioned the PSC to implement the 18% increase on an interim basis, subject to refund. A hearing on the interim rates is scheduled for August 6. At the same time, the PSC may also rule on Mississippi Power's proposed Mirror CWIP refund plan, which was filed in response to the July 7 order.","I'll turn the call over now to Art for a financial and economic overview.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the second quarter of 2015, reporting earnings of $629 million, or $0.69 a share, compared with earnings of $611 million, or $0.68 a share, in the second quarter of 2014.","For the six months ended June 30, 2015, earnings were $1.14 billion, or $1.25 a share, compared with earnings of $962 million, or $1.08 a share, for the same period in 2014. Earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, include after-tax charges of $14 million and $20 million, respectively, related to increased construction estimates for Mississippi Power's Kemper County integrated gasification combined cycle project.","Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2014, include after-tax charges of $235 million, or $0.26 a share, related to the Kemper County IGCC project. Earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 also include a $4 million after-tax charge related to discontinued operations of Mirant and the March 2009 settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery.","Excluding these charges, Southern Company earned $647 million, or $0.71 a share, during the second quarter of 2015, compared with $611 million, or $0.68 per share, during the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $0.03 per share. For the first six months of 2015, excluding these charges, Southern Company earned $1.16 billion, or $1.28 per share, compared with earnings of $1.20 billion, or $1.34 a share, for the same period in 2014, a decrease of $0.06 a share.","Earnings for the second quarter of 2015 were positively influenced by retail revenue effects at Southern Company's traditional operating companies, warmer weather and a stronger than expected performance from our Southern Power subsidiary. Earnings were negatively influenced by increased non-fuel O&M expenses.","Moving on to an economic and sales review for the second quarter, as Tom just mentioned, we experienced weather normal growth in all three customer classes; residential, commercial, and industrial, in consecutive quarters for the first time since 2004.","We are particularly encouraged by growth in the residential class, which saw weather normal sales increase 1.2% in the second quarter, largely a result of customer growth. We've added nearly 22,000 new residential customers through June of this year, which compares to just over 13,000 customers added during the same period in 2014, an increase of nearly 60% over last year and our 2015 forecast.","Residential growth is shifting from absorption of vacant properties to new construction as 85% of our customer gains are from new connects. While not yet back to prerecession levels, new connects are 14% ahead of 2014, which further indicates a strengthening housing market and healthy migration into our service region. Between 2013 and 2014, Atlanta was ranked number four among U.S. cities with the highest net migration.","Our commercial markets are continuing to show strength as well, with a second quarterly increase in weather adjusted sales of 0.7%. This growth is supported by strong non-manufacturing employment growth. Atlanta experienced the second fastest rate of job growth of the 12 largest metro areas in the U.S., and its office vacancy rate is at the lowest level since 2008.","Earlier this month, we re-engaged with our Economic Roundtable, a group consisting of regional economists and executives from several of our largest customers that meets twice a year. The panelists expect GDP growth of approximately 2.5% for 2015. They also noted an improvement in the national housing market, which further supports what we are experiencing with migration to our region as homeowners are better able to sell their existing homes and relocate to higher growth job markets. Finally, our earnings estimate for the third quarter is $1.16 per share.","I'll turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Art. Here at the midpoint of 2015, we continue to see a franchise business that is operating at a high level, and we see important progress on major capital projects. We also see a strengthening economy and a region poised for continued growth. Finally, Southern Power is on track to exceed its original financial targets.","In short, we believe Southern Company is well-positioned for continued success in 2015 and beyond, behind the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to our customer-focused business model.","We're now ready to take your questions. Operator, we'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. One moment, please, for the first question. And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Greg. How are you?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good. Good afternoon, fellows.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I know you guys usually only update guidance once a year at the beginning of the year, but you made a comment that you're feeling pretty good about where the financial performance stands year-to-date. Are you prepared to comment about how we look inside the guidance range for 2015?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No. Greg, we're going to keep doing what we've been doing for \u2013 gosh, I know this was ever since I was CFO, so this is over 10 years ago now. So, we provide initial guidance in January and then we always update kind of in October, once we get past the summer months. We'll just keep with that practice.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fair enough. My second question was looking at the financing plan on page 12 of the slide deck, it actually looks like your total debt financing needs are slightly lower over the 2015 to 2017 time period, and you still are not projecting to need any equity. Is that plan sort of formally updated for the SMEPA refund and what you hope to get in terms of a decision in Mississippi with regard to the refunds there?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Greg, this is Art. Yes, it does. We have adjusted some of the operating company needs out of 2015 and reduced those, and then Southern Power has been on a small bit of adjustment as well, offset by some increases in the holding company level. But all-in-all...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Yeah. So, when you say you've reduced the needs of the operating companies, does that mean that there's more cash flow than you expected there? Or you've cut back on expected capital expenditures at the regulated businesses? Or does that mean there's just \u2013 you're modulating down, sort of the placeholder (19:38)...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. It's a combination of all that plus as you look into 2016, we pushed some out of 2015 into 2016, but if you net them all, it's a slight bit of an increase, not great.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And can you guys just explain again specifically what it is that you're hoping to get from the Mississippi Commission on August 6?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","The 18% rate increase, for one, and then what is the preferred plan for the customer refund?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure. So, the simple answer is that we have a plan in place that amounts to about an 18% increase permanently for assets and service, including some amortizations of some regulatory assets. So, that amounts to 18%.","We won't be able to have those rates put into place by the Commission until the process is complete, which we think now might be, who knows, November, something like that. So, the interim rates, we would expect to be put into place on or around August 6. That would permit us to basically keep the rate structures in place that have been in place minus the refunds. So, that's really the process. Number one, the interim rates equal to what we believe is the right kind of rates associated with assets and service. We think that'll be complete at the end of this year, November.","And then, we will have the rest of the assets either ruled on by the end of the year, we don't know the answer to this, or conceivably pushed into 2016. That's associated with what we believe will be about a 10% looking number, 6% associated with securitization bonds, 4% associated with the other assets. In terms of the refund plan, our preference is to have a default that would be a bill credit. The customers could elect to take a check. All that would be complete within 90 days.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, guys.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Anthony, how are you?","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Wonderful. Never been better.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Awesome.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Just two quick questions. Unfortunately, they're with the small part of your business on Mississippi. One is, I think previously you were thinking you could get syngas entered into the unit in July, and maybe that's been pushed back. If you give some color on that.","And the second question is related to, I guess, the staff recommendations in Mississippi that were released last Friday. The staff had recommended some conditions, two of them of interest, one was that an equity infusion of like, $200 million rather quickly, and also, the parent, Southern Company, guarantee investment grade credit at Mississippi Power through the duration of the project. I just wanted to know if you could maybe talk about those. Is that something the company is willing to entertain until they get full clarity on the entirety of the project?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me take the first one on syngas. So, basically there's three or four big pieces that we need to do. One is that we're working on a syngas cooler super heater, the ash silo and the fluidization lines pressure testing. We're doing all those right now. Once we get those done, then we'll go through in-service pressure tests. We expect to complete all of that kind of by mid-August. So, that's very near term stuff. As well, there's something called a particular control device that basically takes the foreign matter, particulate matter, out of the flue gas.","Then, we will move into the fluidization process. The first thing we will do is actually run the gasifier. This is kind of a new step we've put in place. We just think it's prudent, though. But, we will use sand to emulate the lignite particles and shapes. So, we're going to run sand through the gasifier. So, essentially the fluidization will be able to be demonstrated without the production of syngas.","Putting that step in place, pushes actual syngas production out of lignite into the fourth quarter. So, that's roughly the schedule, kind of four or five kind of big things we're doing right now. We expect to be complete by mid-August. Then we start this simulated process with sand. Once we get that in place, then we'll do the lignite. So, these are all intentional, and we think it will serve us well as we continue to go through an orderly startup.","Anthony, with respect to the second question, it really goes to the staff's recommendation. We have, Southern Company has stood behind everything we said we would do with respect to getting the plant built and started up. And that's what we're doing.","And right now, there has been a staff recommendation. It's better, I think, for us not to comment particularly to any staff recommendation, certainly as any recommendation could relate to Southern Company. I think, we believe, that when you look at the issue at hand, that is rates for assets in service and those services have produce great value to Mississippi's customers, and they have been performing exceedingly well compared to any measure, we think we'll be treated fairly. And we expect constructive treatment out of the Commission not only for interim rates, but also for permanent rates related to those sets of assets, okay? Is there anything else that you wanted me to cover about that?","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","I guess, do you expect the, I guess, interim rates, and I know there's a window when the Commission has to approve interim rates and also maybe permanent rates.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Does that all get decided with the current Commission, or does that get decided maybe in 2016 when you have two new faces on the Commission?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We think that the 18% that we are seeking both in interim and permanent would be with this Commission. There are two paths that could happen on the remaining 10% or so. Remember, 6% of those 10% relate to securitization bonds, which does not involve any ROE to Mississippi Power. The only remaining kind of return elements to Mississippi Power is 4%.","Now that could either happen this year based on a current filing or a new filing we might make, or it could be pushed into 2010, we'll just see. I mean, 2016. We'll just see where that goes. We believe that so far the plant, knock on wood, has been going great. The start's been going great. We've had some normal bumps in the road, but we've been able to handle them with the contingencies that we've had in place. And we're very happy with the performance of the team on-site. They're doing a heck of a job.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question, Tom.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Anthony. Good talking with you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Steve.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Tom. Thank you. Just one other thing, I know you just went through an extensive schedule on Kemper. I did, I think, when you commented on it, you said something to the effect of you are kind of to a large extent kind of within the contingency for it. And I just wanted to make sure I understood what messaging you are trying to say there.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure. Yeah. And thanks for the clarification. So, what I meant by that was remember when we, gosh, we took this reserve whenever we last changed the schedule into the first half of 2016. We basically provided for, I want to say about $30 million a month, and that included some contingency. And so, as I said in the kind of prepared remarks that that contingency is working and it speaks to whatever kind of unforeseen changes we've had to make, any work, rework, those kinds of things.","The only when I said largely, the only thing I'm referring to really isn't schedule. It goes with these little small things that we've been showing, like, for example, a net increase this time of $14 million for the quarter. That's all we're referring to.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, maybe just also in your comments at the end on kind of happy with financial results, and maybe \u2013 I think you said maybe meet or exceed expectations?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I said that about Southern Power.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","So, that's on Southern Power?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And is that's due to the higher investments in renewables?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And just to review the bidding there, if you think about it in 2014, remember, we had, I forget, placeholders for three years, as we kind of typically do. And in 2014, we started seeing so much success, we accelerated those placeholders into 2014. And that produced better than expected results. And then remember when we set our financials this year, we said, we're going to replicate 2014 and 2015. In other words, 2014 results for 2015, and we're going to add some stretch.","I'm telling you right now, I think we're going to beat our stretch targets for 2015 for Southern Power, and we said this on the last call, but it just continues to be true and perhaps further, that the placeholders are getting filled up for 2016.","So, I'm feeling very confident about our ability for the placeholders in 2016; and in fact, potentially, can't guarantee it, but potentially there could be upside to even our expectations for 2016. By October, we may be able to shed even a little more light on both of those 2015 and 2016 issues, but let's wait until the next earnings call, where we'll have a little more transparency. But, we're feeling very good about our progress and executing.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. But, I guess, my only question then on that is, if that becomes \u2013 what happens then in 2017 if we don't have an ITC anymore or I guess it's smaller...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","...does that become a big headwind?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Not a headwind. And we've talked about this before, and it was the shape of, kind of, earnings. So, I think this would largely be true for most folks and that is, absent solar investment tax credits which go from 30 to 10, you would generally expect to see a flattening out of earnings from \u2013 you'd love to see, so we're telling you, we're seeing a really good picture. The franchise is doing great. The power is doing great. You're going to see a trajectory in 2015 and 2016. All things being equal, the solar credits go away or at least go to 10, you'd see some flattening of progress, especially if people try to push stuff into 2016 to get it done, so 2016 to 2017 could flatten out a little bit.","One of the things though that we're working on is ways to fill in what we're calling that divot, and that divot could be filled in with some win projects. We announced earlier Kay Wind, there's some other things we're looking at. As you know, they have a different earnings profile associated with their production tax credit. It's a 10-year kind of deal. And so, we're working on ways right now to improve what 2017 may look like, assuming you don't get an extension on the solar credits.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with the question.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Dan.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Just, Tom, could we just talk a little bit about EPA and the CPP and I guess, a, whether you think the stories are right that it's going to come next week and then kind of, what adjustments you guys think are going to make it into the final rule?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so, Dan, it's anybody's guess at this point. When EPA pushed forward the preliminary rule and they got, gosh, over four million comments, I think they themselves realized that the proposed rule has some significant flaws, and I think we've been working constructively with EPA to try and fix those flaws.","Been a number of kind of important areas that we look forward to EPA addressing. For example, one that's been just widely discussed is the so-called cliff date of 2020, so we would look for EPA to provide some flexibility. My sense is, they're likely going to keep teeth in the 2030 requirement, but we could see some flexibility on 2020. Who knows? EEI certainly has put forth a recommendation for that.","Other issues could be related to current non-carbon-emitting resources. It could be life extensions of nukes, it could be increases of capacity of nukes, it could be our own Vogtle 3 and 4, which originally we didn't get credit for, that somehow EPA would recognize that that absolutely meets the intention of reducing carbon. And really it goes to Kemper County and actually other things.","There's a host of other issues, Dan, that could be considered. You hear about energy efficiency requirements, you hear about the original methodology that EPA took to determine, kind of, the renewable capacity of certain states. But for me to say, where they're going to come out on those issues, again, would be pure conjecture.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. I guess next question, Tom, is just, Toshiba is the economic backstop to CBI and Westinghouse on Vogtle, and given kind of all their troubles they've incurred so far, A, is that having any effect on how Westinghouse is behaving on the project itself? And then B, what is your source of recourse if Toshiba has problems or if they sell down their interest in Westinghouse to make sure your protections stay in place?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we have an awfully strong contract, number one, and remember our contract is very different in its makeup than what you see at the summer project for SCANA. So, our contract is typically viewed as a turnkey, fixed-price deal. And actually, we've improved it over the construction cycle that we've experienced so far. So, that's kind of number one.","Number two is, when you think about just the commercial incentives for CBI, for Westinghouse, and even Toshiba, the best thing they can do to improve their own financial integrity is to perform under the contract, so that's important.","Number three, I know there's been some trade press about Toshiba's ability to execute given that they've had some negative publicity. In 2013, Westinghouse took appropriate charges for many of these issues. Those issues are behind Westinghouse.","To the extent there is a double, a two-notch downgrade at Toshiba's level, then they would post in LOC, we think they have the ability to do that. So, the contract provides us protection. Incentives, even in the event of tremendous turmoil, would always direct them to perform under the contract. And then finally, to the extent there are downgrades, the contract provides for Toshiba to post a letter of credit. We think they have the ability to do that.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. And I guess just one last question. Can you remind how you guys think about M&A from a corporate strategy perspective and how you prioritize that relative to other uses of capital?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely. Yeah. We've talked about this a lot and nothing's changed. Essentially, and we've talked about it in the past in terms of thinking about this kind of long-term trajectory we're on, as our CapEx program starts to wind down, I think this year we're $6.8 billion in CapEx, and next year $5.5 billion, and the year after that, $4.3 billion. I think those are the numbers, round numbers.","When you think about that, the consequence is that EPS starts to slow, and we've talked about that. And then, we said there's a shape to that; in other words, EPS growth should resume once you get into the next decade and you reach capacity, equilibrium in the region as well. There could be new CapEx associated with environmental law as well there could be new CapEx associated with 111(d). So, kind of on its own, we think the curve resumes.","In the interim, as we see CapEx winding down, we see cash flow growing immensely. And what we've said is during this period of immense cash flow, certainly compared to our recent history, Southern actually looked a little over equitized. So, we've said that on several earnings calls. So, what do we do about that? We've often talked about three options.","The first, simplest option is to buy back your own shares. The second option is kind of at the other end of the spectrum, is to buy somebody else's shares. And we always said that would require a premium and you would have to demonstrate a likelihood of recovery of the premium through increased value to shareholders. And in the middle has been just buying assets. And frankly, we've been doing that. If you look at kind of Southern Power's performance, we certainly have exceeded our own expectations on our ability to execute asset purchases, particularly in solar and wind. So, we've done that very successfully. So, those are really the options I would cover.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yep. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Stephen, how are you?","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Very well, thank you. Thanks for your time.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Most of my topics have been covered. I just wanted to hit on new nuclear briefly and check in on the Chinese project at Sanmen. Anything notable in terms of development there since the last quarter?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Not really. With respect of new nuclear at Georgia, what I said was we were going to call a timeout on pushing that one forward until we got this dispute resolved from a commercial standpoint. Recall, what we've said in the past is the dispute isn't so much with us anymore, it's kind of among and between the contractors, so we look forward for them to kind of constructively resolve their own issues, and then I think we can deal with them in a constructive way. So, let's see how that goes.","With respect to Sanmen, I think the most important thing there is, there's been a lot of conversation about this reactor coolant pump issue. That's not a critical path issue for us, and it looks as if, they have made a successful resolution of some of the design issues, so that will accrete to our benefit. So, it's going fine.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. That's all I had.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey. How are you doing, Michael?","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm all right, Tom. Congrats on a good first half of the year.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, sir.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","When you think about Southern Power, about how \u2013 how do you think about the maximum, meaning how big would you want Southern Power to be relative to the overall, and whether that impacts how you think about whether there are \u2013 whether under different umbrellas, Southern Power might have even greater growth opportunities, if there is such a cap?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, hey, that's a great question. That's something we actually talk about. Yeah, right now, they're about 8% of Southern. And you probably remember from prior discussions, but just to review for everybody's benefit, the way we structure Southern Power is to essentially replicate the kind of credit profile, risk profile, that we had at Southern. That is, as apart from any merchant investment, long-term bilateral contracts, durations of 14 years or so, creditworthy counterparties, we don't take fuel risks, we don't take transmission risks, so it kind of has the feel from a portfolio risk standpoint as does the rest of our franchise business.","Now, the question you raised is a very interesting one and that is, how high is too high, or is our appetite? I think you could easily kind of double Southern Power relative to the rest of Southern Company and still, I think, stay within our appetite, but that would be pushing it. Somewhere in the 15% of net income range.","But there again, we'd have to see what the nature of those investments are, our tax appetites, all that stuff. We'd have to review that, but that's what I would roughly say, relative to where we are now, we could still double it and remain within our appetite.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Somebody asked a question earlier about the EPA, and I wanted to ask you what \u2013 and obviously there's a lot of wood to chop when it comes to the upcoming carbon rules, state implementation plan designs, et cetera. How are you thinking about what the impact of other potential rules that haven't been finalized are, say maybe ozone...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","...and what that means both for the CapEx profile and for the cost to customers and the timeline for implementation, and whether it's ozone or some other rule that I'm not thinking of?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Nah, but listen, it's an excellent thought, because one of the problems that \u2013 well, let me start out with, I've been very public on this one. The body that has the same kind of lens we do, that is to balance the important objectives for our customers, a clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy, is Congress. I think with all the best of intentions EPA doesn't have the ability to assess, I think they get clean, but they don't have the ability to assess in a balanced way, safe, reliable, and affordable. It's not what they do.","And so, when we think about long-term implications of a regulator like EPA, putting out piecemeal the regulation, it is an important fact to note that the so-called pancaking of these various regulations are not particularly well-coordinated in balancing the overall energy portfolio of the United States.","That's why I've always said, we need kind of a consistent national energy policy, and I think we've got great leadership there. Fred Upton in the House, Lisa Murkowski in the Senate, these are terrific leaders of the United States, and I think they've got all of our best interests at heart in balancing these important issues.","The other issue that's just kind of interesting to think about along these lines, I would have gone to the \u2013 the Hatch\/Max, now Matt's issue, the remand to the D.C. District Court. And depending on what they do, they could send it back to EPA for clarification on how did they take cost into account. Well, the practical matter is, as this industry complied in good faith to that kind of far-reaching regulation, we've already spent billions of dollars.","We've started closing plants, we've eliminated jobs and tax base, we've done all sorts of things. The regulation remains in place, even though it's being revisited. It's important, I think, to learn as a lesson that whenever you evaluate the far-reaching implications of some of these regulations, we need to get all this right out of the gate as opposed to after the fact. So, that would be kind of my big lessons learned.","One is thinking about the pancake effect. We've got to think about it in an integrated way. Number two, we've got to get all those clean, safe, reliable, affordable factors considered before we implement. And three, I'd love to see national energy policy enacted by Congress.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carrie Saint Louis with Fidelity (46:11). Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Carrie (46:12).","Unknown Speaker","Hi. How are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Super. How are you?","Unknown Speaker","I'm doing fine. So, I just wanted to touch base on a little bit more on the capital raising and Mississippi Power. So, looking at the slides, it looks like you guys have put some bank debt in at Mississippi Power?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. That was true, Carrie (46:38). This is Art \u2013 back in the spring. About $900 million. Yeah.","Unknown Speaker","What was the decision behind that?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, again, it was renewing some bank loans that were already outstanding and we added a little bit to it at the same time.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Does that...","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, these are to serve as a bridge until we get some clarity on regulatory issues or to the point where we can issue securitization bonds and take that debt out.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. But is it like a general term loan? Are you deciding that you're not going to issue in the public market at Mississippi Power until there's a little bit more regulatory clarity? Or just what was the decision to use that type of funding versus public market issuance?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. That's absolutely true. With so much on the clarity side...","Unknown Speaker","Right.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's a problem.","Unknown Speaker","Okay.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, we're trying to do it as best we can. And again, the banks are worried about security as well. So, it's not just the public markets.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think just from a structural standpoint, too, if we believe that securitization bonds are in the near-term future, bank debt to bridge to that is an efficient way to finance. Yeah.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then just two other quick questions. On The Southern Company, the $1 billion of issuance this year, why are you issuing so much up at the parent this year versus prior years? It seems like a lot of issuance, I think it's $1.6 billion overall.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. These are remaining amounts, and a lot of that is to cover the cash needs at all of our Southern subs for the capital that we might be providing to them. And it also covers some of the Mississippi Power needs related to the refund and it will be provided in the form of an intercompany loan.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then turning to equity, so there still looks like there's no contemplation of increased equity issuance at the company?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That is our current plan. We continue to manage our portfolio over the long-term. Things change, but Southern Power, if they keep executing on their plan to the upper limits, there could be additional needs in that regard. But it depends on where we are with cash and where we see the future CapEx going for the entire business.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And, Carrie (49:10), let me just jump in on this one. If you look at our CapEx plan going into 2017, you see the drop from $6.8 billion to $4.3 billion. We're throwing off cash. So, it would be kind of silly for us to issue equity and then in turn repurchase it two years later.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. I guess just the concern I have is that your S&P put the whole complex, Southern and all OpCos on review for downgrade. And I guess that was done during this last quarter. So, I guess, and I don't want to read anything into it, but I would have thought that maybe you would like to maintain your ratings there. So, I guess, you're not, I guess, your comment is that you're not looking to issue equity to defend current credit rating. Is that a fair comment, or how should I think about that? I would have thought maybe you'd use a little bit more discretion about future equity, but it seems like you're saying not necessary.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we've got to run this business in the long-term. And I think the S&P move was all about Mississippi, to be honest with you. And I'm assuming that we're going to get fair treatment with the interim rates and then the permanent rates.","Unknown Speaker","Right.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I think we just need clarity around that process.","Unknown Speaker","So are you, if somehow in Mississippi things don't go as expected with the outcome for interim rate relief, is there a view that you would be open to considering issuing equity? Or are you saying that that's just not in the plans regardless?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, I mean, we're open to anything, to be honest with you. But we expect fair treatment. I think we have a compelling case for fair treatment. I don't expect anything other than that.","Unknown Speaker","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So...","Unknown Speaker","Well, I appreciate that. I think openness to equity is always constructive. So, thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, Tom. How are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Awesome. How are you?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I'm okay. Quick question. You said you thought that at this point the Vogtle dispute was among the consortium. Kind of what residual risk do you see Georgia Power still wearing here?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I think Georgia Power has demonstrated that they are very well protected via their contract. Residual risk, to me, I suppose there's some theoretical risk there. But, as a practical matter, when you think about even with the schedule changes, even with the increases in costs associated with those schedule changes, we believe that the, call it the majority of the cost, the big majority of the costs associated with that is being borne by the contractors. And that's being demonstrated over and over again.","And in fact, when you think about the fact that when Georgia had this plant certified, everyone thought that the cost was going to be a 12% price increase to Georgia Power's customers. Because the benefit has overwhelmed the increases in cost, we think now that estimate, frankly, Paul, has actually improved this quarter, as you see in the VCM12 filing. So, now we think we're in the bottom of the 6% to 8% range. Largely, this recent improvement is because we're financing at a much better rate than what even we thought when we got the federal loan guarantees.","You know remaining kind of risk, I think we've disclosed in prior quarters, one of the features of the contract is called a financial integrity payment. It basically provides that as the contractors perform their obligations, if they use up all of their profit and then they spend another $250 million above their profit, I guess it's above their cost, then we would share a $250 million segment, of which our share of that would be about $114 million.","And then everything above that would be for the account of the contractors guaranteed by Toshiba. That's been a part of the contract since day one. That's probably it in my view other than certain owner's costs and everything else. But that's about it. I think we're in terrific shape on the contract.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for that. And then do you \u2013 just back to Southern Power and how big it could be, do you think that Southern Power should be valued any differently than the utility?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Man, haven't we thought about that over the years? I know you've over the years thought about and I thought about it, too. Remember at one time all the infrastructure guys were buying up all these bilateral contracted entities, and they had tremendous value. We actually thought about that, and please understand from my background as a CFO, I know Art feels this way, we're always after shareholder interests, and so theoretically, you're always a buyer and a seller at a certain price. We're always there to do what's best for shareholders. If there's a better owner, we'll take advantage of it.","The other thing, though, it's not just a dollars and cents business. There's real blood and guts and relationships in this stuff. When you think about kind of the relationship that Southern Power has been able to strike in the marketplace, and this is really important, because it goes through the center of our business model. Customers in the middle of everything we do, reliability, price, and service, one of the most loyal customer groups that Southern Power has are co-ops and municipals. They absolutely have a long-term view on these kinds of assets and what service may be provided for their customers. So, I'm not sure, we'd have to think very hard about ever selling those kinds of relationships away from the franchise. And that's other considerations we'd have to take into account.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. And sorry to switch subjects, but over to Mississippi, you said you expect a fair outcome. I assume that you would not consider the staff rack to be a fair outcome?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I just don't even want to comment on the staff rack.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Appreciate you being on. Are there any other questions?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Hey. Afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Afternoon to you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. So, I wanted to go back a little bit to some of these balance sheet questions first. In terms of talking about future equitization, you talked pretty bullishly about your balance sheet, but obviously you've got the pressures from the credit rating agencies kind of in a more immediate sense. How do you think about that contingency level that you guys obviously baked in earlier, especially relative to some of the pressures that you alluded to before with Carrie (56:59)? If you can quantify it, perhaps, is really kind of what I'm getting at.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, it's kind of difficult to do that when you've got issues like Southern Power trying to execute on plans and you don't really have a good idea. But, what we're thinking about from a rating agency perspective is basically getting to a point where we can use, we can reduce the business risk, excuse me \u2013 increased financial risk because business risk will be reduced as we move out of these construction projects.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me say it a different way. Value is a function of risk and return. And when you make \u2013 I think the heart of your question gets into a bunch of current unknowables, what's going to happen with balance (57:45) depreciation and therefore cash flow, what's going to be the success rate of Southern Power, what's going to be our appetite to do things like gas infrastructure?","So, there's a host of things that we just can't get our arms around. What I can tell you is as internal risk starts to wind down, that is we get more resolution on Kemper, that is we get more wind down of construction programs and therefore financing pressure, it's clear to me that as internal risk subsides, cash flow improves, that we can probably think differently about our capital structure. That's why we've said for some time now that in fact we may believe in the future, we may be over equitized a bit. So, I can't put a number on it, but these are things that we talk about daily.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. And well, perhaps just to come back to it a little bit, you've alluded to scaling up the relative size of Southern Power within the Southern family here, but how do you think about potentially monetizing these assets? Obviously given the ITC recognition and the subsequent earnings in future years and obviously your co-ownership with certain fuel-cos, do you think about potentially sort of recycling the capital rather than necessarily scaling up the business per se? In particular, if you're going to hit limit the max you say at 15% or what have you, in the context of Southern Power?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Think about the kind of CapEx that would be associated with doubling Southern Power right now. That is a big number, okay? So I think the chances, and you think about how big Southern is, and you think that Southern continues to grow, if you think about what's going to be required to double Southern Power that is a big number. So number one, boy, that's an outside bet. Number two, I've been pretty consistent in saying, if there's a better owner, we'd certainly take advantage of it. We'd always do that. But taking into account historical relationships, long-term partnerships, all those sorts of things.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a great option to have.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Heck, yeah.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Maybe let me just ask it more bluntly. To what extent would you pursue that as a first option, rather than issuing equity in maybe kind of near-term sense to address balance sheet concerns?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If I'm a better owner of the asset and I have investment opportunities to issue equity, I would certainly issue the equity and make the investments that I need to make. I don't think about issuing equity in and of itself as being a bad thing.","Number one, I'm over equitized, so I've got some margin there. Number two, if I'm above my kind of EVA threshold, then I issue equity and create value. So, I don't look at issuing equity as a bad thing. If I'm issuing equity, it must mean that all other things being equal, I've got darn good value-enhancing investments to make.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","That's very fair. And let me come back to one \u2013 something you alluded to in your comments previously here on gas infrastructure. Where do you stand on those opportunities? You've kind of suggested there could be updates coming, but where do we stand today?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, a lot, a lot, a lot of activity. I am not prepared to give you an update today, only because I got a lot of irons in the fire and I got to see how those things resolve themselves.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Well with that, best of luck with those irons.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, sir. We appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ali, how are you?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","I'm doing well. Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon to you.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","First question, Tom. As you've mentioned, your weather-normalized sales through the first half are up 0.8%. As I recall, your full-year target was 1.3%. Is that still the target given where we've been through the first half?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Ali, this is Art. It still is. We don't adjust our targets that we put into our initial plans. But again, the momentum that we're seeing is beginning to approach what we've set out. We're certainly not there, but it was kind of forecast that way as well.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The signals we're seeing are really bullish. And if you look at kind of the national statistics, I'm sure the things the Fed is dealing with right now, we're seeing the same stuff they are. This residential move we've seen has been really bullish for us. We're not far away from where we were pre-recession on migration into our area and increasing customers. We're probably, I don't know, we think are about 70%, 80% of the way there?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","More like 60%, but...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, what are we expecting for the year 44,000 customers?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","In those days we were 55 to 60?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, so whatever percentage that is.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. Yeah. And then secondly, perhaps to you Art again, as you look at your O&M ramps again through the first half, I know you had talked about having some catch-up to do. Are we where you thought we should be on the O&M front, and again just remind us how we should think about that O&M this year and then going forward?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we're exactly what you said, we're right on target, even though year-over-year it looks like we're spending more money. And it is, a lot of that is driven by a couple of things. We've had more outages at our larger operating companies this year, last year as a comparison...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And planned outages.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And planned outages from a \u2013 into the tune of maybe $0.03 year-over-year. There is regulatory deferrals in Alabama in 2014 that you don't have in 2015, and that's about another $0.03. And then for other changes that we're seeing it's about another $0.06, so we're right in target. That deferral I mentioned at Alabama will reverse itself at year-end. So, when you get to year-end, we should be right on target with what we talked about at 3%, at 3.5% growth in non-fuel O&M.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And that's the run rate to think about going forward as well?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Yeah. And lastly, Tom, just clarifying the Vogtle dispute with the contractors, from your perspective, I know in the past you've alluded to the fact that if the other side is willing, there may be a settlement to be had where you give up some, they give up some and you move forward. Is that still an option or am I hearing that things are now going in a different direction, that they themselves are not sure where to go, or is that still something we should keep an eye on?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's something to keep an eye on. Look, we're always looking for a successful resolution. Failing a settlement, we're going to end up in court in Augusta, Georgia, to litigate around the commercial disputes.","So, I think once the contractors resolve their own differences, we'll be in a position to address in a constructive way how to settle this thing. I'm an optimist, but I think it's reasonable optimism. I think we have a basis to go forward. But, they've got to resolve their own differences first.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I have a really sort of quick question, I guess. Now that you guys are further along in the project and what have you, what do you guys estimate the cost of turning the lignite into gas is on just an operational basis?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, when I answer that one, Paul, I generally think about it as a net energy price equivalent to gas to Mississippi's customers. Now...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","In NBT (65:56) you mean?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, let me give it to you on what it used to be and we'll project, we'll get an estimate on what it is now. So, recall that our ability to stand behind our construction overruns has preserved largely the capital cost economics to Mississippi's customers. When I think about the relative lack of volatility of lignite fuel supply into the plant, so we control all that fuel, there's almost no volatility relative to natural gas.","Now remember the net cost is really net of also sales of by-products, which include sulfuric acid, ammonia, and CO2. The biggest issue there is CO2. At $100 a barrel, so this obviously isn't the case today, at $100 a barrel, remember, the CO2 revenues are indexed to oil. The net energy price was equivalent to about $1.25 per million BTUs, somewhere in that range.","Now with oil prices being down, the net energy price would be up, so let say it's, I don't know, call it $2.50. If $100, and call oil $50, and I'm being kind of broad brush here, but say it's $2.50 per million BTUs, somewhere in there. So, my sense is gas today is, what, $2.82, somewhere in there, last I saw? You're still going to compete favorably with natural gas with this plant. It'll be by all reasonable estimates a base load facility, and for those economics, recall it has almost no volatility.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So, let me just understand this. So, what you're saying is with the CO2 being used to extract oil, is that what you mean?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's right. Remember, we sell it under contract at Tellus and Denbury...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","...and we get paid revenue for what would otherwise be a waste stream.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Because it's indexed to oil, and as a result, obviously those numbers have changed, but even with them changing on an operational basis, you guys see all the reagents, all the energy you have to put into it, et cetera, the extraction is basically approximately $2.50, give or take. Is that right?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That was a broad estimate, okay?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't have in the top of my head what ammonia's worth, what sulfuric acid is worth. It assumes a heat rate, it assumes a variety of things. But that would be, as I sit here right now, it would be a reasonable estimate.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And you see this as dispatching pretty much...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Once it's up and running. We're not going to have a situation where you're just going to be running natural gas through the CCGT because it's more economic?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't think so, no.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. That's it. I mean, you've answered all my other questions.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, sir.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Thanks a lot. Have a good one.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. You too. Appreciate you being on.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Dan.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi. Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","How are you doing, bud?","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Pretty good. I have a couple related to the economy. You mentioned how you're seeing a rebound or a pickup in the residential and commercial areas, but I noticed that on the industrial it seemed it was a little slower than what we've seen in the last few months. I'm wondering if you have any more color on that.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure. Look, it's been consistent with kind of what the Fed has been seeing, it's what everybody's been kind of speculating, me included. Gosh. As the dollar has gained in strength relative to the euro, and when we think about what's going on in China and everything else, the United States economy, like it or not, may be the best place for people to invest, including Treasuries. Therefore, the strength of the dollar has really increased.","And one of the dilemmas that the Fed is trying to deal with is that they start on a path to lift off, if you will, and then depending on what trajectory they select, you could see further strengthening of the dollar relative to other international currencies, and obviously that could have an impact on exports, okay? We've seen already some of that happen. So, when you think about the Grexit, whether it happens are not, Japan, China, like I said, event risk in the Soviet Union or in the Middle East, the dollar still looks pretty darn good. So, we've seen some slowdown in exports. Likewise, we've seen an increase in imports.","The other thing that's kind of weighed on the industrial activity a little bit is oil prices. As oil prices being so low, we've seen kind of a reduction of bid in the pipelines, some manufacturing, things like that. Primary metals are down a little bit, chemicals are down a little bit, also, in this whole mix. So, that's what you're seeing. That's what's responsible for some of that.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Good. I also had a question, another question kind of related to the changes you've made to the financing plan. You know, overall it has, the three-year total didn't change much, but it looks like the 2015's about were $445 million lower, whereas 2016's $475 million higher. But you're still talking about the same CapEx numbers? So, should we maybe \u2013 is that more related to maybe some CapEx getting delayed into 2016 that was in 2015? Or how should we think about that year-over-year change related to the CapEx forecast?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Dan, it really is a function of cash flows within the operating companies, how they change, what their needs might be, whether they can push an issuance out of one year into the next.","Again, we try to balance from a Southern Company perspective, who's going to market, when they go to market, so that we don't all go at the same time. So, we're just trying to balance out as we move through time how we tap the markets in the most efficient way.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then lastly on Vogtle, you didn't really breakout the Unit 3 and Unit 4 like you have in the past. And so, I'm just curious, just looking into this current quarter, the third quarter, it sounds like setting the Unit 3 say one is one of the critical items. I was wondering if you could identify any of the other critical items in Unit 3 and Unit 4 in this upcoming quarter.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the near term, you hit it, would be to set the CA01 in Unit 3. There are some other things going on there, the transmission work that we mentioned, I believe, in the script. That ops building, as Tom mentioned as well, is very, very important to us. The one other thing that's really not mentioned here, which is really down on the horizon part of Unit 3, it's the installation of the turbine generator, which I believe is late this year, early next, I believe.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's right.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Which is a big deal. And that turbine building has probably another 60 feet of steel to go on top once that turbine deck's built. So, if you look at the pictures we put in the slide deck, it's beginning to look like what it's going to look like at the end of the day. And that's exciting for us.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And you know what, I'll just make the invitation, I know certain of you guys have taken investors on to the site to be able to see this stuff, the scale of this work is just immense. And in order to kind of get an appreciation for it, if you guys maybe want to come see it, we'd be glad to arrange any kind of visit you want.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. How about Unit 4? Are there any critical items in this quarter [c there?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Dan. I think they set some smaller modules in, but the real big work there is going to be modular related. The CA20 assembly has begun in the modular assembly building. And they've begun making panels for the CA01 module at Unit 4 as well. So, those are big deals. We've learned a lot of lessons from Unit 3, and we're hopefully to going to put those lessons to use and build them quicker on Unit 4.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And the other thing that I guess I come away with when I go out there and kick the tires on the side, listen to the people building it, we're actually feeling pretty good about the schedule on Unit 2. There's a lot of element \u2013 I'm sorry, Unit 4. There's a lot of elements on Unit 4 that relative to Unit T3 are accelerated. That's good for the project.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, sir. Operator, are there any more questions?","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I just want to say thank you to everybody. We had a heck of a first half of the year. The franchise is doing fabulous. We're coming off a year where we were the highest level of customer satisfaction, that's our ultimate barometer. But financially, we're great; operationally, we're great. Southern Power's doing fine. Making big progress on these big projects. I'm very happy to report a really good first six months and look forward to the next six months. Thank you all for being on the call. Thank you for following us, and look forward to talking with you soon. Have a great afternoon.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.","Daniel S. Tucker - Senior Vice President of Finance, Treasurer","Thank you, Julian, and welcome everyone to Southern Company's third quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well with the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss on today's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. As you can see from the earnings materials we released this morning and the announcement we made last night, we have a lot of good news to share today.","First, our traditional operating companies continue to operate superbly in the third quarter of 2015 and they're on track to deliver on their financial targets for 2015. Second, Southern Power also performed exceptionally well in the third quarter, exceeding our expectations. So, so far this year, Southern Power has announced 12 new renewable projects with an ownership stake in these facilities of just over 1000 megawatts.","Third, we've entered into an agreement to settle the commercial litigation associated with Vogtle units 3 and 4 and better position the project for the remaining months of its construction. And four, we achieved a major technical milestone in our Kemper facility with outstanding initial results in the fluidization testing phase of start-up.","In a few moments Art will discuss the drivers of our third quarter performance in more depth and provide our earnings estimate for the remainder of the year. Let's now discuss the project \u2013 I mean the progress on Vogtle and Kemper in more detail.","First, an update on Plant Vogtle units 3 and 4. As you may have seen in our disclosures, we've agreed on terms to resolve the outstanding litigation with our EPC contractors. As we've shared previously on these calls, we believe the main obstacle to resolving these issues outside of court was the disagreement that existed among and between the contractors themselves.","In a major move to resolve these disagreements, Westinghouse has agreed to purchase Stone & Webster, the AP1000 construction arm of CB&I and consortium partner in our EPC contract. Under the proposed transaction, Westinghouse and its affiliates would serve as the prime contractor for the project. Not only is this expected to make activities more efficient at the work site, it would also remove a lingering concern about contractor financial stability.","Contemporaneous with that transaction's closing, we will agree to settle our commercial dispute. The proposed settlement contains the following key terms: first, all open claims, including any potential extension of those claims as well as future claims that could have been asserted under the original terms of the EPC agreement, will be dismissed. This includes the ongoing litigation in Augusta, Georgia. Second, the EPC agreement will be amended to restrict the contractors' ability to seek further increases in the contract price by limiting changes which constitute NRC changes in law.","Third, the guaranteed substantial completion dates in the EPC agreement will be extended to June 30, 2019 for Unit 3 and June 30, 2020 for Unit 4, consistent with the current project construction schedule. In exchange for these benefits, Georgia Power has agreed to pay approximately $350 million. The cash impact of this amount are as follows: $121 million has already been paid as Georgia Power's share of disputed invoices; $114 million is to be paid upon the finalization of the agreement; and $114 million has been structured as milestone and incentive payment, heavily weighted to fuel load in December of 2018 and December of 2019. We are very pleased with these terms as they would achieve several key very important objectives.","First, these terms reaffirm our current schedule and incentivize the contractor to meet it. Second, the term streamline resource deployment by removing inefficient contractor interaction. Third, it should reduce the risk associated with potential future claim. And four, these terms reinforce how well the EPC contract protects customers. In fact, customer rate impact for Vogtle units 3 and 4 even with this settlement are projected to be well within the previously disclosed range of 6% to 8%. In fact, our current projection, including the settlement, is less than 7%. With 4.5% already in Georgia Power's rate, this suggests that the rate increases through the completion of the project will be less than 2.5%.","Moreover, the proposed settlement amount is significantly less than the amount of the contractor claims in the current litigation, which only includes their estimated cost for approximately 21 months of delay. Without a settlement, the contractors could have asserted additional claims, including their estimated cost for all or some portion of up to 18 months of further delays. As a part of the settlement, we also sought additional protection from similar lawsuits in the future. We believe the proposed amendment to the change in law provisions of the EPC contracts are perhaps the most significant element of the agreement.","So, again, we are gratified to have reached this agreement which, with a proposed settlement cost of approximately $350 million, we believe that this proposed settlement is exceedingly favorable for customers and for the overall success of the project. The Georgia PSC has been briefed on key terms of the agreement. Their initial reaction was positive and they understand that it removes a significant overhang. Georgia Power will submit the ultimate settlement agreement and related amendments to the EPC agreement to the PSC for a more detailed review.","Finally, as anticipated on our last call, we achieved several major milestones this last quarter for Vogtle units 3 and 4. The most notable was the placement of the CA01 module in Unit 3. Located inside the containment vessel, this module will house the steam generators. At 2.3 million pounds, this was the heaviest lift to-date on the project. We also began installing the first of many shield-building panels for Unit 3 and we installed the CA04 module for Unit 4. This module will ultimately have the reactor vessel for Unit 4, which is already on site.","Let's turn now to an update on the Kemper County facility. During our earnings call one year ago, we announced that the combined cycle was in service and that the remaining construction schedule for Kemper had been extended into the first half of 2016 and that we plan to take a very methodical approach to the completion and start-up of the remainder of that facility. Today, those decisions are benefiting the entire project.","The combined cycle has been performing exceptionally well for more than a year, providing some $23 million in energy savings for Mississippi Power customers. The gas plant has been operating with an equivalent forced outage rating of less than 1%, compared with an industry average of more than 6%.","We are also well under way with major start-up activities. Last week, we began fluidization trials on the first of the two gasifiers. As a reminder, the fluidization test is a process in which sand is used as a substitute for lignite in order to test the flow of solids through the gasifier vessel. Not only does this process validate a critical component and scale-up of these technologies, but it also allows the operations team to test and fine-tune control systems beyond what is possible with simulators.","We are extremely pleased with the results so far. In fact, the tests are going even better than what we expected; and we will take valuable lessons learned into the testing of the second gasifier later this year. In addition, we plan to conduct final commissioning of our lignite preparation systems over the next several weeks and begin the cure-out process for the gasifier refractory in preparation for the first production of syngas.","As disclosed yesterday in our 8-K, we've increased the estimated cost subject to cost cap by approximately $150 million. Approximately $60 million of this amount has been incurred to address issues identified through our start-up and checkout process, as well as to help prepare the plant to operate more reliably with either lignite or natural gas. These efforts have positioned the project for the success we are experiencing today with the major start-up activities.","The remainder of the increased cost is for additional schedule contingencies we expect to incur with an in-service still scheduled for the first half of 2016, consistent with our previous and current disclosure. As we've said many times in the past, we will not take shortcuts or sacrifice safety in order to expedite completion of the plant, and we remain committed to providing a world-class generating facility for customers.","Finally, with respect to regulatory matters in Mississippi, our immediate focus is on getting permanent rates in place for the assets already placed in service. Hearings are scheduled to begin November 10, and we expect a decision from the Public Service Commission on or before December 8.","I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial update.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Tom. For the third quarter of 2015, we earned $1.05 per share, compared to $0.80 per share in the third quarter of 2014, an increase of $0.25 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 we earned $2.30 per share, compared to $1.88 per share for the same period in 2014, an increase of $0.42 per share.","Earnings for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 include after-tax charges of $93 million or $0.11 per share; and $112 million or $0.13 per share, respectively, related to increased cost estimates for the construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County project. Earnings for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2014 include after-tax charges of $258 million or $0.29 per share, and $493 million or $0.55 per share, respectively, related to the Kemper County project.","Earnings for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, also include after-tax charges of $12 million related to the proposed acquisition of AGL Resources. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, also include a $4 million after-tax charge related to the discontinued operations of Mirant and the March 2009 settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery, LLC.","Excluding these items, earnings for the third quarter of 2015 were $1.17 per share, compared with 1.09 per share for the third quarter of 2014, an increase of $0.08 per share. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, excluding these items, were $2.45 per share, compared with $2.43 per share for the same period in 2014, an increase of $0.02 per share.","Earnings for the third quarter of 2015 were driven by positive retail revenue effects in our traditional operating companies, partially offset by increased operations and maintenance expenses. Quarter-over-quarter, earnings were also positively impacted by Southern Power's recent project development and acquisition success. A more detailed summary of our quarter-over-quarter earnings drivers can be found in the slide deck posted on our website.","The southeastern economy continues to grow, supported by robust employment growth, a steady recovery in the housing sector, stronger than expected consumer spending and continued in-migration into our region. As a result, we experienced positive growth in retail sales in the third quarter, as total weather-adjusted retail sales increased 0.2% over the third quarter of 2014 and 0.6% on a year-to-date basis.","Weather-adjusted residential sales were up 0.1% over the third quarter of 2014 and 0.5% year-to-date. This growth has been driven primarily by customer growth, which is approaching historical norms for the first time since the recession. For the first nine months of 2015, nearly 28,000 residential customers were added across the Southern Company's system, with 38,000 added in the last 12 months.","Weather-adjusted commercial sales were up 1% during the third quarter of 2015, compared with the same period in 2014. Growth in commercial sales has been consistent across all three quarters this year and reflects improved in-migration, growth in the residential customer base, modest income improvement, and increased consumer confidence and spending.","Consistent with this data, the Atlanta office market absorbed almost 2.2 million square feet in 2015, driving the vacancy rate below 17%; the lowest level since the end of 2008. While industrial sales are up 0.5% year-to-date, they fell 0.6% during the third quarter. A strong dollar, low oil prices and weak global growth condition continue to constrain growth in the industrial sector. Exports remain on a downward trend, although our region continues to fare better than the rest of the nation.","While the performance of industrial segments such as chemicals, primary metals and paper has lagged, those results had been at least partially offset by improved performance in the Transportation segment and in construction-related segments such as lumber and stone, clay and glass.","Our economic development pipeline remains robust and on a positive long-term trajectory. In September, Mercedes-Benz announced that it will be producing a new hybrid SUV at its Vance, Alabama plant. This $1.3 billion project will result in the expansion of its SUV assembly shop and the creation of 300 new jobs in 2017.","Tuscaloosa-based SMP Group and Birmingham-based Magma International, both suppliers to Mercedes-Benz, plan to add 600 jobs and 350 jobs respectively. You will recall that Mercedes-Benz is moving its headquarters to Atlanta. It's recently been announced that Lincoln Financial Group will also relocate to Atlanta, adding 600 jobs in 2016. In addition, Norcross, Georgia-based Suniva, a manufacturer of solar panels, has also announced it will add 500 jobs in the immediate near-term.","To-date, more than 12,000 new jobs have been announced in our service region this year. This represents an increase of more than 250%, compared to the first nine months of 2014. The projected investment for new projects announced year-to-date is $4.8 billion, a 95% increase over the same period in 2014.","Before I share our earnings outlook for the remainder of 2015, I'd like to provide an update on Southern Power capital expenditures resulting from the recent successes that Tom noted earlier.","In February of this year, we provided a forecast for Southern Power capital investments totaling $1.4 billion, with $600 million of that set aside for placeholder projects.","Southern Power's success in finding value-accretive projects has exceeded our expectations. Strong relationships, tax appetite and a proven ability to close transactions has made Southern Power an attractive partner for acquisitions in the renewable market. As a result, Southern Power is now projected to have capital investments totaling $2.3 billion for 2015.","Similarly, for 2016, Southern Power has already secured project investments consistent with our earlier forecast of $1.3 billion, with even more projects still under consideration for that year. We are optimistic that Southern Power will exceed its current forecast for 2016 much as it has surpassed its 2015 forecast.","Since 2010, when Southern Power made its first investment in utility scale solar with the Cimarron Solar Facility, Southern Power has developed one of the nation's largest contracted renewable portfolios with more than 1600 megawatts of generating capacity announced, acquired or under construction.","Key attributes of this portfolio include: long-term contracts averaging more than 20 years in length; high credit-worthy counter parties; and a long-term low volatility cash profile that is an excellent complement to the rest of Southern Power's generation portfolio, as well as to Southern Company's overall financial objectives.","Turning now to our fourth quarter estimate or earnings per share guidance for 2015. Our fourth quarter estimate is $0.43 per share. This implies a year-end result of $2.88 per share, excluding charges associated with Kemper, AGL and Mirant-related items, which is at the very top of our annual guidance range of $2.76 to $2.88 per share.","I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Art. As evidenced by our discussion today, the third quarter of 2015 was indeed a remarkable quarter. However, I would be remiss not to mention that the most significant measure of our performance is always customer satisfaction.","With that in mind, I am pleased to report that our four traditional franchise utilities have once again ranked in the top quartile for customer satisfaction for the 14th consecutive year in our annual Customer Value Benchmark survey. Among three national peer utilities, I mean, Alabama Power, Gulf Power and Georgia Power are the only utilities to rank in the top quartile for all three customer classes: residential, general business and large business.","As always, it is our customer-focused business model with its emphasis on outstanding reliability, best-in-class customer service and rates below the national average that remain the cornerstone of our business and a key driver of long-term value to Southern Company's shareholders.","We are now ready to take your questions. Operator, we'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","One moment, please, for the first question. And our first question today comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Anthony, how are you? Hey, man.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Never been better. How about yourself?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks. Doing great.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Just two quick questions, the first on Southern Power. I mean, what is that company seeing in the market right now for price of like utility scale solar?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Anthony, this is Art. It depends on the PPA contract and how old it might be. More recent contracts are priced a lot lower than the older ones; and that's a function of kind of the timeframe of when that original PPA was established. So I have a hard time giving you an answer about \u2013 that wouldn't be very meaningful to you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The general trend is newer contracts are cheaper than older contracts. Prices are coming down.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And moving to Kemper, I mean, you guys seem like you're making some great headway at Kemper in start-up. But earlier this month, the Mississippi staff had filed a recommendation or I guess their view of the project and they're looking at something, I guess, a start-up date much different than what the company is forecasting. Are there any big differences or things you think maybe the staff has missed and why you're more optimistic on the first half 2016 start-up, where I think the Mississippi staff engineer put it somewhere like a 30% likelihood of a 2016 start-up?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Anthony, it really goes to kind of people's assessment after the technology risk. This is a first-of-a-kind technology. And if I had to kind of segment the four big tests we've been going through, the first one I think was a test of, I'm going to call it, the structural integrity when we pressurize the whole facility. The second test really went to first fire of the boiler. The third test is this fluidization test. The fourth test will be essentially turning lignite into syngas.","And when I think about that, the most important of these tests I think from a technical standpoint was this fluidization test. Recall that scale-up from Wilsonville to Plant Ratcliffe at Kemper County is about 100-to-1; and I think different people saw our ability to do that differently. In fact, I know there were some people that were very dubious of our ability to achieve that kind of performance with scale-up.","Just as serendipity would have it, I was at the plant walking the plant site and in the control room on the day that we passed the first test. It started at midnight and went through \u2013 and actually it's still going through right now. But I can tell you once we hit the fluidization process, it was amazingly stable. Even in, say, the first eight hours of the test it was amazingly stable.","Obviously, there's always little fine-tunings; and that's one of the things that they're working on through the balance of the fluidization test for Unit A. But I would just say that outsiders looking at this technical process would have put a lot more risk associated with that. The fact that \u2013 look, I should say this, we expect it to be successful; we didn't expect it to be as good as it went. So we're very happy with it.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Thank you, bud.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Dan.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Tom, just \u2013 hey. Just on the renegotiation on Vogtle, you guys have long said that your contract was a fixed-fee contract, lot of protection, and it seems like your renegotiated that contract in exchange for money. Can you like tell me or lay out for me what pieces got better in the contract from what you had before to justify the extra money going to the EPC guys?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, Dan, if you think about what gave rise to the commercial disputes and the litigation, the original agreement resulted in disputes that arose from field interpretations of a broad range of NRC regulatory requirements. In other words, the contract said, you've got to do it if the NRC regulator requires you to do it; they would dispute a field interpretation of a requirement, Dan.","The revision in the language, which is much tighter, says that going forward only new regulations or guidance documents, so these are actual pieces of paper, that are officially issued and acknowledged by the NRC as changes to the agency's previous positions will be considered owner's responsibility, is a very much narrower definition as to what's eligible for a change order. That's a really big deal.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And I guess that Toshiba certainly had other problems in the press, but how did you guys get comfortable with concentrating your performance needs on them? And did they make any financial guarantees to put collateral or credit aside to cover if they end up running overruns that are on their tab versus your tab?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Oh my gosh! I think we're in so much of a better shape. Dan, you could phrase the question that way or you could phrase the question about CBI and the all the concerns there. Basically, we put Westinghouse right in the front seat. And you may recall from the issues you raised about Toshiba, Westinghouse has taken its accounting charges, I think, around 2013, somewhere around that timeframe. And they were not subject to their business, Westinghouse's business was not subject to a lot of the concerns that Toshiba entered into in its accounting problems.","So Westinghouse itself did the hard work earlier in time. They are not impacted directly. And we think that going forward the balance of risk is much improved for the project, for Westinghouse to take the prime contractor role and not have to deal with kind of a codependent control with CBI. We're much better off.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And I'm sorry for belaboring this. I just want to make sure that I understand the pieces. But you guys and scan (30:50) are now targeting the same in-service dates or guaranteed in-service dates for your units. Is there enough trade labor to be executing kind of the same finishing work at the same time?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. We have all the labor we need on-site; and let's be very clear that labor now transfers from CBI to Westinghouse largely, for the most part. And we believe while whatever you say about kind of on the schedule dates, we think we're about two months kind of ahead on a schedule basis, at least than they are. We believe we've got plenty of personnel. You may have also seen that Westinghouse has entered into some conversations with Fluor about augmenting personnel at the sites. So we feel great about where we are there.","Daniel Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very good. Thank you, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Steve.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Tom, hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. First, just kind of a technical question on your financing slides in here. So you have, I think, $2.12 billion of equity over the next three years in here, and the last time you did this slide after the AGL deal, there was none. Is that just that you're now including the equity to fund the AGL deal in the plan and that's the only difference?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sir. That's correct.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's what I thought. Secondly, on Southern Power, maybe just overall, what kind of returns are you earning on these projects that you've won over the last year or what kind of expected returns?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Every project's a little different. We've kind of been over this in calls in the past. We use the same methodology that we used in the past. In other words, we use a hurdle rate that looks like a yield curve. And the shape of the yield curve or the requirement, where you are on the yield curve is based on a variety of factors, including the term of the contract, any of the project specific risks, things like that.","In general, what we have kind of said is that the ROE, the book ROE of Southern Power, is expected to exceed kind of our regulated book ROE by some amount. And, again, it depends. The longer term contracts will resemble a utility return. If, in fact, there are greater risks in a utility project, then we can see 150 basis points higher. That would be the general range that I would be looking for.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And that's good for not just the whole, so that's good for the new investments that you've been making (33:37).","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely right.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And how generally are you levering these projects? 50-50?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Southern Power's about 45% equity, 55% debt; and that's the way we've financed that organization for years now.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We think that corporate financing is much more effective, more flexible, cheaper than project financing.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And may I just...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Excuse me, Steve, one more thing, just to be clear. When we look at these things, they're all on an IRR and cash basis. You asked the book return, but same thing.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, yeah. Yeah, no, so it's low teens, low to mid-teens IRRs \u2013 or, excuse me, levered IRRs?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. For an unlevered IRR, it would be 6% to 7%, depending on what \u2013 it would be just identical. Just like I said, either identical to or slightly higher than what we would be out of the core utility business.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just so I understand, based on this kind of new what's locked up for Southern Power on the update that you've given. Roughly what level of ITCs do you expect to have in 2015 and 2016, or at least in 2015? Could you give us that number?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll get somebody to...","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hold on a second.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're getting the number now. But we're assuming in everything we're looking at that the 30% ITC goes away in 2017. So it's just 2015 and 2016 left. Frankly, our relationship that we've developed with the people like First Solar and others, our ability to execute quickly, our tax appetite have all given us, I think, this kind of flow of deal our way.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Steve, the number is \u2013 I can't find the number. The number I recall is about $55 million this year; and that probably compares to $45 million to $48 million last year; somewhere in that range.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll get it for you later.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, lastly, it looks like based on the fourth quarter projection you're going to end up the year at about the higher end of your range for 2015?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. (36:12).","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. So if you were to say what's driving you kind of being at the higher end, is it primarily the higher Southern Power investment or something else?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's operating companies performing as we thought they would, plus what we know is going to happen with Southern Power. If you look at our past three, four quarters, it's about $0.43 a share; somewhere around there.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. If you look, our fourth quarter earnings have run across the board. It depends on what kind of weather year we've had. But as I look for the year-end, Steve, I'm looking year-over-year; I expect maybe $0.05 of the accretion year-over-year to come from Southern Power, maybe $0.06 from the operating companies, a penny from our parent and maybe minus $0.04 on shares. And that would account for the $0.08 increase from $2.80 to $2.88.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Maybe if you just look at our past three years' performance of earnings per share, in 2012 through 2014 we went $0.44, $0.48, $0.38. We feel very confident about our ability to hit our numbers.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, man.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. How are you doing? Quick question on Kemper is, are you seeing the first half of 2016 for commercial and service, how about the deadlines for tax credits and I think it's April, is that right?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's right.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Are you thinking \u2013 I guess does the successful test give you any confidence about trying to meet that deadline?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, by taking the contingency for the next three months, we're suggesting that the probable outcome is not to make that, but we'll only...","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There's an opportunity that we could...","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And there's still opportunity to hit that date.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And in terms of the $350 million, how does that compare to the press numbers that we had earlier seen about the lawsuit. I mean is it $900 million, I believe I recall, plus extra growth on top of that for other items? And does the $350 million represent basically \u2013 is that a resolution of the entire $900 million-plus?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's actually bigger than $900 million-plus. If you think about it, our share, if you kind of gross up our share in disclosures, the current litigation was around $1.5 billion, something like that. Now that's total. And then what we also \u2013 that was for the first kind of 21 months of delays. Recall also we're wiping away potential extension of current litigation for the next 18 months that would carry us through to in-service dates in the middle of 2019 and 2020. And we also tightened up, recall, Westinghouse taking over for CBI; plus we tightened up in a very significant way the ability for the contractor to provide change orders that would be agreed upon.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So when you add all those up, we think the settlement is very attractive.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Does this mean that the contractors are picking up the other part of the 1-point-something-billion above the $350 million in their lawsuits?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If that's the real number.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, if that's the real number.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We always disputed that.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann from Mizuho Sec. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","JvR.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Tom Fanning. How are you? How are those yellow jackets doing?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey. After last weekend, they're doing great.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Exactly. Couple of questions. The first one I guess is \u2013 the first several questions are on Kemper. When do you get to run the lignite through for the syngas test?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right around the end of the year; could be early January, but \u2013 yeah.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I've got to tell you, like I said, I was walking around the plant, I was in the control room, met with plant management later that day. The general belief is we're going to be able to manipulate lignite a lot easier than sand. Sand is a denser material. They all felt that if we could pass this test the way we were doing, they really felt they're going to be able to handle the lignite pretty well. So they're feeling good.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And then the second question on the whole Kemper thing is do you need to see the whole plant operational before you can file the second rate case in Mississippi?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's the intention. I mean, the whole plant, it needs to be CoD.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","That's what I meant, yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And then just switching over to the settlement. I know there's a lot of \u2013 congratulations on getting that done \u2013 but I'm just having a tough time still understanding how those risks are bucketed now that it's done. So let's just say you get to 2020-2019 and everything else and you're going to start seeing some delays. How does all that work? And who bears what risk, I guess, is the question I'm really asking, longer term?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So let me operate in kind of the world of 100% dollars, as opposed to Georgia Power dollars.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But we've guided installment payments on this last $114 million such that fuel load now becomes the kind of operative target in the contract. In 100% dollars, $35 million is tied to fuel load on year-end 2018 and $35 million is tied to fuel load on December of 2019. And to the extent they miss, I think it's about $10 million a month \u2013 something like that \u2013 that, that number would be reduced. So not only is this third $114 million staged to milestones over time, it also is heavily weighted as an incentive to hit fuel load when we said it would.","Now here's my other editorial comment. You remember when the consortium changed their schedule. There was a lot going on behind the scenes and you heard kind of the probable angst in our voice about that these problems are being driven not really by the performance of the project, but by arguments and disputes among the training contractors. It was our belief that they gave us a schedule that they can improve on. We believe, given what everybody has agreed to here, that they're going to be able to hit this schedule.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. But in the unlikely event, what you're saying is, let's say this thing slips into 2021 or something for the first unit, who absorbs the PTC in the absence of the PTCs?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there would be $10 million reductions in the incentive payments, there would be liquidated damages.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay, okay. I got it. I just wanted to make sure I was reading it correctly.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Super. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, buddy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ali. How are you?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, Tom. How are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Super.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Couple of things. One is, Tom, if I look at your weather normalized retail sales, we saw the slowdown in the third quarter and you were at 0.6% through the nine months. So how does that 1.3% for the year target look now and what's realistically the target we should be looking at for the year and looking beyond that?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's less. You know what, Ali, I mean not to kind of wear the Fed thing out, but we're seeing the same things the Fed is seeing, especially when you look at kind of the leading and the lagging nature of these indicators. Industrial sales are a leading indicator; commercial sales are typically your lagging indicator. Well, it looks as if the leading indicator is slowing and the lagging indicator is what's really carrying the day. So that's kind of interesting.","I think the Fed is wrestling \u2013 and Art went through a litany of kind of the data. I think the Fed is wrestling with those same things. If they now begin liftoff and communicate a trajectory, what does that say about the confidence of the continued recovery, given all the exogenous factors like malaise in Europe, event risk, Russia, Middle East, lack of transparency in China. These are the things we're all wrestling with. The good news, as Art said, is kind of Atlanta, for example. Top five in the United States in job creation and in in-migration. In fact, we were fourth in job creation, I think, only to Houston, Dallas and Phoenix.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Correct.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So that's all good stuff. If you look at our economic development pipeline, 15,600 jobs announced \u2013 12,000.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","12,000.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","12,600 jobs announced in the year 2015 and that will take place from 2015 through 2018; almost $5 billion in capital. The economic development arm looks pretty good. And so we kind of say to ourselves, what is this? Is this a permanent flattening? Is this a secular change in the growth of the United States economy, or is this a pausing in which, now, as we adjust to a different export environment and monetary environment, we'll catch up? What would you add to that?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Ali, I think if you look at the numbers, industrial is really the one that's lagging the most. And, as you remember, from a revenue perspective, that is the least impactful to our company. But if you had them at 1% growth rather than a 0.5% growth, we'd be up close to a 1% growth year-over-year on a year-to-date basis, almost actually 1.3%. But we're really pleased with the commercial end of the business. We've been waiting for a number of years for that to come around, and it has.","Customer growth has been very strong. That's, again, a reflection of in-migration. Use per customer is still eating away that. That's a bit of the efficiency gain that we're seeing through natural occurrence with appliance replacement and those kinds of things.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Not only energy efficiency, but also this kind of \u2013 we think here again, a secular shift away from single-family housing to multi-family housing. And that's really driven by just kind of new tougher credit guidelines, as well as it may be with the millennials, they like being flexible and living in apartments, rather than undertaking big fixed investments like owning a house. So we want to see how that shakes out, too.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So at this point, embedded in your full-year numbers, Tom, what would be sort of the weather normalized load growth we should be looking at?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Weather-normalized number for retail sales, about 0.7%. I mean, that's just a pure guess. But seeing what we're seeing in the industrial market and we expect the commercial market to do well, that's about what we think.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And you've talked about, I think, 1.2%, 1.3%, sort of longer term as well and in growth. Is that still what you feel is the right number?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're going to relook that and we'll update you on that on the next quarter's call when we look at the full-year 2016 through 2019.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Separate question. Tom, coming back to Southern Power for a sec. So given that you've obviously exceeded your targets and you've got a bigger portfolio, what's sort of the underlying annual net income run rate that this portfolio is now running for you? Obviously, higher than you were previously thinking.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, man. So it was fascinating when you kind of break down where we were into 2015. We knew just because they have contracts in place, they were kind of below $150 million in net income; and then we gave them kind of a stretch target to hit that would get them up to about $180 million. So when we thought about developing the financial plan, we kind of had a number in there of about $180 million. And with everything we know now, we're going to be over $200 million, more likely $210 million. And so, we'll see. So we've done better. My sense is we're going to see similar performance, even though we haven't set all these numbers yet. I'm just telling you what I think. I think we're going to see similar performance next year.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, in the past, you talked about the headwind that would be created by the ITC going from 30% to 10%. How should we now think about that as we're thinking about 2017?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Well, this is kind of fun to think about. Because we've been very public, and I hope you guys give us credit for this. We're very transparent on how we see growth rates and everything else. And when we tell you what we believe about growth, it's because we can see it with reasonable kind of stretch targets, we think we can do what we say we're going to do.","When we reduced our growth rate to 3% to 4%, it was because of all of these factors; and we were very transparent in telling you about \u2013 I think the funny word I used was divot in 2017. That would be represented by the loss of 30% investment tax credit and, likely, fewer projects for solar in that and maybe wind helps fill that in. And then we said that we would resume a growth rate that would be more attractive once we saw more environmental spending at the end of the decade and into the 2020's, as well as the response to the clean power plant. And then we did the AGL merger.","So let's think about the slugs of kind of EPS growth. 2015 and 2016, you're seeing Southern Power outperform our internal targets; and so you're seeing growth there. From 2017, 2018, 2019, because AGL has very predictable and transparent earning streams resulting from safety-related pipeline replacement programs that are under rate riders. We already know Georgia, Illinois, potentially other states. We can see, and I think we suggested that you would see something like $0.10 a share or so in the 2017, 2018, 2019 timeframe, okay?","So we bump up there on top of whatever Southern Power can produce. And then some of those projects continue into the 2020's. And then you see in the 2020s now, I think now you have time to get to the ramifications of environmental spending, plus new generation required by the clean power plant. So not only will that be more renewable, it will be more combined cycle, probably displacing coal, as well as more combustion turbines needed to respond to the intermittency of greater penetrating renewable resources.","So if you look at it, the first slug is going to be Southern Power, the second slug will be Southern Power plus AGL, the third slug will be Southern Power, AGL, plus clean power plant and environmental spending. And so, I think we'll give you more guidance about our growth rate in January. Suffice to say, we did say that our new kind of longer term trajectory, assuming we close AGL, will be in the 4% to 5% range.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. It's very helpful. Last question on AGL financing, have you gotten the credit rating agencies completely on board with your financing plan or is that still being worked on?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we had discussions with the agencies prior to the announcement. And we outlined the financing plan for them issuing equity over a three-year timeframe, and that we believe that our metrics will be consistent with where we are before where we are today by the time we get to 2019. We'll issue a lot of debt upfront, but over time we'll get our metrics back to a point where they're consistent with where we started.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Whatever.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, just to follow up on, I was a little unclear about Mike Weinstein's question about the Kemper tax credit. You guys do expect to get the plant up by April to get it, is that what you were \u2013 it wasn't completely clear.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We think that we might or might not. We've added three months of reserve contingency to be conservative to say that we might not make March 31; it might be as late as June 30. So that's the financial charge we made. Obviously, we've got to hit the date in April in order to get the ITC. If we don't and it has a cash impact, its book impact is about $3 million a year, somewhere like that. And we could supplant it with other available tax credits that we're seeking to get from the IRS due to the nature of the plant.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then with respect to the \u2013 when do you expect the gasifier, I guess? I've got an idea of where you expect the lignite testing, but after the lignite testing, which I guess is the end of this year, when do you think that it'll be as a milestone in terms of when it will actually be commercially able to produce synthetic gas, I guess? Or, I mean, when will we know that? I mean what's in between the lignite testing and the actual sort of commercial operation of the gasifier?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, so what will be going there, you're going to get really good indication on reliable syngas to turbines, okay? So that's a big deal. The other things that you're going to get will just need to be tested along that timeframe, will be acid gas removal. So let's think about this for a minute. Recall that we're going to take the syngas, we're going to take out 65% of the CO2 and we are going to also take out sulfuric acid and also ammonia. All of those by-products have value and that goes into the total value premise to the Mississippi's customers.","And recall also that while we'll do first syngas to turbine around the end of the year sometime, in order to get CoD; we want to have both trains operational, both trains checked out. I will \u2013 just a new piece of \u2013 not a new, I guess (55:51) also, but we tested out the flushing of the systems of the acid gas removal systems, and actually we provided for three complete tests of that and we did it in two. And I want to say that the benefit of doing it in two was a three-week benefit. It was something like that. That also went exceedingly well.","Look, I know we're taking a long time and I know we're taking some pain for taking the right amount of time, but what you're getting out of Kemper and you've seen it already is that what we have built and tested is working beautifully. The combined cycle is working as good as any combined cycle in the United States. And these major systems of the gasifier are working well. So I know we've all, me particularly, have had to have patience here, but I think we're taking the right approach.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. I mean, just to sort of \u2013 last quarter I asked you about sort of the MMBtu sort of operational cost of the gasification process, and I think you guys were sort of around the, generally speaking, around 250 in MMBtu. Do you guys feel better about that number or is that pretty much where you guys still feel now that you've gotten three months more and accomplished so much more with the testing and everything?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And let's review the bidding there. You remember it correctly. What we were tying that to that was an estimate based on, I think, $50 oil, because that's how we price the CO2. It's basically on index. And we have to take or pay contracts in that regard. I've kind of wiped away the variability around ammonia and sulfuric acid. So that's kind of correct. The other thing that's really interesting that we're building the capability to do, we've alluded to it in the comments this afternoon, but is a quick switching capability between syngas and natural gas. That should help our reliability characteristics in meeting plant performance criteria. So we're going to be able to deliver to Mississippi's customers, attractive economic natural gas, electricity, whatever the fuel markets deliver to us.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then just finally on AGL, you guys went over the checklist and what have you, but obviously you've had discussions, I assume, with parties and stuff and others. Any sort of color you want to give on terms of that and how things seem there? I mean, anything pop up or not or...?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, you bet. Listen, we've met with regulators both in Illinois, New Jersey, other places. Recall, we have a real ace in the hole here, and that is our Chief Counsel's Jim Carr. Jim Carr used to be a commissioner on a North Carolina commission. He was also President of NARUC. And I can tell you with personal observation, when you walk in a room with Jim Carr to the New Jersey Commission or the Illinois Commission and he knows the people and they know him and he already has trust and, if you will, brand equity. It is a tremendous kind of benefit to have.","The other thing that I don't want to underestimate, when we entered into the merger with AGL, they run a heck of a business in the jurisdictions in which they serve. I can tell you, personally, talking to the Chairman of the Illinois Commission and all the other commissioners there, it was very clear that AGL, when they bought Nicor, made several promises about how they would operate that business, and they have followed through, and even more so, on every promise they've made. So they have great credibility. Given kind of our reputation, our customer satisfaction criteria, our embracing of an integrated, regulated business, our customer focused business model, when you look at our data, number one in the United States, we are getting very constructive responses to everything that we've done so far.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Excellent. Thanks a lot, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Michael.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Tom. You're right that Georgia Tech ending reminded me of an Alabama-Auburn, one I'd rather forget.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. It was way better than that one.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got a question for you. What is your outlook, what is Southern's outlook for the potential for renewable development within the utility service territories in Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi? Which ones do you think have the opportunity to have incremental renewables? Where do you think that could happen in rate base versus PPA with third parties? And which are the ones that may be a little bit further behind in the process, but have the potential to play catch-up down the road?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's a fascinating question. Every one of our companies, right now, has a solar program in place. And you want to know something that's even more interesting? I've been a critic of renewable portfolio standards. All of our companies have entered into these agreements without the hammer of a renewable portfolio requirement.","You may know also that we've had a longstanding, outstanding relationship with the DoD. And it occurred to us that the DoD, nationally, and this is why we've tried to strike this relationship, that they have had kind of a renewables requirement on their own and a severability requirement on their own, and we have worked to play offense with these folks to provide them real solutions not only to meet these requirements, but to give them more sustainable operation from a base standpoint going forward. So all of that has worked exceptionally well.","It is clear to me that as the clean power plan goes forward, you're going to see a lot more solar, particularly in our state. You might see wind, but you know I've been just a little bit of a critic of wind for the southeast only because the best wind resources are way far away from us. The three deals we've done on wind for the host utilities really are located in Kansas and Oklahoma. The right long-term electricity design for America is not to rely on long haul transmission networks to move electricity. You're always better off from a physical design standpoint to locate the generation near the load resource.","So solar's going to make more of a penetration than wind in the southeast. We might be able to do some wind in the southeast; we'll see. The other things that we had some problems about in the past we've done in Texas, but we haven't done in the southeast, is biomass. If we could ever get back in that business, I think the southeast is a good place to go.","And if you want to think about other kind of resources that are going to be particularly important to meeting clean power plan, nuclear and hydro. We never count hydro as part of renewable resources, we probably should. And when I think about kind of if you add up all the wind, all the solar, biomass and hydro, we're approaching something like 7000 megawatts owned or controlled by our company. That's where it's going to go. And along with that, there will be combined cycle gas as base load supplanting coal, CTs to handle the intermittency, and more gas infrastructure, which we've been talking about for some time, that we'll be able to move the shale gas from where it is to where it needs to be.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett from Morningstar. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Mark.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just a quick \u2013 you've provided a little bit of information on how you see the economic landscape unfolding right now. And I know it's not something you typically provide, but on the commercial and industrial load trends that you're seeing, is there any way you could give us a little more granularity on maybe Alabama versus Georgia and how those two large territories are either diverging or kind of moving together?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, on the industrial side, Alabama is probably gotten more of their kilowatt hour sales in industrial than Georgia, but actually Georgia's industrial sales are a little bit bigger. But their other markets are bigger, too. But Alabama is predominantly steel, chemical, and a little less paper than Georgia's got. But those two have done less well here in the, I guess we call it, industrial recession. Georgia has some steel, not as much as Alabama. They've got more paper. And that has suffered a little more.","Some of that paper is down because of low gas prices and they're co-generating more of their needs because of that. So that's a bit of what we're suffering there as long as and as well as I guess lower pulp prices for paper as well. So if you talk about the commercial markets, it's more fulsome in Georgia, I would believe. They've got a bigger commercial market especially within the metropolitan area of Atlanta. And so that's where you're seeing the much more robust growth. You're seeing a little bit in Alabama, but not as much as in Georgia.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And much more in-migration in Georgia than elsewhere in the system.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The other thing that is a big deal, but we're sworn not to talk about, so let me talk about it, is kind of IT jobs and service \u2013 I mean, server farms and all that stuff. Those people are very sensitive about those infrastructure plays. Don't want to talk about where they're located or who they are, but we're seeing some growth there. That's because of our reliability on price position.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Yes. Well, thanks for the color on that. And just a quick update with the Georgia filing for the merger, do you have kind of a rough timeframe for that? Any update on that or...?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Probably next month.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Research","Next month. Okay, I'll definitely keep an eye out for it. Thanks.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good afternoon again. So just one quick question. The $1.5 billion of equity that you plan to do in 2016 for AGL, are you going to wait until the merger closes to do that or might you look to do some kind of like forward transaction or something like that?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We're still considering those options, Steve. But the base plan is we expect to raise the equity in the manner that we've raised it in the past, and some of the internal programs \u2013 we've already turned our internal programs on, beginning in October of this year. So we'll issue in that fashion through 2019, is currently planned, but we're also considering other elements of that that could possibly be used.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Like in the past, we've done things like discrete issuances, we've done dribble programs, we've done a variety of other things. That's what Art was hinting at. But whatever we do, we don't want to impact the market.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. Okay. Thank you. That was it.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi from Avon Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Andy. How are you?","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","I'm doing well. Thank you very much. Look forward to seeing you soon.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, absolutely.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","I am glad you moved on from CBI.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, no kidding.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","I think that's very positive. Just a question on Southern Power. So can you qualify how much net income and cash comes from solar in 2015?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","$51 million. That about right?","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","In cash?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Net income \u2013 I don't know about cash.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We've got to get that detail for you after the call.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. That's fine. And then I guess, without giving out a forecast, but you said about \u2013 I'm sorry, are you going to say something, Art?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We were looking at each other and that $51 million was the year-over-year increase.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Okay.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So we'll get on....","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. How much did you get last year? Do you know?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","From what?","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","That would solve that. Net income from solar. If the $51 million is a year-over-year increase.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We'd have to add some numbers. It'd be easier for us to get with you offline on that.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think what we said earlier was $51 million on ITC.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. And, again, I guess in 2016, the $210 million, does that have growth in solar or is it kind of \u2013 and again, I know you didn't give a forecast. Right. But then, Tom, I think said that without giving out a forecast that 2016 Southern Power would be pretty close to 2015. Didn't he say that?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So what I said was when I think about the kind of projects we see, what we've circled so far, 2015 we're guessing we're going to have a cap allocation of around $2.3 billion. And we already kind of circled up about $1.3 billion in 2016, which is kind of in our base plan. So we've already circled up our base plan, and then we think we should expect to see kind of similar performance for the balance. So it wouldn't surprise me at all to see a $2.3 billion number in 2016. But don't know it yet, just what I've said.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Okay.","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Andy, to be clear, the $210 million was a 2015 estimate.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. And how much did you invest this year in solar? Capital?","Arthur P. Beattie - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, Andy, we're going to have to follow-up. We don't have it split. We've got some capital in there for wind and solar, so I just don't have the split.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The majority of it's solar.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'll get it to you.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. But I guess it's not fair to kind of look at it just on the net income basis as far as return of capital, but obviously return of cash is in some ways more important, right?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's enormous, yeah.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Yeah. So that's why I wanted to get the cash number. Okay. I'll wait till Jimmy Mann (1:12:00) calls me back. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The mayor?","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","The mayor. Good mayor. That's the mayor I like.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Me too.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","And, Dan Tucker, congratulations.","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. How about that?","Daniel S. Tucker - Senior Vice President of Finance, Treasurer","Thanks, Andy.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital","Yeah.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, we've been talking for some time and you all have been so wonderful to be patient with us. I think we're reaching that inflection point in the story. We've always traded on a risk-adjusted basis. The returns are terrific. We're one of just one or two companies like us that \u2013 we can't promise you anything in the future. My lawyers always look at me here. But for the last 10 years or 11 years, we hit our numbers, we hit generally really well within our numbers, even despite duress.","And I think the risk side has been tainted somewhat with some overhangs from the Vogtle litigation and the Kemper project. I think resolving the litigation is an enormous inflection point. I think the technical test that we've just gone through, while not removing it completely, have really reduced, I think, significantly the technical risk in Kemper. So I think we're really moving the company in the right way, and I think the days ahead are very bright. We thank you so much for being with us this afternoon, and looking forward to seeing you in a couple weeks. Operator, that's all.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 2, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Aaron Abramovitz, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Aaron Abramovitz - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Beatrice. Welcome to Southern Company's second quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during today's call may be reviewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Our premier state-regulated electric and gas operating companies performed well during the second quarter and it remain on track to deliver on their targets for 2017 on an adjusted basis. Art will provide a complete overview of our financial results in just a moment, but I'd like to first provide updates on the status of the Kemper and Vogtle projects.","First, Kemper. Let me provide you with a brief review of key events over the past 12 months. In July 2016, as we worked to fulfill our obligation under the PSC certificate order, we fully transitioned out of construction with the first production of syngas from the gasifiers. While the start up of the gasifiers and gas cleanup systems took longer than anticipated, substantial progress was made towards in-service. Along the way, we demonstrated every major facet of the TRIG technology at a commercial scale, including the gasification of lignite, the capture and sale of carbon dioxide and the production of electricity with syngas.","This past February, Mississippi Power filed an updated economic viability study, which indicated that operating the IGCC on lignite would be less economic than operating the combined cycle on natural gas in most future scenarios. The primary factor driving this result was an updated natural gas price forecast reflecting lower sustained prices of almost 25% over the long term. Recall, Kemper was conceived at a time when natural gas prices were approximately $10 per million Btu and had significant market volatility.","In May of this year, it was determined that a critical component, the superheater section of the syngas coolers would need redesign and replacement over the next two to three years. Replacement of the superheaters would require significant lead time for design, fabrication and installation and add significantly to cost above the cost cap. Even though we all felt we could achieve commercial operations in the near-term, this issue hurt the sustainable operating profile of the plan.","On June 21, the Mississippi Public Service Commission made its expectations clear with public statements and a subsequent order on July 6, establishing a docket to encourage a settlement reflecting no gasifier-related customer rate increases and operation of the Kemper plant as a natural gas combined cycle. During this period, Mississippi Power suspended operations and startup activities for the gasifier. Recall that since 2014 in August, operation of the Kemper combined cycle has provided Mississippi Power customers with clean, safe and reliable low-cost energy. The plant has operated at availabilities, well surpassing industry norms.","While operating the Kemper facility solely on natural gas for the long-term is far from ideal, however, consistent with current and long-term projections of natural gas, we believe it is in the best long-term interest of our customers, investors and other stakeholders. Mississippi Power continues to actively negotiate with the Public Utility Staff and other intervening parties with the intent to have a proposal filed that meets the conditions of the PSC's July 6 order, on or before August 21.","Our second quarter financial statements reflect a pre-tax charge of $2.8 billion to write-down the remaining investment in the gasification portion of the facility that is no longer improbable of rate recovery. Not included in the charge are any future cancellation costs, which are currently estimated to range between $100 million and $200 million. There is $500 million of the combined cycle investment, not currently in rate, which is subject to recovery through the Settlement Docket established on July 6. We will provide update as appropriate as the settlement process continues.","And now, for an update on Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the Vogtle Owners have made great progress since our last earnings call in preserving all available options and Georgia Power is in the final stages of forming its recommendation to the Georgia PSC. As a reminder, Georgia owns 45.7% of this project with the rest, owned by MEAG, Oglethorpe Power and the City of Dalton. Combined, our ownership group represents a state-wide partnership that has served Georgia electricity customers for decades.","As we contemplate the future of this project, our interest must remain aligned to ensure that the best overall answer for the customers, communities and economy of the State of Georgia. Ultimately, the final decision will rest with the Georgia Public Service Commission. Georgia Power has kept the PSC informed of the process related to estimating the cost to complete Vogtle 3 and 4 and other related activities over the past several months. We expect to file our recommendation in late August.","Before providing a summary of our cost to complete the estimate, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss the agreements we have reached with Toshiba on the parent company guarantee and with Westinghouse to provide ongoing services to the project. First, we finalized an agreement with Toshiba in June regarding their Guarantee Obligations under our original EPC contract. The agreement fixes Toshiba's obligation to the project owners whether the project is completed or not at $3.68 billion or approximately $1.7 billion to Georgia Power Company.","There is a monthly payment schedule, which begins in August of 2017 and ends in July 2021. The $920 million letter-of-credit or $420 million to Georgia Power remain outstanding as collateral. Payment of the Guarantee Obligation could be accelerated as Toshiba also agreed to contribute a portion of the proceeds from its claims in the Westinghouse bankruptcy to the Vogtle Owners. This could include proceeds from international subsidiaries if those entities are part of a combined sale of Westinghouse and Toshiba's energy services business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.","Ultimately, while Toshiba's financial condition is uncertain, the Toshiba Guarantee agreement puts the Vogtle Owners in a better position. The first payment in October, totaling $300 million is the largest individual payment and will be an important signal regarding Toshiba's financial viability. The Vogtle Owners also recently finalized the Services Agreement with Westinghouse. This agreement took effect on July 27, having been approved by the bankruptcy court and the Department of Energy. While this agreement reduces the project scope for Westinghouse, they will continue as an important partner providing engineering, licensing support, procurement services and access to intellectual property.","This contract extends until the units are operational or it can be cancelled after a 30-day notice that the project does not move forward. The effectiveness of the Westinghouse Services Agreement also officially signaled the orderly transition of the project sites to the control of Southern Nuclear. Southern Nuclear, which operates all of Southern Company's nuclear plants is the licensee for Vogtle 3 and 4. Southern Nuclear has held significant presence on-site from the beginning of the project with a focus on safety, compliance and oversight.","Over the past several months, Southern Nuclear has moved personnel into key Westinghouse in subcontractor roles and in anticipation of taking the lead role on-site, which has allowed for a smooth transition and for construction momentum, to continue. Productivity on-site has improved significantly over the first half of 2017. This improvement can be attributed to several factors including improved leadership in the field, improved work package management and continuous monitoring and communication of performance.","Southern Nuclear expects further improvement in these areas if the decision is made to complete the project. In that event, Southern Nuclear will hire a prime construction contractor, which could be a single firm or a combination of firms. With all major equipment on-site, with the engineering nearly complete, the primary success factor going forward would be productivity. The prime construction contractor will be provided with appropriate incentives and rigorous oversight to drive achievement of the construction milestone.","Let's turn now to our estimate to complete. The process to get to this point has been robust. Our team was granted access to all the work that Westinghouse and its subcontractors have previously done on costs and schedule. Our own personnel combed through the information, went out into the field to verify quantities firsthand and confirm work reflected as completed. We also brought in external expertise, including individuals with recent nuclear construction experience and multiple consulting firms to vet our scheduled assumptions and uptake and validate our inputs. Our current assessment results in a range of potential schedule to complete both units with Unit 3 expected to be placed in service between February 2021 and March 2022, and Unit 4, between February 2022 and March 2023.","Net of the Toshiba Guarantee Obligation, the schedule is estimated to result in $1 billion to $1.7 billion above the previous cost estimate of $5.68 billion, which included contingency of $240 million. Based on the preliminary spending curbs, Georgia Power is not projected to exceed $5.68 billion until 2019. Assuming proceeds for claims in the Westinghouse bankruptcy proceeding are received by 2019, this crossover point could extend into 2020. Through June 30, Georgia Power has invested approximately $4.5 billion in the project and has recovered approximately $1.4 billion of financing costs under the NCCR tariffs.","If a decision is made to cancel the project, we have estimated Georgia Power's cancellation cost at approximately $400 million. The PSC will determine the appropriate process in which they consider our upcoming recommendation. We will continue to work with our co-owners and the PSC to reach the decision that is best for all stakeholders. In the meantime, Southern Nuclear will maintain momentum at the site.","I'll turn the call over now to Art for our financial and economic overview.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials released this morning, including the charges associated with Mississippi Power's Kemper project, we reported a loss for the second quarter of 2017 of $1.38 per share, compared to earnings of $0.67 per share in the second quarter of 2016.","For the six months ended June 30, 2017, we reported a loss of $0.73 per share, compared with earnings of $1.20 per share for the same period in 2016. Excluding the charges associated with the Kemper project, Wholesale Gas Services and other items described in our earnings materials, earnings for the second quarter of 2017 and the six-month period ended June 30, 2017 were $0.73 per share and $1.39 per share respectively. This compares with $0.75 per share and $1.34 per share for the same periods in 2016. Major earnings drivers to our adjusted results for the second quarter of 2017 included retail revenue effects at Southern Company's state-regulated electric businesses, offset by milder weather, increased interest expense and increased shares. As for our earnings estimate for the next quarter, we estimate that we will earn $1.06 per share in the third quarter of 2017.","Moving now to an economic review for the second quarter. The U.S. economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, real GDP rose by 2.6% in the second quarter of 2017, driven primarily by consumer spending and fixed investment. Real GDP growth is expected to be 2.3% in 2017 and our service territories generally deflect these economic trends. Weather-normal retail electric sales for the quarter and year-to-date periods were down year-over-year by 0.4% and 0.8% respectively.","These results were primarily attributable to lower sales in our industrial class with paper, primary metals and transportation segments, accounting for the biggest negative year-over-year results. However, a number of our industrial customers are pointing to stronger orders in the second half of this year. Economic development activity in our territory remains reasonably strong and forward-looking indicators suggest that energy demand should be within expectations of being flat to slightly positive for the remainder of this year.","Within our service territories, we are encouraged by a variety of positive indicators. Year-to-date residential customer growth continues to exceed expectations with 15,000 new customers added in our gas service areas and almost 25,000 added in our electric territories. Employment and population growth in our combined electric and gas territories remains solid. Total nonfarm employment is up by 1.6% year-on-year in May, and we continue to see faster population growth in the rest of the nation, boosted by net in migration to Georgia and Florida.","Let me now update you on our financing plans. In late June, Southern Company contributed $1 billion to Mississippi Power in anticipation of potential charges associated with the gasifier portion of the Kemper project. Consistent with our commitment to preserving financial integrity on a consolidated basis, Southern Company has an equity need of approximately $1 billion. There are several moving parts in our business, which also impact funding needs that are still under development. The Vogtle Go\/No Go decision certainly has potential implications to our long-term financing plans. Under a Go decision, we would require more debt and equity to maintain Georgia Power's regulatory capital structure. Considering potential proceeds under the Toshiba Guarantee agreement and the proceeds from a Westinghouse reorganization or sale, this is primarily a longer-term need. Under a No Go decision, our financing needs would be greatly reduced.","Under either scenario, we do not anticipate Vogtle further changing our equity needs in 2017. As we alluded to in our last earnings call, we are actively evaluating opportunities to modernize our basic business operations as our customers' needs evolve. Our objective, as always, is to improve the way we serve our customers while maintaining affordable prices. These initiatives would have the benefit of strengthening our longer-term EPS growth, contribution from our state-regulated utility. While these modernization opportunities could increase our long-term funding requirements, we do not anticipate any changes this year, 2017.","Another moving part is Southern Power. As we continue to evaluate and develop our pipeline of opportunities at Southern Power, we are evaluating the use of third-party tax equity to fund renewable projects. Southern Power is working to secure tax equity for the Cactus Flats wind project announced this week and will likely explore the same for projects in its 3,000 megawatt joint development pipeline. While our CapEx forecast for Southern Power is unchanged, the use of third-party tax equity could significantly reduce the amount of debt and equity deployed over our five-year forecast horizon. We plan to refine our long-term capital and financing plans over the next several months and provide an update on our third quarter earnings call.","Our slide deck for this call includes an updated financing plan for 2017, which reflects the previously mentioned need for approximately $1 billion of additional equity. We remain committed to a high level of financial integrity, strong investment grade credit ratings and our objective of a longer-term 16% funds from operation to debt ratio.","Now for an update on our EPS and our growth rate, and our dividend. We have accounted for probable outcomes of the Kemper project, which assumes no return on or return of gasification-related investments. Recognizing that we don't yet have a final regulatory solution for the Kemper project, we forecast an ongoing reduction to annual EPS of approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per share. The resulting long-term trajectory still reflects growth of approximately 5%, beginning in 2018. We will formally update our long-term EPS guidance after we have a Go\/No Go decision for Vogtle. The base financing plan was developed before the Westinghouse bankruptcy and essentially reflects a Go scenario and approximately a 5% long-term EPS growth rate.","Most importantly, our dividend trajectory remains intact under either a Vogtle Go\/No Go scenario. The Southern Company board of directors has increased the dividend every year for the past 16 years. And for nearly 70 years, the company has paid a quarterly dividend that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter. Our dividend objective is to provide regular, predictable and sustainable growth. In turn, the board's dividend decisions had been predicated on a robust review of our long-term financial plan including risks, assessments for a variety of different outcomes. While purview over the dividend decision remains with our board, we believe annual dividend increases of $0.08 per share are sustainable.","Our strong operating cash flows provide additional support to this belief. Over the next several years, we expect that cash flow from operations will average over three times the size of our common dividends and this ratio is approximately 10% higher than the past 16 years as a result of our current tax position.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Art. July 1 marks the one-year anniversary of our merger with the former AGL Resources, now, Southern Company Gas. As you know, this acquisition was a major step in a broader strategy to further expand our business in a meaningful way across the energy value chain. In fact, earlier this week, the Southern Company Gas placed the Dalton Pipeline in service. With all of its capacity under contract for 25 years, Dalton represents one-third of Southern Company Gas's newbuild mainstream infrastructure and is expected to contribute approximately $10 million per year to income.","The integration of Southern Company Gas into our business has gone extremely well and the combined companies now serve more than 9 million customers nationwide, with a portfolio of premier, state-regulated utilities. Southern Company Gas is a great addition to our company and should contribute positively towards fulfilling our shareholder value proposition for a very long time.","Before we open the call to your questions, I would like to respectfully remind everyone that we do not want to get ahead of the regulatory processes in any of our states, including the ongoing negotiations in Mississippi and the filing and consideration of our Vogtle Go\/No Go recommendation in Georgia. Thank you in advance for your understanding.","Operator, we are now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Hey good afternoon guys. A couple of questions. First, I just want to make sure I've got the baseline cost estimate to complete the plant sort of right as I know \u2013 I'm sure people are trying to benchmark that against the $18 billion cost that SCANA articulated in their decision not to move forward. If I take your $8.4 billion to $9.1 billion range, which is obviously before the guarantees and I gross that up, that gives me sort of $18.3 billion to $19.8 billion total plant cost? But I also know that, that might not be apples-to-apples because you have included in your cost estimate, costs in excess of what the Westinghouse was obligated to deliver the plant for that was like a little over $2.6 billion. So, am I right that the apples-to-apples cost is somewhere between $15.6 billion and $17.2 billion? Those are a lot of numbers, I apologize if that's not clear.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Let's first do this. And I know people are going to be interested in comparing our situation to SCANA's. There are a host of differences between our project and the Summer project that SCANA and Santee Cooper recently canceled. It really is apples and oranges. For example, the commercial terms for the projects were very different, the EPC cost, the guarantee, the different regulatory processes they went through, the cost cap over there. So, it's really \u2013 I really want to resist kind of a reconciliation of where SCANA is relative to where we are.","Stick with our numbers. The other thing that's important about our numbers, I really don't know the process SCANA went through in developing their estimate. I can tell you that not only did our on-site people work very hard to develop estimates, we brought in a variety of external parties including folks that had been involved in the recent nuclear completion projects at TVA as well as estimates from both Bechtel and Fluor. We feel confident in our estimates.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So I should just stop with knowing that I grossed it up, the total plant cost?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right. I think that's a...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","That is $18.3 billion to $19.8 billion, and not try to read through further from that.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. The second is, I heard you on your \u2013 what you said about the regulatory process, but can we just...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","However.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","However, I'm going to ask you a question. When are you going to file your plan? What do we think the time horizon is going to be until we get some sense of where the Commission is leaning?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","And should we assume that the plan will lay out options such as, and I'm theorizing here, we either abandon, we build two units, we build one unit, these are the different costs associated with each of these choices, which choice do you think is the right choice? Is that \u2013 or you normally didn't go that far?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Greg, I think what we're doing is working very closely collaboratively. I've often said in past years that our relationships with the staff, the Commissions is a continuous rather than discrete kind of relationship, so they've been briefed along the way. Further, we've been working hand-in-glove with our co-owners as we evaluate the different scenarios that we will consider.","You should assume that we have considered the entire waterfront of options available to us and we've been pretty creative in pushing a lot of different ideas. I would expect that the results will converge on a single idea and we will provide that idea as a recommendation to the Georgia Public Service Commission sometime this month.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then is there any sense how long the process might take to come to a mutual decision?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. That's part of the process I'd rather not get into. Let the Commission decide how they want to handle that.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fair enough. And then one quick question. The base case forecast as revised take into account the Kemper costs, again, that assumes the 5% growth off the lower base, assumes a Go decision as the base case?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right. The base case assumes that we're building Vogtle. That's the case that was provided back in October.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Final question. If you were theoretically in a no-go posture, the amount of dollars that you would seek to recover under the Georgia legal framework would be whatever the quick balance is as of that point in time? Or would it be the quick balance plus the cancellation costs?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Both of those, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","But the financing costs are not, those are costs that have already been recovered, so would be...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's correct.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And of course, we wouldn't have the Toshiba Guarantee against that.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Right.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Right. And whatever tax benefits you got from in abandonment, correct?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Correct. That's it.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You got it.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. I know those were a ton of questions. I'll go to the back of the queue. Thanks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks Greg.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Anthony.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon Tom.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hope you are well?","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","I just wanted to follow-up with Greg on slide 8 you talk about go and No Go decisions. Just one of the footnotes or the only footnote there was allowed recovery should you go no-go. And I know, just what is carrying cost mean, I guess is my question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Full cost of capital.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","So, both in equity and a debt return?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Has there been any other like a project or something that have already gone through this procedure?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Not to my knowledge.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just lastly, the timing I guess with Greg, the decision, the utility is going to make a decision in August of a contractor? And then also in August, make a decision on what they believe and then that gets pushed to the Commission and then October, is the first payment from Toshiba and then some time after that, the Commission will make a decision.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. I mean, you should view the Commission to decide how and when it wants to make a decision, so let's be flexible there. I mean conceivably, they could make it really quickly or it could take time. The October payment, I think from Toshiba is an important milestone.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you. You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. How are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Super. I hope you're well.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I'm doing well today. Okay, so I think, you know, look we all saw the estimates from SCANA and then we're trying to compare them to yours, but from the perspective of your shareholders and the potential for the multiple expansion on your stocks, so we're talking about spending additional $1 billion to $1.7 billion over the next couple of years. This is your best estimate right now, but you never know what this final amount will be, and then for a similar amount, if not much less, you could build a gas plant.","So how do you try to appease investors about the risks that you are undertaking by continuing the project if you continue versus just building a gas plant instead, especially as the load growth numbers seem to becoming below the prior expectations?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, there's a variety of issues underlying that and you should know that we evaluated building gas on the site relative or instead of finishing the new. So there's a whole host of issues. For example, it's not clear to me that where we did not go and pursue gas, that you would build gas at that site. We would need to build a rather lengthy pipeline and maybe other sites around Georgia that maybe more suitable for that.","Adding the nuclear units give a much desired quality to the state's integrated resource plan that is fuel diversity. It is resilience to future carbon potential outcomes. I think there's a host of factors that would cause us to consider, if we decide to go forward, building new can feel very good about it. It's an important process to follow. I think the Commission has been very vocal about their desire for a reasonable outcome on nuclear. We already have a strong framework for recovery. We entered into that when we had the settlement agreement in the prudence proceeding.","So we have a process that works, that process does not provide a cost cap to the extent that the capital costs are prudent. It only addresses return levels, cash, AFUDC. And then of course, once we clear those plants into service, they would leave that kind of settlement regime and revert back to the Georgia Power base rates.","A lot of these things have been contemplated already. And I think from a political standpoint, from an operational standpoint, fuel diversity, a variety of other things, I believe that the state planning process is as evidenced by the integrated resource plans, that was discussed in 2016, I guess, approved in July, believe from the state of Georgia that nuclear is important. So while it is an option to build gas, I think on a lot of scenarios going forward with nuclear may make sense. Of course, we may decide not to and we'll see, but don't think about replacing the units with gas there.","And one last point and this is a point frankly, I want to throw some kudos out to the current administration and Congress, boy, people don't say that very often these days. But let me tell you, as we have traveled around the globe, making sure that we get the best outcomes possible associated with the Toshiba Guarantee, with the Westinghouse portion, scope of the project, the Trump administration cabinet has been fantastic, whether it's been Rick Perry, Wilbur Ross, Mike Pence, any of those guys and their staffs have been exceedingly helpful in having us prosecute our interest here. Further in Congress, I'll say very clearly, folks like Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady were very helpful in getting a bill, Bipartisan Bill; Jim Clyburn, Nancy Pelosi and getting a bill out of Congress, out of the house anyway and we'll see where we'll go elsewhere in the Senate. So look, I'm sorry, Angie, I kind of rambled around on you.","I think the issue really goes to, besides just straight economics and we think economics still favor \u2013 at least the economics we present will favor whatever we decide to do. Don't consider gas at the site as the right replacement. If we do a no-go, you'll build gas, but it'll be elsewhere.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Understood. I'm just, again, I'm just trying to understand, you're adding two years of the nuclear construction risk and yes, I understand regulators want the plant to be finished, that these steps what it seem like to me from their public statements, but I'm just trying to see if there's a way to get some additional assurances for shareholders, just in case, this is now two years, let's say three years and if that original estimate turns out to be too low.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. I would argue that what investors, owners should look towards is number one, the generally constructive environment in Georgia. Number two, we have a framework in place that will provide for rates of return during the construction period, however long it is, and assuming you have a prolonged scenario, as you suggest, that once you finally complete that these assets will return to the normal Georgia rate regime for decades to come.","It's interesting, you could make a short-term decision or you could make a long-term decision here. I think we're all trying to balance those two things and coming up with a recommendation with the Commission.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Angie, it's Art. I think it's also important to remember and Tom addressed this a little bit in his script, was that this is going to be an owner-led process through one or two major contractors where we're going to control the metrics of performance and we'll have immediate responsiveness to however that performance is going around the productivity of the asset.","It's also important to remember where we are in the construction, the scope going forward is very clear. All the equipment and most major equipment is on-site already and so it's a matter of constructing the equipment that's already there on-site, so it merely becomes an instruction performance metric as we move forward. And that gives us a little more confidence as we look forward as to these timeframes.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And the data supports that we have been hitting just about the targets we want on a constant schedule here very recently as we've taken over the site.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Tom. Good afternoon. So just to clarify the, in terms of the growth rate and the earnings, you could just take $0.08 to $0.10 off of the base and grow 5%? Is it as simple as that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, virtually it's the same math. I would have grown it 5% and then reduce that $0.08 to $0.10 and that's where you are and then grow 5% there on.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then in terms of the Toshiba Guarantee, couple of questions there; first, as you get the money, how should we think about it being applied? Is it effectively applied as an offset to the investment and not needing the recovery in rates?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then I assume the October date is important just to make sure Toshiba actually pays it.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right, and recall, the way we've structured this agreement with Toshiba with respect to their Guarantee, when you think about this draw schedule, we think the riskiest payments are the ones further out, right? So what we've done is provided for the normal draw of the LC to backstop the furthest draws away from us right now to the extent they defaulted on this $300 million payment in October, we could accelerate the draw on the LC and take care of it that way.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then on the equity needs, you mentioned, Art, a lot of factors. Most of those you talked to them being equity beyond 2017.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Right.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","The one I'm not sure was clear was on the Southern Power, changing and how you're financing things there would. Could that impact the 2017 equity or is that also further beyond 2017?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","We don't think so, Steve. The $1 billion that we've outlined we think will cover the waterfront including all the businesses and use of third party tax equity for Southern Power.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It could have an impact beyond that.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And one last question is, does the Summer abandonment have any kind of practical impacts, good or bad, on kind of the workforce availability, just all \u2013 I assume there's a lot of resources up there that might be applicable for your site. PTCs, does it do anything there? Is there any just high-end for your project that is worth talking about?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. I mean, I think you started to suggest, am I right. Best athletes will be available. In other words you're not going to stretch personnel resources, whether that's skilled craft labor, whether that's leadership in either a Fluor or Bechtel or anybody else that maybe brought to bear to the site. Certainly, with respect to the availability of PTCs, I expect that we'll be successful ultimately in Congress.","They've all indicated a willingness to help. We just got a stuck-up procedurally with frankly, Obamacare and the Senate. So I think all those things will work to our benefit.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","I had one last question, I forgot. The existing rate agreement on the $5.7 billion, my recollection is that when you \u2013 the plant had to be running by 2020? Or once you hit the $5.7 million, you went to like a lower ROE?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's it.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Is that \u2013 it's simple as that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, and that's only during construction and what you would expect to see if we drew the line out for what we expect out of earnings per share in this 5% growth trajectory, that's a long-term growth trajectory. To the extent you're in one of those periods where you hit the 7% ROE or whatever, you would have kind of a drop in the earnings power of those assets for a period of time, but once you cleared the in-service, they would return back to the regular regime of Georgia Power. We believe that circumstance should it occur, would only occur post 2020 and would be like a year or two or whatever the circumstances warranted at that time.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Ali, how are you?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, Tom. How are you? Good afternoon. So first question, just to clarify, the $1 billion equity that you need this year just from a timing perspective, do you need to have that Kemper settlement filed by August 21 or any of the Vogtle documents filed before you can issue that equity or are those two things unrelated, how should we think about that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Ali, it's a good question. At this point, we haven't detailed what timing will be and we think they're unrelated.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","I think you want to make sure you have appropriate disclosures at that point.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right, that's right. We've got a lot of disclosures going around, but we just have to pick the right time sometime in the second half.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","We certainly would prefer quieter waters to issue into.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes. But as you said, on the disclosure front, there's no requirement that you need to have that out there? I mean, I'm just talking from an SEC legal requirement point of view.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No. As long as you had appropriate disclosures, I think you'd be okay.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","And we're in an open window.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Okay, got it. And then coming back to the growth rate scenario as you said, that's baked in a go scenario, but does that factor in these potentially higher costs at Vogtle and then the incremental equity need, Art, that you were talking about, how would that sort of change that trajectory or is that already baked into the new line, that you're showing us?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, it accounts for all the capital requirements that a Go decision would require. And obviously, that's going to be spread out over time.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","If you think about the $1 billion to $1.7 billion, it is additional, if you think about the timeframe in which they'll be realized, it's had really a modest impact.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","And it's really, it's not until post 2020 before you're even looking at spending over and above what our current plan already took into account.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And our sense is you would finance that with the same mix of capital as we always do.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And the timing would be such as well in terms of when that additional equity would show up basically?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. And then as you're going through this process on the Vogtle front, as you mentioned, there's the ROE and that may be a timing issue for a couple of years, what about your partners' ability to fund those additional costs, as you said, you'd want everybody to move together. At the end of the day, if it is a Go decision, it's the thought that on that the current ownership structure stays as is, or is there a possibility that that changes?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","No, we believe it will stay as is.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","In terms of percentage ownership of everybody?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's it. We worked under this kind of relationship for really decades and it's worked great.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then last question. As the Toshiba payments start coming through as you said, that's a multiyear process and you've got some backstop with the LC, but to the extent that there is \u2013 the LCs are covered and there's still space left, is there a scenario where the Commission could revisit whatever the new numbers are today, or is the thought that whatever those numbers are, are pretty much set over the duration of the project?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, yeah, let's add to the security package this notion of, so you have the LCs. We have a share of whatever proceeds come from the sale of Westinghouse out of bankruptcy. There also is a non-subordination agreement that would essentially preserve under many cases our subordinate position relative to the bank credit that already exists or that existed at Toshiba as of the date of the agreement.","So we kind of have those three features, but you're right. There is an element that is uncovered in which we're essentially taking Toshiba credit risk. Now our idea was to front end load those exposures, so that in the near term, we think we'll know very quickly and get those behind us. So strategically, that's how we thought about the draw schedule and the rights to the sale of Westinghouse and the LC.","There are always opportunities for the Commission and the company and the co-owners to evaluate off ramps, if conditions change materially. Say for example, Toshiba doesn't pay its $300 million, say there's an extreme force majeure event, the Commission always has the opportunity to evaluate best course forward.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right, okay. And then last question, Tom, coming back to Kemper and the amount of investment that's not in rates. If you run the math on that amount, the EPS impact comes out much larger than the $0.08 to $0.10 you've talked about and in that $0.08 to $0.10, I presume you've also put in the $1 billion of extra equity, so can you just help in the math? I mean, was there some disallowance that you had originally assumed in your original numbers that gives you that cushion? Or how do does math work to get us to that $0.08 to $0.10 hit from Kemper?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. When we gave you the financial plan way back in October when we had our Analyst Day, we intentionally crafted our long-term growth rate on a conservative basis and we allowed for, under a variety of circumstances, wherever it may occur, some cushion, if you will, in terms of adverse impacts that may occur and still provide the long-term 5% growth rate, and that's what gave rise to this notion of resilience.","So that has always existed. We believe that taking the gasifier off the playing field, so to speak, really leaves the Commission with pretty clear kind of evaluation. That is they're not dealing with a gasifier anymore. They're dealing with a combined cycle unit that has run among the best of any combined-cycle unit in the United States, E4, less than 1%, average E4 for combined cycles fixed or whatever it is, and it has served a tremendous amount of energy for the citizens of Mississippi since 2014. So what we're left with, I think in Mississippi is how does the Commission want to treat the company on a sustaining basis. We believe we should be treated fairly there.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Paul.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey, howdy ho.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Awesome. How are you?","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","I just want to clarify and follow-up on Ali's question. Does the $0.08 to $0.10 explicitly include the dilution from the $1 billion or does it not?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It does.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","It does, okay. And then is the parent $500 million junior subordinated notes new in terms of financing? And will you get equity credit for that with the rating agencies?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes, we do get equity credit and I believe that we have already issued a good amount of that \u2013 I can't remember the dollar amounts \u2013 earlier this year.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And then also, I guess following up on a question that might have been asked previously. Are you going to wait for the Vogtle Go\/No Go decision before issuing equity? Or is it possible that you could issue in two pieces?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes, Paul, we did answer the question before but they're unrelated. Remember, we've said the Vogtle need, if it's a go, would create more longer term equity needs than shorter term. So we view those as unrelated, whereas the equity needs this year would be addressing the Kemper write-offs.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And all you're asking really I think comes down to having appropriate disclosure and everything else. So I mean, theoretically, you could issue equity before you have the decision in Georgia or not. You just have to make appropriate disclosures.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yes, no, no, it wasn't from a disclosure perspective.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Okay.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","But thank you very much and that's it from in terms of questions.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hi Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Tom, I want to change the topic.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Okay.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You made some commentary about potentially some programs at the core electric utilities where you might find ways to serve customers more efficiently.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But then you didn't go into a, 'hey, we're going to implement some kind of major O&M reduction program.' That doesn't seem to be what you're talking about. I may be wrong there. It almost seems like it's more of a capital opportunity, meaning an investment in the infrastructure. Can you just talk a little bit about this size...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sure.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","...scale, decision time line, all that kind of good stuff?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, every company is working through it right now, but the idea is kind of a modernization kind of thing, and what we would do is put greater intelligence in the wires, greater resilience into the transmission system, generating plants, more technology involved in customer service. For example, one of the things we've done recently at Georgia, just as an example, we did close down some human interfaces in some of the local towns, but we manifold increased the customer touch capability through technology, kiosks and other things. So frankly \u2013 and we found that customers, frankly, love that stuff. And, in fact, I want to say, Georgia Power this year was voted the number one most trusted utility, even after all of these rather profound changes in the way we approach customers.","Likewise, all of our companies generally set the bar across the United States in terms of customer satisfaction. So the big trade, I would argue, is one in which we are likely, and this will probably take the form of capital for the most part, putting way more technology out there and making whatever adjustments we need to operating-wise.","The other one, Michael, I would add and this kind of goes to my hat that you know I have for all the electric utility industry, co-ops, communities, and IOUs. On this whole cyber and physical security realm, I think it's real important, and this even reaches EPA and I made these arguments in the last administration. It's very clear that the resilience of our systems, whether its resilience to physical attributes or cyber-attacks, we really need to think differently about how to make sure that electricity flows and electronic commerce and the digital age is able to be undertaken.","And my sense is, we need to think about resiliency not just in n-2 transmission standards but in standards that will provide cyber-protection that nobody has even thought about three years ago. And certainly, we are leading the way along with some of my other peer companies in things like machine-to-machine capital additions as opposed to human-to-machine defenses in the cyber realm. So there's a lot going on there. I think there's lots of opportunity to improve the delivery of our product and make it more resilient on behalf of our customers.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Have you had an opportunity to vet this yet with either Commission staff or intervenors or others or even the Commissioners themselves? And at what point in the coming months or years do you think you might actually, I don't know, quantify some of this when you're thinking about your capital budget updates?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. I would argue this is kind of an ongoing discussion. When we think about, I guess, the next rate case in Georgia will be 2019, Alabama has an annual process, Mississippi has PEP, Gulf just went through a process. These are the kinds of discussions that we have along the way. So you should view this again as a continuous process rather than discrete.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of the Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hey, how's it going?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Awesome.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So let me just follow up a little bit here on the go\/no-go, because it looks when you look at the slide that the no-go has the cost of financing and that doesn't seem to be \u2013 I mean you have a footnote about it in the slide, but I just wanted to touch base. So if I look at it, would it be appropriate if you were to include financing in the Go way? You take $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion, subtract $1.4 billion, which you've already spent, and then add that to the $1.0 billion, $1.7 billion to come up with something like $2.7 billion to $3.8 billion? Does that make sense?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","You lost me in all those numbers.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's basically right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then with respect to Toshiba payments, you're looking forward to about $300 million payment my understanding is in October, and then you mentioned that you'll draw down the LOC if you don't get that. If you do get it, does the LOC change at all? I think it's around $920 million, am I right about that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, and there's a reduction at some point, $200 million or so, but the $700 million would remain outstanding for the balance of the draw schedule.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's right. And remember, $3.7 billion is 100%.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","It's $1.7 billion for Georgia Power.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And so when I'm thinking about that, though, I guess, what I'm trying to figure out here is the staff, just as recently as Friday, believed that the Toshiba guarantee is really your problem, so to speak, whether you get it or not. Is there anything else we should think about as being potentially exposure to I guess to sort of Angie's question, exposure to ratepayers if \u2013 as we go forward with respect to any exposure that might happen or contingencies we should think about that...?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. Without going beyond, kind of, we already have a rate settlement regime in place that established the recovery of the settlement cost plus a prudence evaluation. That remains in place and will cover I think all these questions. With respect to any of the details, the gives and takes along the way, let's not get ahead of the any kind of discussion we will have at the Commission. Let that process play out.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, fair enough. And then...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Paul, it's Art. Let me make sure you're clear as well. We've got the LOC as a mitigant and we also have the proceeds from the sale of Westinghouse out of bankruptcy that could potentially be a mitigant to that exposure as well.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","We have no idea what that will be, but it's another piece of the pie.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I got you. And then the 5% growth is with the go scenario. What would the growth be without the go scenario?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It depends on what that looks like, how much recovery we had, all that other stuff. It really gets into the regulatory settlement process. So if you'll bear, give us forbearance here, let me defer that one.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks again.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you, buddy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just wanted to follow-up on Ali's question on partners, and I just wanted to make sure I was clear. Should we presume that you all will be going sort of arm-in-arm together in terms of the path that you want to take later this month?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, understood. And then just a small clarifying question on the go\/no-go page that's got so much interest. On the right-hand side on the no-go, the benefit from the guarantee obligations, was there a reason that wasn't \u2013 I know it's in the note below, but was there a reason that wasn't shown in terms of the net impacts of no-go?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No. We've already beaten up the accountants on the presentation.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisers. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Hey, guys. Obviously, all the questions have been asked. The only thing I have is just on the balance sheet. So after you issue your equity, this is again specifically on the parent level. So you do all this financing that you've outlined, what will the estimated equity ratio be at that point?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Andy, I'm going to guess, it's going to be in the high-30%s and that would be my guess right off the top of my head. But...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","But the math we're solving to...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","...is not equity ratio, it's the FFO.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Right.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","No, no, no, I know, I know how the ratings agencies look at it, right. After you do the $1 billion and you did the $435 million and the $158 million, and I don't know, I guess the junior subordinated wouldn't be included.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Right.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","But you'll be around 37% or 38%, I'm sorry, you said.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, that's off the top of my head. We can get back to you in the boiler room, if you want here.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","That's all right. And then where would you like to be a year or two from now?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, as we go a year or two from now, is if we're going to have the kind of credit quality that we're solving to, so go to your coverage ratio. As we produce on the 5% earnings per share growth rate, we have the dividend payout ratio that continues to improve. The growth rate of dividends at $0.08 a year, assuming the board stays with it. We believe there's every reason they will, but it's their decision at the end of the day. We would suggest that our payout ratio falls reasonably quickly into the mid-70%s and that's kind of what the company looks like.","The old good Gordon model, we've talked about that one in the past, cash flow over K minus G. We're taking Kemper off the table. We are moving forward in a \u2013 I think a reasonably transparent way with Vogtle. So I would argue that K might drop a bit. G remains its size, and cash flow and the numerator looks like it's a pretty steady increase in the dividend growth rate over time. Remember what we did in '16 and why that is so important. That really gave us a steady ship in which to ride through sometimes these turbulent waters.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. I think in the past you've said you've kind of wanted to be around 40% of the parent, but I guess as the rating agencies don't seem to care that much about the parent equity ratio, they seem to care, as you said, about FFO to debt.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","I guess that's what your main focus is. It's not the equity ratio as much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Andy, the other thing that's just kind of fun to think about here is how much of our earnings are coming from our state-regulated utilities. Something like 96% came this quarter, 93% roughly of this mix between state regulated utilities came out of our electric side. We are still, as we were, a state-regulated dominant company. In the balance $0.09, so if you say $0.60, $0.70 kind of state-regulated, $0.09 came out of long-term energy infrastructure deals. So average contracts, I don't know, 14 years or so. So the nature of who we are, even after all the stuff we did in 2016 remains a very kind of low-beta proposition.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. And then the other question I have is just last year was \u2013 or 1.5 year, last 1.5 year, you were pretty aggressive on the acquisition front, and I guess you did make an acquisition yesterday on the wind side I believe it was, but whether Sonat or whether it was AGL after many years of really not being aggressive, where would you say Southern's head is at, at this point, when it comes to corporate\/assets beyond renewables M&A?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, I would give you the same answer I've given in years past. Corporate M&A is extraordinarily hard, and you really have to have the right mix of chemicals in the sea in order for something to crawl up on the beach. We've always taken a disciplined approach. It would have to be accretive in a matter of months, not years. It would have to be at an acceptable credit profile. It would have to be consistent with our long-term strategy.","I've been talking for years, gosh, I could remember even back when I was CFO, that we needed more exposure to gas infrastructure. I've never wanted exposure to the commodity. I want exposure to the things that move the commodity, and that's what we were able to execute. And when you think about the risk\/return profile of AGL Resources and then the Kinder Morgan Sonat transaction, boy, those are right down our strike zone. And as you can see, not only they performed well, they've exceeded our expectations. But if we remain a state-regulated integrated utility with regular predictable sustainable earnings that give us regular, predictable, sustainable dividend per share, and you can see us follow through on that.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks, bud.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Please proceed with your question","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Ashar.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Hi, how are you doing, Tom? I guess from the conversation we've had to present, it's pretty much clear that it is a Go decision. I don't know what else to make of this. Because otherwise, Tom, if I'm correct, right, and I wanted to run that because you didn't mention it in your slides. SCANA had $1.5 billion of tax benefit. And so if you do the No Go decision, there should be a lot of tax coming in backwards and liquidity should be improved and you might not need this equity, the amount that you're doing, the $1 billion in a no-go situation. That's why they can go ahead and buy back their stock the next two years. And I would assume a similar scenario would occur to you is that there would be a lot of cash benefits on abandonment case, which would flow back to the enterprise and should reduce your equity needs even with the present one. So am I wrong in that assumption, question number one?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So let me just kind of answer it holistically. In our view, when you think about abandoning Vogtle 3 and 4, there's really three moving pieces: one, deals with the potential for stranded cost, that is our investment to-date; the second deals with the value of the Toshiba guarantee; and the third, as you mentioned, deals with potential tax benefits. The other thing that remains is your long-term relationship with the state general assembly, the regulators, everything else, because when you abandon, you have nothing to show for the amount of money you've spent. If we go forward, we have a nuclear plant that will serve us for decades to come. But please understand, there has been no decision made and that decision will only be made when we reach a recommendation in conjunction with and collaboration with our co-owners and in collaboration with the PSC that has the final say.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay. Okay. No, I understand that. My only point was, Tom, that why would you not delay your equity offering till that final determination is made because it could be beneficial. You might not need to issue this equity because equity dilutes us permanently. You know what I mean?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, here's the issue. You should think about the equity we're talking about associated with Kemper, okay? That any incremental equity associated with finishing Vogtle 3 and 4 is well into the future.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","No, but I'm thinking of the equity refund we might get in case we decide to abandon. Are you with me? That's the way I'm looking at it, that if you do the No Go decision, because of the income tax benefit and also from the guarantee, there should be things coming back to you. This would be...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","(01:15:56)","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Ashar. The other issue that I think you have to consider with Southern is we're in an NOL position. So to the extent you get a tax benefit from cancellation, you won't see the incremental cash until after the NOL is expunged.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay. And when does that happen?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That would be some time in the future.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Ashar, it could push it out another 1 year or 1.5 years before you actually get some cash, all of the cash associated with the No Go decision.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","(01:16:30)","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I've been kind of pedantic and I hope I'm not driving people crazy, but the decision to go or no-go goes way beyond the presence of cash in the next few weeks. It's going to go into a host of economic factors and qualitative factors that really take effect for decades. So this is not 1 year or 2-year decision. This is a decades decision.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay. Fair point. Thank you so much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. I guess most of the questions and a lot of questions have been addressed so thanks guys for taking the time. We appreciate it. I guess just on the tax impacts on the No-go part. Does that impact rate base? Will that come out from deferred taxes? And how much is that a hit to rate base in a No-go situation?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Praful. You're really getting ahead of the regulatory situation there as well as to how that would be treated. I think under a normal framework, it would be a reduction to rate base. However, there could be a number of different ways that you could go about treating that. And so I think it's a little early to be asking that question for us to give you any kind of direct guidance as this depends on the regulatory environment.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you, fair enough. And then on the tax equity that you mentioned where you're going into renewables or buying more projects more from a tax equity partner, I guess what's the leakage associated with that as an IRR is impacted, given the tax equity investor obviously needs some kind of return? And will that reduce the ability to invest capital? Or do you still see enough opportunities out there even with a tax equity partner coming in?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I'd be kind of surprised. I'll let Art, jump in. What's different is the shape as opposed to the actual quantum of IRR.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, that's true. And the accounting for third-party tax equity, we would still capitalize the amount of the $1.5 billion a year, but we would have the third-party financing provide a good portion of that upfront. So it would mean less debt and equity from Southern's perspective. It would mean correspondingly less income, but the structure and framework of the income over the first five years is actually richer and actually contributes to our 5% EPS growth. So you're earning less income, but you're issuing less equity, but it still performs on our 5% growth path.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. But then, I guess, if I break out that 5% and exclude the impacts of these kind of projects, which we more look at, at least when we evaluate it, more look at it from an IRR or cash flow perspective. Are you saying that the underlying utility business profile is a little weaker and is boosted by the tax equity benefits, sorry, the way the tax equity, I guess, is accounted for and that benefits, I guess, achieving or hitting your 5% target growth rate?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","No. No, they still all have to meet the hurdle rates that we established for that business given the risks associated with each specific project and including the impacts of third-party tax equity, that's the way we evaluate it.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Well, thanks a lot guys. I appreciate you taking the time.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","You're welcome.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, thank you. I appreciate you tuning in.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, how are you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Great.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I guess, I really appreciate the extended timeframe here. The page 8, the cost estimates for Vogtle Go, does that include the nuclear PTCs? Does that make an assumption that those are going to be go-forward with that?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","No. It doesn't include. Those are credits back to fuel at Georgia Power and aren't reflected in the capital cost at all. As you have nuclear generation, you get a credit for the amount of nuclear generation in the particular year up to a limit, and that's how that's accounted for as a benefit to customers. So it would be reflected in the ultimate price that your customer would pay and that's why they're important to us.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. So it affects the final rate increase at the end.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, absolutely.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. And then one more question about the tax equity. How does that affect the 16% targeted FFO to debt, as you take on more tax equity in the beginning?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, we're working with the rating agencies around all that and right now, they don't see any real problem with that, but discussions will continue as we move along as we always have discussion with rating agencies as things evolve.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, they've been supportive.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And I think I understood that the 5% growth rate on EPS assumes that a Vogtle Go decision is made. It's unclear \u2013 I guess, you weren't really quite sure how much it might get reduced in a No-go situation, but I think if I heard you right, you did reiterate a dividend growth of 8% increases or $0.08 increases is sustainable even under No-go, is that a correct statement?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's correct.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And what we said, remember, we weren't presuming a current state Go. What I suggested was that would be assumption back in October when we gave you the financial plan. So I mean, the answer is the same, but I didn't want to prejudice anybody judging as to what we were saying here. We've not made the call on Go\/No-go, but even on a No-go situation, the current dividend policy is robust.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right, thanks a lot.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Dan. How are you doing?","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi. Good afternoon. So I hate to keep beating this dead horse, but I just want to make sure that I'm thinking about slide eight in the way that I expect certain parties to the proceeding will, at least the staff and commissioners and the interveners. So if I want to make sure I'm thinking about the economic piece of this correctly, would it be appropriate to include the quip and the cancellation costs minus the guarantee obligations, minus any tax benefits of the write-off, if they rule that all of that has prudently occurred with a net No-go cost?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. You're right on target.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","And then I would need to add in whatever the cost would be for replacement generation and then compare that to the $6.7 billion to $7.4 billion, correct?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, that's one way to go about it. Certainly, those will be factors that we would help present to the Commission and help them in our recommendation.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then I just wanted to verify, it sounded like from SCANA that one factor that drove their decision was the decision of Santee Cooper to not go forward. I just want to verify that your partners are pretty much, they're all together in terms of where you're at on the decision-making process there.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, we work very hard, Georgia Power works very hard as a co-owner. We've had a relationship with these folks for decades and we have a terrific relationship, among and between Oglethorpe and Miag and Dalton, and we work very hard to stay together on these issues and I feel confident we will.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","And then the last thing I wanted to ask about, you mentioned how you continue to see the productivity improvements. I was wondering if you cloud give us a little more granularity and the type of improvements you've been able to achieve and the confidence you have that those would continue if you do decide to go with the Go decision.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, and what we'll do, we're going to have a lot more transparency. Obviously, we had to rely on our turnkey contractor Westinghouse and so we didn't get complete transparency. They had their own books and records, they kept. Now that we've been able to get in the middle of that, we've actually plotted out what we think their productivity rates were versus what we believe we're achieving now and what we think we can achieve.","We have washed those assumptions through our external consultants Bechtel, Fluor, others. TVA personnel recently finished a nuclear plant. So we've already seen pretty dramatic improvements. I want to say it was something like 25% improvement this year in productivity and really ramping here, the best improvement has been the most recent improvement, the last four weeks and we'll provide a way to talk to you all our owners, as to how to communicate that productivity performance, obviously, as we're effective on schedule, that certainly has a bearing on being effective on cost and that will have an overall kind of aspect as to our success in hitting these numbers.","Our near-term experience tells us that we can do a better job than Westinghouse should we decide to go down that road.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Jonathan, welcome.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Just a quick one, you presented these new numbers on slide eight as preliminary estimates. And I think you also said, Tom, that you expect when you file with the Commission that, instead of being a range of options, it'll be more like I think you said converging on a single point. Should we also expect the estimate to be narrowed in that filing? Or are these the kind of numbers and you're just doing more analysis?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Jonathan. We haven't put together a filing yet. We haven't got a recommendation yet, but to answer the hypothetical, my sense is the single point would be a recommendation that is a dominant belief among us, the co-owners. And I think they won't surprise the Commission, the staff and everything else. Like I say, we have an ongoing kind of conversation about where we're going. It will include now the input of our major contractors. We'll have moved down the road with people like Bechtel, Fluor, however, we decide to construct that relationship. And I think we'll be more refined. I will not be prescriptive on this call, but I would estimate, I'm going to guess that we would still go with a range, but it might be a tighter range. We'll see.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Obviously, I'm probably surprised if the number was outside the range.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That will surprise me.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then can I just to recheck on equity, I think you've said a couple of times that you think equity for Vogtle purposes would be well into the future. I mean, is there a scenario where 2018 looks a bit like 2017? Or is it more likely 2018 looks like 2017 used to look?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","2018 looks like 2017 used to look because remember, the incremental equity we're talking about is Kemper-related and the additional equity to the plan assuming we do a Go, occurs later.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And does that carry you out into 2019 as well? Or is that a little too fuzzy at this point?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","It could be somewhere in between but we'll update that when we outline our plan going forward. I think it will be a little more clear to everybody.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But the well into the future does probably means beyond 2018 that sounds like it's you are saying.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. And remember Tom talked about exceeding the $5.68 billion, I think, is what we as $1 billion to $1.7 billion over there and we're not going to cross that line until 2019 or 2020. So...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","2019 or 2020 as we draw on the guarantee...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Incremental needs, we'll be in line with that.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, because 2020 and beyond assuming the guarantee numbers are there.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That was it. Thank you very much, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. I just want to thank everybody for the phone call. These have been tumultuous times for us all here and we appreciate you hanging with us through this turbulence, but we are moving through it. We built a plan that I think is robust into the future. The premise of this investment remains a low beta, regular, predictable, sustainable and we're able to, I think, deliver long-term earnings growth with an attractive dividend proposition for years to come.","Thanks, everybody.

Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Tucker","Thank you, Elaine. Welcome everyone, to Southern Company\u2019s First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today, in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call.

After closing remarks from Tom, we\u2019ll move to Q&A.","At this time, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Tom Fanning","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. During the first quarter of 2013, Southern Company continued to fulfill our primary mission of providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy and doing what\u2019s best for customers in the communities we serve.","An important component of this work is the progress we\u2019re making with our major construction projects. At Plant Vogtle Unit 3, we\u2019ve recently completed the placement of basemat structural concrete for the nuclear island, pouring approximately 7,000 cubic yards of concrete in 41 hours. At Unit 4, the nuclear island foundation is now complete and column setting is underway.","The full outlines of both nuclear islands have been completed to grade level and overall construction on the units is more than 40% complete. As you can see on the slide over the next quarter, we expect to install rebar for Unit 3 auxiliary building walls and also set the containment vessel bottom head and structural steel for Unit 3. We further expect to complete installation of the upper mud MATS and begin nuclear island rebar for Unit 4.","Georgia Power also received unanimous approval from the Georgia PSC on its seventh construction monitoring report and recently filed a date report, which included the following: a request that the PSC verify and approve all costs, totaling $209 million, incurred between July 1 and December 31 of 2012. I requested the PSC amend the existing certificate to reflect revised commercial operation dates the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2018 for Units 3 and 4 respectively.","And a request that the PSC amend the existing certificate to reflect an increase in the projected total capital cost from $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion, with the associated increase largely driven by schedule related costs, as opposed to brick-and-mortar costs, which remained stable. A projection of total impact on customer rates of between 6% and 8%, once the units are in service. And finally, a determination that the extended construction schedule will not increase costs to customers.","Meanwhile, progress continues at the Kemper project in Mississippi, as we continue with startup activities. Last month, consistent with the settlement agreement we reached in January, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved a two-step rate increase associated with the Kemper project. The settlement agreement contemplated a seven year plan with no further changes to base rates for Kemper project, through 2020. And Mississippi Power recently made its necessary filings with the Commission. This rate mitigation plan is expected to be addressed by the Commission this fall.","We continue to make tremendous progress at the Kemper site. With most of the major components in place, the combined cycles, gasifiers, massive gas absorbers and Ignite dome, as well as, the 75-acre reservoir, the facility\u2019s appearance reflects our progress with start-up activities, which are now 40% complete.","With the final engineering almost complete, the activities leading up to commercial operation include the very meticulous work of bringing the installed components together through sophisticated piping, cabling and control equipment. Our current cost estimates for the project has increased, based primarily on matters related to piping. We\u2019ve improved the quality and increased the quantity of the pipe and increased the amount of labor needed to achieve our in-service dates. Art will speak to the financial implications of the current estimate, in a few minutes.","While disappointed with the estimated cost increases, we remain accountable to customers. In light of our agreements with the Mississippi Public Service Commission, we will not seek recovery of these increased costs, which exceed the $2.88 billion cost cap, established in the Commission\u2019s 2012 certification order, net of the DOE grants and cost cap exceptions included in that order. Our current plan is only to seek recovery of the capital and variable cost components already reflected in the seven year rate plan, recently filed with the PSC.","The revised construction cost estimate reflects the company\u2019s current analysis of the cost to complete the Kemper project. We continue to believe that the scheduled in-service date is achievable. As with any project of this magnitude and complexity, we will continue to evaluate the estimated project cost and schedule as we proceed towards completion over the next year.","We are proud of the trig technology being implemented at the Kemper project. This facility is expected to produce energy, with a variable cost approaching the cost of nuclear, and with a carbon footprint less than a similarly sized natural gas plant. We remain focused on bringing this 21st century coal project to successful completion for the long-term benefit of our Mississippi customers. We will keep you posted as startup activities continue.","Meanwhile, we continue to expand our use of renewable energy sources with two major announcements taking place just this week. The first of these is the acquisition by Southern Power and Turner Renewable Energy of our largest solar installation to date, the 139-megawatt Campo Verde Solar Project, the partnership\u2019s fifth solar acquisition and its first in California, Campo Verde more than doubles the Southern Company\u2019s system solar capacity. The project will be built, operated and maintained by First Solar, a leading global provider of thin film photovoltaic systems and is expected to begin operation this fall.","The second, is an announcement by Georgia Power that it has entered into an agreement to purchase energy from two wind farms in Southwest Oklahoma, with capacity totaling 250 megawatts, beginning in 2016. All of these projects represent key elements in our ongoing effort to build a truly diversified generation portfolio, all for the benefit of the customers and communities we serve.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Art for our financial and economic review.","Art Beattie","Thanks, Tom. For the first quarter of 2013, we earned $0.09 per share, compared to $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2012, a decrease of $0.33 per share. Included in these results is after-tax charge, against earnings, of $333 million or $0.38 per share, related to the current cost estimate for the Kemper project. As Tom mentioned, Mississippi Power will not seek recovery of these estimated costs to complete the facility above the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of DOE grants and exceptions to the cost cap.","Also included is an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease investment. Excluding these items, we earned $0.49 per share compared to $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of $0.07 per share. Earnings drivers for the first quarter of 2013 can be viewed in detail on this slide.","However, two factors in particular influenced our year-over-year adjusted earnings. Weather, and retail revenue effects at some of our traditional operating companies. Weather in the first quarter of 2013 added $0.05 per share to our earnings, compared with the first quarter of 2012.","Weather is actually $0.01 per share below normal for the first quarter of 2013 but that was compared with $0.06 below normal for the first quarter of 2012. Heating degree days during the first quarter of 2013 were 54% higher than the first quarter of 2012. The other significant driver for the first quarter of 2013 was retail revenue effects at several of our traditional operating companies, which contributed $0.04 per share as compared to the first quarter of 2012.","Turning now to a discussion of our retail sales results for the first quarter of 2013. Total weather normal retail sales for the first quarter of 2013 decreased 0.9% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Weather in normal residential sales decreased 0.9%, weather normal commercial sales increased 0. 4%, and industrial sales decreased 2.1% compared with the first quarter of 2012. If total weather normal retail sales were adjusted to reflect one less day in the first quarter of 2013 due to the leap year in 2012, overall retail sales growth would have been closer to flat. If applied to each of the respective customer classes, residential sales growth was essentially flat, commercial sales growth was more positive than reported and industrial sales growth was roughly half as negative as the reported results.","Residential sales were affected positively by 13,000 new customers added in the first quarter of 2013. About half of those new customers were new connects, further evidence of a rebounding housing market and a strengthening economy across our four state service territory. Our economists have produced a recent analysis suggesting that 88% of any shift in residential usage is accounted for by three factors: weather, the price of electricity and changes in personal income.","In the first quarter, we saw a weakness in personal income and we believe the biggest contributor to that may have been the increase in federal payroll taxes. We believe this factor could have limited growth in our first quarter usage per customer metrics. The increase in commercial sales represents the strongest growth in this customer class in a number of years, and yet another signal that the economic recovery continues. This is also consistent with retail expansion activity in the region. As previously noted, industrial sales declined in the first quarter of 2013 compared with the first quarter of 2012. This result is consistent with reports indicating that exports from the region declined in the first quarter of 2013.","However, a number of declines in sales resulted from temporary outages associated with new plant investment as well as unplanned maintenance and other short-term factors. Some customers have indicated to us that they expect to return to normal operating levels of production for the remainder of the year. The outlook for future industrial sales and growth in the industrial economy are supported by a number of factors. For instance, manufacturing employment in the Southeast, thus far in 2013, has grown at almost twice the national rate and regional indices of manufacturing activity are much stronger than they were just a quarter ago.","Additionally, our pipeline of economic development projects remains robust. Recent job announcements of greater than 1,000 jobs include Home Depot which is creating 2,200 customer service jobs in Kennesaw, Georgia. General Motors which is creating more than 1,000 high-paying IT jobs in Roswell, Georgia. The Navy Federal Credit Union, which is adding 1,500 back-office jobs in Pensacola, Florida and Medium which is building a new, $90 million movie studio in Savannah, Georgia that will employ more than 1,200 workers.","Sales results for the first quarter of 2013 were consistent with our expectation that GDP growth in 2013 would be 2% and would occur primarily during the second half of the year. Despite the headwinds, we\u2019ve mentioned earlier, we continue to see positive signs of emerging economic growth, such as increased expansion of retail stores, continued renovation and expansion of food service locations and continued growth in sales tax collections. However, the uncertainty in the overall economic outlook continues.","Turning again to company financial news, our Board of Directors voted earlier this month to increase Southern Company\u2019s common dividend to an annual rate of $2.03 per share. This marks the 12th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. In fact, since 2002, our dividend has increased total of 51%. This 12-year trend is a direct reflection of the positive outlook we continue to maintain for our business and the region that it serves. We remain steadfastly confident that the business fundamentals of the Southeast provide a solid foundation for a promising future and Southern Company is proud to be a part of it.","Finally, I\u2019d like to share with you our earnings per share estimate for the second quarter of 2013, which will be $0.68 per share. As a final note, in light of the Kemper charge, we remain committed to our annual guidance range and our long-term EPS growth target.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Tom Fanning","Thanks, Art. In closing, I\u2019d like to talk for moment about our nation\u2019s economy and the great opportunity our industry has to help make things better. As you know, Southern Company\u2019s business is all about doing what\u2019s best for our customers. It\u2019s a philosophy that goes all the way back to our founding and it\u2019s an area in which we continue to excel. In fact, Southern Company was just named the top-ranked major electric utility in the 2013 American Customer Satisfaction Index.","Down through the generations, Southern Company employees have always focused on making life better for the families and communities we serve. Our customers deserve that commitment. It\u2019s central to our legacy and it\u2019s an especially crucial role for us today given the difficult economic climate faced by many of our customers. By now, everyone knows the issues with the economy. Low sustained growth and unacceptably high unemployment.","The problem isn\u2019t solely tied up with reduced spending or higher taxes, the real solution lies in promoting sustainable economic growth, that will support more job creations and personal income growth, and make American lives better. Our industry is uniquely suited to support that outcome. In fact, since 1970, nearly 80% of the growth in energy consumption has been driven by the electrification of the American economy. Energy producers are central to the economy and central to the lives of American families.","In short, energy is growth capital and we need to do everything we can as a nation to ensure a clean, safe, reliable and affordable supply. With that in mind, we have been promoting in industry initiative across the energy complex, which includes oil, natural gas and electricity to address the issue of North American energy security.","The goal is to develop and market our vast supply of energy resources so that by the end of this decade, North America can become a net energy exporter, and perhaps later, the largest producer of energy worldwide. Think about it. Our current energy policy is predicated on the concept of scarcity. In fact, we can turn that premise to one of abundance. Southern Company is committed to playing a leadership role to help North America, and particularly the United States, achieve that aspiration. I will keep you apprised of our progress.","In the meantime, Southern Company will continue to excel at the fundamentals of our business, finding the best ways to serve our customers in the Southeast, while building better communities in a better country.","We are now ready to take your questions so, operator, we\u2019ll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Art Beattie","Hello, Dan.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hey. Listen I guess this is going to be the topic of the day for little while, but just on Kemper, can we discuss a little bit more what caused the 20% increase effectively in project costs from where you guys most recently thought it was going to be to where you are today? Just maybe explore what\u2019s driving that a little more than just a piping comment?","Art Beattie","Yeah, sure. So as we approach these last 12 months essentially, we were looking over our estimates of what it is going to take to complete and to make the in-service date. There were kind of a number of different issues we outlined broadly, but with respect to the piping, we made the decision to essentially improve the quality of it, improve the thickness, improve the metallurgy.","We think that will provide the best long-run answer to the reliability of the plant and serve Mississippi customers for decades to come. So we improved that. Secondly, we miss-estimated the amount of piping that we would need so we increased the amount of piping that was associated with this project. And then I guess finally, we have added another shift, essentially an overnight shift, to getting the work done by the in-service date. So it really is kind of a function of more labor and a revision of our labor productivity estimate.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","And, Tom, when you think about, I guess the first question on that, is there any ability for money to come back from the E&C guys so you\u2019re not going to take the full tab on this? Or is this kind of thing to sit on your cost level?","Tom Fanning","Well, this is our best estimate of what it\u2019s going to take in order to complete by the in-service date. To the extent we under-run then yeah, there would be an adjustment at the end of the process. Likewise, if it takes more, there would be another adjustment over, but that is our best estimate currently.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","But I guess, you know with Vogtle there\u2019s some debate over whether the E&C providers are responsible for some of the cost overruns and delays. Is there a similar recourse ordebate of recourse with Kemper that you guys could try and get some of the $500-ish million covered by your E&C guys rather than you guys paying for it?","Tom Fanning","Well, remember, Kemper and Vogtle are completely different, right, so let\u2019s think about Kemper. Remember, this is our technology, our design, our construction effort, certainly have subcontractors but this is our responsibility. And recall we already have a settlement agreement in place with the Mississippi commission that provides for in total about a 19% net increase.","When you look at Vogtle, we have a completely different arrangement. That is we have a turnkey contract with the consortium that\u2019s Toshiba, Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge and Iron. And while we have made modifications to that contract over time to the benefit of our customers, we feel that it is a completely different relationship than in Kemper where we are solely responsible for executing on the project. We are responsible for Vogtle, but we have commercial relationship with the consortium.","Further, when you consider the cost impacts on Vogtle, it\u2019s pretty clear it\u2019s a different matter. When we originally certified the plant we thought it would be 12% increase. Now with the additional cost but moreover the overwhelming additional benefits, we think that price increase now is reduced to somewhere between 6% and 8%. And while in VCM 8 we did increase the schedule, there will be no costs that will show up in rates to customers associated with that change in schedule.","And further, when we think about the remaining price increases associated with completing Vogtle to in-service, we believe those price increases are somewhere less than 1% per year. So it\u2019s a totally different ballgame. Kemper we already have a settlement agreement, Vogtle we have a process in place at the VCM hearings and a variety of other things, a different commercial arrangement, a different price impact. We just think they\u2019re completely different.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. I guess one last question on Vell and I\u2019ll let somebody else talk, but Art, on the \u2013 with the charge do you guys need to change your equity proceed expectations for this year and next year just to balance out your balance sheet?","Art Beattie","Yeah, we\u2019ve \u2013 we kind of outlined on the last call that we had plans for $0 to $300 million but that was kind of contingent upon Southern Power\u2019s projects. Let me say first off that we\u2019re committed to the credit quality that our customers enjoy the benefits of. We will support Mississippi Power in their \u2013 getting their cap structure in a shape that it was contemplated in the seven year rate plan that they filed.","So how we finance that, how we downstream cash to Mississippi Power is a function of what we \u2013 how we do it at Southern. And our intention is to address that over a period of time such that we\u2019re not going to issue a slug of equity immediately to make up that delta. And when you look at Southern Company\u2019s ratio, it would drive our ratio down a little bit below 43%, so we\u2019re not that far away from the target ratios that we established for Southern Company. So we\u2019ll get back to that over a period of time.","Tom Fanning","And even the ongoing net impact of additional shares whenever we decide to issue shares is really pretty minor. I think the sustaining cents per share impact is like $0.03 per share associated with this if we sold all the amount of shares right away, which we don\u2019t intend to do right away. So \u2013 and just recall, last year we had negative $0.11 of weather. I think when Art says that we\u2019re committed to our annual guidance and our long-term growth aspirations, I think we can manage this circumstance quite well.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Thank you guys.","Tom Fanning","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","And now our next question over the phone lines is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Trahan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Fanning","Hello, Steve.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Hi. Hey, Tom. How are you?","Tom Fanning","Great.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","So just same topic, just in the event that Kemper comes on after May of 2014, is there any issue if it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s targeted start-up with your settlement or anything like that?","Art Beattie","Yes, Steve. This is Art. There are, yeah, certainly the issue around investment tax credits is time sensitive. So that represents roughly $133 million and it\u2019s contemplated in our 7-year rate plan that has been filed with the Mississippi commission. There may also be some issues around the AFUDC especially with the certainly the portion that would exceed the $2.88 billion where we would not continue to accrue AC\/DC on that portion but then a question about the remaining balance of AFUDC and whether or not you\u2019d be able to continue to accrue on that balance as well.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. And this is just any time after May of 2014 these questions come up or is it a certain time after that?","Tom Fanning","No. We think would be that. In other words, the structure that we have crack AFUFC be up to $2.88 billion. Beyond $2.88 billion given the higher cost increase that could occur earlier than say May. So you could see that effect going on. As Art mentioned the ITC effect would be something you would see ratably over the 7-year period and within that structure there\u2019s a true provision and a variety of other things so we\u2019ll just have to see how that would work out.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. And just...","Tom Fanning","Hey, Steve. The ITC would be reflected over 30 years so there would be the annual effect of that over the 30 years so we think it would be kind of small.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. And then in terms of the remaining risks in terms of the current budget, is there certain area that we should be most watchful of where there still could be risk of cost pressure in these last 12 months?","Tom Fanning","Well, recall this is a first of its kind technology although we\u2019re confident of our ability to deploy it. What we have said before probably the larger risk in front of us right now goes to the instrumentation and control equipment. Harmonizing the operation of the plant from the fuel intake of lignite to the gasification to the stripping out of the CO2 to the remaining synthesis gas going on to the combined cycle units and producing electricity.","Harmonizing the operation of the plant I think is probably what we are most focused on. Now we have put in place for some time now a simulator where we have modeled how this is supposed to work. We mentioned before that we\u2019re already 40% through start up activities. Those start up activities have been mostly focused on the combined cycle units some of the other ancillary areas around the plant so the big effort is going to be start up around the gasifier and the carbon capture equipment. It\u2019d be those issues. I would say instrumentation and control would be the biggest single issue.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. And then one last question just on the variable cost of the plant in the future based on any of these changes, does that affect whatever you expected the variable cost of the plant to be in the future? Either good or bad...","Tom Fanning","No, we think on a GAAP equivalent basis you\u2019re going to be somewhere between $1 and $1.25 per million BTU. High capital cost but cheap energy and recall the energy is influenced by the value of the CO2 which is indexed the price of oil which pays for substantial portions of the lignite fuel. The net effect is a very promising energy cost for decades to come for Mississippi\u2019s customers and we have great certainty. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be much volatility at all in the fuel price because we own the mine and it\u2019s right there. This is essentially a mine now operation. So low volatility...","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Tom Fanning","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Greg. Greg? Greg, are you there?","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Yeah, I\u2019m here. Sorry about that.","Art Beattie","No problem.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","I had two questions but you answered the first one on the financing cost of the write-down. The second one is just looking at the Appendix when you show your generation portfolio past through factors in mix.","Art Beattie","Yes.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Natural gas prices have run-up quite a bit in the first quarter.","Art Beattie","Yes.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","I\u2019m surprised to see that you saw such a dramatic increase in Powder River basin coal burn. I\u2019m not necessarily surprised that your non-CRB coal burn is about the same. Can you talk about what the dynamics were in the quarter that led to that and then maybe extrapolate out into the next quarter \u2013 the rest of the year based on where gas and coal prices are now?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, sure. Look, me and Art will tag team this one. The way to think about kind of our coal to gas energy is really this. PRB is going to come in to dispatch somewhere in the $3 range, $3 to $4. SO at $4.25 spot gas you\u2019re running PRB in a sense, right? So that\u2019s Shearer, that\u2019s Miller. And interestingly as we evaluate other kind of mixing of PRB in with regular coal, that will happen.","Now the other thing is, we\u2019re moving away from Central App coal more to Illinois basin coal. When you look at those units, the Illinois basin coal, they\u2019re going to start dispatching at about the $5 range. Central App will still be kind of in the $6 range. So that would be the spread in which you should look to see coal and gas switching. Art, do you have anything to add to that?","Art Beattie","Yeah, I\u2019ll just point out, Greg, that at, right at the end of the month if you look at our dispatch, curve all the Miller units and at least three of the Shearer units were ahead of our most efficient gas unit. So that gives you an idea about how sensitive those PRB units are to the gas price in the marketplace.","Tom Fanning","And the everything is \u2013 go ahead Greg. I\u2019m sorry.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","I was going to ask how you\u2019re coal piles in relation to finishing up the answer to this question. How you\u2019re coal piles look? I mean how flexible are your contracts such that you can have the facts to be able to look at this cycle as these prices move against each other?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, well they\u2019re higher than we want but we have plans in place to work them down by certainly 2014 and into 2015. We have plans in place. We\u2019ve done all sorts of different things to manage this situation. Normally, we would be about kind of a 40-day supply right now and we\u2019re kind of in the mid-60\u2019s. It varies by plant, to plant, to plant but we have plans to get it all down and placed by the right time.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","I would guess where it is now that\u2019s going to bring your PRB pile down pretty fast, right?","Tom Fanning","It sure will. It\u2019ll help us manage them faster, that\u2019s for sure, relative to where they were last year. Hey, interesting data, interesting data. In the first quarter of 2012 average gas price was $2.50. In the first quarter of 2013 average gas price was $3.50, spot price $4.25. Remember our cautionary kind statements about gas and while we\u2019ve made the big bet to gas we remain convicted that it was more volatile than other fuel sources.","I think the data just bears that out. And one of the things I was going to add was one of the other blessings we have by the people who came before us was deploying a lot of combined cycle technology so that we have great flexibility in being able to move between coal and gas in a short amount of time. When we think about it we could go as high as something like 57% gas and 22% coal and as high as, oh I don\u2019t know, 30%, 45% wait a minute, 45% coal 35% gas if coal gets cheap relative to gas. So we can swing significantly here.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you, guys.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Fanning","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. My first question on demand. I know you\u2019ve been saying that you anticipated the first half of the year would be slower than the back half. But the 2% decline you saw in industrial having seen an up quarter I guess in the fourth quarter. Was that sort of kind of what you had in mind? Or more severe, less good than the outlook you gave 3 months ago?","Tom Fanning","I\u2019ll answer you first and then Art fill in. Look, 2% I think adjusting for leap year is 1%. If you just the outages that we saw with variety of kind of big guys like Mercedes-Benz, like Chevron like others, we were probably nearly flat on industrial which is not far off of what we thought.","Art Beattie","Yeah, that\u2019s true. There were some other impacts we had with cogeneration going on at some of our large paper customers. So that has an impact year-over-year as well. And that\u2019s still a function of gas price and where that goes.","Tom Fanning","The other thing I would say is going back to this kind of economic development and the new announcements, those are really the headlights on kind of where we see our industrial sales going. That\u2019s awfully bullish. Gee whiz. Four projects at 6,000 new employees, good jobs. When you look at our manufacturing employment being 1.8% versus the national average of 1%, it looks bullish to us. So I would just say look, adjusting for all these things, it\u2019s generally in line with our expectations and we look forward to seeing how it unfolds. If I had to say, is there a weakness? I would watch out for the global economy in exporting.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Tom.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then just on the way you presented the numbers generally, you obviously have this item you excluded on a leveraged lease. Can you just talk us through why you\u2019re pulling that out? I mean in the past, you\u2019ve \u2013 typically, there\u2019s been a pretty high bar for Southern Co. to exclude a one-time item from numbers.","Tom Fanning","Well, that was. I\u2019m sorry, Jonathan. That was a \u2013 go ahead.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","No. You go on, I\u2019ve stated the question.","Tom Fanning","Okay. That was a leveraged lease that we were the equity and tax owner of. We entered into that lease back in 2002. The lessee had significant operating performance problems with the plant and was unable to get cash flows high enough to make the debt payments. So we had disclosed this in the 10-K, I think as long as a year ago, describing our options here.","We could\u2019ve written off the entire investment at about $90 million or get the bondholders to agree to a restructuring, which is what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019re actually going to put some additional investment into the plant. We are going to act as a general contractor to the new lessee and we believe that the accounting rules required us to book a restructuring charge of \u2013 after-tax of $16 million or so, and that\u2019s basically the long and short of it.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you. Guys, sorry, one more issue?","Tom Fanning","Yes. Absolutely.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Of the \u2013 on \u2013 there was a \u2013 I think there was talk before of some securitization angle around Kemper. Is that...","Tom Fanning","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Still something you\u2019re contemplating? And could you just remind us what was going to happen there?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, sure. That was part of the regulatory settlement we reached earlier this spring, so in essence, additions to rate base are $2.4 billion of the plant, the mine and the CO2 pipe. Beyond the $2.4 billion of the plant, up to $2.88 billion of the plant is plus AFUDC and some other items, goes to securitization. And we have estimated that amount to be between $700 million and $800 million. Recall, we had legislation provided for an amount of about $1 billion, so we currently contemplate using somewhere between $700 million and $800 million of the $1 billion securitization available to us.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Right. And then obviously as you\u2019re eating everything above $2.88 billion on the plant, that\u2019s not part of that discussion.","Tom Fanning","That\u2019s right. We\u2019re very clear though that there are exceptions to the cap which remain in place. And remember those are force measure change in law, beneficial capital or project development allowances, is essentially actions we take on the plant site while we\u2019re building it to improve its performance. Those things remain exceptions to the cap.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So you\u2019ve talked about in the answers to what\u2019s going on at Kemper that some of these things were improvements designed to enhance performance, so how much \u2013 can you give us a number of what the exception piece is likely to be your view of it?","Tom Fanning","Well, we don\u2019t \u2013 anything that we\u2019ve talked about so far, it does not apply to the regulatory agreement that we struck so far. So when we struck that settlement agreement, remember there was a settlement agreement and there were two pieces of legislation passed through the Mississippi House and Senate and there was a vote by the commission to approve all of that.","And then we have remaining in front of us the approval of the seven-year plan, as well as prudence hearings. Given all of that work, when we came up with the increased estimate, we\u2019ve felt bound by the settlement agreement we reached and all the agreements we reached with the parties involved, and elected ourselves not to charge customers for any of these cost increases.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So even if they could technically fall under the exception, you\u2019re choosing not to.","Tom Fanning","Not with these. These costs we\u2019re talking about don\u2019t fall under any of those exceptions. To the extent something arises in the future, conceivably they could, but not the cost were talking about today.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Right. Thank you, Tom. Sorry to be slow on that.","Tom Fanning","Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Thank you.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Julian Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Julian.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Hello?","Tom Fanning","Hello? Hello?","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Hey. It\u2019s Julian here. Can you hear me?","Tom Fanning","Oh, absolutely.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","There we go. So I wanted to ask you guys about coal ash here and what your expectations are as far as it goes with respect to the latest that came out of D.C.?","Tom Fanning","So you know we\u2019ll see. There\u2019s still a lot of work to go. Our expectation is that at the end of the day they\u2019ll find it nonhazardous would be my simple answer, and that the kind of effective period in which will be able to adjust to whatever new regulations we\u2019ll have some time to do that well into the future. You know there are some significant capital costs associated with whatever EPA has us do with coal ash. At one time that was in our three-year budget.","Our sense is now that there won\u2019t be any significant capital in the three-year period that we disclose in our estimates to you guys. In the aggregate, however, depending on how these rules come out and we\u2019re going to be as engaged as we always are, these could easily result in compliance costs that exceed our incremental cost from that. We just believe these costs including coal ash, effluents and 316-B will likely be outside the three-year estimate period now.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Great. And then does the \u2013 what came out here on the effluent side, does that change what you\u2019re talking about at all? And just in terms of the time when you talk about three years, in what kind of timeframe are we ultimately talking here?","Tom Fanning","Well, it\u2019s way early to assess kind of where we are. We\u2019re still evaluating all that stuff. We think we have something that is workable and it\u2019s a 400 page rule and we\u2019re going to just dive through it as we do here at Southern and we\u2019ll respond back to EPA in due course.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Great. Thank you very much.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Yeah, hey, there.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Paul.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","I just had a question kind of what\u2019s still open at Kemper? And if there were further escalation where could we see that happen?","Tom Fanning","It\u2019s kind of what we chatted about already. The regulatory process I described still in front of us is approval of the seven-year rate plan which was contemplated in the settlement. And the other thing still in front of us are prudence questions, okay.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay.","Tom Fanning","So we\u2019ll do a prudence review of building the plant.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","I guess I was asking what engineering is not done? I mean could you \u2013 are there like other piping issues that could arise?","Tom Fanning","I really think the issue there goes to kind of what I described before. It\u2019s going to go to as we complete startup activities, recall we\u2019re 40% complete right now so what startup remains goes to the I&C question, instrumentation and controls; and then recall one of the big cost drivers going forward here that gave rise to our new estimate had to do with labor and productivity and meeting our in-service dates. So we\u2019ve got to hit our productivity levels.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay. With regards to the ITC, when does the plant have to be up to qualify for that?","Tom Fanning","Well, there are several phases of ITC involved here. Phase I is a time sensitive phase and it has to be in service by I think May of 2014 in order to qualify for those. The second phase relates to the amount of carbon capture that we\u2019re successful with, and those I think expire some time in 2016, April of 2016. We have also, Paul, applied for some additional Phase III credits but that would require that we exceed 70% carbon capture, and we\u2019re just not sure that we\u2019re going to qualify for those particular credits, but we have applied for them.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","And then can you just talk, you gave second quarter guidance kind of the drivers to think about, the ins and outs of what\u2019s going to happen between the two quarters?","Tom Fanning","Well, if you think about just the revenue effects, you\u2019ll see more revenue effects in the first quarter than you will in the second because you had some increases in the second quarter of last year related to McDonough primarily and some issues I think at Gulf Power. So those will probably reduce somewhat. It\u2019s mostly based on our low growth and our experience around what we expect on the O&M side. That\u2019d be the drivers that I can think of off the top of my head.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","What was weather like last year, do you recall?","Tom Fanning","I think weather was $0.01 positive in the second quarter of last year.","Art Beattie","But of course, the second quarter is not a big weather month anyway.","Tom Fanning","No.","Art Beattie","And the weather\u2019s been sort of screwy. We actually had more revenue in March than we did in January for the first time in anybody\u2019s memory around here. It was really weird looking. Our 80-degree days, January was warmer than February, which was about equal to March. It was a very strange quarter, even though in the aggregate it was normal probably.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Got it. Thank you very much.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Tom Fanning","Michael, how are you?","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, guys. Just a quick update if you don\u2019t mind. I remember last year there was some litigation or, I think, mediation regarding the contractors, the Shaw\/Westinghouse Consortium...","Tom Fanning","Oh, sure. Right.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And Vogtle. Can you just give an update where that stands in the resolution process and, kind of, what investors should be looking out for that going forward?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to be a short answer. I would give you more here, I just can\u2019t update it a whole lot. I would argue that there has been positive developments, and I think one of the positive developments has been that within the consortium, right, so the Consortium is to Toshiba, Westinghouse, and it was formerly Shaw, now Chicago Bridge and Iron, has essentially bought Shaw. We think that is marginally a positive development in working through the commercial issues related to this.","We\u2019ve looked at a variety of different things. We went through mediation. And after mediation we go through litigation. We\u2019ve filed lawsuits. We still haven\u2019t determined venue, whether that is Washington, D.C., or Augusta, Georgia, so that remains in front of us. But look, we\u2019ve met with management of both Westinghouse\/Shaw and Toshiba, all of them, and we have a great relationship. And so we\u2019ll see how it goes. I can\u2019t update you with any specificity as to when we\u2019re going to resolve it or whether we\u2019ll go to litigation or whatever, but that\u2019s where we are.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And one follow-up totally unrelated to Vogtle. When you look around the system, I mean you\u2019ve got Kemper coming online next year, you\u2019ve got Vogtle coming online in the back end of the decade. But when you look across the system, whether it\u2019s Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, et cetera, when do you start seeing a need for new gas-fired generation?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. I\u2019m going to guess \u2013 what do you think, Art? About 2023? That\u2019s what our models would say. Of course, a lot of that depends on economic growth and a variety of other things. But assuming, kind of what, 2% GDP growth, 1.3% electricity sales growth, you get a number like 2023.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. So in other words, the McDonough plants as well as the Vogtle and Kemper plants kind of meet your, really your base load and intermediate load supply needs for a better part of a decade.","Tom Fanning","And throw on there, I think it\u2019s easy to forget about, but Alabama brought in from wholesale sales out of its Miller units, which is one of the most efficient coal units in the United States, and is now using those units to serve retail in Alabama. So I would argue you\u2019ve got Vogtle. You\u2019ve got McDonough. Georgia has procured some PPAs from competitive generation providers. We have Miller. We have Kemper. We have some megawatts out of a solar initiative in Georgia. I think that will all speak to our needs through the end of this decade and perhaps into very early the 2020s.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it.3 Okay. Thank you, Tom. Must appreciated.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Carrie Saint Louis with Fidelity. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Carrie.","Carrie Saint Louis \u2013 Fidelity","Hi. How are you?","Tom Fanning","Not bad. How are you?","Carrie Saint Louis \u2013 Fidelity","Good. Good. I just, I had a couple of questions to go through. First of all, I didn\u2019t see in the slides any updated CapEx numbers, and with the higher costs at Kemper County and some of the activity at Southern Power, I was just wondering if you could address that.","Art Beattie","Yeah, Carrie. This is Art. We did not update that slide. We\u2019re still evaluating the timeframe around which those dollars will be spent, so we will probably address that in Form 10-Q and you\u2019ll see some more detailed information there.","Carrie Saint Louis \u2013 Fidelity","And in terms of Southern Power you had a number of $900 million. Do think that is going to be higher than that this year? Or is that still a good number for all of 2013?","Art Beattie","I think that is still a good number. It contemplated some placeholders and we\u2019ve announced the acquisition of the Campo Verde project. So there\u2019s also some other elements in there from a capital perspective around maintenance capital and things like that. So I\u2019d still stick with that number.","Carrie Saint Louis \u2013 Fidelity","Okay. Great. And then I was just wondering if you had spoken to the rating agencies with respect to the Kemper County overruns and had any updated views from them?","Art Beattie","We have spoken to all three of the rating agencies. We have reviewed the situation with them and they\u2019ve given us a response of concern but again, our commitment to the Mississippi to maintain their ratings and we\u2019ll address the southern ratio over time as we spoke a few moments ago.","Tom Fanning","And you know that\u2019s part of our Southern Company financial dogma. We believe that financial integrity is as important as return. That\u2019s what really drives value. We\u2019ll maintain that posture.","Carrie Saint Louis \u2013 Fidelity","Well, just so I could follow up. So I believe that Mississippi power is A3 negative outlook at Moody\u2019s. Do you maintain \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever had asked this before, but kind of a limit on how low you would like the OpEx to be rated? Like would you like them kind of all on the A category? Or you\u2019re indifferent? Just how should we think about your credit quality commitment for the operating companies?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, we\u2019d like for them all to be in the single A category. So A3 is kind of as low as we want to go with Moody\u2019s.","Carrie Saint Louis \u2013 Fidelity","Okay. And so just so I understood that commitment, so your discussion is the parent will push funds down into Mississippi Power to get back up to its regulatory capital structure?","Tom Fanning","Yeah. So as Art described earlier we\u2019ll make a capital contribution to preserve their financial integrity. How we do that at the Southern we\u2019ll see over time.","Carrie Saint Louis \u2013 Fidelity","Yeah, okay. So do you envision doing the infusion down in the Mississippi Power sometime sooner this year? How have you thought about that?","Tom Fanning","Well, that\u2019s a function of the CapEx and when they spend it. So that will over the next \u2013 by the time it goes into service we\u2019ll be back to a closer level.","Carrie Saint Louis \u2013 Fidelity","Okay. What is their allowed equity structure down at Mississippi Power?","Tom Fanning","It\u2019s basically a 50-50 and that\u2019s consistent with what they filed for in their 7-year plan.","Carrie Saint Louis \u2013 Fidelity","Okay. Great. All right. Thank you very much.","Tom Fanning","Thank you. Nice talking to.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Fanning","Ali, how are you?","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Good. Good afternoon. How are you?","Tom Fanning","Super.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Good. Hey, Tom. as you look at Kemper County today as an investment given the cost overruns and where the budget is coming out versus where you thought it would when you went in, how do you see the economics of this project?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, absolutely. Thanks. It still is terrific. Now obviously we\u2019re disappointed. Nobody wanted to have this overrun and certainly for our account. We take that very seriously and we\u2019re disappointed with that. That being said, it is so important to serve the long-term interest of our customers to provide a balanced portfolio of generation resources.","Failing to do Kemper would have put a much bigger bet in natural gas for the account of Mississippi\u2019s customers and that doesn\u2019t make sense. When you think about the energy production profile of Mississippi Power going forward with Kemper, they are about a third coal, a third Kemper, a third natural gas. And we call the energy equivalent dollar-per-million BTU of Kemper is going to be somewhere between $1 and $1.25 per million BTU with very low volatility. Unlike natural gas and we pointed out before a quarter ago, $2.50 per million BTUs, first quarter $3.50 per BTU and spot $4.25. And if any of you live in the Northeast, especially New England, you can see how volatile gas can be still.","Now I sale that to say we\u2019ve already made a big bet in natural gas. We have great optionality to swing between coal and natural gas. We are very bullish on natural gas. But that does not mean that we put all our eggs in that basket. Economic dispatch Kemper looks like a nuclear plant. High capital cost, cheap energy. We think it makes sense.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Okay. Fair enough. Second question I wanted to clarify \u2013 I know for planning purposes you talked about 2% GDP growth, 1.3% or so weather normalized demand growth. Wanted to be clear \u2013 is that what you\u2019re assuming in your 2013 guidance as well \u2013 that demand growth number?","Tom Fanning","Yes.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Okay. And my last question, and you talked a little bit about some of the additional projects that are coming in within the certain power footprint renewables et cetera but also I thought Tom, you talked about expanding the Southern Power business model. Maybe I thought you were talking also about more Greenfield projects outside the Southern footprint. Can you just give us an update on your thinking on Southern Power\u2019s model for us?","Art Beattie","Yeah, it is where it was. I would just pick at just a couple of words. We\u2019re not expanding the business model per se. The business model for us would be essentially long-term bilateral contracts credit-worthy counterparties, little or no fuel or transmission risk. We earn our money based on the brick-and-mortar investment that we get in a capacity price that we put in our contracts \u2013 a second contract typically we associate would be essentially energy which is mostly fuel and there\u2019s some upside in those contracts but very little downside.","That\u2019s the way we structure Southern Power so that it has a risk profile similar to our retail regulated business and we\u2019ve been awfully successful. So the idea was we\u2019ve been able to do that in the Southeast. The Southeast is pretty well flush with capacity and we have been approached by other people. We\u2019ve gone outside the Southeast really in order to do renewables, right?","The biomass fuel in Nacogdoches, the solar deals we\u2019ve done now in New Mexico and Nevada and now California. So those are the reasons why we ventured outside the Southeast. We have maintained the same business model. Along the way we have been approached by people particularly our target customers which I would say are particularly focused on munis and co-ops and maybe other large IOUs outside the Southeast to do other business.","So far we\u2019ve been turning that business down. What we have suggested in prior calls is that maybe that\u2019s some business we could do effectively. We would keep the same business model in place in pursuing anything if it\u2019s outside the Southeast. And to the extent at the expiration of the contract recall that we tried to do these long-term contracts. I don\u2019t know specifically with the latest average tenure is \u2013 12 to 14 years for Southern Power but I would say that if you\u2019re taking risk on re-upping a contract that the expiration of a long-term contract we would probably price in a risk premium to the return to make sure that we were covered on that risk. But that\u2019s our thinking. It remains.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust","Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Tom Fanning","Yes, sir.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Fanning","Hello, Mark.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar","Good morning. Hey. How are you?","Tom Fanning","Great.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar","Just a couple of quick questions. I know it\u2019s a little bit early and you can\u2019t get too in detail about it but with the Georgia filing \u2013 the rate case filing that you\u2019ll be doing a little later, are there any big structural changes that you might be looking at? Maybe a change from the 3-year cycle in that filing? Or is it too early to comment?","Art Beattie","Yeah, it\u2019s really very early to comment. Until we file we\u2019re not going to have a whole lot to say about that. But what we\u2019ve done in the past \u2013 we typically file a traditional one-year rate filing and then we\u2019ve been under since 1995 a series of three year accounting orders which generally have a much more fluid structure. So what we\u2019ve had with the Georgia regulatory process \u2013 the Georgia commission particularly is a constructive relationship in which we can evaluate and manage regulatory structures to accommodate the needs of the day.","And I think that has served Georgia Power\u2019s customers so well for so long. So we\u2019ll file a traditional rate case and we\u2019ll file probably some other alternatives to that and we\u2019ll see what makes sense for George\u2019s customers.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. And just one quick question on the Bowing explosion. I saw that you had a filing to close one of the units there. Is that related to the generator incident? Or are you going to be fully repairing? I mean I just wanted to get little clarity around what\u2019s happening around that Unit?","Tom Fanning","So we don\u2019t have any filings associated with the Bowing problem there. The filing that was made was the sale of a Certain associated with Unit 6. Here\u2019s the issue. We\u2019re really not prepared to talk very much about Bowing yet. Any event like that we do what\u2019s called a root cause analysis.","That root cause analysis has not yet been completed, and we\u2019re very careful, even internally, talking about that, until we see with the facts are. There is a very disciplined, rigorous process that we follow. And so once we see that, we\u2019ll evaluate what to do now, in terms of returning Units 3 and 4 to in-service, Unit 1 and what to do about repairs associated with Unit 2.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. I appreciate that. Yeah, I had seen that filing and I just didn\u2019t open it. Just wanted to make sure it wasn\u2019t related.","Tom Fanning","No. It\u2019s really a minor issue and really doesn\u2019t apply to Bowing 1 through 4.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar","Thanks.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","Hey. How are you, guys?","Tom Fanning","Great.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","I don\u2019t really have any, I guess I have one or two questions left. Just a clarification I guess if you asked this to IR, but just on these sales growth forecasts that you gave, could that, that you gave on the fourth quarter call, you gave guidance. Does that include the effects of the leap year or didn\u2019t include? I\u2019m just not sure on that?","Art Beattie","It contemplated the leap year effect.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","Okay. So the sales that you\u2019re showing here, for the quarter, are really versus your guidance and we wouldn\u2019t strip?","Art Beattie","No, they\u2019re actual to actual. The way I would think of it, it\u2019s year-over-year, so","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","Right. Right. But we compare it to your guidance, not stripping out the leap year going back to flat? Right, so?","Tom Fanning","Well, we\u2019re just give you color on the year-over-year comparison, is all we\u2019ve done.","Art Beattie","Yeah, and, Andy, when you think about it, so the leap year effect really occurs in the first quarter, then it diminishes as the year goes on. So you have essentially 190, which is about 1.1% difference. You know afterwards, once you get to 360, the leap year effect almost washes out on any year-to-date comparison. So it kind of washes out by the year. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to kind of account for it in the first quarter.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then is there a way to get a breakdown on Kemper as far as the $550 million, how much was for piping, how much was for labor, productivity, whatever.","Tom Fanning","No, we don\u2019t have that. Well we have it, but that\u2019s for our account.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Avon Capital","Got it. Okay. I guess that\u2019s it. Thank you.","Art Beattie","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Ashar. How are you?","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Pretty good, Tom. How are you doing? I\u2019m sorry, I was off a little bit, I don\u2019t know this question got addressed or not. The announcement that was made yesterday on buying the solar facility, is there any more information regarding the purchase price attributable to Southern? And if I\u2019m right, the plant comes into operation, if I\u2019m right, end of this year, so there is going to be some kind of ITCs that are going to be recognized as part of earnings? Sir, I don\u2019t know if you discussed this already or not, is there anything you can provide?","Art Beattie","Ashar, this is Art. You\u2019ll see more information on that in our 10-Q. We have an agreement with, in the purchase agreement where we\u2019ve agreed not to disclose the purchase price until we have an obligation to do so, and that\u2019s when we\u2019ll do it, in the 10-Q. So we\u2019re going to honor that agreement. But there are ITCs associated with it that, that will be recognized and our guidance contemplated the projects.","Art Beattie","This is one of those placeholders I was referring to. It fills one of the placeholders.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay. And the plant does come into operation right? At the end of the year?","Art Beattie","Yes, sir.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay. Thank you so much.","Tom Fanning","You bet. Nice talking to you.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Fanning","Big Dan, how are you?","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Good. How about you?","Tom Fanning","Great.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","You mentioned that you\u2019ll provide more info on the revised CapEx in the Q but I was \u2013 would it would be the same for the financing? Can you give us any color on how financing plans would change given the higher Kemper costs and so forth?","Tom Fanning","Well, the financing cost, we talked about this earlier, Mississippi\u2019s additional cost to \u2013 for the $540 million will be financed with a mix of capital. We\u2019ll then load some capital from Southern to support the equity side and then issue more debt to support some other expenditures. In terms of how we handle that at Southern again is something that we\u2019ll deal with over time. For Southern it\u2019s a much less \u2013 much smaller impact on the Southern level that it is at Mississippi. So we\u2019ll deal with that equity issue over time.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","How about on the debt side, though, so you\u2019d expect more debt issuance on \u2013 for Mississippi Power I would assume?","Tom Fanning","Well, it depends on the timing of the expenditures and right now we\u2019re \u2013 we don\u2019t have a feel for exactly when they\u2019re going to spend that money so we can update you later on that.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, and then going back to your Appendix ratio, the capacity factors and generation mix, just wondering if you could give us what the capacity factors were for the nuclear in 2012 and 2013? What Q1...","Tom Fanning","Yeah, can you hold on just a second? I\u2019m going to have to look that one up.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Sure. And then somewhat related to that, just the generation mix, the decline in nuclear, I assume that\u2019s related to additional outages. Is that correct in line with...","Tom Fanning","That\u2019s correct.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","What would that be in each quarter, do you know?","Tom Fanning","I don\u2019t have the outage.","Art Beattie","Will get that for you. That\u2019ll be factored in; 2012 I think it was first quarter was 93 and 2013 was 85.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.","Art Beattie","All right, Dan. Thank you.","Operator","And now our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tom Fanning","All right, Paul.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Hey. How are you doing? Can you hear me?","Art Beattie","Yes.","Tom Fanning","Yeah, sure.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Pretty quick, just there\u2019s this footnote that says also reflects reclassification of January 2012 kilowatt hours so among customer classes with \u2013 consistent with actual advanced meter data and the use of the advanced meter data I guess is implemented in the first quarter of 2012. What does that mean? Does that have any impact on any of this data or anything that we should know about?","Tom Fanning","No, it\u2019s merely a way to make the data more comparable and more meaningful. Basically it\u2019s an improvement in the reporting results. At the end of 2011 we were using a much more rough estimate of what the allocation of unbilled would be between classes whereas at the end of the \u2013 end of last \u2013 end of the first quarter last year we were using a much more accurate \u2013 using the AMI meters to calculate, which was a much more accurate. So we didn\u2019t want that to do \u2013 disrupt the reporting numbers so we normalized for those effects.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","And that didn\u2019t have \u2013 did that have an impact on the year-over-year of what are normalized numbers?","Tom Fanning","Well, it did have an impact but it normalized them in a way that we think is more meaningful.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. So I guess it\u2019s more meaningful but I guess \u2013 in that it\u2019s more accurate, but I mean does it \u2013 would the numbers be substantially different I guess if that hadn\u2019t happened?","Art Beattie","Let me say it this way, the total number that we reported, the 0.9% for total retail sales, would have stayed the same, the allocation between the classes would have altered.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Gotcha.","Art Beattie","Okay?","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then in terms of just if I understood the thing the GDP forecast and sales force caps and everything hasn\u2019t changed from last quarter. Is that correct?","Art Beattie","That\u2019s correct.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then just I guess at Kemper it does seem that \u2013 I mean I\u2019m just wondering, is there some specific design issue at IGCC that we should know about? Or that you guys have \u2013 I mean it just seems that this thing is \u2013 especially if you guys, I mean you had a problem as well with the cost overruns and what have you. I\u2019m just sort of trying to get a sense as to what you guys have learned in this process as to what\u2019s going on.","Tom Fanning","Paul, I would argue that our circumstance is completely different than what Duke has experienced. Duke is buying a very different kind of gasifier. They\u2019re buying it with that contractual relationship. This is our own technology. The gasifier behaves differently. You may remember I went through a protracted explanation as to why we were different than Duke.","Look, when we do the feed study, the final engineering and economic design of Kemper County for everything that we did the feed steady on which is all the kind of electricity side and the proprietary technology, the gasifier, the fuel handling and all that stuff? We are right on the money in terms of that estimate. Where we missed it, just to be clear, is on the piping. And you think about the piping associated with a plant like this, it really is a pretty big effort.","Because remember, we\u2019re taking gas off of the gasifier, we have all these byproducts including CO2 and a variety of other chemicals and by improving the quality, quantity and then by adding more labor including adjustments to productivity on the site, to deploying that piping, that\u2019s what\u2019s given rise to the big increase. That\u2019s a different situation than what Duke raised and probably has nothing to do really with the technology associated with the IGCC itself. It\u2019s the piping coming out of the IGCC.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. Just with respect to \u2013 you guys mentioned that you thought that the cost, this is your best estimate at this time. And obviously that could change. But it would seem to me that as you guys get closer there should be less variation. I mean I know that you\u2019re obviously being cautious. But can you give us any sense, I mean you mentioned that there were several other steps that still have to be taking place. Is there a potential for another big \u2013 is there something significant potentially that could happen here with this? I mean in other words, could we see another write off like this potentially?","Tom Fanning","I certainly hope not. Listen, you know how conservative we are. This is our best estimate with everything that we know right now. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","The ITC that you were talking about with Paul Ridzon that would mean that the plant would have to be available by 2014? If for some reason it wasn\u2019t available in commercial operation by 2014 what kind of exposure would we be talking about it?","Tom Fanning","Well, with ITC there would be ratably given to customers over 30 years. So what would say, $133 million over 30 years that would be the annual affect? The other thing that Art mentioned just to add back is that additional ITC that\u2019s associated with a 70% capture, we can\u2019t guarantee we\u2019re going to get there or not, but if we got that, that would be additional $90 million. So that could serve to offset if we missed some of the other. So we\u2019ll see.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","And that goes to customers. Is that right?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, ratably over time.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. Thanks so much.","Tom Fanning","And all of that is in our plan that we filed.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions over the phone lines. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Tom Fanning","Well, let me just close out by saying I appreciate everyone\u2019s participation on the phone today. Look, this Kemper situation is something that we\u2019re disappointed in. I do want to say to you all and also to the thousands of employees that are involved in this, this is not representative of the kind of performance The Southern Company delivers year in and year out. When you think about our engineering and construction services group we have engineered, constructed and put into service well over $20 billion of a gas generation fleet and an environmental control fleet under budget, on time and better functionality than what we expected.","This is unusual performance for us and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to work very hard not to repeat. So I just want to say to you all we\u2019ve got our heads down. We are focused on this and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to improve performance going forward. Thank you very much for your attention this afternoon. We appreciate it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude The Southern Company\u2019s First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, February 20, 2020. I would like to turn the conference over to Scott Gammill, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Scott Gammill","Thank you, Edison. Good afternoon and welcome to Southern Company\u2019s year end 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you we will be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Tom Fanning","Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us. As you can see from the materials that we released this morning, we reported strong adjusted results for the full year that exceeded our original guidance expectations and we are in line with the updated year end estimate we disclosed on the third quarter call. By all accounts, 2019 was an outstanding year for our company. We performed well across a broad range of metrics. We reached all 2019 major milestones at Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Operational performance at our state-regulated utilities was superb with record generation and transmission performance. We concluded several key regulatory proceedings, including constructive base rate cases for Nicor Gas, Georgia Power, and Atlanta Gas Light. We took steps to further strengthen our balance sheet. We continued to economically de-carbonize our generating fleet, decreasing our coal generating capacity by 2,000 megawatts and we expanded our portfolio of renewable energy sources, which is now over 12% of our generation mix. Our company is ranked in the top quartile nationally for customer satisfaction and we were named Best Company to Work For in our industry and 14th overall in the United States. So, overall, terrific performance.","Let\u2019s turn now to an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In April of 2019, we laid out an aggressive site work plan as a tool to achieve margin to meet the November 2021 and 2022 regulatory approved in-service dates. Executing this strategy resulted in substantial progress at the site and we reached all major milestones in 2019. The aggressive site work plan established last April set a goal of approaching 90% completion of Unit 3 direct construction by year end. Today, Unit 3 direct construction is 85% complete. As we have discussed in the past, Southern Nuclear evaluates projected cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis.","As part of this process, we completed a scheduled refinement for Units 3 and 4 earlier this month, which in summary produced three major conclusions. First, we confirmed our ability to our expected ability to achieve the November \u201821 and November 2022 in-service dates. Second, we supported the site\u2019s strategy to continue to utilize an aggressive site work plan with no change to the May 2021 target in-service date for Unit 3 and a 2-month advancement of the target in-service date for Unit 4 to March 2022. And third, we confirmed no change in the projected overall capital cost forecast.","Now, I will walk you through the details. Let\u2019s begin with some additional background on the schedule refinement. Over the past year, we continued to gain a greater understanding of the site capabilities for construction and testing, specifically for construction. In 2019, the site achieved sustained periods of 140,000 to 145,000 earned hours per week, but built a backlog to the April 2019 aggressive site work plan. The schedule refinement process took into account our 2019 performance and also our progress on work packages, testing and turnover. The resulting refined aggressive site work plan for 2020 relies on sustaining our current construction production levels and requires a reasonable increase in electrical commodity installation.","On the refined aggressive site work plan, we have extended by about 6 weeks, 2 of our near-term milestones for Unit 3, starting cold hydro testing and hot functional testing. By extending these milestones, refining testing sequences between hot functional testing and fuel load and planning to complete non-critical electrical work later in the schedule, we now have more time to complete construction and work down the current backlog of construction hours. With these changes, the aggressive site work plan continues to target a Unit 3 fuel load by the end of this year supporting a May 2021 in-service date. The aggressive site work plan reflects a continuation of our strategy to drive construction productivity, complete testing activities and ultimately meet the regulatory approved in-service dates.","Next, to complement the aggressive site work plan for Unit 3, we have established a November benchmark that forecasts construction production levels and future milestone dates necessary to support the regulatory approved in-service date of November 2021. This benchmark provides a clear comparison to the refined aggressive site work plan. On the November benchmark, fuel load could occur as late as the summer of 2021 in support of a November 2021 in-service date. The November benchmark also support our expectation that the aggressive site work plan is an appropriate strategy and provides sufficient flexibility to achieve the November 2021 regulatory approved in-service date. The result of the schedule refinement in the November benchmark is illustrated on the key milestones chart for Unit 3. The blue line represents the aggressive site work plan and the orange represents the November benchmark with the milestone start date shown in the circles and the direct construction percent complete detailed on the lines near the top. As you can see on the green bars, recently, we have been averaging about 2% completion per month for direct construction for Unit 3. If we maintain construction completion of approximately 2% of direct construction from each month from now until hot functional testing, we would expect to be close to the blue line or the aggressive site work plan. To achieve the November benchmark, we estimate this metric would need to be approximately 1.3% each month.","Now, let\u2019s focus on estimated costs. In conjunction with the refined schedule in the fourth quarter, Georgia Power allocated an additional $110 million of its project contingency. Primary drivers for this allocation include a continuation of current cost and schedule productivity trends, which have been lower than planned. Through the fourth quarter of 2019, Georgia Power has allocated a total of $140 million. So, approximately 60% of our initial total cost contingency remains. Looking at it another way, the scheduled cost margin and the remaining cost contingency combined represent approximately 20% of the remaining estimated cost to complete. Recall the estimated cost of the time between the aggressive site work plan and the regulatory approved November in-service dates or there our scheduled margin is embedded in Georgia Power\u2019s base capital forecast. As we have said, we expect to utilize the entirety of these funds as we progress towards completion of the project. In summary, as I mentioned earlier, there is no change to the total estimated cost to complete the project.","Finally, from a regulatory perspective, Georgia Power continues its Vogtle construction monitoring, or VCM, process with the Georgia Public Service Commission. VCM 2021, recall it, 12 months, was unanimously approved by the PSC on Tuesday. Georgia Power filed VCM \u201822 accounting for 6 months yesterday. In summary, we continue to expect that we will meet the November regulatory approved in-service dates and there is no change to our estimated cost to complete. It is important to recognize the substantial progress made on Vogtle Units 3 and 4 both in 2019. And really since the Southern Nuclear team assumed leadership at the site nearly 3 years ago, it is equally important to recognize that there is much work ahead, particularly in 2020. Our primary objective remains achievement of the regulatory approved November 2021 and 2022 in-service dates for Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and we look forward to communicating progress on our major milestones in the month ahead.","Drew, I will turn it over to you now for an update on the financials and our outlook.","Drew Evans","Thanks, Tom and good afternoon everyone. First, I would like to echo the Tom\u2019s comments on an incredible year. In 2019, we achieved earnings per share of $3.11 on an adjusted basis above the guidance range that we established at the beginning of the year. We delivered this outstanding financial performance, while also returning to customers the benefits of tax reform and regulatory sharing programs, including additional one-time refunds to customers as a result of the Georgia Power rate case settlement. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in the morning\u2019s release and in the earnings package.","2019 EPS was $0.04 higher compared to the prior year on an adjusted basis primarily driven by higher earnings at our state-regulated utilities. Just to be clear, our performance is relative to year in 2018 that significantly exceeded the midpoint of our original guidance expectations in part due to strong weather at our state-regulated utilities. And in 2019, we more than offset $0.31 of EPS from entities we divested in the prior year. With that backdrop, the $0.04 year-over-year increase reflects the impacts of tax reform and related to changes in capital structure and continued investment at state-regulated utilities in support of infrastructure modernization, along with some customer growth. Recognizing the industry trend that customer used is declining, we have also been successful in mitigating internationally related to O&M expense as we always look to operate more efficiently.","Turning to some operational highlights, for 2019, our energy supply mix was comprised of 50% natural gas, 22% coal, 16% nuclear and 12% renewables, notably, generation from coal decreased by almost 20% from 2018. This is consistent with our carbon reduction objectives and our commitment to deliver affordable energy to customers. We continue to experience strong population and job growth in our Southeast service territory, particularly in Georgia, which is the fifth fastest growing state in the U.S. Last year, we added over 41,000 new residential electric customers and nearly 30,000 residential natural gas customers across the state-regulated utilities, exceeding our full year expectation. Over the past 5 years, on average, we have seen weather-adjusted retail electric sales remain essentially flat. We have seen annual customer growth of roughly 1% offset by a decrease in customer usage of about the same percentage, reflecting continued energy efficiency in technology advancements. For 2019, specifically, we saw a trend of weaker industrial sales. This resulted largely from global trade uncertainty as well as changes in production levels and customer responses to real-time pricing. However, we do see some modest improvements emerging and we believe the Southeast is well-positioned to add customers as the industrial sector picks up. Overall, usage remains consistent with our expectation and we expect retail sales growth to be flat to 1% for the foreseeable future.","Turning now to our expectation for 2020, our guidance range for the full year is $3.10 to $3.22. The $3.16 midpoint represents a compound annual growth rate of 5% from the midpoint of our 2018 guidance range. For the first quarter of 2020, we estimate that we will earn $0.72 per share. Our expected long-term EPS growth rate remains 4% to 6%, using the same base that we established in 2018 of $2.87 per share. With over 90% of total projected earnings over the 5-year planning horizon coming from our state-regulated utilities, our EPS trajectory has a solid foundation. Likewise, our balance sheet improvements, recent constructive regulatory results and ongoing focus on cost control serve to strengthen our outlook over the next several years as the lower ROEs related to Vogtle 3 and 4 construction phase-in and phase-out.","Our long-term outlook also continues to be driven by capital investment in our state-regulated businesses. Our investment plan of $40 billion for the 2020 through 2024 timeframe includes projected rate base growth at our state-regulated utilities of approximately 6%. This updated plan reflects a $2 billion increase over last year\u2019s 5-year forecast. The main driver of the increase is incremental investment related to new electric generation and additional safety related gas pipeline replacement programs. Of the total, 95% is expected to be invested in our state-regulated utilities with a continued emphasis on transmission and distribution modernization. For Southern Power, the cumulative 5-year investment plan is comprised entirely of previously announced projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet, which supported by recent re-contracting successes is over 90% contracted for the next 10 years. Any incremental growth opportunities at Southern Power expected to enhance the long-term financial plan and be largely self-funded.","We currently forecast no equity need over our 5-year plan horizon as a result of strategic value-accretive transactions that we have executed over the past 2 years and our August 2019 equity units offering. Financial integrity and strong credit ratings provide significant benefit to both customers and investors and has always been a very top priority for us. We have taken significant steps over the past 2 years to de-leverage our balance sheet decreasing our total company debt to capitalization by almost 8 percentage points and believe we are well-positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and improve our credit metrics. As part of this focus, we have engaged in an effort over the past year to simplify our business. This effort has included identifying and divesting assets that are not sufficient not of sufficient scale to be meaningful to Southern\u2019s overall value proposition. The announced sale of our ownership interest in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the pivotal LNG business to Dominion Energy is the most recent example of this business simplification effort. Additionally, on January 17, we closed on the sale of Southern Power\u2019s Plant Mankato to Xcel. And last year, we executed on the sale of LED lighting and utility infrastructure businesses that were originally acquired as part of the PowerSecure transaction. Lastly, in an effort to continue to improve our risk profile, we made a $1.1 billion voluntary contribution to our pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2019. This increased our funded status at year end to 100%. Further, we did not expect any additional required pension contributions over the next 5 years.","Before I turn it over to Tom \u2013 turn it back to Tom, I would like to give you a brief update on our regulatory calendar. After a very full regulatory calendar agenda in 2019, we will return to a more normal pace in 2020. Proceedings related to Alabama Power Certificate of need for new generation are ongoing and resolution of Mississippi Power\u2019s base rate case is expected in the coming months. In addition, the second quarter \u2013 in the second quarter, Virginia natural gas expects to file a general rate case. We will keep you posted on all of these proceedings as they evolve. Thanks for your interest in Southern.","And with that, I will turn it back over to Tom.","Tom Fanning","Thanks Drew. Adding to your regulatory commentary, we started 2019 with a full slate of regulatory proceedings. The outcomes in these proceedings are once again representative of the constructive regulatory environments across our system that supports future investments in infrastructure to strengthen the reliability and resiliency of the state\u2019s electric and gas systems, while maintaining competitive rates for our customers. Drew briefly mentioned in his remarks that generation from coal-fired facilities decreased to 22% in 2019 and as a result today, coal energy only represents about 14% of Southern Company\u2019s total revenue.","Importantly, carbon emissions have also declined by 44% since 2007, our high watermark for carbon emissions, which demonstrates that we are making good progress towards our 50% carbon reduction goal by 2030. I actually believe we will meet that goal with years to spare. We also continue to increase our renewables footprint and expect to have over 15,000 megawatts of renewable resources by 2022 across our state-regulated utilities in Southern Power. These are meaningful shifts in a relatively short timeframe. As we have set pathways to further de-carbonize our footprint and diversify our generating fleet, we remain mindful of potential economic, community and environmental impact to society. This effort will be a multi-decade transformation for our industry and we look forward to engaging with our many stakeholders.","Now, before we move to your questions, I want to mention a recent charitable commitment made by the charitable foundations of Southern Company and its state-regulated utility companies, one of the largest commitments in our company\u2019s history. In January, we announced a $50 million multiyear initiative for students at historically black colleges and universities. The initiative aims to provide scholarships, internships, entrepreneurship training and leadership and career development to qualifying HBCU students. This investment is consistent with Southern Company\u2019s commitment to diversify in all forms. In making this commitment, we also hope to ignite giving from additional corporate partners to increase HBCU funding. 2019 was an excellent year by all accounts and we believe we are well-positioned to carry our strong momentum into 2020.","We have a solid financial outlook for 2020 and beyond driven by continued investment in our state-regulated utility franchises that continue to be among the industry leaders for operational performance and customer satisfaction. As I have said, 2020 will be a pivotal year for the Vogtle project. We are committed to keeping you informed of major milestones and key productivity measures as we progress through the year and we remain focused on placing Units 3 and 4 in service by their regulatory approved dates of November 2021 and November 2022. This is certainly an exciting time to be in our industry. And at Southern Company, we have much to look forward to.","Thank you for joining us this afternoon. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Does the financing plan include any additional significant divestitures going forward or is that pretty much done at this point or is there anything else that you might be considering going forward? And would that \u2013 if so would that be incremental to no equity needed and result maybe some kind of additional action?","Tom Fanning","I will let Drew double team this one. I will lead off with this. I think we have demonstrated as well as anybody in the industry that we are good buyers and sellers. We always look opportunistically, strategically to improve our return to shareholders on a risk-adjusted basis. I think we have demonstrated that. So we are always kind of in the market. Does the plan assume any major activity in that regard? My answer is no.","Drew Evans","Absolutely, right. Nothing assumed in the plan, nothing assumed about our growth and our investment requires additional divestiture. And I would say that principally around the transactions that we have just discussed, ACP, in particular our primary goal really has been, or secondary goal behind credit quality has been business simplification. And I think that, that\u2019s a major component of it. We just really wanted to select two assets that we thought would have a meaningful impact on Southern\u2019s prospective growth and at 5% that simply didn\u2019t do it and we think that was really just a good thing to execute around. Those same two principles will guide us through everything that we evaluate in the corporation in total, but there simply isn\u2019t any need for additional equity to fund the $40 billion investment.","Tom Fanning","One of the things we like to say to ourselves, we remind ourselves all the time, don\u2019t do things that don\u2019t matter and that asset didn\u2019t really matter to us.","Michael Weinstein","Right. And another question would be the difference, I guess, the compression and the schedule between Unit 3 and Unit 4. Is that \u2013 are there any \u2013 is there anything significant about that, that you can talk about that might lead to, for instance, maybe some acceleration on Unit 3 at some point?","Tom Fanning","Well, sure, I mean it\u2019s all about lessons learned from Unit 3. When we think about I can even think of just some examples. We did initial energization of Unit 3 and we were very excited about that to achieve that milestone. In looking back, however, we think that delaying initial energization will allow us kind of more productivity improvement on Unit 4. We have always felt that as we adjust the schedule, which really moved us from the April 2019 to the February 2020 refinement, we always find that as we refine the schedule and move things forward and move things back, we can improve our ultimate performance and delivering. And that\u2019s what you see in the scheduled compression between 3 and 4. We picked up we think 2 months and that\u2019s good on a risk-adjusted basis.","Michael Weinstein","That\u2019s great to hear. Hey, one last question, the $2 billion you have in the long-term plan for Southern Power and the infrastructure \u2013 contracted infrastructure business. Is that \u2013 what does that say about what is your philosophy going forward about investment in the unregulated part of the company going forward and in particular, maybe solar and renewables going forward?","Tom Fanning","But we want to fix both the solar and renewables. So that\u2019s important. The second is really this it\u2019s a recognition of a tougher marketplace. We have lots of opportunity to invest in our franchise businesses. I think Drew pointed out, 95% is kind of focused in that direction. We have seen the market on a risk-adjusted basis just really tough and getting tougher. So, we don\u2019t try to expand our market share. Rather, we have a rather disciplined kind of investment thesis where over the long-term we try to gain about 150 basis points relative to the franchise investment in that long-term contracted business. Those projects are getting fewer and far between. We still want to have exposure. We have $500 million allocated per year over the next 5 years, but it\u2019s a tougher market to do business.","Drew Evans","Yes, I think if you look at the base \u2013 sort of our base expectation of around $40 billion invested, almost $1 billion of that is in Southern Power over the time period and the vast majority of those things are already committed. We have got some very nice wind projects, Skookumchuck grading Wildhorse that rely on some wind turbines that we set aside prior to tax reform and we are really pleased to complete those projects. We would love to do more. It really is going to be dependent upon the return and attracting capital relative to that, that we can invest in state-regulated franchise.","Tom Fanning","One other outcome is just kind of interesting who knows how it will turn out. But certainly, there has been more solar approved in the state of Georgia. I will remind you those of you that have followed us for years, a couple 2, 3 years ago Georgia Power was named by the solar industry as the investor owned utility of the year. You know that we don\u2019t have any renewable requirement in order to hit. It just makes good business sense. When you consider Alabama\u2019s integrated resource plan, there is new solar in there. There maybe opportunities in the Southeast as well, but whether those are third-parties or not we will see.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Tom Fanning","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Sophie. How are you?","Sophie Karp","I am doing great. How are you guys?","Tom Fanning","Fantastic. Thanks for joining us.","Sophie Karp","Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a terrific year and all of the accomplishments.","Tom Fanning","Yes, it\u2019s exciting.","Sophie Karp","Yes, good stuff. Couple of questions that I have so the divestiture of your stake in ACP to the extent earnings that you were booking on that or contemplated in the original guidance which remains unchanged. What are the offsets that you are seeing that would make up for that?","Tom Fanning","Big investment in our franchise businesses.","Drew Evans","Yes. No, I think that\u2019s right. Our investment was pretty small to date. Construction has not progressed as rapidly as our original expectations there, and so our capital deployment was not heavy. The $150 $175 million in aggregate in proceeds from the two businesses really allows us to sort of offset whatever we had expected and planned for EPS.","Tom Fanning","Our trajectory on capital investment and what drives EPS growth in our gas businesses has exceeded our expectations. And recall that is really associated with safety-related pipeline replacement programs. And we got through regulatory processes, both in Illinois and in Georgia. And of course, Georgia Power went through an IRP last year. And then the result of that IRP was largely accounted for in its three-year accounting order that was received at the end of the year. So I think we filled in with franchise investments. We look forward to more in the future when we look to Mississippi, we look to Alabama and Virginia.","Sophie Karp","Got it. This is just super helpful. Thank you. And then just a broader, bigger picture question, I guess. So you are investing very heavily, obviously, in the zero-carbon generation being the Plant Vogtle. So with looking beyond that, is there a sense of needing to be more ESG-friendly, if I know if it\u2019s the right word, but this is an increase increasingly a focus in the space, right? And we see that the names who are making ESG-friendly investments are performing are getting the premium valuations and performing better. So is there internally a discussion of tailoring your strategy in alliance with this broader trend in the marketplace?","Tom Fanning","Yes, and Sophie, thanks for that. Interestingly, we talked about that a lot at our Board, and we\u2019re having a special focus of just kind of global, what is going on in the ESG world in April in our next Board meeting. So this is a particular focus of ours. We view this as an and not an or. This is something that I think we\u2019ve had a lot of depth in, in the past, and it\u2019s really just kind of coming to fruition now. Before I became CEO of Southern, we were 70% coal, zero renewables. And you see the numbers now we gave you a new data point in our script today and that was 14% of our revenue.","Drew Evans","Total revenue.","Tom Fanning","Is associated with coal generation. That was a data point that came from one of our ESG investors. They wanted to see that kind of data. So we provided it. It\u2019s absolutely an impact that I think any responsible company will take. And I think in the broadest sense, Southern Company has been doing this for 100 years. We\u2019ve talked about being citizens wherever we serve, making sure that the communities are better off because we are there. When we think about ESG, it isn\u2019t just what\u2019s going on with carbon or the environment. It really goes to the broadest sense of making sure that the communities are better off because we\u2019re there. And I think we demonstrate that as well as anybody. This is not a company run by as per ESG. We have always taken into account all of our stakeholders. And I think that\u2019s the right way to drive long-run performance.","Sophie Karp","Right, thank you so much for comments.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with STRH. Please proceed.","Drew Evans","Hello, Ali. How are you?","Ali Agha","Good. Good afternoon. First question on Vogtle, Drew, can you just remind us what was the net income contribution from Vogtle in 2019? And part two of that same question. Also, can you just remind us the main sort of difference between your view of the progress and the staff and the independent monitor\u2019s view? I mean, clearly, diametrically opposite in terms of their conclusions to where you are?","Drew Evans","Well, yes.","Tom Fanning","We can start with contribution and you could take the other.","Drew Evans","Ali, it\u2019s a little bit of a complicated answer. We know that Vogtle in-service will produce something like $800 million worth of additional cash flow for the corporation and about $0.40 a share in aggregate. We have about half of that embedded in rates today as we collect as we construct a bit. There are some offsets like the ROE penalties that we incur as construction progresses. And those impacts could be $0.15 to $0.25 over the next couple of years since they are a bit of an offset. If you want to give us a call, later on, we can walk you through each of the individual years and how Vogtle contributes to income within Georgia.","Tom Fanning","But I do want to hit the soft toss here.","Drew Evans","Exactly.","Tom Fanning","As we emerge from Vogtle, net income goes up.","Drew Evans","An additional $0.20 a share, it\u2019s $40 million $0.40 worth of content.","Tom Fanning","And I think I\u2019ve said this before when you think about kind of in the I\u2019m not giving guidance now, I\u2019m just doing dumb math. But when you emerge from this kind of penalty rate period, we\u2019re kind of in the 2023 time frame, somewhere in the $3.75, even the $4 range just from EPS, just transitioning from this kind of return environment to a full return environment. The other thing is it\u2019s a very interesting question, Ali. I really don\u2019t think we\u2019re diametrically opposed. Just yesterday, Drew and I were down at the site, and we sit there with all the co-owners, the independent monitors, everybody is there and members of the staff are there, the NRC there, DOE is there. So we are all hearing the same stuff. In some cases, it\u2019s a difference in philosophy. And we try to take a risk-adjusted approach to this very large and complex project. For example, we believe that accomplishing as much as we can as fast as we can is an enormous risk mitigator. You\u2019ve heard us use the expression before, Fail Fast. We\u2019d like to get our hands on major equipment and major systems and test them as early as we can two big benefits. When we do that, we let in the opportunity for these systems when problems invariably occur that they don\u2019t impact our critical path, one; two, that we can minimize cost as a result of those things; and three, that we gain lessons learned that we can apply to other systems throughout the plant. And we have proven that over and over and over again. We think that is absolutely the right thing to do. You will have seen testimony from some of the staff, etcetera, that would say, oh, we think you\u2019re testing too early. We absolutely disagree with that. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re diametrically opposed, the difference in philosophy.","The other one would go to this, why are we driving so hard on achieving an aggressive site plan. Well, I think it\u2019s to incent the thousands of people that are there on the site to achieve to be the best they can be. Were we to relax our demands on the system at the site, we think we would just be giving up margin. And by giving up margin, we increase risk and our ability to handle unforeseen changes and to achieve ultimately the November 21 and November 22 milestones. In other words, it may sound crazy, but I think it\u2019s true. If we were just to adopt a November pathway, we think that would be a much riskier approach in building the plant than what we are doing right now. The other thing that\u2019s fun to look at is, go to the chart we have given you, I guess, that\u2019s on page 7. And what you can see is kind of our performance and how we see. I hate to take my foot off the accelerator on the plant. We have been achieving 2% on the average over the past. And you could see, December and January are we bit less, but that\u2019s holidays and kind of ramp up after the holidays. Otherwise, we\u2019re pretty confident we can hit 2%. The new aggressive site plan that is refined schedule assumes 2%. We could drop all the way down to 1.3% by hot functional test and still achieve the November schedule. And I love looking at the green line relative to the red and the blue lines. I think you can see the trajectory. Why slow down now. Let\u2019s do as much as we can, as efficiently as we can. And I think, overall, that\u2019s an enormous risk mitigator as a strategy to prosecute the construction of these plants.","Ali Agha","I got it. Makes sense. Second question, when you look at that $40 billion CapEx plan over the next several years, any of that CapEx or any of the functionality of that CapEx where you think you may get bigger pushback from regulators or is your sense, there is full buy-in on all the regulated CapEx that you are planning over that time period?","Drew Evans","I think time will tell on these IRPs, especially that\u2019s where the big hunk of it is. As you have just been through a rate case in Illinois and a rate case in Georgia with respect to Atlanta Gas Light, from the gas standpoint, that\u2019s the lion\u2019s share of it. From the electric standpoint, the lion\u2019s share of it is at Georgia. We just finished the IRP and then we just finished the rate case. Ahead of us this year, and we never get ahead of regulatory processes, is the IRP conclusion in Alabama.","Scott Gammill","The other thing, Ali, I think, I would look at is so we are talking about the $40 billion worth of investment, our depreciation over that time period is something in the range of $20 billion. So our net additions to rate base we think, is appropriate and prudent at about 5% a year in electric so maybe closer a little more than 10% a year in the natural gas business. The vast majority of expenditure in both of those categories is for modernization of transmission and distribution systems, which brings higher reliability for customers. We will get to a more aggressive modernization of the generating fleet overtime. But in the near term, I think these are very consistent with the priorities that the states have laid out individually for how capital should be deployed there.","Tom Fanning","One more thing in this new concept of resilience really matters. I am helping lead the industry on all the cyber and national security work. It is a national security interest for this industry to invest in resilience, which is how your system operates under abnormal conditions as opposed to the old traditional engineering economics concept of reliability. Resilience does matter, and we should put forth the effort to make sure that our electric grid is as safe as it can be.","Ali Agha","I got it. I was just saying, one, just one clarity on that. You show the CapEx with and then without pool closures. Can you just remind us why you show it without pool closures as well?","Tom Fanning","I\u2019m sorry, pond closures. I think","Ali Agha","Pond closures, yes, I used the wrong word.","Tom Fanning","I\u2019m sorry okay, sorry about that.","Drew Evans","Those are plans that we\u2019re working through today with commissioners. And I think we wanted to just demonstrate what they could be with or without that particular category or their relative contribution.","Ali Agha","I see. I see. Okay. Thank you so much.","Drew Evans","You bet.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Michael. How are you?","Michael Lapides","I\u2019m fine. Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m actually, it is two questions. First of all, how are you thinking about, when you look across the electric utility subsidiaries, kind of the post Vogtle which ones are right for incremental fleet transformation? You obviously have the plan laid out in Alabama right now for the next couple of years. How are you thinking about what happens next in Georgia and what happens next in Mississippi?","Tom Fanning","So we do a we do a system plan and then every individual operating company has an integrated resource plan, whatever flavor they have in their state, that essentially operationalizes in that state the overall system plan. And of course, every state commission has their own ability to modify the plan, however, they see fit. Although I think we have been generally successful showing the benefit of kind of the benefit of scale that we have and the benefit of everybody playing within that scale. And one of the things that is an obvious kind of determining factor is that The Southern Company Power pool where everybody participates provides excellent outstanding economic value to all of our participants. So we get the benefit of a state-by-state solution, but we also get the benefit of an integrated long-term plan for generation and transmission, which is a benefit we have as an integrated system relative to the so called organized markets. So we have scale, we have the benefit of state by state input and we have the benefit of kind of a recognition that it\u2019s not just generation, it\u2019s generation and transmission, and we iterate around that.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. One other question, Tom, I know you are selling your stake in the Atlantic Coast pipeline, but the reality is it was a pretty small stake in what\u2019s been a pretty big project getting bigger. How are you thinking about the opportunity set for incremental gas pipeline investments, but kind of stuff that\u2019s more in your service territory or touching your service territory?","Tom Fanning","Well, we did Southern Natural Gas pipeline with Kinder Morgan. Thought we got a really good outcome there. We have done a few things around the margin. Drew can speak to that probably better than me. We look at this stuff. My sense is there is two big factors that\u2019s just making pipeline investment tough these days. One is kind of the environmental pushback that really shows up as regulatory or permits or what have you. That\u2019s tough, that\u2019s a tough environment. The second one is the long-term question of natural gas in the system. Look, we absolutely believe I used to say when we bought AGL Resources that natural gas is a bridge to 2050. I really believe natural gas will go beyond 2050. I think in order to achieve low to no or net-zero concepts by 2050, given how plentiful and cheap natural gas is, we are just going to have to find a way to keep it in play, but deal with the carbon atom. You know that we, by far, lead the industry in investments in that regard with Wilsonville facility is our big research and development effort, where we run the national carbon capture research center we run the international carbon capture research center. And I think the next kind of generation, the first part of that was kind of focused at coal. We are going to start doing it on gas as well.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated. Sorry.","Drew Evans","Michael, I think the only thing I\u2019d probably add is that we have been successful in smaller additions to our current infrastructure. We are really pleased with the investment in SONAT. We think that\u2019s a very important piece of infrastructure for the southeast for reliability, in particular, for generation. We have added things like the McDonald lateral. We\u2019ve talked to FERC and filed an SONAT expansion to some degree. But I think longer term, this is just a piece of infrastructure, given the difficulty for building new infrastructure that we\u2019ll rely on and be very proud that we have owned for a long period of time.","Tom Fanning","Yes, yes, I said another way. Looking back, boy, that was a great acquisition because it exists and it works and it serves a little over half of our system now. Hey, one other thing is just an exciting thing. I am actually front-running and breaking a little move, but in the R&D realm, we are doing some direct air extraction of carbon. We\u2019re starting to plan that anyway. I will be announcing that around the annual meeting, but I guess I already did. But it\u2019s some exciting work that will get us to net zero we hope by 2050.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you Tom. Hey one last one, what\u2019s intended in your growth rate for O&M? Just in terms of how should we think about kind of O&M growth at the consolidated entity over the next couple of years?","Drew Evans","Our goal is to generally blade inflation throughout the planned period.","Michael Lapides","Okay, great. Thank you guys. Much appreciated as always.","Drew Evans","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Julien. How are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Tom Fanning","Good afternoon.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","A quick question, coming back to the Vogtle timeline here, can you talk a little bit about the Sanmen experience on the cold and hot functional testing? Just thinking about how long was their experience in each of those phases? And maybe any of the learning\u2019s that came out of that, that we should be sort of following and you guys start to move through that for Unit 3 here?","Tom Fanning","Well, let\u2019s think about this for a minute. There was a lot of noise going on as they moved these plants into service. If you remember, there was a big celebration around premier ESG where a lot of activity just really slowed or came to a halt. And we have people on the site there. There was nothing at the site that caused any discernible reason to slow down or stop what they were doing. Now their experience from fuel load to in-service is really pretty encouraging for us. So you may remember, we talked about these management windows, our flexibility period or what have you. In the February refined aggressive site plan. We have consumed about two months of our four months of total flex time if you will. So that allows us to move the start dates of some of our milestones six weeks and still maintain our schedule on fuel load and in-service. If you look at fuel load in-service, we still have six months. Now China averaged essentially 138 days, not 180 days. So we think we can beat the 180 days. China\u2019s debt was $112 million. We, frankly, think, and we\u2019ve got plans in place to beat that. Now maybe it\u2019s beat it by some margin. But in all, I think we\u2019ve got kind of two months of flexibility from fuel load in-service as demonstrated from China. The other thing that I just want to point out that I forget which unit it was, but some of these units when they started up they ran like a Swiss watch. They went post to post, breaker to breaker. So they performed beautifully. So we should have confidence that failing any equipment problems or anything else, which is why we do all the testing we do, we are going to get a good result. The only other thing I would just say, the regulation in the United States is way different than the regulation in China. So that may account for some differences from regime to regime.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And then can you just talk about the timelines here? I mean 2 months on cold functional, for instance. Are there any specific data points that you may be point us to and perhaps more critically, help would be probably [indiscernible]?","Tom Fanning","Hey, Julien. Hey, buddy you are breaking up. Could you be could you say that again?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Sorry, hopefully, this is better. I\u2019m thinking about the timelines here for the hot and cold functional testing.","Tom Fanning","Right.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","What are the public data points that we all should be looking for in the next, say, cumulatively 8 months here as you work your way through them, especially given how tight they are. For instance in the coal a couple of months for the coal functional testing as a follow-up?","Tom Fanning","Well, so, yes, let\u2019s think about that. So we\u2019ve just filed all this stuff in the VCM. So you could go into the Georgia process and get that material to all public. One of the things that we have heard some questions, I just want to clear that up. What we are showing here, so cold hydro testing, have the ability to begin in June and conclude or actually, as of the November schedule, you could start as late as kind of in the fall. We really don\u2019t mean to suggest that, that is the duration of the test. The cold hydro test that is referring to the start of it, the cold hydro test itself has a duration of 19 or 20 days in total. That includes mobilization and takedown. The test itself is only 7 days long, okay. The other thing let me just do high functional test too. So the hot functional test from beginning to end total duration, mobilization to take down, is like two months. The hot functional test itself is only a month. Now we show you just major milestones. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that when we finish hot functional test we go right to fuel load. There is a few other things we\u2019re going to have to do. We have between cold hydro and hot functional, there is some leak tests and a variety of other things we will be doing. If you want a more complete picture of the VCM, I think it\u2019s on Page 24 of the filing has a detailed list of all those matters.","Drew Evans","Julien, we\u2019ll give you a couple of interim data points as well. You\u2019ll see at the end of the first quarter our release on percent complete, which will help us better define what the start of cold hydro will be. There will also be testimony, both from ourselves and from staff-related to VCM before these events occur. And so there are a couple of interim data points that will give you a little bit better handle on it as we proceed.","Tom Fanning","Let me add just a couple of things. You didn\u2019t ask this, but I am going to go ahead and offer it up in the spirit of this question and it really goes to you guys have often asked before, what do we worry about? And I think we have been pretty consistent on productivity, particularly electrical. We said reasonable, I think in the script here, a reasonable increase in productivity. We have been averaging kind of in the 28,000 hours per week. We expect to be able to achieve around 32,000. Remember and that\u2019s for Unit 3. And remember, we I think I have drawn for a lot of you all in one-on-one this graph. And I think we have included a similar graph somewhere in the appendix to the handouts, kind of how big the capital cost curve is right now, I guess, it\u2019s on Page 35, where we show that once we hit hot functional test, the exposure to cost variant logically should decrease pretty rapidly. If you go to Page 35, you\u2019ll see a reasonably quick slope and a really dramatic slope for Unit 4. That\u2019s because this graph shows both 3 and 4, alright. So we would expect to see any major cost variances occur right now. What do we worry about, what are the kind of big variances? One is hitting this electrical productivity, again, the increase for the next 6 months or so for Unit 3 from 28,000 hours a week to 32,000. We believe it\u2019s reasonable, because as we have said a lot and you look at this curve again, we are in the toughest period right now for electrical work. We are in that reactor vessel, it\u2019s confined areas. It\u2019s a lot of material and it\u2019s a lot of people. And so you would expect the productivity to be the worst that it should be right now. As we move out of the containment vessel into other areas of the plant, we open up scope, we open up area, we should see productivity improve. That\u2019s kind of thing one.","Thing two that\u2019s on our mind right now, it\u2019s kind of next man up. Bechtel has a broad responsibility and has been doing a great job on this project. And I worked with Brendan Bechtel, he is a top guy, Jack [indiscernible] and the people beside are really good folks. One of their other areas of responsibility is system subcontracts. And we talked about that 2 years ago, but now is the time where subcontractors under the management of Bechtel and some with us have to perform and it\u2019s tough that you \u2013 it\u2019s not electrical and containment, it\u2019s things like coatings. It\u2019s the HVAC systems in the plant. It\u2019s insulation around the pipes where you have penetrations in walls. It\u2019s the ceiling of those penetrations and then fire protection and others. There is actually a big laundry list of stuff. But this is the next thing that we have to perform on. So, I know you didn\u2019t ask that. It\u2019s my executive caveat to answer a question that I asked, but I think it\u2019s important for everybody to understand, it\u2019s just a new phase in the project.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thanks for all the details. Good luck.","Tom Fanning","You bet. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","Hey, everyone. So you have already addressed \u2013 you addressed in the last you addressed my first question. My second one is about the outlook for demand, you were pretty clear that you have seen flat weather-normalized sales over the last 5 years. What gives you the optimism that it\u2019s going to be more like flat to up 1% going forward?","Drew Evans","So, I think the issue I was actually I wanted to be specific in addressing was that we did see a decline in use per customer this year that seemed a bit exaggerated in my mind. And I think it mirrors a positive exaggeration in 2018. And so when you put those two things together we are a lot closer to smooth in terms of total net growth in total than any one of those two years would indicate. There are a number of folks in our sector that are expressing the same issue, which is that we are doing linear regression of weather normalization. And we\u2019ve seen two very extreme weather years that tend to kind of bend around the curves, not to get too statistical about it. But I think our precision with which we can measure in these two instances is not great. So your question was more around long term. As we do more long-term view of growth, we think it\u2019s quite strong in the southeast. We have seen a lot of in-migration into our area, particularly in Georgia. But we are seeing efficiency, and we\u2019re measuring the capacity for efficiency, particularly in our commercial segments. And so we do take some comfort that use per customer, although we\u2019ll be growing the customer count will be declining, but not with a full offset. That\u2019s a bit of a long-winded answer. We are also seeing industrial rebound. This is the third cycle within the last 12 years of growth cycle and we really do think that momentum is positive in the industrial segment maybe stand to that.","Tom Fanning","Yes. I\u2019d like to geek out on all of it. The first derivative of all this is momentum. And in fact, we\u2019re seeing that. I\u2019ve told you before I think that momentum showed us bottoming out a little bit, but the momentum signals were flat to negative. They have just turned a wee bit positive, six positive, three negative, one flat. And I think what you are saying in English is tax law change, good; reduced regulation, good; currency wars, country trade wars, bad. And now all of a sudden, we see some green shoots out of some agreements with us in Mexico, for example, North America, also with China and there is still more to go. Now countervailing that and a little bit of headwind is the coronavirus. But as we have seen and we\u2019ve actually talked about this at the Fed before, with the kind of pandemic that we are seeing, assuming that we get control of it, those are reasonably shallow downturns and the recovery is pretty good. So we will see where this one takes us. But long-term, we think the fundamentals are still good, certainly, relative sense for the Southeast as compared to other places.","Andrew Weisel","I appreciate you putting that into words. I can understand. It\u2019s very simple. My next one, next question and this is very, very minor, but you do have the comment that you will have new shares for long-term equity options incentive comp, what\u2019s the outlook for that, either in dollars or shares per year?","Drew Evans","We only have about $350 million worth of options outstanding, Robinson came, it\u2019s actually a little bit lower than that, probably closer to $200 million and we don\u2019t control the exercise of those. But I know we know that the duration is no longer than I think 2024. And so we can\u2019t gauge the timing, but we know that it will happen sometime in that timeframe.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, very minor. Thank you.","Drew Evans","About $200 million is the dollar denomination of it.","Andrew Weisel","Great.","Drew Evans","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with ExodusPoint. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Andy. How are you?","Andy Levi","Good. How are you?","Tom Fanning","Awesome.","Andy Levi","Just a question on cash flows, you have talked about earnings as you get further out in the $3.75 to $4 range. Again, that\u2019s not guidance, thinking about it, but just what will cash flows look like? How will they change from like where they are today to the \u201823, \u201824 timeframe as the plan stood up and running in the CapEx?","Drew Evans","Yes. So there are bunch of different ways to think about this. In general though, Vogtle adds about $850 million of cash flow once it\u2019s fully embedded in rates. All of the other business units are driving at general increase in cash flow that\u2019s consistent. But if I look at this with respect to couple of things, payout ratio or FFO to debt, we are very credit conscious here in total. And I would say that both of those measures indicate improvement over the 5-year plan period that\u2019s measurable and substantial. That\u2019s the way we plan.","Tom Fanning","Here again, Andy, we didn\u2019t ask this, but I just feel compelled to say this too. When we show our CapEx plan and all that, it is what we think we know. We don\u2019t have a bunch of placeholders in there. It\u2019s not pie in the sky numbers. There is an asset underlying everything that we are projecting here. Our experience has been that we tend to spend more in outer years, but we are just showing you exactly what we know. No placeholders.","Andy Levi","So you are going to have $850 million of incremental net income or cash, right \u2013 not Net income, I am sorry, cash. And then depending on what the CapEx is maybe even a little bit more, let\u2019s call it, $1 billion, what do you do with that cash, pay down debt, do you or grow the dividend faster, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the balance sheet is just going to look like\u2026","Tom Fanning","Yes, it\u2019s all of that. I mean...","Andy Levi","Do you buyback stock? What do you do with that $1 billion? And can you talk about longer term get it up to the board, but as far as once we get out of this building cycle, where would you envision the dividend growth rate to be once you get that pop in earnings and does the shareholder almost in a sense get a catch-up on the dividend?","Drew Evans","First, Andy, as always, I appreciate your long-term perspective. It\u2019s very refreshing to think about the 2024s, \u201825s and \u201826s. I would say that we will talk with our board about the bookends of opportunity around free cash flow. And in general, we have been keeping the dividend growth slightly behind the expected growth of income in an effort to move our payout ratio down a little bit closer to the industry. We will achieve that within this plan period. And at that point, we will have a conversation about whether or not we grow dividends a pace with earnings or we, on the other hand, pay down debt to improve the credit quality of the corporation. I think that the reality lies someplace in between and that we will emphasize both of those activities when we have the ability at the end of Vogtle construction.","Tom Fanning","Yes. And the other thing I would just say we say it all the time, value is a function of risk and return, improving your credit metrics as a lot of value to a value accretion as does increasing earnings. And so we will keep our eye on both of those things. The wonderful news is you are looking at a company that\u2019s going to be spinning off a boatload more cash, have much greater earnings potential and have little to no event risk.","Andy Levi","I agree. Thank you very much.","Tom Fanning","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","Hello, Ashar. Good afternoon.","Ashar Khan","Hi, good afternoon. Congratulations. Tom, I am hoping with I guess this new phase, we can also return to the old phase when you were the CFO and when you gave guidance, you exceeded the \u2013 always achieved the top end in the 2000 years when you were the CFO. Can I assume that under this new, it\u2019s 2 years of good that we are back in that cycle, what whacked us that they followed you that you can be back in that cycle of as you project that you are losing towards the upper end of guidance every year going forward?","Tom Fanning","Yes, those are all Southern people up there. Yes, look, we always have a conservative bearing to our earnings. That\u2019s the way we like it. We think we are on a great trajectory and we will be able to address. We put this 4% to 6% thing in place sometime ago and we think it\u2019s good \u2013 it\u2019s fit to be faithful to that. A lot of people have asked us, are you going to increase it? And certainly, if you look at a point estimate, 1 year going forward? Yes, sure. I mean, the math would show you that it would increase. Long-term, we will see. I think once we get out of the big project business, which I assumed when I got this job, we will be in a position, where as I just said, cash flow positive in a big way, earnings accretive in a big way, low event risk, we should be in a posture to continue to improve. Our recent performance, Ashar, first time, I think even when I was CFO we never said on a third quarter earnings call that we were going to exceed the range. We would always say something like, well, we expect to be at the very top of our range. We did exceed and we would have exceeded more, but for part of a settlement in the Georgia rate proceeding. Remember, we gave away some of the earnings above 12% as part of an overall really attractive global settlement. That was probably worth what, $0.04 or so this year. So I think look, we are going to do the best we can to under-promise, over-deliver, right now, our focus on getting Vogtle done. I would love to get back to those days.","Drew Evans","I would only reiterate that we do, we are Ashar, under pressure this year because of penalty ROEs related to the construction of Vogtle, which is a single-minded focus for us. And then the only other thing I would do is absolutely affirm the fact that Tom was the CFO 2000 years ago.","Ashar Khan","Thank you.","Drew Evans","Ashar, you got anything else?","Ashar Khan","No, thanks.","Drew Evans","Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to you.","Tom Fanning","Hey, thank you. Thanks everybody. This is such an exciting time. And well, we said 2019 was such a heavy lift. You look back over that year, we had to scale up. Remember, we were all worried about getting people to the site and getting site productive and we did hit numbers like a 160,000 hours in a month and we did all of that stuff. I think we have refined the schedule going forward at somewhere between 140,000 and 145,000, we think we can do that. We are calling for a modest increase in electrical. We think we can do that. We have got to get subcontractors under Bechtel management to perform. We think we will do that. There is a long way to go here, but boy oh boy, we are starting to see the end of the tunnel. And I am so proud of the folks that work at Vogtle 3 and 4 and our partners, Bechtel on the site, good folks. So, we look forward and we are going to continue to work on that like crazy. But the other thing I don\u2019t want you to forget is that this company has been performing like champions outside of the major projects. This notion that now we are the best company to work for in the industry, 14th in the United States that we do so many good works in the community like the help to historically black colleges, like the work we are doing on the ESG front, like the folks that don\u2019t do rhetoric, we do solutions on the environmental and technology front. We are really trying to invent our future beyond just performing on the major project we have in front of us. This is I think what makes this company great. It\u2019s not a company run by a spreadsheet. Rather, it is a company run by a relentless focus on value as a function of risk and return and we try to balance both those issues in doing the best we can for shareholders going forward. Man oh man, 2020 could be just a great year and we are going through everything we can to make it that way. Thank you so much for being with us and we will talk to you soon. Operator, that\u2019s it.","Operator","That does conclude the conference call for today.

My name is Ciglan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Gammill","Thanks, Ciglan. Good morning, and welcome to Southern Company's second quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you, we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call, which are both available on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Tom Fanning","Thanks, Scott. Good morning. And thank you all for joining us. This morning, we reported strong earnings per share substantially above our estimate and remain on track to meet our full year earnings target for 2019.","Our electric system has demonstrated resilience in what has so far been a hot summer in the southeast. We also continue to make meaningful progress at Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 as demonstrated by the achievement of several milestones during the quarter. In addition, we are progressing well through an active regulatory calendar this year. We\u2019ll cover all of this today.","So let me start with an update on Vogtle. The site continues to make progress and we remain focused on meeting the November 21 and November 2022 regulatory approved in-service date for Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Our strategy of working to an aggressive plan on the site remains in place and currently provides a six month margin to the November date.","There is no change in our total estimated costs for the project at this time. And we have not allocated any contingency, though the presence of a contingency reflects our expectation that we will likely utilize this reserve in the months ahead.","As we stated during the first quarter call, our focus is on achievement of major milestones, supported by adequate staffing and productivity. In May, we achieved initial energization for Unit 3, a major milestone for the project. In addition, we set the middle containment ring for Unit 4 and installed the generator rotor for Unit 3.","In August, we expect to begin our next major milestone for Unit 3, integrated flush activities on schedule with the site's aggressive work plan. Overall and including engineering procurement and initial test plan activities, the entire project is approximately 79% complete. For Unit 3 direct construction is 71% complete with a target to approach 90% by year end.","The site is averaged approximately 145,000 earned hours over the past three weeks with a year-to-date average of 133,000 earned hours through July. Now recall, the aggressive site work plan requires an average of 160,000 weekly earned hours for a sustained period of time starting later this year into next year.","To meet the regulatory approved November schedule, we estimate that we would need to average approximately 100,000 earned hours per week through the start of Unit 3 hot functional testing, which is essentially the completion of the construction phase for the unit.","We've been successful in hiring additional craft resources and supervision and now we have over 8,000 people working on the site across day and night shifts. As a result of these hiring efforts constructions weekly production capacity has risen and we are working to gain productivity improvement.","As we [Technical Difficulty], for example most recently our electrical scope for Unit 3, we see essentially an S-curve or a sawtooth effect. As we add a significant number of new skilled craft and field supervision, we initially see modest levels of improvement in earned hours then as the workforce matures productivity should improve.","You can see this effect in our most recent data. CPI is a trailing four-week statistic. However over the last month or so earned hours for our Unit 3 electrical have more than doubled. Looking forward in order to meet the aggressive site work plan we will need to sustain and improve this performance.","As a final note, it would not be surprising to see more fluctuations in CPI in the months ahead as we continue to add new craft and increase system turnover activities. We believe we are on track to meet the upcoming milestones in support of the aggressive site floor plan.","Now looking forward to the end of the year, we expect to be near completion of the integrated flush for Unit 3 and have the main control room ready for testing. Around the same time, the site should begin open vessel testing, which we have added to Slide 7 as another major milestone to track.","Open vessel testing verifies that water flows between the primary systems and the reactor and that the pumps, motors, valve and pipes function as designed. This is a key set of activities leading up to cold hydro testing which we anticipate will begin next spring.","The final major construction milestone is the start of hot functional testing. From there we will focus primarily on certifying systems, leading up to fuel load which would occur by the end of next year under the aggressive site work plan. And as we said previously, the aggressive site work plan is challenging and we work to meet it every day.","Ultimately success is bringing Vogtle Units 3 and 4 online on or before the regulatory approved November 2021 and 2022 in-service dates. Based on what we know today, we continue to expect that we have sufficient schedule and cost contingency to meet this objective.","I'll now turn the call over to Drew to cover our quarterly performance in greater detail.","Andrew Evans","Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. Happy Shark Week. In the second quarter of 2019 we achieved earnings per share of $0.80 on an adjusted basis, $0.09 higher than the estimate we provided on our last call and in line with $0.80 of earnings per share on an adjusted basis reported in the second quarter of 2018.","The primary drivers of our quarterly results compared to last year are higher revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing, net of usage changes and warmer than normal weather at our regulated utilities, partially offset by the impact on earnings as a result of divestitures.","Temperatures across our Southeast service territory were significantly warmer than normal during the second quarter of 2019, including the warmest May in the last 50 years, resulting in $0.03 of benefit compared to last year and $0.07 of benefit versus normal. A detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in this morning's release and the earnings package.","Taking a look at customer growth. We added nearly 23,000 residential electric customers and over 14,000 residential natural gas customers across our regulated utilities in the first half of the year. These additions put us on track to meet our full year expectations for residential customer gains across our electric and gas franchises and are comparable to the growth we experienced in the same period last year. Customer growth continues to be driven primarily by strong job growth and population growth in our Southeast service territories.","Weather adjusted retail electric sales were down just over 1% year-over-year due to a combination of factors, including continued energy efficiency and technology advances across all customer segments and continued weakness in industrial sales.","Industrial sales particularly primary metals, chemicals and stone, clay and glass were down due to global trade concerns and a strong dollar's impact on trade, as well as changes in production levels and some timing. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share were a $1.50 in 2009 with essentially no weather impact.","To be clear, weather on an aggregate basis has been normal for the year despite the warmer than normal second quarter period. Our estimate for the third quarter of 2019 is a $1.10 per share on adjusted basis with normal weather. We will assess our earnings guidance range for the full year after the third quarter.","Turning now to some updates on capital requirements. In June Southern Power successfully closed on its sale of the Nacogdoches Generating Facility to Austin Energy for $460 million. The sale of Plant Mankato to Xcel remains subject to Minnesota and North Dakota State Commission approvals and is expected to close this fall.","Year-to-date equity issuances from internal plans have resulted in proceeds of approximately $450 million which is higher than forecasted. Southern's equity needs for 2023 now stands at roughly $2 billion. While we have the capacity to fill our projected equity needs through our robust internal equity plans, we continue to evaluate all options to efficiently source equity. Financial stability and strong credit metrics provide significant benefits to our customers and investors and remain a top priority for us.","Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I'd like to give a brief update on our regulatory calendar for the remainder of the year. As we get [Technical Difficulty] to Atlanta Gas Light and Georgia Power filed base rate cases with the Georgia Public Service Commission in June, we expect that these Georgia proceedings, as well as the pending rate case for Nicor Gas in Illinois to conclude in late 2019. Mississippi Power is scheduled to file a base rate case with the Mississippi Public Service Commission in the fourth quarter of 2019. Lastly Georgia Power received a final ruling earlier in July on its Integrated Resource Plan and Tom will highlight a few of the outcomes in that proceeding.","Tom, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.","Tom Fanning","Thanks, Drew. As Drew mentioned earlier this month the Georgia PSC approved the Georgia Powers 2019 Integrated Resource Plan or IRP in a 5-0 vote. Recall, Georgia Power files an IRP every three years and the improved plan outlines how the company will continue to deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to 2.6 million customers over the next 20 years.","The approved plan includes the addition of 2,260 megawatts of new renewable generation and the retirement of five - coal fired generation units totaling nearly 1,000 megawatts. As a result, the Georgia Power intends to grow its renewable generation portfolio by more than 72% to nearly 5,400 megawatts by 2024 increasing the company's total renewable capacity to 22%.","Georgia Power also received approval to own and operate 80 megawatts of battery energy storage systems which will help position the company as a leader in energy storage. In addition, Georgia Powers environmental compliance strategy was approved, including plans to close all 29 ash ponds. We believe these are constructive outcome that will benefit our customers on many levels in the years ahead.","In closing, I'd like to highlight a few newsworthy items of which we\u2019re particularly proud. For the third year in a row, Georgia Power was ranked number one for customer satisfaction among large utilities in the south by J.D. Power in its 2019 Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study.","Georgia Power achieved the highest score in its category based on multiple factors, including reliability, corporate citizenship, communications and customer service. Two of our natural gas utilities, Virginia Natural Gas and Chattanooga Gas were recently recognized as most trusted business partners in the utility industry by Cogent Syndicated and the alliance to save energy named Alabama Power as the 2019 star of efficiency for its smart neighborhood project outside of Birmingham.","In addition for the fourth consecutive year Southern Company was named among the top 50 companies for diversity by DiversityInc. Our long standing commitment to diversity and inclusion is embedded in our culture and allows us to better anticipate change and achieve success as we build the future of energy. I'm very proud of our team for these accomplishments.","Again, we are very pleased with our performance from both a financial and operational perspective. Through the first half of the year, we continue to see our regulated franchises operating on a high level and we are achieving key milestones in Vogtle. We remain focused on bringing Unit 3 and 4 online by their regulatory approved date of November 2021 and November 2022. We are committed to keeping you informed and look forward to providing another in-depth update at the end of the third quarter.","So thank you for joining us this morning. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Morning, Tom. A couple of questions. Congratulations on continuing to see the type of productivity improvements that you need to be within the now sort of April to November timeframe in - on the Vogtle project. Can you can you comment. I know it only just came out in the last 24 to 36 hours on why you think the staff of the Georgia Commission in their review of your last filing is more sceptical of your ability to execute and where the dissonance might be between your cautious optimism and their scepticism?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, sure. Glad to do that. First of all, I think - I think it was reasonably a fair report. We respect those folks and you should know, everybody on the phone should know that the people that write that report, whether it's Dr. Jacobs or other key members of the staff sit in every meeting that we sit in virtually. So they're in the co-owners meetings and they're in there with Southern Nuclear management, with Bechtel, with me and Paul Bowers and Drew and all the team.","So number one, all the cards are on the table for everybody. Number two, I think one of the other important paragraphs you should read in that report is the first paragraph. And that's a very I think positive statement about the process that we're going through.","I think the third point is we certainly respect these people and they are certainly confident. But where we would find differences of opinion would really go to our belief in our own capability, when you think about the players I just mentioned, whether it is our own team building the plant, led by Glen Chick, who came from Browns Ferry that put a - completed a nuclear plant and know how to do this. That's the most recent example; our own expertise and look at the track record of success that we've been able to show since we took over the project from Westinghouse; look at Bechtel, they are by far the leading contractor for nuclear plants around the world. And you know I have a great relationship with Brendan Bechtel. In fact, weekend or two ago I was with not only Brendan but his dad Riley.","The team on site there, look I think we know how to build nuclear plants and I think there are certainly different approaches you could take, but we believe that our approach has been tested recently, not only at Browns Ferry but also in China and that we think everything we're doing is sound.","There are no secrets, there's no hidden cards. Everything that we're doing is open for discussion and it's not only us, its our co-owners and anybody - oh the NRC and everybody that looked in believes that our practices are sound. It's very reasonable that somebody could have a different opinion about that, but we believe that our conviction is well suited.","So I would say those general comments. I would say just other things that are important. And it really goes to how you look at the data. I spent a little bit of time in the script talking about this sawtooth or ramp up of effect. We believe that we are reasonably on track to do what we need to do on electrical work front.","It did start a little slower than probably we wanted, but that's not completely unexpected. Bechtel would describe that as their S-curve we call it sawtooth. But we believe now we're hitting the numbers we need to hit in terms of the electrical work front and if we sustain that and then we want to improve it a little better, we believe that we're reasonably on track to do it. We need to do to hit the schedule.","And so far the milestones are reflective of the aggressive site plan. We readily admit, the aggressive site plan is in fact aggressive, okay. But every time we beat 100,000 hours or every time we beat - we achieve a milestone consistent with the aggressive plan we build and maintain margin to the November in-service date and that is ultimately success. Greg I'm glad to go into anything further you'd like to, but I think those\u2026","Greg Gordon","Not that\u2019s extremely thorough. I appreciate it. Two more quick questions. One is just in the quarter you know, you\u2019ve said that you had you know, that the hottest May in 50 years. And I know you said on a year-to-date basis things have sort of evened out.","But can you suss out how much usage and how much - how much of the - how much of the incremental earnings in the quarter whether it was usage or directly weather driven came from that weather event or is it sort of\u2026","Tom Fanning","Sure\u2026","Greg Gordon","[indiscernible] clear that you were able to carve that out?","Andrew Evans","Yeah, Greg. This is Drew. We actually put it in Slide 9, but the weather impact for the second quarter was about $0.03 relative to last year and about $0.07 relative to normal. But if you look at it over the course of the entire year, I think weather is actually down about a penny relative to our normal expectations for consumption.","As we look at the individual usage classes, you know, conservation and energy efficiency are pervasive trends particularly in residential and commercial and then on the industrial side, we did see a downtick of about 2% in total electricity sales. We think a good portion of it just really describes a general economy that's in a bit of a pause.","Trade skirmishes are sort of a vacuum to good capital deployment or a barrier to good capital deployment over the long term and a strong dollar in general with an economy that's about 25% dependent upon exports for its production really just signaled to us that we're seeing a little bit of weakening and that's \u2013 in that section of the economy.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Greg. Let me jump in here real quick. Let me correct them, I had a brain cramp. I don't know why, I was in a conversation this morning kind of getting ready for CNBC. I had Browns Ferry on my mind on another issue, the last completed one was Watts Bar. So anyway\u2026","Greg Gordon","I don't think anybody would have caught that. But thank you.","Tom Fanning","Yeah. You bet\u2026","Greg Gordon","Have a great morning, guys.","Tom Fanning","Yeah. Thank you, buddy. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes one of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Hey. Good morning.","Andrew Evans","Julien, thanks for joining us.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, thank you rather. Hey listen, I wanted to follow up a little bit on Greg's question if you could elaborate a little bit. I mean, clearly both you and staff talk about potentially - shall we say using up some of that contingency. Where and how would you kind of read into progress against that and confidence or really what variables or specific elements are going to be eating into that contingency. Is there any difference in opinion between you and staff on where you might be using that contingency or where the greatest risks are to that specific element? Then I got a follow up.","Tom Fanning","Yeah. Well, I mean, let me just start with the basic concept right? When we created the new estimate July a year ago, we put everything that we knew into the estimate and then we said let's create a contingency of some percent above that estimate.","And the contingency basically allows for things that you don't know in the current period if you have a reasonable expectation that you'll spend over time. To the extent we made the statement that we're not going to use contingency, we would have to reverse it.","At this point we believe that for everything we know we think there is still a reasonable likelihood that we will use contingency. Otherwise we'd have to reverse it. We don't think we're in a position to reverse that today.","Now, will we use contingency going forward? I think we probably will. That is the assessment that we must make in order to keep it on the books and keep it in place. Look we continually re-evaluate our cost position and we're very gratified as of the current period right now that we haven't touched contingency, we look at all the pluses and minuses. You must imagine that as a daily activity and we evaluate that against our own kind of reserves and our own kind of allowances for change.","So far we've been able to manage any of the pluses and minuses with cost today and what we know in the future with our own reserves on site, but we haven't touched contingency. My only caution is to people don't be surprised if and when we do. And it may be kind of lumpy and maybe you know, 50 million to 100 million or 150 million, there's still three years to go on both these projects. My only caution to people is our contingency is there for a reason.","Andrew Evans","And Julien, if I could sort of reintroduce a concept, that I have talked about a number of times and I think it's supported by the independent system monitors report. If we look at contingency as a percentage of our estimate to complete, we're maintaining a level that's perhaps in excess of 20% of that total estimate to complete. As Tom said, consumption of this in our view is probably certain the pace at which we do it is a little less certain. But nevertheless, if you measure us over a longer period of time, I think we'll take some great comfort in where we stand when we get to some point in the middle of next year.","Tom Fanning","And contingency can take a lot of different forms right? But let's focus on Unit 3 for a minute here. We're about a year away, round numbers, maybe a little more, to hot functional test and what that says is your five or six month away from loading fuel. And then you're six months away from having an in-service.","We are rapidly approaching, eliminating the uncertainties at least with respect to that unit, every month every quarter that we go by staying with schedule gives us more certainty that we'll be able to hit ultimately the November regulatory agreed upon process. So that's a big deal.","And as you know, hot functional test is essentially the completion of construction. That's Unit 3. These things are happening right now. I think I've mentioned on TV that we announced yesterday that we've sent out a contract to procure fuel. So these times are fast approaching, whether we're going to use contingency or not at least on Unit 3 is right in front of us. So we are right now making a whole lot of progress.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Nice. If I can follow back up on the Georgia IRP process and just all together understanding the CapEx budget. I know you guys have historically done solar and sort of followed up after the fact and reflecting that in your outlook. But how do you think about the cadence of reflecting the latest IRP developments here and how do you think about your own participation in subsequent RFPs that will come out now?","Tom Fanning","I'm sorry. Julien, what's the point of the question, is it how did we work with them on that, you want to me comment on that?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","How do you think about reflecting the CapEx benefits from any further generation procurement here from the IRP?","Tom Fanning","I see what you're saying. Thank you. Yeah, we will - you know, as been our historical practice, we'll update CapEx probably the first - the end of the year call which will be end of January, 1st of February. So we're getting ready now.","But I would argue that the direction of CapEx associate with this IRP approval is probably up when you consider the ARO associated with the ash ponds, when you consider kind of the storage project. You know, the swing in that when its obviously solar. If you remember last year, I don't think Georgia Power won any of the new solar, but Southern Power did. And then later Southern Power came in and bought a lot of the development activity by other successful bidders, that also can be a swing in what CapEx looks like down the road. But that's a little hard to predict today.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Look, I'm glad you brought it up actually. If I can clarify it. With respect to the ARO and the Georgia piece and obviously looking forward to Alabama, how much of that is already reflected just versus what's incremental here, specially the ARO piece?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, if you look at the ARO it really is a 10 year obligation generally to make this environmental investment and about 40% of it is represented in our plan, something like that today, over the five year plan period. So if we look at the $38 billion that we think we will invest over the next five years, those investments are largely centered around modernization of the transmission distribution infrastructure and environmental - environmental investments.","I think your question is more around the modernization of the generating fleet or the movement of - into renewable generation, which we kind of view as being a post 2023 issue - 2023 being the plan you're about to post, as a second half plan year that would give some durability to our growth rate and total invested capital in total rate base.\\","And there's some other kind of interesting ideas we introduced in the IRP that also could have a bearing here. One is that for the first time in my knowledge anyway in the history we had a section on resilience, and one of the ideas that we put in place is this notion of inactive reserve that is not retiring a coal plant per say, but taking it out of economic dispatch, preserving it as a matter of resilience in the event of a system emergency that could help in a whole variety of ways. Anyway, all those things have a bearing. We will certainly clarify that. But I - you know next year - but I think the general trend would be north of where we are.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yeah. Got it. All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you guys very much.","Tom Fanning","Thank you my friend.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Hello, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi. How are you doing?","Tom Fanning","Terrific. Hope you're well?","Praful Mehta","Excellent, excellent. So thank you for all the answers so far. I guess just to clarify, on the contingency that you highlighted just wanted to understand as you pointed out that you want to keep it on there as a justification for keeping it in the plan. Could you at least give some color on what specifically you have put against the contingency right now that allows you to keep it in the plan?","Tom Fanning","It's just general uncertainty about the remaining work to be done and the schedule on part in which it will be done. You know, there's you know just to remind everybody to finish, I guess Unit 4 you're three years away, round number. So there is a lot that could happen between now and then.","And I think the lack of - the lack of clarity with what could happen, you know in a hope, what are they call the unknown unknowns could certainly have a bearing. You should know also this is also a difference of opinion a little bit in the report by the staff. And that's perfectly fine. We keep a risk register.","So what we do is we analyze the top you know, 10 kind of - it's actually bigger than that, but the top kind of 10 big things. And we like a subcontractor cost. And we look at how their performance has been with relation to construction startup testing. And we just continually reassess those. Its kinds of things that really go to our assessment about contingency.","The other thing that you should know, I mean, think about as you go through testing, it may be that some of the equipment you test doesn't work the way it should and going to need to rework it or it could have a schedule impact or who knows. But that's the reason why there's just enough uncertainty remaining that we keep the contingency in place. We are gratified. Make no mistake, we haven't hit it yet. But don't be surprised if we do in the future.","Praful Mehta","Got you. That\u2019s super helpful color. Understood. Maybe secondly on comparable plans in China. I know that there has been some unplanned outages there. Any color that you have in terms of what could be the reason for that. And is there any kind of design issue that you're aware of that could become a problem for Vogtle as well?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, sure. Last question first. There is no design issue that we're aware of. Number two, there's been a lot of discussion about the RCP reactor coolant pump and you know, I think it's pretty clear the discussion around, we don't know the root cause effect. I think that reports coming out reasonably soon on site. But that really is a matter of discussion between the Chinese and Westinghouse.","But that has been the only significant outage and our sense is that they have equipment on site that they could have improved the speed of the recovery or whatever. But for whatever reason that's really for them to answer. That's just one of 16 RCPs on site, there is no to our knowledge there is no design or systemic issue that we're aware of.","Praful Mehta","Okay, great. Thanks and good to get that out of the way. So appreciate that. And then finally just quickly on the equity issuance timing, is there anything we should be thinking about around all the options and what are the options that you're thinking about and from a timing perspective how should we think about that as well?","Tom Fanning","Probably I think we've shown really good discipline in terms of capital raising over the last year and a year and a half, probably two years. We've been focused on making sure that any divestiture that we do or slimming down of our core business is accretive to what our expectations are for equity. You know, you've seen some activity in this period in particular with the sale of Nacogdoches and I think our pending sale of Mankato.","We've also done some streamlining across other parts of the business and recently sold the utility services business out of PowerSecure. We've discharged a very small container shipping lease program that was part of cleanup after the Nicore acquisition from 2011.","So really working through all of the options that we have to reduce the burden on share issuance. The programs that we've had to date, the internal plans of drip generate about $500 million per annum and in share count the options exercise which is another component of an internal plan have accelerated a bit because of share price appreciation over the last few months.","And so I'd just say that, as we look at all of the options available to us to satisfy the remaining $2 billion we just want to be as considerate from an investor perspective as we possibly can. Our route though is to meet our capital plan we can do it with simply using the internal plans that we have in place, all other options we would use would be only accretive to that plan.","Praful Mehta","Got it. Super helpful, guys. Thanks so much.","Tom Fanning","Thank you.","Operator","Our following question concern line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Hello, Ali. Good morning.","Ali Agha","Good morning. Morning, Tom, Drew. First question, Tom just wanted to come back to the staff report on Vogtle. Anything in there that that kind of surprised you and what do you make of the criticism they have on the approach that you all are taking. I think in their words you know, a premature focus on testing versus focusing on construction completion any thoughts there?","Tom Fanning","Yeah. Sure, absolutely. Not really. I mean, a lot of the points they raised have been raised in the past in DCMs and other things. I can remember some discussion about not enough attention paid to milestones and too much attention paid to hours worked. And I can remember commentary over the past that you know, we had this ramp up of ours and there was no concern about whether we could do it.","Well, in fact, we've demonstrated and I started saying that the last October's earnings call about how - you know don't listen to our rhetoric just watch and see if we can ramp up the hours, I am sure enough we have.","So I get concerned you know, and that's their job. They're the adversarial staff. And like I said we respect those people. That's what they're doing. They're pointing out issues. We're well aware of the issues, we all know the issue.","In terms of kind of the process, we think we have a really good balance on site right now of evaluating kind of the process of commodity work whether it's hours or material or whatever and focusing on milestones.","It's very easy to think about kind of how all hours are not created equal. For example, some hours when we go to these weekly things and that's why we tried to and I guess this was two earnings calls ago, maybe three, that we started saying to you guys we're giving you hours and we think that's instructive. But as we start down this new rebase lining it's important to think about milestones because not all hours are created equal. In other words, some of the hours that we're talking about have nothing to do with critical path. They are illustrative of our ability to put deploy labor and productive hours in place.","Let me just give you an example. We have now ramped up worked hours per week at around 188,000 hours per week, all we count are hours that accrue to productive work. So the delta between say 145 and 188, we believe it's headroom that allows us to increase productivity on site. Essentially this S-curve or sawtooth effect and get to where we want to be to 160,000 number. That's why we have some confidence.","This idea about deferring some work in order to start a milestone, we completely, we all understand, we talk about this a lot in these meetings that they attend, we attend, the NRC attend, Bechtel attends. This is a very intentional strategy of people that have built nuclear plants before.","And yeah, not all these hours are required in order to start a system test. But we think keeping to the aggressive schedule really helps us. In fact, some of the testing activities have already uncovered some benefits that will serve us well in the future in reducing hours. So sure, it's a balance, so we accept the point. But we think we're doing the right thing.","Ali Agha","Got it. Secondly, just to clarify, the fact that you know you came in this quarter well above what you were budgeting for the quarter, was that all or primarily weather related. Given weather was so much better than normal or was there something else that caused you to come in so much better than your original expectation?","Tom Fanning","I think the underlying utilities are doing great. Let me just kind of start there. These folks you know, we've had - and not to throw at anybody else, but if you look at resilience issues around the United States, whether there's temporary blackouts or things like that. We've had a reasonably hot summer, particularly in a month where we didn\u2019t expect it, May. The resilience of our system, the investments we've made over the years and we'll continue to make have proven to benefit our customers like nobody's business. And so, we're very happy I think with the operation of our system.","And let me just also say, we don't often talk about it on these earnings call, but things like our ability to deliver service, Georgia Power for example, leads in customer service and customer satisfaction, we think that is a wonderful indicator of support for the hard work our thousands of employees do every day.","The other thing I would say is recall this $0.80 per share that we did, did not include, I don't know $0.07 of divested earnings, Gulf Power doesn't include Puerto Rico that added considerably to last year. So on all fronts our franchise businesses are doing wonderfully well.","Ali Agha","Okay. Last question. As you pointed out through the first half weather normalized sales are down about 1% or so. If I recall correctly, I think the budget for the year has been flat to up 1%. Are you re-looking at that or are you still confident you can get there?","Andrew Evans","No I think we are very confident with the projection that we laid out. I've have to look at whether normalization over a longer time period. We've had I think two exaggerated quarters in that - I think it was probably February where we were with - it was considerably warmer than normal and now May it was in opposite season considerably warmer than normal. And so these two things tend to have - serve an exaggerating effect on our estimates of weather adjusted normal sales. But still pretty confident given the strength of the underlying economies here, job growth, residential and migration that would be in the right range for the year.","Tom Fanning","We\u2019re gratified with customer growth. The other thing I would just add, what we see in some of these results is timing, a onetime effect, like the industrial that being down 2%. We really think kind of going forward that\u2019s a number more like 1%, absent these effects. So look it's very clear that we're in a little bit of a plateauing on the economy and I think that's why the Fed is kind of thinking about what they're doing.","But by the other token, our companies are managing expenses under Drew's leadership and the execution at the operating company level. We are delivering terrific results. Georgia Power for example, top quartile you know, O&M right now.","Andrew Evans","So we're able to accommodate whatever variances we see, be it weather or be it in organic sales.","Ali Agha","Understood. Thank you.","Andrew Evans","Thank you, sir.","Operator","Our following question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, Tom. Hey, on the SPI Directs Performance Index slide, what's the reason for the uptick since May you know, when you look at that and how it's creeping up there? I'm just wondering what the - what's driving that?","Tom Fanning","Let me get to the slide. Oh yes. Obviously, it's 4th of July. We did hit our numbers on that week.","Michael Weinstein","So you expect it to come back down.","Tom Fanning","Yeah, yeah.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. All right. And on the ARO\u2026","Tom Fanning","And Michael, just\u2026","Michael Weinstein","Go ahead.","Tom Fanning","Real quick, I'm sorry. If you heard in the script we talked about last three weeks. That was to exclude the 4th of July.","Michael Weinstein","Got you.","Tom Fanning","And remember the statistic we're showing here is a four week average. So it's picking up 4th of July.","Michael Weinstein","Right. Hey, on the IRP and the IRO, and also the rate case. How much flexibility do you have in spending on coal ash remediation going forward, given public comments so far on the rate case and the filing amounts and concerns that you know about how the rate filings was a larger amount, just wondering if there is flexibility in how you can spread out that spending over time?","Tom Fanning","Yes. So Drew, let's tag team on this because Drew's got this great stuff, but using executive privilege I am going to lead the away. Georgia hasn't had an increase since 2013, that was the increase they deferred, and now it's 2019. So when you think about the increase that Georgia Power is talking about, the frame of reference is kind of nine years. In other words, last six years no increase, three years looking forward. So think about the increase they're talking about in the context of nine years, okay.","And so what they've done in order to deliver results is manage O&M. They're now top quartile easily and some other things. You have some kind of interesting data points.","Andrew Evans","Well, to your point around the rate case, if you look at the impact the customer share of wallet and burden to bill rates have been basically unchanged over that eight or 10 year period with the rate increases have been proposed it's I think less than 1% in total over that.","Michael your question really related to - related partially to ARO, what its implications might be for rate. I would tell you that the $10 billion program that we have today is today's best estimate of how that investment will unfold. The chances of it being overly accurate today are slim. We will modify that plan as we proceed and so the timing of expenditure will change over the period, the total amount will change.","Recovery is the same feature which is we have a lot of flexibility and I think the Commission and Georgia Power are considering different ways for recovery that will reduce - ultimately reduce the burden on customers.","Tom Fanning","And I think Drew raises the right point there. There is a balance between what we must do and we have an agreed upon plan with the state EPD and the whole thing. So we have a what and then as Drew correctly points out, we have a how out of recovery. So that will be the subject of the rate case and we're certainly not going to get in front of that. So that will be worked out in a constructive manner I'm confident.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. Okay. Thank you very much.","Tom Fanning","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our following question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Michael. How are you?","Michael Lapides","I'm fine Tom. Thanks for taking the question. Real quick. You're doing a lot of fleet transformation with all the renewables with the extra gigawatt of coal retirements. How are you thinking about, A, how this impacts the need for incremental transmission across the system. And B, when you think you'll start seeing similar fleet transformation and in your other large jurisdiction in Alabama?","Tom Fanning","Yeah. So that's a terrific question. In fact, part of the IRP, one of the reasons why we love our IRP process in the Southeast is, we are able to iterate around generation and transmission decisions, that's really difficult in the so-called organized markets.","In fact, included in some of the closures and potential flexibility in the future is in fact an iteration around some major transmission projects. For example, I know that whether we do it you know in the next three years or down the road, building some more transmission east of plant Bowen, which is kind of Northeast Georgia that we want to go east of there to bolster our system makes a lot of sense.","For years we have talked about transmission improvements along the bottom south of our system. So let's - we used to call it a southern highway, that it kind of shows increases from Mississippi across Alabama used to go into the Gulf. So the iteration around generation transmission - generation decisions and transmission is really important. What was the other part of your question?","Michael Lapides","Well, just Alabama, when do you see happening playing out - when do you see a sizable, because if you think about your fleet transformation so far it's been mostly Georgia. When do you see that playing out in Alabama if it all?","Tom Fanning","Well, so here's - Alabama has a different process than Georgia. Alabama did announce that they are going to retire a thousand megawatts of coal and they have been under a public process to procure more gas.","We think that they will undertake a process that may give more clarity by the end of this year. But that really is between Alabama and their commission. So you just stay tuned.","Michael Lapides","Okay. And then a little bit of a housekeeping one for Drew. Drew, it looks like the tax rate in the quarter was pretty low, if I just look at the financials in your - in your packet, like sub 15%. I'm just trying to think about - you know, how to think about the second half of the year in tax rates?","Andrew Evans","I think that I'll have to probably answer your question in more detail when we get into the boiler room. But the two biggest drivers I think probably were ITC amortizations and current period and tax impacts in the sale of subsidiaries. I don't think that our rate will be significantly different on a normalized base system what we experienced last year.","In fact, there was a gain on the Triton investment that had the biggest impact on our effective tax rate in the current period and we recorded some gain on investment tax credits from the sale of Nacogdoches. So a little bit modulated by the cleanup of the portfolio that we've been doing.","Tom Fanning","And I guess we've announced it really, but we did sell off another piece of business at PowerSecure. A utility services business.","Andrew Evans","That just helps sharpen our focus on that.","Michael Lapides","Got it, guys. I'll follow up offline. Thank you, Tom, Drew for responding.","Tom Fanning","Always great being with you. Thank you.","Operator","Our following question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Hey good morning. How are you?","Sophie Karp","Morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking my question.","Tom Fanning","Oh, delighted.","Sophie Karp","I wanted to maybe switch gears a little bit and ask you about the Mississippi. It's been kind of quiet, but there's been some changes in the commission and you're going to go in for a rate case later this year. I guess, what are your expectations about how this jurisdiction is going to shape up going forward if any and so what are you seeing there on the ground?","Tom Fanning","Yeah, I think it's been quiet and that's good for everybody I think. You know, Mississippi continues to regain its footing after the plant Ratcliffe, Kemper County event. And you know, I would say since then we got the gas plant in place in a very constructive way.","So I would say - I would determine it really since then it's been very constructive. We look forward to a fair process and certainly we're not going to get in front of what's going to be filed and what they'll think about it. But I think it's been very good.","Sophie Karp","But your framework there has been in place for a really long time correct?","Tom Fanning","Oh, absolutely, gosh, believe it or not. The performance evaluation plan they modified over the years, but it was put in place about the time that I was CFO there, which goes back to 1993, I think is when I came there from Australia. So it's about that old 25 years.","Sophie Karp","Yeah. And should \u2013 do you also think that this kind of framework stays in place and maybe just the changes around the edges or should we...","Tom Fanning","Yeah. In fact, you know, what, you look around all of our three electric utilities have different processes and all of them are terrific. That performance evaluation plan is great. The RAC plan and Alabama has been great and the kind of three year process we go through Georgia has been great.","And when I say great here's what I mean. At the end of the day they produce terrific results for customers and look at it, we've got among the lowest prices in the United States. I think Georgia now has more than 15% better than the national average. Customer satisfaction is high. We're able to handle kind of very thorny issues together with our regulator to produce great business results, that helps everybody. So while each of these mechanisms are different each of them work well.","Sophie Karp","Got it. Thank you.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Andrew Evans","Thanks, Sophie.","Operator","Our following question comes from line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Christopher. How are you?","Chris Turnure","Good morning, Tom and Andrew. Just a modeling question for you following up on some of the prior ones on the quarter itself. Are there any items included in your adjusted EPS that we could consider not recurring for next year? And in particular on the power or the gas side?","Andrew Evans","In ex- items, I guess is your question. So ex-items were dominated by the gain on the sale of Mankato, Nacogdoches wholesale gas services are backed out. And then we had small charge for plants under construction which would be largely Kemper. Non-repeatable next year I think would probably be acquisition disposition integration impacts, but we will continue to back out wholesale services I think in the future.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Chris. I thought you were saying in our adjusted earnings were there anything onetime or...","Chris Turnure","Yeah. That's what I was driving at within the adjusted number.","Tom Fanning","Yeah. Not that I'm aware of. I mean, other than what we talk about to you is I mean, weather junk like that. But no\u2026","Chris Turnure","No smaller gains on sales or anything in there?","Tom Fanning","And one time as we tend to push those off into the ex-portion that Drew was talking about.","Andrew Evans","Yeah, probably one of the bigger deltas relates to income we did have in \u201818 and didn't have a \u201819 which would be revenue from Puerto Rico. We did settle some small litigation in Southern Power about $12 million, so less than a penny, about a penny a share, but\u2026","Tom Fanning","Nothing significant.","Andrew Evans","Nothing significant.","Chris Turnure","Okay. Great. And then one other question on Vogtle, among the others here I think you were successfully able to hire 400 people I think for the day shift in June and then your goal was to shift them over tonight. Any more recent commentary for your progress in the month of July?","Tom Fanning","Yeah. Well, here's the - yeah. Let me give you the breakdown on, remember as you point out and as we start adding people, most of that was going to go to the night shift. And in fact we've added a thousand people since the last call. And in fact, when you think about the percentage differences between where we were and where we are, I wanted to say we were, gosh 75, 25 day tonight. Now we're kind of 65, 45. So all of these additional personnel are going largely to the night shift. And so you know there is productivity issues and all that. But boy that's working well.","And just to give you a quick commentary, we're pretty well done on pipe fares. As we've got all that we need. Electricians we're on track. We have what we need today, we'll probably add a few more. But we're very happy with where we are on staffing.","Chris Turnure","Great. Thank you for the color.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Operator","The following question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Andrew. How are you?","Andrew Weisel","Very good, thanks. Good morning.","Tom Fanning"," Good morning.","Andrew Weisel","A follow on question on the Georgia IRP around coal sales or coal retirements - excuse me. Obviously that was part of the package, but obviously also some other people wanted additional coal plant retirements. Could you explain the strategy behind keeping some of those other units like Bowen 1 and 2 for example and is that economics versus reliability or how should we think about the potential for additional coal plant retirements?","Tom Fanning","Yeah. So there again that\u2019s well-defined regulatory process in which to evaluate that. But it really goes to two big things, economics and then reliability. It is very clear that other forms of generation, regulatory environment around coal and carbon and everything else, that there's a lot of pressure on any sort of carbon emitting type of generation, clearly coal. And so therefore coal will continue to be under pressure over time. You can't just shut those things down and we demonstrated some of that in the IRP.","When you think about Bowen 1 and 2 just for your example, it is lower in the dispatch curve than it has been over time, not because of cheap plentiful natural gas, it's continued to be pressure probably as we add renewables and a variety of other things and as we add nuclear. The notion of this inactive reserve taking it out of dispatch as a matter of resilience is a discussion point, right now. Nobody agreed to do that.","But I think given the notion of the increasing importance of resilience and let me be clear, IRPs are founded under decades long mathematical practices that deal with the cost of outages and reliability, resilience and reliability says this is how my system acts under normal conditions, including weather variances and normal outages and a variety of other things.","Resilience really goes to the idea of how my system operates under abnormal conditions, whether that's a hurricane or a snowstorm or a cyber attack or what have we had a major interruption in a gas pipeline. Are we thinking proactively skating to where the puck will be on ways to manage significant disruptions that we don't currently anticipate happening.","And so that is where we get into these ideas like standby, I mean I'm sorry, inactive reserve. These are very constructive conversations that we're having with the staff and with the commission. And really I'm trying to elevate that conversation nationally. These are important issues we need to deal with.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Thank you. If I could squeeze in one follow-up. On this third quarter guidance, will you remind me your practice? Does that assume normal weather or does that reflect the favorable hot July weather we have seen?","And then kind of as a follow-up to that for the full year, should we - I know you'll update guidance on the next quarterly call, but are there anything we should consider that might be an offset to the favorable weather? Or would it be fair to assume you're trending toward the high end of the guidance range? ","Andrew Evans","Our guidance or expectation for the - our expectation for the third quarter does assume normal weather. I think that's the simplest answer and you know as we've seen great volatility month to month and projection versus actual I think that's probably our best process for prospective planning.","Tom Fanning","There's a joke upon this, I got to tell a joke. There\u2019s a joke among the CFO. I used to be CFO, remember. There was a CFO of Mississippi Power and we go through these meetings where Drew just - they all work together and beat each other up about what the right numbers are.","And Frances Turnage, CFO of Mississippi Power one time said that all of our positive variances are temporary and all our negative variances are permanent and that's how she sets her numbers. But in general, Drew and team work really hard to get a good number for you guys.","Andrew Evans","And you know, it's just not an appropriate quarter for us to update our expectations today. Let's get through the summer. The bulk of the summer heating season and we'll be able to give you a really good sense of how we think the year is going to come out.","Tom Fanning","And you guys didn't ask a question, but I'll go ahead and answer the question. When Drew gives you the third quarter estimate that implies something for the fourth quarter. If you look historically we think we can handle that pretty easily.","Andrew Weisel","Great. Thank you, guys.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Operator","Our following question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Hello, good morning. Thanks for joining us.","Charles Fishman","Hey, just one question on slide 16, generation mix. Tom, if we look out 10 years and let's assume natural gas stays cheap. If I look at the right hand pie chart, nuclear obviously up, renewables up, coal down. What happens in natural gas?","Tom Fanning","Yeah. Oh this is great stuff. So there is actually a lot of degrees of freedom in that question, right. So 10 years. But let me give you this. We have - in fact, this goes back to my time as COO. Oh so I'm telling old man stories now. This is 15 years ago, 20 years ago, but 15 years ago.","We started using probability weighted way to think about carbon prices or the cost of carbon. And we do essentially a three by three matrix of high medium and low gas prices, high medium and low coal, high medium and low cost of carbon. So when we do an IRP we actually have prices of carbon that go into the probability estimate and we come up with in probability terms a dominant solution, that comes up as the IRP.","The carbon prices we use our zero, $10 and $20 a tonne. It's very easy to manipulate that, manipulate meaning change it and put in new input that would say, what happens at $50 a tonne. And so we go through all sorts of stress analysis about that.","Here's kind of the big variances, my sense and this is my judgment today no guarantee, you're going to continue to see low cheap gas forever. I mean, that's why we bought gas and that's why gas has been a great solution for us.","So you're going to see gas migrate north, you're going to see renewables improve significantly, you're going to see nuclear with the addition of Vogtle 3 and 4 remain reasonably constant. And then over time you will see coal diminish. I think that's a matter of economics. It's a matter of a whole lot of thing. Now whether coal goes away from a capacity standpoint or just diminishes from an energy standpoint goes to these resiliency strategies I've been talking to.","So who knows? This is where we made the commitment, we were first out of the gate, I think to say low to no carbon. How natural gas continues to stay in the mix depends upon at least one or two big technology innovations that we're working on.","One deals with how are we going to manage the carbon atoms that come off hydrocarbon kind of looking fuel type. If we could continue to have success in capturing carbon and ultimately doing something positive with it then you'll see natural gas be really robust for a long period of time.","The other one is storage. If you succeed in storage beyond kind of the lithium ion technology we see today you may see a much bigger penetration of renewables. So those are kind of the big swing points.","Charles Fishman","Okay. Fascinating. Thank you.","Tom Fanning","Yes, sir.","Operator","Our following question comes from the line of Phil Covello with ExodusPoint. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Thanks for joining us.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, it's actually Andy.","Tom Fanning","Oh, Andy. How are you?","Unidentified Analyst","Hopefully you're still thankful.","Tom Fanning","Yeah, well you know, pretty much.","Unidentified Analyst","Just very, very quick numbers question. So just - so the $10 that you're giving for the third quarter, I guess the trailing 12 months would be like 285 because it was like $0.25 in the fourth quarter. So again you know, assuming normal weather, what drives the fourth quarter to like $0.40 or something like that? What are the drivers?","Andrew Evans","This is Drew. If you look at the last five years sort of the modern Southern era with gas, we've been sort of bimodal in our reported results something in the quarter to $0.50 range. And what has been modal is really whether in the third quarter and its impact ultimately on earned ROEs. And so as we move in - move through the third quarter we'll have a better sense of where we will be in terms of earn versus allowed.","In the fourth quarter we\u2019ll either be sort of the supplement to a poor weather quarter in the third or it will be reflective of large reserves taken for customer refund in the fourth. And so I think that's kind of how we think about third - the interplay of third and fourth quarters. I think what we've set up is very consistent with our experience over the last four or five years.","Tom Fanning","In other words if we've essentially had very beneficial weather in the third quarter that produces over earnings. And therefore, we have less earnings in the fourth quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","So that\u2019s what happened last\u2026","Tom Fanning","And what you're seeing - and where we didn't have that kind of weather we tended to have less sharing and therefore better fourth quarter results. And Andy just to give you in \u201817 we earned $0.51 and in \u201815 we earned $0.44.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That's perfect answer. Thank you very much.","Operator","That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Sir, are there any closing remarks.","Tom Fanning","And I promise not to talk about the greatest Tour de France in the last 10 years. You know, it's interesting this is a important period I think for me personally. This is my - the anniversary of my first earnings call with the company after I took over from the great Art Beattie, and I would expect a call from him this afternoon.","If I think about what our conversation was centered around last year really was whether or not completion of Vogtle 3 and 4 would occur. And I'm really sort of enjoy the fact that that we've moved on from that conversation I think because of structural improvements that we've put in ourselves, in terms of the commitment that we've made to you know advancing the construction. We've had major milestones met over the last year and we've converted a labour force largely from iron and concrete into pipe and to wire.","If I look at what's ahead of us, we've got a couple of major milestones that we want people to focus on. I think we get a little bit overly myopic in terms of hourly rates or Canadian visas and it's promising I think that we've moved on and think about major milestones and their turnover.","As we talk through this with investors, I think we're very open about the fact that we maintain reserves of both time and cost that we think will allow us to meet our expectations with the commission which ultimately is for completion in November of 21 and 22. And I think we're in good shape to meet those commitments. It's been a - I think a very important year in terms of the success of the company in advancing that effort.","Andrew Evans","Hey they only cherry I'll put on that one is this, you know, we said a year ago that 2019 would be an awfully important year. And if you look at the first half of this year, it's a great report card, lot of work ahead, nobody's counting any chickens at this point, but son of a gun you got to be happy with the first six months and we're happy with what we think lies ahead.

Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company, and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call.

The slides we will discuss during today's call may be reviewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. Our premier, state-regulated electric and gas utilities and Southern Power performed well during the third quarter and they remain on track to deliver on their targets for 2017 on an adjusted basis. Before Art provides a complete overview of our financial results, I'd like to first provide updates on what's happened since our last call.","First, for Plant Vogtle. On August 31, Georgia Power filed VCM 17 with the Georgia Public Service Commission, which in line with our co-owners, recommends completion of Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power expects Unit 3 to be in service by November 2021 and Unit 4 to be in service by November 2022 with an estimated total cost for Georgia Power for both units of $8.8 billion.","Factoring in expected payments under the Toshiba parent guarantee, the new total net cost of the project is estimated to be $7.1 billion, which is an increase of $1.4 billion over their previous estimate. In the 17th VCM filing, Georgia Power is requesting the PSC to confirm that: one, the revised cost and schedule estimates are reasonable; two, the 2016 prudence stipulation remains in effect; three, the certified cost is not a cap; and four, Georgia Power is not the guarantor of the Toshiba parent guarantee. A schedule for all of the proceedings has been approved and a decision by the PSC is expected in early February 2018.","Georgia Power continues to work on mitigating project risks and mitigating the overall cost of the project to its customers. On September 29, Georgia Power received a conditional commitment for an additional $1.67 billion from the Department of Energy to expand the Vogtle 3 and 4 loan guarantee program. Final issuance of the additional loan guarantees is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions and is not expected to occur prior to the end of the first quarter of 2018. Including this commitment, the total loan guarantees are expected to provide more than $500 million in present value benefit to Georgia Power customers. On October 2, Georgia Power and the co-owners received the first and largest payment from Toshiba under its parent guarantee obligation, totaling $300 million of which $137 million is Georgia Power's share.","Earlier today, we received the second scheduled payment. While we anticipate Toshiba will fulfill its remaining obligations over the next three-plus years, Georgia Power and the co-owners have been actively evaluating and preparing for the option of monetizing its rights in the remaining Toshiba guarantee payments and its bankruptcy claims against Westinghouse. Any monetization transaction is subject to DoE review and approval under Georgia Power's Loan Guarantee Agreement. We believe the process could be complete before the end of this year, effectively eliminating this risk for the owners and our customers.","Turning to construction, the primary success factor for this project going forward will be productivity in the field. Throughout the transaction of the site from Westinghouse control to Southern Nuclear control, productivity trended in the right direction and we have even seen that trend continue in support of the updated schedule. This continued improvement can be attributed to several factors, including improved leadership in the field, improved work package management and continuous monitoring and communication of performance. A contract with Bechtel to serve as the prime construction contractor was finalized two weeks ago and we see another incremental step towards improved site performance.","Let's move now to our recent announcement regarding Southern Company Gas. A few weeks ago, Southern Company Gas entered into asset purchase agreement with South Jersey Industries for the utility operating assets of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas. We anticipate closing these transactions by the end of the third quarter of 2018 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.","The total proceeds of $1.7 billion will be used to reduce external financing needs for both Southern Company Gas and Southern Company, and we expect the transaction to support our EPS growth and credit metric objectives. We are gratified to have a buyer like South Jersey Industries, which is committed to providing the same level of outstanding service and reliability that Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas customers are accustomed to receiving today. We believe this is a value-maximizing transaction for all parties involved.","I'll turn the call over now to Art for a financial and economic review.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials released this morning, we reported earnings for the third quarter of 2017 of $1.07 per share, compared to earnings of $1.18 per share in the third quarter of 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we reported earnings of $0.35 per share compared with earnings of $2.40 a share for the same period in 2016. Excluding the charges associated with the Kemper project, Wholesale Gas Services, acquisition and integration costs, as well as other items described in our earnings materials, earnings for the third quarter of 2017 and the nine-month period ended September 2017 were $1.12 per share and $2.51 per share respectively. This compares with $1.27 and $2.62 per share for the same periods in 2016.","Major earnings drivers to our adjusted results for the third quarter of 2017 included retail revenue effects at Southern Company's state-regulated electric businesses, offset by milder weather, timing of Southern Power tax credits, increased interest expense and increased shares. As for the earnings estimate for the next quarter, we estimate that we will earn $0.46 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, which would have us at $2.97 per share or just above the middle of our range for the year-end 2017 on an adjusted basis.","Moving now to an economic review of the third quarter. Economic growth remains encouraging, both nationally and in our service territories. U.S. has now experienced 83 consecutive months of job growth and employment, and our footprint continues to outpace the national average. The Southern Company system is experiencing strong residential customer growth at a rate of 1%, with the most robust growth occurring in Florida and Georgia.","In the commercial sector, we continue to see expansion of square footage across our footprint including office space, warehouses and data centers. Offsetting these positive trends is the ongoing adoption of new technology and energy-efficient equipment and appliances, especially HVAC and lighting, in both the residential and commercial sectors.","In addition, the advancement of digital commerce continues to negatively impact prospects for growth in the commercial sector. Nationally, economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in September at the fastest pace in 13 years, and the ISM Manufacturing Index climbed to 60.8, its highest reading since May of 2004.","In the Southern Company footprint, we have seen electricity sales increase in primary metals and chemicals, with 6 of our top 10 industrial sectors showing positive momentum. Economic development activity in our service territories has been robust. Daimler has announced plans to expand its Alabama operations with a $1 billion investment in infrastructure and in 600 new jobs at its Global Logistics Center, all of which is expected to support the manufacture of electric SUVs by 2020.","In Georgia, the Anthem Technology Center is expected to add 1,800 new IT jobs with the potential for 3,000 jobs over time, and online retailer ASOS will create 1,600 new jobs in its fulfillment center. Looking ahead, we anticipate that the rebuilding and repair work associated by the damage sustained from recent hurricanes should help sustain economic growth in our territories through the end of 2017 and early 2018, and automakers are already reporting higher sales as residents of Texas and Florida replace vehicles destroyed by flooding.","Let me now update you on our financing plans for the remainder of 2017 and provide you insights into 2018 and beyond. At our 2016 Analyst Day, we outlined cumulative equity needs of approximately $1.4 billion from 2017 through 2021. Much has changed since last October and our equity needs for the remainder of 2017 and forward continue to evolve. For 2017, while our Kemper charges generated an incremental $1 billion need for equity to rebalance our capital structure, the pending sale of Elizabethtown Gas and Elkton Gas as well as the potential monetization of the remaining Toshiba obligation have greatly mitigated that incremental need.","Here are a few other key drivers expected to change our equity needs in the future. First, Southern Power secured tax equity for the Cactus Flats wind project announced in July and will likely explore the same financing vehicle for future renewable projects. The use of third-party tax equity is expected to significantly reduce the amount of debt in common equity deployed by Southern Power over the forecast horizon. Moreover, the use of third party tax equity is not expected to diminish Southern Power's contribution to Southern Company's EPS growth.","Additionally, we are considering launching a process to sell a minority equity interest in Southern Power's portfolio of solar assets. We are very proud of the leadership position we have taken in utility-scale solar across the U.S., and we continue to view these assets as an integral part of Southern Power and Southern Company. However, we believe this portfolio has tremendous value in the market, considering the quality of long-dated contracts tied to the underlying assets.","Selling up to one-third of our interest in the portfolio represents a clear opportunity to extract value from the market and redeploy capital in a manner that further supports our overall financial objectives. We will likely initiate a sale process some time before year-end with a potential closing in mid-2018. The updated cost and schedule for Vogtle 3 and 4 will also have an impact on our longer term financing plans.","While the potential monetization of the Toshiba obligation would greatly reduce project risk and mitigate near-term financing needs, it would not have a significant impact on our longer term financing plan. We do, however, expect increased debt and equity needs for Vogtle 3 and 4 as a result of the incremental $1.4 billion of capital costs. Any incremental equity from Vogtle's change in cost and schedule will be part of Georgia Power's retail capital structure.","Finally, as we've alluded to in the past, we are actively evaluating opportunities to modernize our basic business operations as our customers' needs evolve. Our objective as always is to improve the way we serve our customers while maintaining affordable prices. We anticipate these initiatives would have the added benefits of strengthening the long-term EPS growth contribution of our state-regulated utilities. These modernization opportunities could increase our long-term funding requirements. We look forward to sharing with you our updated long-term capital and financing plans as well as our long-term EPS growth projections on our fourth quarter call in February.","I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks Art. In closing, we continue to see Southern Company Gas performing exactly as expected, complementing our outstanding electric operations including our competitive generation subsidiary, Southern Power. In our state jurisdictions, we continue to foster constructive regulatory relationships as evidenced by several positive rate outcomes this year. As we look ahead to 2018 and beyond, we are well positioned to deliver value to our investors over the long-term.","Finally, I would be remiss not to mention the catastrophic weather events that occurred during the third quarter, including Hurricane Irma and its impact on customers in our service region especially those in Georgia and Alabama. We experienced roughly 1.7 million outages system-wide that we were able to restore service in less than five days for customers who could accept service. Thanks to the close collaboration and tireless efforts of line crews and staff from all of our operating companies as well as others across the electric utility industry.","Prior to that, we were pleased to contribute to efforts to help restore power outside of our own service territory in wake of damage incurred by Hurricane Harvey. Both of these recent restoration efforts represent an unprecedented collaboration between investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities and co-ops, along with tremendous support and cooperation for the United States Government. As a matter of fact, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, was a valued participant in all of our daily teleconferences, offering unfailing help at every opportunity.","Thanks once again for joining us this afternoon. We will now move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Good afternoon guys.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Hi Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Can I ask some questions with regard to the financing plan? Is the reason why you're not formally updating the plan today, simply sort of trying to give us some direction on puts and takes because we don't know yet about the go, no-go decision on Vogtle and once we get that, you'll be able to sort of lay it out more clearly for us?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes, that, Greg, plus any modernization initiatives that might come about included in the plan or excluded from the plan. There's lots of moving parts yet, so this is just a preview, but we'll give you more to chew on in the next call.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Sale of the minority interest in solar's and the other one. Yeah, we'll have a better idea later.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, right. Because you guys had said relative to Kemper, that you needed a $1 billion of equity this year, but you never said you needed a $1 billion of common stock. You just needed to find a $1 billion of cash, right? So the Elizabethtown deal, that's not going to close till late next year so that's not part of what you need now, but the third-party tax equity, the minority interest sale, the monetization bringing some cash forward from Toshiba, all those things could theoretically severely limit or even maybe eliminate the need for common equity in the short run, right? Or wrong?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","You're correct. We think we can eliminate the need in the short run. The monetization will actually equal itself out over time, but it will certainly help in the short run.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. That was my main question, guys. Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","You're welcome.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Angie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","How are you? I never ask M&A questions, but I will this time around. So, okay. So just bear with me, okay? So you are pursuing your construction of your project in Georgia, the nuclear project. There will be some lessons learned from it.","You, for now, have the 5% earnings growth objective, which could go higher and why not attempt to grow those earnings through an acquisition in South Carolina? You are better positioned than anybody else to potentially offer continued construction of this V.C. Summer project, maybe not now, but in the future, applying some lessons learned from the Vogtle construction. You have an incredible operation track record. There is a utility there that needs help, so just talk me through why that would not be a rational course of events for you guys?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Angie, thanks for the question. Look, I mean you've known us for decades, I bet. You can't really comment on any specific opportunity. As with Elizabethtown, as with AGL, we really pay attention to those being both a disciplined seller and buyer. We use roughly the same kind of threshold, et cetera. And so we'll apply that logic wherever we look and you know that we have an active radar screen. As I've said before in many different earnings calls, and one-on-ones and everything else, these deals are extraordinarily hard to get done.","In order to balance the different objectives, first of customers, then of the companies and all the other external public, any attempt like this is a bit of a long putt. Certainly, time will tell, but I think that's probably my best answer right now.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","There's so many \u2013 especially there, there are so many moving pieces, it's just hard to see through them right now.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Understood. And my second question is, so I understand that there is \u2013 you have partners at the Vogtle project and the DoE needs to opine on the monetization of the Toshiba securitization, Toshiba proceeds. Is that the reason why it's taking longer than what we saw with SCANA?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. As a normal course of financing, that the Toshiba guarantee is a part of the security package, underlying the DoE loan guarantees. And so we have to get a approval of essentially a change in the security package, not only for the existing loans outstanding, but anything new in the new commitment by DoE. OMB has a say in that and it's just taking some time for OMB to process a change in the security package. My belief is that they will get there and we will get this done. It's just taking a little bit of process.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, ma'am. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Paul.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey. Good call. I guess, there still are open regulatory matters in Mississippi. If there were to be any further disallowances as were recommended by some of the intervener parties in that proceeding, should shareholders expect that you would infuse additional equity into Mississippi Power, or is that off the table?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We pretty much said consistently that we're going to protect the financial integrity of Mississippi Power along the way. We'll see what unfolds. The process right now though, Paul, and everybody should understand, in a very painful way, we've taken the gasifier off the table. What's remaining to be evaluated under this rate process is a combined cycle asset that has been delivering round numbers about one-third of the energy to the customers in Mississippi Power, has had a reliability circumstance that is something less than 1% of equivalent outage rate where industry averages maybe three times or more times that. So this is a terrific asset, an economic asset and we expect to be treated fairly.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","And then sort of as a follow-up on that, I mean, under what circumstances would you potentially consider selling Mississippi Power, if any?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, I think I answered that question with Angie's question too, Paul. Listen, in representing the interest of shareholders, we try to be exceedingly disciplined whether we buy or sell, and that goes to companies, that goes to assets, that goes to everything we do. So taking all that into account, what is the best mix of Southern Company assets for the benefit of our long-term growth rate, our risk return profile, ultimately inuring to the benefit of shareholders. That's just the best way to leave that question, I think.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, Tom. How are you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Michael. How are you?","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Hey, do you have any indication as to how the monetization of the payments would be treated by regulators? Is this going to be a refund? Are they looking for refunds? Or are they going to allow you to keep it on the balance sheet and help finance the project?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","We've had discussions with regulators, but there's been no finalization of that. What we would recommend is that they apply it to the construction work in progress balance and that would provide for a rate reduction in their NCCR rate, which would benefit customers in the short run and will accrue AFUDC once we pass this $4.4 billion benchmark.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. The fact that the DoE loan guarantees have this as one of their provisions, does that prevent regulators from trying to even attempt to refund it to customers in some way?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Don't believe so. I think those would all be independent.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, you know the Georgia Commission has had a long track record of constructive regulation for the long-term benefit of customers. I think they'll follow that practice.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to just explore the potential for further cost cutting at the different utility businesses. When we look at the cost structure in some of your utilities, did you see you have some potential there? But I'm just curious, I imagine that's an ongoing thing that you all think about, but is there anything specific that could be under way or that you could be thinking about further in terms of further cutting O&M cost at your utility businesses?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Stephen, I think we should think about a better way to put those actions in context. We call this our modernization plan and largely, what we're doing is displacing O&M with capital. Why is that? What we're able to do now, we've been employing a business model for 100 years or more in the Southeast and what we see are opportunities now because technology is enabling it and because certain customers are requiring it, we're thinking about how to displace a historical practice, for example, in Georgia, being in every small town in the state with perhaps a more modern way to connect with customers.","Interestingly, while we have reduced our local office physical presence in the state of Georgia, we have expanded our points of presence with customers, largely through technology. I think almost four times, I think that's about the right number. And interestingly also, we were very uncertain as to the effect that these changes may have in our customer base. I think last year, Georgia Power was named the most trusted utility in America and so we think those kinds of changes have helped. That's kind of in the customer-facing business. We're also evaluating changes in our generating fleet.","Now, we have a long-term plan that speaks to kind of a transition between now and say, 2050, to the low to no carbon future that thinks about, what do we believe about nuclear, what do we believe about coal, the importance of natural gas infrastructure and renewables, and so you continue to see us exercise the latest thinking on technology improvements to our operation.","The final thing I will say is this business model of making, moving and selling energy up to a meter and then having kind of a relationship where the customer does something with the energy on the other side of the meter and sends us a check every month, is changing. And that is, we have created, I think, a very important, but rather small, at least at this point, option with PowerSecure where in effect, we're taking some small steps what I would call creative destruction. That is creating the make, move and sell on the customer premises, allowing customers more control and we're doing this largely in areas that aren't in the Southeast.","In other words, in the Southeast, we provide customers with the very best reliability, the lowest prices and the best service again in the United States. Once again, I think our top five utilities in customer satisfaction were our five utilities including Southern in that. And I think that's giving us another opportunity to think about the advent of technology in displacing what otherwise has been, what I would call, traditional service.","We continue to seek ways \u2013 as Art mentioned, earlier in response to, I think it was Michael's call, but it was the idea of thinking more and more about how our CapEx budget may be impacted by these modernization efforts, along with that, in order to keep \u2013 because every time you add CapEx, that does an increase to the customer bill, we're going to try and make reductions in O&M to keep customer bills indifferent and still provide better reliability, better cost, better service.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Stephen, one other comment in that regard, if you look at our consolidated as-reported earnings, it shows a pretty hefty increase in non-fuel O&M year-over-year, on a year-to-date basis, but most of that increase is due to the inclusion of Southern Gas, which was not in last year's year-to-date number. So if I look at the electric operating companies' same period, they're down almost 6% year-over-year. So, there are a lot of moving parts in that regard.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And let me throw one more idea. We've done this in years past, haven't talked about it in my recent memory. We have this program in place where we include optionality into our spending. And so recall this year, I want to say this quarter, Art, we had $0.10 of weather year-over-year that was negative. In other words, yes, this year's weather in the third quarter was reasonably normal, but last year, it was exceedingly hot. And I think year-to-date, it was something like $0.23, $0.26, what was it?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","$0.23.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","$0.23. We've been able to maintain our earnings through effective cost management. So I guess, and I'm describing these, there are kind of tactical changes and what I was describing earlier are kind of strategic changes in our cost structure. We've demonstrated year over year, over year, and if you look at almost any company, our actual performance compared to our guidance, we almost always hit it, we can't guarantee that for the future, but if you look at our track record, Southern Company is one of the most predictable and reliable earnings performers in the industry.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very, very helpful. And then just shifting over to Vogtle, I was thinking just about the Bechtel involvement here, and in the case of SCANA, SCANA had an independent assessment done of the project. Have you all engaged any independent assessments of the project? Or has it really just been part of the core team that has been developing the budget, i.e., is there an outside party that's been taking a separate look? Or is it really just been the entire project team sort of together, if that makes sense?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Absolutely, yeah. No along the way, I won't speak to SCANA's issues. Our issues are very clear and that is, we've had Dr. Bill Jacobs, who is the independent monitor for the staff, the commission in Georgia. He's a terrific guy. He's had complete access to everything that we've done. He sits in the meetings with us. Gosh, I mean, all along the way, we've been exceedingly transparent with the commission and through him, with us and the staff as to all of the issues, whether they are cost, whether they are schedule going forward, everything has been on the table really through all of these VCM processes and it's easy, go look at the testimony.","Further, as we went through this decision of whether to go, no-go, we've had lots of independent evaluations. We wanted to really cover this kind of idea soup to nuts, and so we've had a firm called Kenrich involved. PwC made an independent assessment. And of course, Fluor and Bechtel both made independent assessments. The Bechtel assessment ultimately has provided the foundation upon which we have a new commercial relationship where they have significant fees at risk. So, I think we've been, A, exceedingly transparent; and B, we've used that information not only in the past, but using it in the future to create, I think, an effective commercial relationship.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's very helpful, thanks. That's all I had.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yep, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, Tom. Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","First question. I just wanted to be clear as you laid out on slide 16. When you're looking at the equity for this year versus the original $575 million, looks like we will end up at $750 million. Is that accurate, am I reading that right?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And so then again, from a high-level perspective, you laid out the various things that have moved around, the asset sales, potential monetization, et cetera. When you put it all together, I mean is it fair to say the message is that net-net, your needs are likely less than what you were previously thinking or is that not fair to think?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","I think near-term, we have certainly \u2013 as we've said before, near-term, they are a lot less than what we had outlined on our last call. But as you go through time, especially related to the increased cost associated with Vogtle, the potential increase in modernization efforts, which are all part of our upcoming plan that we'll talk more about in February. So, yeah, there's lot of moving parts, but I think you're getting the gist of it. And all that slide was intended to do is to let you know that there's a lot of stuff going on.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah, but those big gas utility sales, the monetization of part of the solar portfolio, the tax equity, these were again, I think, things that you had not been pushing for earlier. So even with the Vogtle increase and with the modernization, it just seems that there's more cash coming in, but maybe that's not the case. I just wanted to be clear if that was (38:51)","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It is clear. There is more cash coming in. I think the other thing that we need to make very clear is that when we think about any marginal equity increases in the future, the vast majority of them will be associated with this modernization effort in the operating companies, so those will represent additions for regulated investments.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And on a separate note, looking at the trends in your weather-normalized sales, you're down 1.3% in the third quarter, but down 1% year-to-date, versus your expectation, but still flat to slightly up for the year. Just wondering how your thoughts have changed both near-term and long-term when you're thinking about your weather-normalized load outlook?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, I think this year is partially explained, at least in the quarter, by the hurricane, which you could technically call it weather, but we don't pull that out specifically and residential weather normal sales were down 2%. I think some of that was influenced by the hurricane and the outages associated with that.","Industrially, it's not been as strong as we thought it would be, but we expect that the momentum for the rest of this year and into 2018 will be stronger. So that number could improve by year-end. When we think about our long-term forecast, we're still kind of in the low \u2013 we always say, I think last year, 0 to 1%, but right now, I think for 2017, we had estimated 0.3%. And we'll update you on our new forecast in our plan in February.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, and those of you that are into the trivia, during the storm we lost in Georgia 9% of our load; for the month 2.2%; for the quarter 0.7%. So that kind of gives you the magnitude of the storm effects.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. Last question. Tom, also wanted to clarify, you were talking about some tactical moves you can make on O&M as storm and other costs come in. Should we view those as temporary, one-time in nature? Is there a permanency attached to that? Or how should we think about the O&M cost increase off the 2017 base going forward?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Ali, we've been doing this really going back \u2013 I mean, I started this back when I was CFO of Mississippi Power, for heaven sakes, but we call it our flexible budgeting system where we identify things that we just have to do, we identify things that we want to do, and then if we had, for example, favorable weather, higher revenues, these are things that we would tee up and only do if we have the opportunity to do them. So we actually kind of fourth-rank O&M and we have a sense of priority over time. And really, since I've been CFO of Southern, so now that goes back, gosh, a decade or more, we do this comprehensively across the system.","And it's enabled us in a very kind of sensible, orderly way where we get biggest bang for the buck to be able to handle variations in the economy and in weather. And we do that up to a confidence level and it's worked exceedingly well. Interestingly, with the gives and takes of weather, some years are hotter and some years aren't, we're able to satisfy what we think is a normalized O&M spending over a period of time. So some years it's up, some years it's down, and overall we've been able to deliver the results we need. And the demonstration of that is this reliability we have, the customer satisfaction we have, and the fact that we maintain low rate through this period. It's been exceedingly, exceedingly beneficial.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, sir, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, Tom. Thank you guys for taking my question. One on Vogtle and then one on the gas business. On Vogtle, you've still got multiple years of construction left before you complete the project. Whether it be a project management or be it your contract with Bechtel or others, how do you protect Georgia Power and Georgia Power's partners from continuing to have even more project delays and even more cost inflation on the project?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, number one, a lot of the variance in the estimate is already taken out. In other words, 95% of the equipment is already on-site. We have a healthy contingency included in the estimate, not only in cost contingency but also schedule contingency. We have incentive structures in the commercial relationship with Bechtel. I think Bechtel has given us an improved productivity set of metrics, which are all showing us since we've taken over the site from Westinghouse and Fluor that they're all headed in the right direction. And that is based on a schedule that calls for six months of contingency. So, in other words, if you think about it, the filing we're making, it's kind of a 29-month schedule extension. We're providing our own metrics for kind of a 23-month; therefore, a six-month contingency schedule. All of those things right now are pointing in the right direction.","The real key to our success going forward and being able to hit these numbers really is going to go to commodity type of equipment and wire and pipes and stuff like that, but most importantly, the efficiency of labor at the site. The other thing I'll just say is that this company, me personally, have had a terrific relationship with Sean McGarvey over the years. The U.S. Building Trades has been a terrific partner in executing Vogtle 3 and 4. They were enormous supporters of ours through this very turbulent period with Westinghouse, and I think they understand that their ability to execute in a favorable way is critical to our overall success. And I believe that everything they can do to help in that endeavor will be done. So if you line up kind of commercial incentives, improved metrics, the type of work, the kind of cooperation we're having with the skilled labor on-site, I think we're feeling pretty good, but those are kinds of big variables.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And when you think about the commercial metrics, and I don't recall what you put in the public domain on this, is it simply there's upside for Bechtel to finish the project on time and either on budget or even below budget, or is there sharing in the downside where if there are incremental project cost creeps due to inflation or just being able to execute a challenging project schedule is there downside for them where they share in the downside along with Georgia Power, Oglethorpe, and the other owners?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Michael, no. We think we've taken good estimate that allow for plenty of contingency. Their incentive is essentially half of their fee that is tied to both cost and schedule performance.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. I want to change topic a little bit to the gas midstream business. I mean, it's been a while since you bought half of SONAT from Kinder, and just curious about whether you're seeing offshoot opportunities now that you've had that exposure, and obviously since you've had AGL for a little bit of time as well, are you seeing offshoot opportunities in the Southeast where there's a potential need for it to move incremental gas, and it requires a midstream solution and you might be well positioned to partake in that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So we have looked at some other things. We continue to get those questions. Gas infrastructure is another one of the so-called prominent solutions with the technology revolution provided by directional drilling and fracking and when you just look at the energy values, it looks as if gas is going to be around for a long, long time. And then we're seeing these kind of new opportunities we've done with Bloom, which is a gas feed. We have looked at some other gas pipelines in Georgia that we can speak to, but so far the kind of big interstate efforts, they haven't hit our thresholds. We did have a placeholder in the original SONAT obligations. It was over $200 million. I want to say $240 million or so that dealt with an expansion to the Southern Natural Gas system through Fairburn, Georgia. So we've done that. We have expanded even beyond our initial investment. Southern Gas already has their own kind of projects underway, and we're executing on those. The big other ones are kind of still out there and I think people are still trying to figure out how to get them done.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. And the only reason I asked that question is now that one of the major nuclear projects doesn't look like it's going to go forward in South Carolina, it seems that that's a state that's going to start utilizing a lot more gas-fired generation than maybe it previously had and it's had a lot of very, very strong gas LDC demand over the last two to three years, two to four years. And at some point, there will come a need to move gas in the South Carolina. And it strikes me, you're one of the three opportunities to do it. Either SONAT goes further east or Transco has an incremental lateral or ACP comes down. I just didn't know if it's premature and kind of the cycle of all these things to even be thinking about stuff like that.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Michael, that's a fascinating question and the way that we prefer to think about that is kind of as a region, how do we think this moves? Thinking about that question and its implication for just South Carolina may not be the optimal answer.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciate it.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking our call. I just want to \u2013 on equity, your slide says the near-term needs are greatly mitigated and I think in Greg's question, you kind of endorsed the word eliminated or even said it, but does near-term mean 2018, or is it just 2017? It strikes me, you've kind of done the equity you were planning in 2017. So presumably it means 2018, but I want to make sure I'm right on that.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. There are some details yet that have to be filled in and we'll give you on the next call, but I think you're thinking about it right. 2017 and then a lot of 2018 will be mitigated as well. We'll just have to wait and see until all the moving parts kind of settle down a little bit.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Art. And then ...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And that source of equity and CapEx on the other side, we continue on the modernization efforts that are core to utilities.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. And then just as we tie these things together, I mean, you obviously withdrew the slide you had last quarter that showed the step-down for Kemper but then the 5% growth that you reiterated. Assuming that you're still \u2013 and then it was suggested in another question that you're pointing to the same, that or higher. Just you didn't say anything to that. I was just curious whether you're endorsing that concept or...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, we are where we were.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We are where we were, Jonathan. We're still on a 5% long-term trajectory. Of course, we'll update all this in the \u2013 whatever it is, the early February call next year.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just finally on Vogtle, thank you for the productivity metrics that you're showing. It's very helpful, but can you give us a little insight sort of behind that summary number? Are there some subsets of that or do they all look similar or anything you can provide some extra color there?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, I think, Jonathan...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I think you said...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I think you want to focus on where our critical path issues are and I think you would define that as the power block. That would be the nuclear island and the turbine building, and that's where we'll focus most keenly on productivity because those are the most important aspects of the unit in order to meet the schedules that we've outlined. And right now, we're on goal with all those metrics, but you're right, there are different approaches to different aspects of construction around the site.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And it's a fascinating question as we sit through every two weeks or so in these project meetings. A lot of improving the pace of work is involved with opening up different work fronts. And if you look at our site compared, for example, to other sites, you will see kind of broader expansion, which will ultimately help us in a variety of fronts, not only just putting concrete and rebar and iron on the ground, but also in the regulatory process as we kind of streamline (53:30) and a variety of other things. So Art's right. I think the critical path for us right now is the nuclear island, but we're opening up a great deal of flexibility by moving on these other fronts, and that provides us a great deal of flexibility going forward in maintaining schedule.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, and to make sure I understand the metric on slide six and your comment just before that it includes contingency. So if you were to hold that metric around 1, you'd effectively bring the plant on six months early. Is that ...?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's a 23-month schedule, that's right. And round numbers, fellows, correct me here, but I think if we were to bring it on in 29 months, this is around a 1.4 metric. So if you're below 1.4, you're not eating into any sort of contingency.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you, Tom. All right. And I guess just finally, I think weren't we supposed to hear about the fire up of the Sanmen AP1000 by now? I was curious if you guys have any insight into what may or may not be going on there?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Jonathan. We know of no real technical reason why they haven't loaded fuel. We can only surmise that it's just governmental approvals that they are waiting on.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Jonathan, excuse me, let me just be very clear. 1.4 is equal to a 29-month schedule, 1.0 is equal to a 23-month schedule. If you're in between 1 and 1.4, that means you're in between 23 months and 29 months. I hope that's obvious, but just want to be very clear.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hey, how is it going?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Awesome.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Great. So just quickly here. On Vogtle, it seems that there's a little bit more of a focus on the co-owners. I think they're going to be testifying at the hearing coming up. And I don't recall that and maybe I just missed it. So let me know if \u2013 is that unusual or is that a change? And could you just sort of maybe describe sort of the \u2013 there seems to be more of a focus in terms of the data requests, et cetera. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate what might be going on?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, listen, this is one of the most important projects in Georgia's economic history. And it was very clear to us, as we've been working through the challenges and now the opportunities available going forward, that we needed to be arm-in-arm. It's interesting. We do have a shared interest: the co-ops, the munis, City of Dalton, and Georgia Power in seeing this thing through the right way. And I think that's what that's a reflection of is really a joint interest in a participation.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Okay. And moving on, let me ask you this. Do you think there's any possibility that we'll get a settlement in this deflated VCM?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It's always possible. I've said that before in response to questions about settlements with Georgia's triennial filings, boy, always possible. But it's a great practice, some might say therapeutic practice to allow the process to continue and unfold. It allows everybody a seat at the table. Everyone's voice is relevant to be heard. I think we'll get the right conclusion whether we settle or not.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Okay. And then on grid modernization, this comes as sort of interesting. I'm just wondering if you could sort of comment on perhaps the size of the potential grid modernization that you might be thinking about and the nature and perhaps if there's any tie-in with O&M there, just sort of what you guys are thinking about there and what might be the factors that lead you to go for that or not?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, they're directly linked to each other. To the degree we identify additional opportunities there, we'll have to identify the O&M that goes along with it from a timing perspective in order to minimize the impacts on rates. So one will lead to the other. We have not outlined size at this point, Paul. We will give you more detail on that on our next call. We're not quite through with our process yet.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. There's a comprehensive effort across the system to figure out how and when to do these different initiatives. Stan Connally, currently CEO at Gulf Power is kind of leading that on behalf of all the CEOs, but I can tell you all the CEOs head different parts of this initiative. It's a really kind of exciting thing. It's a way to modernize the company. And recall, this is really being driven by market changes, both in technology and customer requirements.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But I mean, when we think about this, is there any type of technological deployment that sort of stands out? Or is it just a whole bunch of things? And what I meant about O&M, you were talking before about how capital business can save on O&M. And I'm just wondering whether or not we have any sense as to whether or not some of this might pay for itself or sort of anything like that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Sure. Gosh, yeah. And in fact, the whole objective here is to deploy the technology CapEx. I gave the example earlier of kind of reducing physical locations in small towns with a manifold increase in points of presence to customers, making it easier for customers to do business with us and actually improving as a result their satisfaction and ultimately their trust in the company. It really is a modernization as to how we approach the marketplace, but as you can imagine, this modernization goes into internal systems as well, not only generation and transmission and distribution, but even kind of supply chain, human resource, a variety of the so-called administrative areas. We're really pushing this notion of how can we modernize our operation and improve it for customers.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Kamal.","Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon, gentlemen. How are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Terrific.","Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Had a couple of questions. Looking at the potential asset sales that you're evaluating, would you say that market value is at a fair premium to book value?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's hard to answer. I mean it depends on the asset. It was certainly fair in Elizabethtown.","Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And even with the solar portfolio, I guess, given the yieldco demand and the financial investor demand, it seems like that would be the case, is that not?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, we believe so. There are investors out there, we think they're looking for passive kind of deployment of capital into 20-year average life assets, very predictable, high-quality kind of cash flows coming off of that. So we think there's value in the marketplace.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We think those kinds of structures have immense more value than say, a solar asset dependent upon an organized market.","Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then looking at machinations in your equity issuance. I understand the near-term needs to be mitigated, but looking longer term, where do you see yourself from an FFO to debt perspective at the holding company?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, we target that overall of our OpCo, so I think over the longer term, we certainly can achieve that target. That's the stake we have put in the ground in order to achieve and the use of proceeds from these asset sales. We'll eliminate some equity need, but we'll also reduce debt as well to maintain our progress towards those targets.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And the target coverage ratio, we're aiming at?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","16% FFO to debt.","Kamal B. Patel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Ashar, glad to have you.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Hi. How are you guys doing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Awesome.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Tom, Art, I wanted to go back to, I don't know if you can remind us some of these moving parts. The detriment from Kemper that was $0.08 to $0.10 that you had provided on the last slide in the second quarter call. Could you remind us what that was made up of? How did you come up with that number?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, it was a piece of the fact that we no longer would have an earning asset related to the Kemper project, and the additional equity need that it would create from the write-off. So I don't have the splits for you, but I think we could get them to you. $0.05 to $0.06 I think was the earning asset and then another $0.03 to $0.04 for the equity.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's the round numbers.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Those are rough.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay. So now with the equity need being alleviated through some other mechanisms that we have come up with, does that make that $0.08 to $0.10 now of a lower drag as we look forward or no?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","No. I still think it's still the best approach towards our earnings guidance for 2018 going forward. It's still an early assessment yet. And we'll clear that up certainly in the next call, but it's still our best guess as to where we see ourselves going and what we're trying to achieve over the longer term.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Certainly gives us more flexibility with respect to changes in EPS growth and credit metrics. Our idea is to balance that, maintain our long-term commitment to shareholders.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay. Thank you so much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Andy.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Hi, guys. How you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Great.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Good.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Just a couple questions. And this, maybe I should know but I don't. On the asset sales, whether it's the solar or Elizabethtown or whatever else you may end up selling, is there any tax leakage on that, or basically, for whatever you sell it, because of NOLs or write-offs or whatever, that all goes into your pocket?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Actually on Elizabethtown, we expect there will be a taxable gain, but oddly enough, it could result in a slight book loss, which is kind of odd, but that has to do with a lot of...","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","That's not cash, right?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","The accretion.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Goodwill.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Goodwill. Excuse me.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Right.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","And then, of course, it depends on what happens whether we do a transaction with the solar assets or not, but more than likely that would result in a tax gain as well.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And recall, since we're in an NOL, any taxes due are deferred.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Right.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay, so you will be able...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It's free for a period of time.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","...to receive cash.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","All right. Okay, so in the short run, next couple of years, that's all cash kind of in the door...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's it.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","...for your use. That was my question. And then...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","But a good time to ...","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","On that one, and then just thinking about kind of what you've been doing recently with various cash raises. Is one way to think about this, again, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but obviously you're talking about grid mod and we're going to get a revised CapEx forecast in the fourth quarter, but are you kind of getting rid of assets that are maybe not earning the same type of return that you would be able to earn on the regulated side, and so we probably should expect some type of significant cap raise and this is a way to redeploy the capital? Or am I getting ahead of myself on that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, we always look at who's the best owner of any asset, and that goes to whether we buy it or sell it, right? So we always kind of take, and that should be viewed as a long-term look, okay? That's not a tactical thing. And we always also are very mindful of our impact with all the external publics that we face.","So for example, when we even considered Elizabethtown, and like I said, on the day that we announced the AGL Resources merger, I got calls. So that was always an attractive asset in the market for a variety of folks. So as we think about going forward, it's going to be the combined math of all that.","It really is kind of opportunistic, where do we think we are going to be in the next 5 to 10 years with that asset. Where will somebody else be? And remember, that's not just returns, that's risk and return. Value accretes to a function of risk and return. If we can reduce risk and improve returns, that's a home run. That's what we're trying to do, is just balance the portfolio.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","So really, it has nothing to do with some future CapEx opportunities at the utilities?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. I thought maybe it would be, okay. And then my final question basically has to do with, when you give 2018 guidance and, again, don't want to get ahead of myself there too, but that will be off of \u2013 that's 5% where you reiterated. Will that be off of 2017's earnings or is there potentially some type of small rebase because of Kemper or something like that and then it would be off of that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, exactly. I mean the math that we've shown before, you take 2017, you grow it 5%, reduce $0.08 to $0.10, grow that at 5% forever. That's kind of (1:08:38).","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Hey, Tom. Just one question on the \u2013 I guess, it ties in with the growth rate, but also with the Vogtle monetization and Toshiba monetization. Just you have this ROE reset thing that in 2021 for a period until the units are up. Can monetization in some way help address that and just how are you going to deal with that in like a growth rate, are you not going to look out to that period? Because it's temporary anyway.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Our 5% long-term growth rate, it depends on how that resolves itself. Whether those two units are treated the same way or whether you split them or how you deploy the cash. There's a few moving pieces in all that, but any consequence of, if we keep the settlement as is and we travel through, you will have just a brief divot in 2021 and 2022 , but you're back to the 5% when those things clear to in-service. It just looks like a year or two of underperforming against the 5%. But they clear to service, you're right back at the 5%. Our long-term growth rate is 5%.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just is there a way that if you're able to get some of the money and kind of delay getting above that cost cap that you could limit this period. I mean obviously if you get the plants up sooner, that limits the period but...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","There is no cost cap per se.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. It's all just based on timing.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's correct.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right. Hey, Steve, the other thing. I just want to be very clear about on this 5% and all that. We have been increasing dividends in a regular, predictable and sustainable way and that's because we believe in our long-term growth rate and even with the challenges that (1:10:54) at Kemper County, we increased the rate of growth from $0.07 to $0.08.","We are setting our \u2013 of course, this is ultimately the purview of the board, but ultimately our dividend policy is set on a belief of the long-term 5% trajectory, so any kind of one year deviation due to a regulatory construct won't have an impact per se on our long-term dividend strategy. And that ultimately is what drives value.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just, I'm curious, maybe you talked about this upfront, tax reform. I'd be curious to kind of your view given you are so close to it. How you're feeling about the outcome coming out in a way that like some of the utility sector issues are addressed the right way, I guess particularly the bonus and interest deduction.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. So let me first say that Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady had been terrific in really pushing this thing forward and certainly we've met with all the folks in the Senate. We understand and gotten the support in the White House. Here's my best guess. It's worth a cup of coffee or whatever, but let me be parochial. Production tax credit. I believe that there is unanimity in Congress in the House and ultimately in the Senate. I believe we'll get treated fairly and we will get either the timeline moved or eliminated for production tax credits for Vogtle.","Now stepping out of my parochialism, for the industry, I think we will follow what was done in 1986 and that is I believe that we will not be accorded expensing of CapEx for public utility property as was originally defined back in 1986. And we will follow some \u2013 what we came up with back then was ACRS \u2013 but some ratable depreciation schedule for taxes kind of as we have now. And in exchange for that, we will retain the ability to deduct interest. That's where I believe we'll go out.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So it's kind of a carve-out for the utility industry...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Which has existed since...","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","...to reflect its unique rate-making.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. And it's been a very sensible kind of engagement with Congress and these guys have been terrific in listening.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Do you think the House will...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I'm sorry.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Will the House come out with that you think since this will be our first look at the bill.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, let's see. I mean I'm guessing right now, but I think it will.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","They're giving us a big benefit. Look I get the benefit of expensing CapEx. It's just that our deployment of long-term capital is dependent largely upon generation and transmission and environmental expansion plans. We don't sway those one year or another based on tax benefits for heaven's sake. Those are really put in place over decades really.","However the elimination of interest deductibility has an immediate negative impact on customers' cost of energy, so they're giving us a benefit with capital expensing that really isn't a benefit and they're hurting customers in the near-term. Especially energy bills tend to be the most kind of regressive form of tax. So the trade actually pays for itself. Let's keep on the tax depreciation schedule for CapEx and let's retain interest deductibility. Congress gets that and it's really important for the most capital intensive industries in the world.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello. Thank you for joining us.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thank you and thank you for the marathon session, so appreciate it.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Always happy.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. So the tax reform point was actually very helpful color and perspective. Just wanted to understand that if what you're saying plays out, and basically it's an interest or tax rate deduction or tax rate comes down, right, let say it comes down from 35% to 20%, the deductibility of interest expense at the holding company that tax shield will also then effectively come down?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","What does that mean for Southern, like are you looking at the holding company debt right now, and are you evaluating this \u2013 I saw in your plan you actually increased by $500 million the holding company debt. So wanted to just figure out how you're thinking about holding company debt given the tax reform and given the tax rates might actually come down.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, look it's a simultaneous equation. I mean, you've centered in on some important stuff. But boy it goes to greater net income because more of it or less of it is subject to taxes. Overall, we believe this is a fair trade for the whole industry including Southern.","The other thing that's an impact to us is any sort of carry forward position or unused tax credit position gets extended with a lower tax rate but we've factored every bit of this into our financial plan.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you, and fair enough.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","The other issue around the debt is junior subordinated debt, which will add some equity characteristics to it, from a rating agency perspective it's more friendly.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks. So, it will help you with your FFO to debt targets as well?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yep.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And also in terms of the sale of this minority interest of solar projects, wanted to understand were you referencing that the sale price you potentially could get for the one-third interest sale would be higher than effectively your purchase prices for the same assets or have market prices been about the same?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, hey, you know what, we had a huge argument internally about this. We've all agreed, we're going to let the market kind of dictate what prices are. We really would prefer not to get into any sort of market valuation of where that may get.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We'll know soon enough. So thank you for your patience there.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, that's fine. And then just finally on that point when you get the proceeds, is there any plan to pay down part of the debt for the projects associated that are being sold. So, if you're selling let's say one-third of a project, is one-third of the debt going to be paid down as well or is the debt going to stay at the full level?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, we finance even at Southern Power, we finance on a portfolio basis. So they've got 45% equity ratio. We would use proceeds to reduce debt and equity.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And you got to understand the way we finance Southern Power is apart from say project financing, it's a much simpler approach and gives us a lot more flexibility than say a project finance structure.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Well, thanks so much guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Julien, how are you?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Hello?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Julien?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, let's talk quickly here \u2013 I'd love to hear little bit more about the monetization here on the Southern Power side. Do you have any metrics that you might want to think about? I mean, you all talk about net income historically, but I suppose in the other side of the world we talk CAFD, we talk EBITDA. Any kind of sense initially on how to try to size this up? I know we're early days on this, but maybe kind of a consolidated basis, take a one-third of whatever metric you want to talk about?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, I think, Julien, the way we like to talk about it is we think there could be up to 26 solar projects included in this. There may be as much as 1,700 megawatts and these are 20-year average contract lives. We just think that the cash flows for a passive investor, there's lots of interest in that, and that's kind of the target that we've outlined here.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And the other thing is, yes, we do talk net income because that translates directly into EPS, which translates directly into the stock value. We stay away from cash metrics. We tried to do something that's easy for people to value and if you look at Southern Power's track record, historically, they regularly beat their internal objectives.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Should we think about...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","As they did this year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Absolutely. Let me check with you on this, I mean, is there something to be said about perhaps an acceleration on this business given the confidence or should we be thinking about this as kind of taking down the expectations thereby and sort of linearly saying, I'm going to sell down a chunk of this business and we'll swap that out with earnings elsewhere?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We'll go through this in detail in the next earnings call, but what you should expect is that Southern Power will contribute its previous share of EPS growth that it has all along. There is not at all an increase or a reduction. We are keeping exactly with the plan that we laid out in October of 2016 in terms of EPS, contribution to Southern Company.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","And our intent of selling this portion of solar assets is a one-time thing. There is no ongoing right that we would like to offer to that owner to buy future additions to the solar portfolio.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Coming back to this earnings question. Obviously, the gas storage assets have value to them. Maybe not necessarily reflected in kind of a traditional net income metric. How do you think about that part of the overall gas business? I mean is that ultimately in the long-term core, if it doesn't turn around and what are the prospects for this across your specific storage footprint?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We don't think it's significant to our earnings picture, is the short answer. Hasn't been, don't think it will be.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, fair enough. Actually, and then maybe, if I could try to summarize a little bit of what folks have been asking the last, almost hour-and-a-half here, can you give us a little bit of a sense of the big positives and negatives in terms of the cash flows that you're looking at against the equity need that you'd originally articulated? Because you are obviously talking a lot about cash raise here, and not necessarily talking about big uses of cash outside of novel modernization program. Can you just maybe try to summarize that a little bit for us?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. I mean, I don't know, I mean the pluses are the fact that we were opportunistic in the market. We found a terrific buyer for Elizabethtown, and like I said, we had interest in that well before we had any equity need that Art started talking about. So that was really a culmination of a series of discussions over time.","Southern Power, using tax equity, certainly has an impact on our equity needs going forward and we're able to maintain our EPS contribution to the overall 5% growth rate of Southern along the way. The other thing is the sale of minority interest of the Southern Power solar portfolio, it's certainly another cash raise that will be I think interesting to us.","The monetization, as Art said before, the Toshiba guarantee, is really a time issue. In other words, we would have gotten that over 3-plus years, now we'll get it in a lump sum. So that's just timing. In terms of equity needs, I think it's whatever's associated to support the credit metrics and Mississippi Power associated with Kemper.","Whatever we end up with approving with the Georgia Public Service Commission on Vogtle 3&4, and then the increases in CapEx and decreases in O&M associated with this business modernization plans in the OpCos. We will add all those pieces up, the puts and the takes, and have them in the financial plan first quarter next year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you all very much. Really appreciate it. Good luck.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you. Thanks for joining us.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Dan, thanks for joining us.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Good afternoon. So most of mine have been answered, but I have just a couple more around Vogtle. In particular, one, I was wondering given the hornet's nest that's been stirred up in South Carolina, wondering around your VCM schedule with the Commission in Georgia, are you seeing any uptick in terms of the activity or aggressiveness in terms of interveners in that case?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Dan, I bet you can read that both ways, right? Certainly, we have to be aware of and responsive to any of the issues that come to Public in South Carolina. I certainly can't comment on any of those for them, but I certainly can for us.","The good news is that we've had this processed. It's VCM processed. It's proven to be such a blessing and the way we have worked with Dr. Jacobs has been so terrific. As well, every VCM process we've invited. It's been a welcoming kind of exercise to have any and all the interveners participate in what is now VCM 17 for heaven's sake.","So this has been all a good process, and so I don't think we've had these kind of surprises at the Georgia Public Service Commission. So in general, I think we've been thoughtful in the process. The Commission has run a terrific kind of regime in evaluating Vogtle now over the years, and I think we have a thoughtful way to proceed and I think the other thing, just to be clear, when you look at the broad public support we have, whether it's statements by the Commission or the Governor or the legislature or the public polling that we do, our position is widely supported here in the state of Georgia.","And I will say, we've had tremendous support out of the federal government. You should know that I think at the federal government level, our continued participation in Vogtle really does have significant national security concerns, and I think that's why you've seen such terrific support, and loan guarantees and support for getting the production tax credit through. We'll see how that ends up, but a host of other issues, the NRC, I should be very mindful to thank them and streamlining the ITAC process.","We've eliminated a lot of the tests, or consolidated the tests, I should say. And we just continue to get great kind of support going forward. We still have to execute. There's still risk on the table. We completely get that, but boy, oh boy, I think this is a good external environment in which to move forward.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. In response I think it that was to Michael, when you talked about, I know the productivity \u2013 you mentioned, I think, that 95% of the components are on the side, I was curious what are you still waiting to receive, commodities mostly?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Dan, most of those are commodities, wire, just equipment necessary to complete the construction of the assets. So, most of the major components are on the ground.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So none of the things are being...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Not that I'm aware of.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","...whatever. Okay.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, your turbines are there. Panels are there, all the big stuff.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","All the shield panels and whatever?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Steam generators, all that big stuff is there.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then just to verify, I think you mentioned a little bit, the nuclear island and turbine building. I was wondering if you'd give a little more detail on what kind of the fourth quarter or before your next earnings call, what are the critical path items that are kind of scheduled for this next three months or so?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Dan, we've got a slide in the appendix, I believe. It's slide 13, that we'll outline a lot of that stuff for you, both the near term progress items and then horizon projects. And it outlines them for both Unit 3 and Unit 4.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And I think as Art said earlier, when you look at these kinds of things, when you see words like containment building, that is kind of pointing to critical path items.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Correct.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Dan.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you, sir.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I just want to thank everybody. It's an exciting time, and thank you for your patience. I know we got a lot of positive activities going on right now and I know some of those positive activities are not going to be dimensionable until they're executed. We expect to see a lot more information on that in the next quarter and certainly, by our next earnings call, we'll have a much more thorough explanation as to the gives and takes and what that means to our growth rate going forward. We feel very confident in our path. We're excited about the future and we appreciate your attention and participation as an investor. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

My name is Bridgette, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note as well, ladies and gentlemen, that today's conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 7, 2018.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Gammill - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Bridgette. Good morning, and welcome to The Southern Company's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you we'll be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements including those discussed in the Form 10-K, third quarter Form 10-Q, and subsequent filings. In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to applicable GAAP measures are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as our slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss today will be viewed on the Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a solid quarter. Our premier state-regulated electric and gas utilities as well as our competitive generation subsidiary, Southern Power, continued to perform well and we remain on track to deliver adjusted results that are well above our original expectations.","While our financial performance this year is notable we are particularly proud of how our employees performed before, during and after the recent severe weather events. The resolve and professionalism of our employees has never been more evident than as demonstrated through recent restoration efforts in Alabama, Florida and Georgia, following Hurricane Michael. Hurricane Michael was the strongest hurricane ever to come ashore in Northwest Florida packing maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour, and a powerful 14-foot storm surge that left devastation across the panhandle of Florida.","The destruction continued inland as Michael maintained Category 3 strength as it moved into Georgia and Alabama, another first-time event. Immediately following the storm, more than 600,000 customers were without power across our service territory. Storm restoration to customers of Alabama Power and Georgia Power was accomplished within three days of the storm. For Gulf Power, the effort included similar results for the service area which could be restored; however, much of their system around the Panama City area, had to be entirely rebuilt.","This rebuild effort was accomplished within 13 days, some 30 hours ahead of the estimated time to complete. This extraordinary effort was not only a testament of the hard work and dedication of over 12,000 Southern Company personnel, but also included the critical contributions of over 35,000 personnel from 27 states and Canada who assisted with the restoration efforts. We owe these hardworking men and women a debt of gratitude for their commitment and personal sacrifice.","The successful collaboration of our public and private partnership with the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Energy resulted in what we would consider an historic textbook restoration effort.","Before I turn the call over to Drew for a review of our financial results, I'd like to first provide a few key updates. First, an update on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. On August 21, the Georgia Public Service Commission voted unanimously to approve Georgia Power's VCM 18 filing for Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Subsequent to that approval, Georgia Power filed its 19 VCM report beginning a review process, which is expected to conclude in February of 2019. A full schedule for the VCM 19 proceedings is included in the appendix of the slide deck for this call.","Additionally, on September 26, all four Vogtle project co-owners voted to continue construction on Units 3 and 4. This commitment means that we will continue forward with the construction of the project which is critical to Georgia's and our nation's energy future. While there have been and will be challenges, we remain committed to safely completing both units and maintaining constructive relationships with our partners along the way.","Let's now move on to the progress at the site. The revised total project capital cost forecast including contingency communicated in the second quarter earnings call remains unchanged including no assignment of the contingency estimate. We have continued to firm up subcontract costs and now have executed contracts for approximately 95% of estimated subcontract cost compared to approximately two-thirds as of our last earnings call.","Recall that the approved in-service dates for Units 3 and 4 are November 2021 and November 2022, respectively. However, we continued to manage the site's planned work based on an accelerated completion date of April 2021 and April 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively, to preserve schedule margin.","While some weekly results were impacted by Hurricane Florence and Michael, we have otherwise seen sustained improvement in productivity since the site stand-down and reset in late July. Since Bechtel became the primary construction contractor in October 2017, the cumulative schedule performance index and cost performance index are currently at 1.02 and 1.17, respectively.","More recent weekly performance at the site resulted in SPI in-line with historical performance and a significant improvement in CPI compared to long term averages. We continue to view these two measures as the best indicators of performance at the site as they consider the collective impacts of productivity of the craft labor and staffing levels.","Productivity is a key element of the project performance, in that it ultimately determines the number of resources that we will need to successfully complete the project.","Focus at the site on key schedule drivers including the ramp-up of craft labor, productivity, system turnover and continuing to build upon the workable backlog to ensure maximum productivity. Most productivity improvements including weekly earned hours above 110,000 have come from the existing workforce. In fact, last week we achieved 120,000 earned hours, a new site record. This compares to approximately 80,000 weekly earned hours prior to the site's stand-down and reset this past July.","We're continuing efforts to ramp up staffing levels to meet the earned hours planned in the accelerated schedule. Our objective is to achieve and maintain those levels from spring 2019 through spring of 2020 as we approach Unit 3 hot functional testing. We have several craft labor recruitment efforts under way, both domestically and internationally, and we are having success with the Helping Hands program, utilizing other trades to augment the electrician workforce on-site. Overall, the project is approximately 71% complete, including 58% of construction. We've included a list of future milestones in our slide deck. Since our last earnings call, all of our major milestones have been accomplished in support of our accelerated schedule on-site.","Meanwhile, the Sanmen 1 and Haiyang 1 units in China have both achieved commercial operation. Sanmen 2 and Haiyang 2 are currently synced to the grid, with commercial operation expected by year-end. It is important to note that the start-up process for the four units in China has gone and continues to go exceedingly well. Lessons learned from China will continue to benefit our project.","Next, as an update to our ongoing initiatives to optimize sources of common equity, we have reached a definitive agreement to sell Southern Power's Mankato Energy Center to Northern States Power. Recall that the Mankato facility consists of an existing one-on-one natural gas combined cycle with an expansion project that is currently in the late stages of construction and is expected to be in service by mid-2019. The expanded two-on-one facility will have a total capacity of approximately 760 megawatts. Subject to customary closing conditions, we expect this transaction to close in mid-2019, be earnings accretive, and offset approximately $400 million of equity needs for Southern Company. The total transaction value is $650 million.","I'll now turn the call over to Drew for a financial and economic overview and an update on our existing initiatives.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The Mankato transaction Tom mentioned is another great example of our ability to efficiently source capital to mitigate our broader equity needs. We are also pleased to announce, consistent with previous investor communications, that we've executed the third-party tax equity financing arrangement for substantially all of Southern Power's existing wind portfolio. This transaction, which we expect to close before year-end 2018, provides $1.2 billion of total proceeds, while retaining our important ownership position in a premium carbon-free wind portfolio. The transaction is expected to be EPS accretive and would offset approximately $1 billion of equity needs for Southern Company.","We also continued to work through the regulatory approval process at FERC for the sale of Gulf Power and Southern Power's plants Stanton and Oleander. While Gulf Power's most recent priority has been the restoration efforts in the wake of Hurricane Michael, we currently expect to close both transactions during the first quarter of 2019.","As a reminder, our initial forecast of post-tax reform equity needs for 2018 through 2022 was approximately $7 billion. We have successfully reduced our projected equity need for this period by more than $4 billion through our proactive efforts to optimize equity sources. Additionally, we have already issued approximately $1 billion of equity through our internal and at-the-market programs through October of this year. Net of the incremental equity for Vogtle that we announced last quarter, our projected remaining equity needs from now through the end of 2022 are only $2.4 billion. We will continue to be thoughtful and strategic as we fulfill these needs.","Now, for an update on third quarter earnings results. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we've reported earnings for the third quarter of 2018 of $1.14 per share, compared with earnings of $1.07 per share for the third quarter of 2017. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we reported earnings of $1.92 per share, compared with earnings of $0.35 a share for the same period in 2017. Excluding the charges associated with construction projects, wholesale services earnings and the other items described in our earnings call material, earnings for the third quarter of 2018 and the nine-month period-ending September 2018 were $1.14 and $2.83 per share, respectively. These results compare with adjusted earnings of $1.12 and $2.51 per share for the same periods in 2017.","We note the excluded items in our earnings call materials, which include acquisition, disposition and integration impacts as well. Major earnings drivers for our adjusted results for the third quarter and year-to-date 2018 include the positive effects of constructive regulatory outcomes and weather at our state-regulated utilities, somewhat offset by increased depreciation and amortization and interest expense. We have also been successful in holding our O&M expense flat year-over-year at our state-regulated utilities as we continue to work each day to operate more efficiently.","Our generation system load was 4% higher in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to warmer-than-normal temperatures in September and despite the impacts of Hurricane Irma \u2013 or including the impacts of Hurricane Irma in September of 2017. The third quarter of 2018 also represented a record high for gas generation and the lowest level of coal generation in more than 15 years. Year-to-date 2018, gas generation represented 48% of the generating mix with a high of 52% in September of 2018. This represents the highest monthly level of natural gas generation in our history. At recent gas price levels, our natural gas units are displacing virtually all of our coal units in the dispatch curve.","Moving now to the economic review of the third quarter. The Southeast economy continues to expand at an attractive pace. Our combined business territory continues to see slightly faster population growth than the nation, boosted by a net in migration particularly in Georgia. Job growth in Southern Company's electric business territory of 1.8% is also outpacing the national average. The key driver of our sales growth in this quarter is our strong residential customer growth for both electric and gas, at a rate of 1% with Georgia leading the way.","Manufacturing activity in the Southeast electric footprint remained solid and most of our large industrial customers continued to report increases in new orders and production. Absent maintenance-related outages at some paper production manufacturing, which utilize on-site co-generation, we saw positive trends in momentum in industrial consumption broadly across the top 10 industrial categories that we follow, which includes segments like chemicals and primary metals.","The economic development pipeline in Southern Company's business territory remains robust despite a modest decline in the total number of active projects. So far this year, we've seen a decline in the number of jobs announced down 8% versus this time last year, but a very solid increase in business investment which is up 29% compared with last year and in line with national trends.","Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I want to provide our outlook for the remainder of 2018. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $0.23 per share in the fourth quarter, which would result in full-year performance at the very top of our revised adjusted EPS guidance range. Remember, we increased our guidance on the second quarter call to $2.95 to $3.05 per share. Our original adjusted EPS guidance range for 2018 was $2.80 to $2.95 per share.","Our current year-end guidance implies an adjusted result that is 6% above the midpoint of our original guidance range, driven primarily by cost control, weather and constructive regulatory outcomes in our state-regulated businesses. Our projected long-term EPS growth trajectory of 4% to 6% remains unchanged. This growth trajectory is based off the midpoint of our original 2018 guidance range of $2.87 per share.","Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Drew. As you can see from today's results, we continue to execute across our businesses and we're well-positioned to deliver on our goals for 2018 and beyond. We demonstrated the constructive nature of our state regulatory environments earlier this year as we delivered significant benefits to customers resulting from tax reform, while at the same time maintaining the credit metrics of our state-regulated businesses.","For the incremental equity required to meet these plans, we executed in an outstanding manner through earnings accretive asset sales. Additionally, the economy within our service territories remains strong with in-migration and employment driving customer growth. As always, it is our customer-focused business model with emphasis on outstanding reliability, best-in-class customer service, and rates well below the national average that remains the cornerstone of our company and a key driver of long-term value to Southern Company's shareholders.","Our commitment to delivering energy and energy solutions to customers includes conserving and protecting the environment for today and for future generations. This progress is evidenced by our successful reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by over 35% since 2007. We understand the importance of engaging with all of our stakeholders in a productive, transparent conversation about how we safely manage risk while delivering shareholder value and growth.","Our goal of low- to no-carbon future will continue to inform our planning processes in the near future. We also continue to seek ways to improve our interim benchmarks as we progress towards our objective of a low- to no-carbon future.","Southern Power also continues to execute on its plan to deploy capital into value-accretive, carbon-free renewable projects. The 150-megawatt Cactus Flats wind facility in Texas reached commercial operation in July of 2018. The output from this facility is fully contracted through long term purchase power agreements with General Mills and General Motors.","Additionally, Southern Power recently announced a 200-megawatt Reading wind facility in Kansas with a 12-year power purchase agreement with Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines.","Let's now move on to the mid-term elections. We watched last night's election results with much interest.

We provide an unassailable advantage in a globally competitive worldwide economy. We remain focused on demonstrating superior performance across all our businesses.","As we look ahead to our fourth quarter call in February, in addition to sharing our 2019 annual EPS guidance and an update on Vogtle 3 and 4, we will also update our five-year capital forecast, including expected ash pond closure costs and capital initiatives at our state-regulated utilities to improve service and lower operating costs.","We certainly appreciate your continued interest in Southern Company and are now ready to take your questions. Operator? We'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey. Good morning. How are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Super.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So is it right that Chuck Eaton and Tricia Pridemore won the election last night? I'm looking online, and it says they were ahead. But I didn't see that there were any firm figures in yet.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, there's still some ballots to be counted. In order to avoid a run-off, they got to be above 50%. Right now, I believe Tricia Pridemore is above 50%. Chuck Eaton, I think the latest tally has him very slightly below 50% but still with absentee ballots uncounted. We'll just have to see how that turns out. If there is a run-off, it would be I think December 4.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you. My second question is on a completely different subject, on Vogtle. Based on the current construction schedule, when does the construction spending and intensity of labor demand at the site actually peak in terms of time horizon? And you starting to see declining spending and declining levels of employment at the site, like when are we at peak construction?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I want to say we're adding about 100 people per month through what, February?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Right.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And then it lasts about a year. There's kind of a big plateau up there, and then it will ramp down starting in February of 2020.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Perfect. Don't have any questions on the quarter. Solid numbers. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you, my friend.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Jonathan. Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Just picking up on what you just said to Greg and looking back at what you'd said last quarter. I think you said your schedule was to hit peak labor in November. So is that target now a little more like spring of next year? And if that is a shift, can you just explain how that fits within the broader Vogtle schedule discussion?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, number of factors at play and one of the first things you should recognize is that the optimal staffing curve is always a little bit of a moving target. Witness the productivity increase that we got on-site, moving from pre-stand-down 80,000 hours a week. We've actually achieved 120,000 hours achieved the last week with actually fewer personnel. So, we're able to manage how much increased staffing we'll need by what our productivity assumption may be. Further, there's a whole host of other things at play.","I think we mentioned this Helping Hands idea. A lot of what's going on right now involves setting up cable trays and pulling cable on-site. Ultimately, you have to connect that cable. One of the things we thought about is the original projections assume that electricians would handle most of that work. Through the Helping Hands initiative, we can re-segment the work so that other craft labor can participate in that activity. That obviously has an impact on how many electricians you will need. Ultimately, we do need more electricians on-site, and we have aggressive plans in place. We continue to work with Department of Labor. We continue to think about different ways to reduce absenteeism and attract new labor from around the region.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So can you give some specifics on how many new people you need, versus what you've done so far? Or just some numbers around that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Sure. I think, since \u2013 if I remember this right, we had probably, May through June, 4,100 direct craft. Post the reset, we actually reduced the number of craft on-site. That went down to about 3,700, right? And we've been adding some people now here lately. I think last week, we added 40 people. Right now, we have 3,850 on-site, and what we would like to do by February to March is have somewhere in the 4,500 region. So, if you add 100 per craft, that gets you to that kind of number.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, you need (27:22) up from where you are today as the rough number?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Oh, sure. Oh, sure. Yeah, and like I said, there's going to be a little bit of a moving target there, but that's right.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just from memory, that's probably a similar deficit to what you were talking about last quarter. So, is that number very similar?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I would bet it's a wee bit less, but yeah, it's similar.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. I wouldn't quibble about that.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just final other thing. There was a number earlier in the year. I think it may have been the independent monitor's number that you needed to \u2013 at some point you need to get to 140,000 hours a week. And it's obviously good to see you getting within shot of that. But is that a number that was \u2013 is that your number? Or was that more staff number? And you got the right target?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, you've got great memory. Yeah, yeah, you've got a great memory. So let's just kind of go through the numbers. So if we hit 120,000, kind of, a duration, we believe we'll be able to satisfy the schedule at November. Of course, we'll use up a lot of our scheduled contingency, essentially getting above 120,000 to 140,000, or if we could do it even better than 140,000 to 150,000 or even 160,000. What that does is increase our schedule margin and that's something we're pursuing with great haste, but those numbers you're remembering are correct.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Yeah, just to emphasize. The 140,000 was related to the accelerated schedule, which would put us in service and preserve margin, but it's the April timeframe as opposed to the November commitment that we've made statewide.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Right.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And from what I'm hearing, that's probably the type of number we should focus on perhaps more than in our head count for example.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, that's exactly right. So, here is the thing. We're very gratified with the improvement in productivity that allowed us with fewer people to increase our hours up to 120,000. I must say, and we push our people around a lot in our meetings, it's \u2013 I think the ability with that level of staffing to get more productivity starts to get a little limited.","Our key to success in getting more margin now will be getting more people. You're right to focus on the numbers of hours, because that's ultimately what matters. Getting work done on the site. We do think we need more people on-site now.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","More people but in absolute terms, I don't know that we include that as part of our three-cornered hat. We do still believe that CPI and SPI, which measure the productivity and the cost of that labor being produced probably are better measures for us in aggregate.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right because all that matters is hours worked, right. I'm just saying at these productivity levels. At these productivity levels, we need more people.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for all the extra color there, guys. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Steve. How are you?","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good morning.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Tom. Good. Thanks. So just one question just on the guidance. So, if you basically just take the $2.87 base that you've mentioned and grow it to 4% to 6%, in 2019 you'd be back to essentially what you're earning in 2018 at the high end. So is that mainly explained that the 2018 upside has mainly been the favorable weather? Or how should I think about that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Steve. I'd say that partially. So, if we compare weather, it's about $0.08 improvement relative to what our normal expectation would be, but I think the balance of your math is correct. A good portion of our benefit is still coming from productive state regulatory reform and usage and customer growth.","And recall, when we went out with that original guidance, a lot of that was on the basis of 7 million shares associated with preserving the credit metrics with tax reform. What we've been able to do through these asset sales is essentially avoid now over 4 million shares, so the shares avoided certainly has a pickup in 2018 relative to what our original estimate was.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Steve, I'd say this do your math more directly, to answer your question more directly. If we take the $3.05 and back out about $0.08, we're still significantly above the top end of our initial guidance range just because of the factors we talked about.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And I want to add, we've done a really good job keeping O&M flat.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So, just the obvious question then is why does that not imply better than 4% to 6% after that? Or why are you going back to the same base of $2.87 for your growth rate?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So recall, you got the regulatory structure at Georgia. So, as we go through 2019 and 2020 moving to in-service of 2021, we have effects there through the earnings rates, which you've always kind of talked about that it would kind of be flattish a little bit, but within our 4% to 6% growth off of $2.87.","The other thing we have is when we think about the effects of selling Gulf Power or Florida City Gas or Elizabethtown or Mankato, we have a net effect we had originally planned for taking some of the 7 million shares in the form of something like converts, where we kind of plan that in 2019. We may do that similar thing, but it's less of an effect in 2019. All the positive accretion we see from those deals will likely start to show in 2020 and 2021. I think we're going to see the lion's share of the accretion in those two-years particularly.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Plus, a little bit of added retention for credit quality...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","...related to a couple of branches.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay that all makes sense. Just a couple other quick ones. On Mankato, I recall you bought that for like $400 million and then you've had to finish the expansion, so what's the $650 million relative to your investment?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","So a couple hundred million dollars invested in the expansion of Mankato, the total invested today is about $580 million.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","And when you're \u2013 it's fully done, is it going to be about that $650 million or...?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","The $580 million.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","About $580 million fully done, okay. And then just one other question in terms of the kind of investor friendly actions like Mankato. What's the sense that maybe there might be more of those to do over time or over let's say the coming year or have you kind of exhausted them you think?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Oh, yeah, no, no, there's plenty of opportunities to do more. We try to be very judicious and strategic in how we exercise those things, but there's certainly more on the palette of opportunities.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Good. Thanks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Michael.","Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Actually this is Khanh for Michael.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Okay. Great.","Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for taking our question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So just following on Steve's question there. You say there's a lot more opportunities there, but is there a level of earnings contribution from Southern Power that you target or that you'd be comfortable with going forward, given all the sale of Gulf Power?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Say it again I'm sorry, your question?","Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","The level of earnings contribution from Southern Power to the overall EPS?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Southern.","Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, sure. Variety of things here. We have been in the low 300s for some time at Southern Power. As we think about the different \u2013 we've remixed so a lot of that earnings in the past, I don't know, two to three years was ITC related from solar, and so you've got these big pops. We've intentionally, and I think, we have some information in our slide material, transitioned from the kind of single year, people are shaking their heads at me on that on the slide material, but we've transitioned away from kind of the one-time pops to more the 10-year production tax credit, associated with wind. So here is kind of where we think Southern Power ends up, and that is earnings in kind of the low-200s, growing at 5% to 10% and we really think also that's a function of the market.","When we saw tax reform occur, and we started hinting at this some last year, we really refocused growing a lot of earnings outside the state-regulated utility franchises, both electric and gas. And right now, what we see is when you think about Southern's earnings, something like 95% of Southern's earnings come from our state-regulated electric and gas franchises. That's where we think the best opportunity to grow the business is and we think it's a very attractive risk return proposition.","Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, that's great, thank you. Also, I'll follow up on a smaller topic, PowerSecure. At this point, do you have any thoughts or comments on Bloom's ability to execute on their projects and permits?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We're going to execute to \u2013 I'm going to comment on Bloom broadly. I'll say this. We've had a terrific relationship with Bloom and where we have deployed the Bloom technology along with our own proprietary storage and switch gear, we've had a terrific experience and the customers love it. More broadly, about PowerSecure. I think, I haven't seen the final numbers on Michael, but for Irma and a variety of these other storms, PowerSecure customers have been able to maintain operability during these worst of times at like a 98% availability level. It's been a terrific business and you know what I say frequently on the stump is, Southern has been such an iconic company for so long and we have such great franchises and such a great customer base.","It is, however, I think this kind of inexorable change where, because technology enables it and because customers are requiring it, I think this old 100-year-old model of make, move and sell at a central station asset concentrated level may in fact start to dissipate over time. And that's why we did the acquisition of PowerSecure.","And I think what also is notable, if you look at the recent business of Southern Power, we grew up on selling to IOUs and munis and co-ops, and lately we've been selling long term renewables to people like General Mills, General Motors and Carnival Cruise Lines.","So what we're seeing is an intersection of interest particularly in the commercial and industrial sectors between what Southern Power is now doing and what PowerSecure is doing. Add to that our fuel management capabilities at places like Sequent, we think that we not only can play well but in fact influence how distributed infrastructure may occur in America. So it's very exciting. It's a very small bet. We've always said that, but it's a very exciting option bet that we've made.","Khanh Nguyen - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's great. Thank you so much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well done thus far.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","How about that?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, I wanted to follow-up \u2013 yeah, absolutely. Well, so I wanted to follow-up a little bit on Southern Power just to clarify couple things. What's the implied PE multiple on the latest sale? And then how do you think about, again, like the accretive equity? I mean, just to come back a little bit to Steve's question, how much could you cumulatively if you think about eligible assets kind of displaced of that remaining equity need if you think about what's on the table here?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","So, Julien, this is Drew. I would start by saying there's not really a good multiple that I could describe to you because it's not a plant in-service, and so you're probably better triangulating it off of something like dollars per kilowatt. And we think it's a very fair market transaction and something that would be good for Northern States Power.","You second part, second part of your question was really what else resides in the portfolio, and I think we've got to take a look at each of the individual assets one by one, assess their importance to the Southern portfolio, to our business partners that are the municipal and cooperative load aggregators within the State. And we'll just continue to look at them one by one.","We have the \u2013 I think, we've shown a strong preference for participating in the construction of wind and solar assets. We want to continue to do that. We've probably optimized from a tax perspective against those two asset classes, and that's why you see movement now on something like Mankato, which is out of the gas portfolio.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, we try to be very kind of dogmatic about M&A. I know I've been answering M&A questions since even when I was CFO, but we try to have as much discipline about buying as we do selling. And a lot of times when you think about M&A in the asset space, as Drew mentioned, it's who is the best owner? Who can think about deriving synergies to improve their bottom-line? Or who can blend that operation into their business to reduce risk? Those are kind of the ways we create value here. We think there's plenty more opportunities, and we'll see how they turn out.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Just a little follow-on. If I thought more about the Wind portfolio, I think the current tax equity transaction represents sort of eight of the facilities within the portfolio, and we will have continued construction and some other assets that would qualify under very similar construct. And so those will also be avenues for us for capital raise without disposition of assets.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell of KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Anthony.","Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","How are you doing, Tom? Good morning.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Awesome. Great.","Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hopefully two easy questions. One is just a housekeeping item. The $0.10 you took for tax reform in this quarter \u2013 is that a timing issue that backs out the fourth quarter? Or we shouldn't see a reversal of that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No. You won't see a reversal. That's an ongoing matter. And remember just broadly, too, I think, when we saw tax reform \u2013 essentially I got that question also on \u2013 or I guess, I created the question on CNBC this morning. It showed that our revenues missed. Even though our bottom line was way up, our revenues were off by 0.7%. We think that's a function of tax reform. In other words, what we did was reduced rates, and about the rough math was about two thirds of the benefit went into rate reductions. One third of the benefit was captured to support higher equity ratios, which in fact, preserved our credit quality, our debt coverage ratios. So if I had to, kind of, think about it, it's an ongoing benefit of two thirds of any dollar of tax reform benefit go to customers.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I think in this particular circumstance there, it's $0.10, but that nets from $0.22 worth of benefits. And so it is something \u2013 that is the functioning of how it will be forever.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Oh, great. And then you said there would be more of a primer on the two indexes you're using for Vogtle on slide 31. So, when you talk about an SPI of 1.02, does that mean you're getting 2% more hours done than what you planned? I'm just trying to understand how should I look at SPI and CPI.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, that's wonderful stuff. So in general, what you should look for on schedule, the SPI is essentially one equals April, and \u2013 what did I say \u2013 1.2 or so equals November, somewhere around there.","Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So does that mean that you're ahead of schedule?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It means, I think, we're on pace for our April aggressive schedule. Now, the real key to that, Anthony, is thinking about how we're able to keep pace on staffing at the site. Let me just review that again. At about the 120,000 level, 120,000 hours per week, what we are able to do, we think, is hit the November schedule, okay? But we would do that without margin. So what we're trying to do is increase hours worked per week above 120,000, and I think it was Jonathan that remembered the 140,000. We could go 150,000, 160,000, but anything we do above that level increases our margin and enables us to better hit a more accelerated schedule, which right now we're planning for April, not November.","Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And that accelerated schedule we should see the SPI rise to like 1.05? Is that a fair understanding of it?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No, sir. If we are not able to keep pace on getting staffing up to 140,000 by, I don't know, February, something like that, then we'll have less margin. The 1.0 would be April, so maybe instead of April, you would end up with May or June or something like that. A lower number on SPI is better, okay? And the whole staffing and the whole hours worked per week is all an objective to increase margin against the regulatory schedule of November.","Anthony Crowdell - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions, Tom.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet, buddy. See you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont of Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Paul. Good morning.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my first question relates to Mankato. I'm still trying to understand the difference between the cash that you're getting through the door and the reduction in your equity need. Why wouldn't the reduction in your equity need be at least the $580 million which is your cost basis in the plant?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","So if you remember, it's a capital-based asset we acquired a couple of years ago. There is some depreciation associated with that asset, and so the deltas really just reflects what the current tax basis is.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. So the difference between the $650 million and the $400 million is all tax-driven?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","That and we also rebalance our capital structure so that we meet our FFO-to-debt targets. And so a portion of the proceeds will be used to pay down debt.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","We try to couch all of our sales based on the equity reduction, knowing that the proceeds will be used for both purposes; repayment of debt and reduction of equity need.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And recall the whole $7 billion that we've been targeting is really at a thicker equity ratio for the company, in general, which gets us back to the coverage ratios at the Southern level.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Right.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. So, it also relates to your attempting to hit some target of FFO to debt, which I assume is in the 15% range?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's correct. 16%.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","And then how much \u2013 what was the weather year-to-date relative to normal?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","About $0.08 in total.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. And then at Southern Power, in order to grow the 5% to 10%, how much of that sort of \u2013 I think, you've identified up to $500 million of incremental investment that's not in your CapEx numbers. How much of that do you need to do, or is all of the growth coming from tax equity transactions which are not affecting your cash outlays?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, let's review the bidding there. Kind of in the prior numbers we gave you was $1.5 billion a year, is what we were looking at, and we've ratcheted that back to about $500 million a year. When you look at the two ranges we just gave you growing at 5% and growing at 10%, the $500 million a year will get us to the 10% number, no incremental growth gets us at a long term 5% earnings float.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","So, that's no incremental capital gets you to the 5%?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Right. That's it.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","And does that incorporate some assumption of transactions that you're doing on a tax-equity basis or not?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It assumes what we've announced, in other words the solar, the wind, but nothing further. We'll evaluate tax equity going forward. We're eating pretty dramatically into any kind of carry-forward position we have, and so we'll assess going forward whether we want to do tax equity or just carry the production tax credits ourselves.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","And then last question from me. You indicated that you're done with respect to equity for the year, so can we use the ending share count at the end of the third quarter as the ending share count for the year?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","No, I don't think that's probably fair. We have drip and dribble that still continue through balance of year. The ATM is the one that we may modulate based on our expectations, but \u2013 and our success really in raising capital in these methods, but we still have to preserve all the options we've got through the balance of the year.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, and it's really not just the balance of the year, it's everything.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Because we'll look at other investor-friendly options, et cetera. So, we'll balance all that together.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Great.

When the plant is fully running with the expansion complete, et cetera, what's the annual net income that would go away now that otherwise would have been flowing through the Southern numbers?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Ali, I just have to get back to you on it. I don't recall what the projection was. I should probably know it, but don't. Something we can talk to you about in the post-call.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. But to be clear, when you all talk about Southern Power's base of low-200 number, that includes both the tax equity transaction, as well as Mankato? Or is that requiring further adjustments?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No, it includes all of those effects.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Ali, the only thing I'd say is the Mankato sale is generally accretive to us.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. It's about $0.01.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","About a $0.01, so that's the other way to triangulate an answer to the first question you asked.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then secondly, if I recall correctly, you folks have been budgeting your outlook overall at a flattish sort of load growth profile. And as you've been pointing out, you're running at about 1%. Does that change your outlook? And if I recall, 1% pickup all else being equal is about an incremental $0.06 of annual earnings. Is that a fair way to think about this?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I don't know whether you saw my little appearance on TV this morning. Look, the numbers we're showing this quarter are really at the tops of what we've been talking about for some years now, 1.4% growth quarter-over-quarter in retail sales, 2.4% in industrial, 1% growth in customers.","Look these are all really good numbers. I would just throw a wee bit of caution on all that optimism. With my work at the Fed and everything else in our own analysis we do look at something that I call momentum numbers and I'm seeing momentum that looks kind of flat. That is you still may be positive quarter-over-quarter, but if you're less positive, I call that a negative.","The momentum numbers would indicate that there is a bit of a pause in the economy and absent any positive action, we could see those numbers go back down a bit. What could unleash it? I think what we're seeing in the good numbers is the effect of tax reform and lower regulation and so people are investing in their businesses but they're doing it largely in their current sites, or expanding a current site.","I think there is another wave but that wave is being suppressed right now through kind of long-term concern about the tax war, skirmish, whatever phrase you want to use. If we could resolve some of that uncertainty in the worldwide economic market, I think there is another breath to take on continued economic expansion, which would really help those numbers. That's kind of what I'm seeing right now. But boy if you look at our manufacturing numbers, for example, Drew, virtually all of them are positive.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Certainly, on the industrial side too, strong segments across all 10 segments.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And because our job growth is great, unemployment rate is still low, people will come to the Southeast to get jobs and we'll continue to deliver jobs to the public. It's a really good dynamic right now. I just want to throw just a little bit of caution on it.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. And then one last one. If I recall correctly from your prior equity plans, I believe the goal was to raise about $1.4 billion of equity in 2018. I know you've done about a billion through October. Is that still the target we should be assuming, $1.4 billion for the year?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","It really does move through time and the goal is through 2022. I think we've done some very proactive things now with the sale of Mankato and being able to get $1 billion worth of equity up. We will, I want to be able to preserve our options through the balance of the year. The dividend reinvestment plan will still be functioning and the ATM is still open, but I don't know if I'm answering your question directly. I think we will continue to issue shares at least in some form through the balance of the year.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","But we're on hold on the ATM.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. Just to clarify, Drew, your annual capacity to generate equity through the internal programs is how much and how much has been done through the nine-months?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","$500 million or $600 million per annum through all programs really, options and dividend reinvestment.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Right. And how much have we done so far?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","This year?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Three-quarters of that amount.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I've got you. Thank you very much.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","It's a pretty straight line for those two programs. The only options really are variable, we can't control the exercise of but dividend reinvestment really is the principal one and so the next \u2013 that happens as dividends are declared and paid.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Thank you so much.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, guys. You covered just about everything. I guess maybe just one last one I want to ask about the O&Ms. I believe you said you've been happy with what you've been doing year-to-date and that's been driving the upside to this year's numbers. My question is how do you think about the cost savings you've seen as being structural and recurring in the future years versus sort of one-time savings that might not repeat in 2019 and beyond?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No, these are structural. Look, we've been working on something called modernization here, and the whole idea is we're making investments in our business largely technology driven, I would say, otherwise, kind of environmental driven, the ash pond work, a variety of other things. And what we're able to do is, for example, through technology provide customers with like a four times greater point of presence, while reducing the fixed assets in the field through investments in local towns and a variety of other things. So we've actually been able to improve customer service and create structural reductions in O&M. Georgia Power clearly has been a leader in that, and we think those things are sustainable around the clock here at Southern. And there's more to go, so we'll keep working on it.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","It's probably fair to say that the results will vary by franchise, and we're in different states of maturity in each. But the goal really is to grind inflation ultimately out of the business in aggregate and see if we can't do more of that from the parent. And then, really it's an offset to a lot of the capital that needs to be invested into rate-base into the franchises.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And some of that sounds kind of ominous, but if you look at Georgia Power by reducing, kind of, capital in the field and investing in technology and this multiplication of points of presence, they were actually voted the Most Trusted Electric Utility in the United States last year. We can improve customer service and, at the same time, take cost out of the business.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Just to clarify on that, you talked on the last call about finding income-generating CapEx opportunities. Should we think of these as being a net increase or decrease to CapEx? And I know we'll get more details in the next call, but directionally, how does that net out?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It's an increase in CapEx. The objective will be take O&M down, increase CapEx, keeping rates constant, all other things being equal.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. Okay. Then lastly, the 4% to 6%, what did that assume for O&M? Over the long term period...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It assumes a regular growth rate of, like 3%, but as Drew said, we're not going to be satisfied with growing O&M at 3%. We're going to grind it away to zero is what we're hoping for.","Andrew Weisel - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, Tom. Thank you for taking my question today. Real quick, when you look at your generation fleet across the different subsidiaries, where do you think the greatest opportunity is for fleet transformation, meaning the potential for incremental coal retirements, the potential for significant growth in either solar or gas-fired generation, or a combination of both?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, sure. We're selling our \u2013 I think it's our most heavy coal generator is Gulf Power. NextEra is buying them. We have been \u2013 Georgia Power has been a leader in the United States. In fact, remember they were voted the number one Investor Owned Utility by the solar industry. They have the largest voluntary solar program in the United States. My sense is solar will continue to be in favor in the portfolio. With Georgia and even Alabama, we now see wind, we see some solar, and we continue to rethink opportunities in gas.","So Mississippi is really pretty small. So when you think about our whole portfolio now, what you see is a growing trend as we complete Vogtle, maintaining nuclear, growing gas with the influence of coal over time dissipating. That's the trend you should see. Much more renewables. Before I got here, we were zero on renewables. Now, across our fleet, including Southern Power, we're around 10%. That's \u2013 for a company that produces as much energy as the nation of Australia roundabouts, that's a pretty big move.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Praful, how are you?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much. Hi, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, maybe first touch on the way you're measuring EPS accretion as you talk about these different transactions. What is the baseline for that? Is it assuming a baseline with some equity issuances? Or just so I understand, what is the base against which EPS accretion is being measured?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Yeah, that's effectively it. So, we're looking at the projection for net income for the underlying asset, the effects for us on EPS' share, earnings per share. We're really looking at the income relative to the cost of avoiding issuance of new equity.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, so, you lose net income, but you don't have the shares.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Don't have shares.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And if the sales price is beneficial, you get accretion.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","The simplest form of this is sort of the after-tax proceeds on a per-share basis relative to our own share price, although that varies with tax position and basis in the underlying asset but that's the calculation.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I got you. So, some assumption that went into what price at which you'd issue the equity kind of drives a little bit of the analysis as well?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It does. It does.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. All right. And then maybe just want to touch on one of the points you made earlier, which was on the tax equity side. The point you made was I think you want to hold off to doing too much more tax equity. I didn't really understand the reason why if you could just clarify why. Is there any kind of constraint on doing more tax equity or not?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Oh, no. No constraint at all. The issue is we just look on a case-by-case basis. When you think about the Florida transaction we just did, we had an enormous kind of carry-forward position. That's a taxable transaction. That takes away \u2013 all these asset sales that are taxable, eats away at that carry-forward position. We're now in a position where we can think kind of on a case-by-case basis whether we want to carry the tax credits and PTCs, ITCs, whatever they are or whether we'd rather sell the tax benefits to somebody else. It's really a pretty straightforward calculation as to the time value with cash, whether we're better having it or whether somebody else is.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","And we've come close to optimization with the current portfolio. What Tom described is absolutely true for future construction. We'll also have assets that mature enough so this becomes a possibility even within the existing portfolio, but we will look at it against share issuance at every point.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. And so where does your current cash tax position stand? As in when do you expect to be cash taxpayers again given all these earning gains that you've had through these asset sales?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So, yeah, the numbers move over time but kind of 2023-2024.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Understood. Thank you. And then finally, just quickly on Vogtle, the labor need that you're saying you're hoping to grow above the 120,000, is there a particular market like the Canadian market in terms of what you're looking to tap to get more workers? Or how should we think about where those additional workers come from at this point?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We have been working with the Department of Labor to source labor from Canada. Yes, we have. But there are other ways to get that labor, too. And remember, this Helping Hands thing is a new strategy. I don't know. How long is it? Probably four-to-six-months old, something like that, but it's a way to re-segment the work so that we need fewer electricians and we can let other craft labor take big segments of work like pulling cable through cable trays. Ultimately, you have to connect the cable, so you need electricians.","Plus, other ideas we have about sourcing through reducing attrition on the site, reducing absenteeism on the site and increasing productivity. We're very thoughtful of that a variety of ways. Even if we don't get labor from Canada, we may be able to source enough personnel to accomplish the work we need and get the margins we want.","One other big factor we haven't spent a lot of time on; we continually work on the site with lessons learned from China and working with our prime contractor Bechtel to re-sequence work, optimize work processes and we've achieved much-better productivity that witnessed the latest numbers as a result of those good efforts.","I personally call or we speak, Brendan Bechtel and I, once every two weeks or so. Steve Kuczynski, Head of our Nuclear Group is on-site all the time. We are working with the executives at Bechtel and Southern Nuclear to always optimize the workflow and we've been able to improve productivity as a result of that. That also goes to the need and timing of new personnel on-site, that's something else I alluded to but wasn't as direct as I am now.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's super helpful. Thanks so much, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Paul. How are you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","How is it going?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Terrific.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just to sort of \u2013 almost everything has been asked and answered, but just back to the Helping Hands, is there sort of any limitation? This sort of sounds like sort of a \u2013 sounds like it opens up all sorts of opportunity. I mean, is there any limit I guess in terms of how much that could be employed or how should we think about that? It just seems like...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, sure there are limits. The kind of obvious limit I just said was ultimately we'll need electricians to connect the cables. We think kind of right now, we've displaced 150 people through this Helping Hands thing, but I think you're right. I think \u2013 but here again, let me give kudos to the labor unions here. We've always had a great relationship with folks like Sean McGarvey and others. It's a real partnership on-site between management, Bechtel and the unions, everybody wants this site to be successful and the unions have been super cooperative, and creative and thoughtful in how we deploy personnel here and get them to work together. They've really been terrific.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, just to sort of, there were a lot of numbers in terms of productivity et cetera and how things have sort of changed and you spoke to Jonathan Arnold and Greg about this. So just sort of want to \u2013 just to make things clear, you guys are still very confident and you feel that you're on track to meet those productivity numbers \u2013 they're just going to be \u2013 the productivity levels, is this going to be a little bit later than you thought it was going to be, is that how we should think about it?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Yeah, we've been 110,000. We just got 120,000. In order to get \u2013 and we think kind of at the 120,000 level we can hit November, and now we'll use up all our margin. So the objective right now, based on this kind of ambitious schedule that we've laid out, is to do the best we can to improve margin, to get back to kind of an April in-service. In order to do that, we need to continuously evaluate, continuously monitor, but otherwise get new people to the site and get the hours worked per-week up. That is how we improve margin.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And do you feel that you're going to \u2013 that's very achievable, right? I just want to make sure I understand how confident you guys are in being able to do that.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","We certainly are confident of our ability to attract more people to the site and therefore improve margin. We certainly are confident and this remains unchanged, of our ability to hit November. What we're about now is improving the margin to November and recall the on-site schedule is one where we're aiming at April.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I got it. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige of Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed.","Kit Konolige - Bloomberg LP (Research)","Hey, guys.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Hello. Kit, I hope you're well.","Kit Konolige - Bloomberg LP (Research)","Yeah, everything's good. How about you?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","It's fantastic.","Kit Konolige - Bloomberg LP (Research)","All right. I wanted in a little bit different arena to ask about the sales number. So year-to-date, you're showing positive weather adjusted sales, looks like pretty well spread across most of the customer classes. Can you give us some color on how confident you are that that's a realistic ongoing sales growth number and does it have more to do with customer usage or increase in customers? Just any sense of how much that can be projected into the future?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","So I think all good questions related to sales. Our retail sales growth year-to-date weather normalized is up about 1.1%. That's pretty broad based. If you look at residential, it's 0.8%, commercial is about 0.6% and industrial is up almost 2% year-to-date. If I look at weather in the year, about $0.05 of benefit occurred in the first half and about $0.03 of it occurred in this last quarter, it certainly was a very strong third quarter for generation.","Customer usage is generally flat. That's maybe a little bit better than what we had initially anticipated. Efficiency will be a persistent trend and one that we certainly aren't here to buck, the efficiency of underlying equipment has improved materially from its original placement. And so we really will rely on in-migration into our state's good manufacturing and good industrial demand, and I think retail will plug right along but will be partially offset certainly by efficiency.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Drew. The other thing that we always kind of laugh at each other in the group I think is weather-adjusted number. So, we really do work hard at getting good numbers, but I'm always a little skeptical as to the weather adjustment. For example, in 2017, we had a hurricane, so we had to adjust out the effect of a hurricane year-over-year. Next year, we've had Hurricane Michael in the fourth quarter.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We're going to have to adjust all that out. These adjustments, we do the best we can. I'm always a little squeamish about them.","Kit Konolige - Bloomberg LP (Research)","Fair enough.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I would say our margin of error in the net is probably in the tenths of a percent. We had a very abnormal January that was kind of outside of the normal distribution, we had one of the warmest Septembers, and we're really not making any hurricane adjustment. We still had really good consumption despite having a number of customers off. It was benefited by the fact that it was just a very short period of time and had excellent reconstruction effort throughout Florida and Georgia.","Kit Konolige - Bloomberg LP (Research)","That's great. Very helpful insight.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Charles. Good morning.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good morning. Hey. Just on China. It sounds like you still have people there. I wonder, Tom, if you could say roughly how many. There's still one or two plants under construction, you've got people there, you've got people at the two operating plants. How long are you going to keep them there? If you could just \u2013 no details, just if you can provide a little more color?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, we've had about a couple dozen people over there. They're now starting to matriculate back to the U.S., so we're not going to have permanent staffing there. We've really been there during the construction. So, now that these guys are going in-service, there's really no need to have them there.","We continue to have a good exchange with the Chinese about the plants, and the NRC frankly has been very constructive in thinking about how those plants have operated and started up much better than what people expected. We have kept our own estimates on start-up constant, but we're very gratified with the experience the Chinese have had.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Okay. That's all I had. Thanks, Tom.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan of Verition Fund Management. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Ashar, how are you?","Ashar Hasan Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC","Pretty good, Tom. Thanks. Can I just ask where are we with our equity ratios or expect to be by the end of the year versus what is authorized? And my second follow-up question is how should we use the proceeds? There're going to be like $6.6 billion of proceeds in the first half of 2019 that you're going to accrue from the sales. What would be the use of funds for those proceeds?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","So, on equity ratios I think we are at target in the Georgia franchises, which is right at 55%. We've got a longer ramp into Alabama's capitalization and expect 55% by 2025 there. Your question was around use of proceeds. The entire backlog of equity requirement is there really to meet those equity needs and so we will fund as we generate.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC","But can I just ask you like the $6.6 billion, right, so can we assume that you don't need equity next year because you'll be getting like $6.6 billion of proceeds coming in in the first six months of 2019? The rest is used for funding and debt reduction or how should I use that $6.6 billion?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Right. So I think we've got a reconciliation of it in the slides that we put out with the call. The total need has been reduced to $2.4 billion.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Over the next five years.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Over the next five years.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And so we could be creative in how we do that, but we'll follow up with...","Ashar Hasan Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC","Well, that's what I was trying to get some color on that, is that do you need to issue equity next year, because you're getting so many proceeds in 2019?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Absolutely. So page eight is the best place for you to go. And we can certainly follow up with you and IR, but even though the asset sale in Florida may represent over $6 billion, we are very cognizant of our credit quality and so that comes with an associated paydown of debt that will help us maintain our FFO to debt ratios and our debt to total capitalization.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So your triangulation there is going to get to a 16% FFO to debt.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And that would imply some level of equity.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Whether we take it there, accelerate it or not we have flexibility to do that.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC","Okay. Thank you so much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Carl Seligson of Utility Financial Experts. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Carl Seligson, be still my beating heart.","Carl Seligson - Utility Financial Experts","You're wonderful, Tom. I hope it clears up your cold too, so you don't have to keep reaching for whatever you're reaching for. Tom, are you maintaining a list or either on paper or in your head, or something of people who because of their interest like Northern States interest, might be interested in future transactions and have you got a list of future possible transactions, because you've started being a financial expert, I just wonder where you're going with it?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I'm sorry, Carl, what was the point of that?","Carl Seligson - Utility Financial Experts","I don't know.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, look...","Carl Seligson - Utility Financial Experts","Is there anything more coming down the line in your head if not actually on paper as far as asset transactions so that you can...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Of course. The world of M&A covers assets, it covers companies, it covers everything, and we try and have the same discipline whether we're buying or selling. Particularly, I thought we bought very smartly with AGL Resources. And when you think about some of the PE multiples and implied share prices, therefore, of the sales that we've done, we think we've accreted enormously to shareholder value well over, I don't know, $3 billion or $4 billion here. We're always looking over our hand here, whether we're a buyer or a seller, and you're right.","I mean we kind of laugh about it, but like my good friend Ben Fowke up there at Xcel, I did pick up the phone and call Ben and just see what his interest was. We have plenty of opportunities whether to use the phone or bump into each other at a variety of meetings that we have.","It's a very interesting environment right now. The good news is it's an option laden environment. I think there's a lot of interest and activity both on the buying and selling realm for a variety of people, some of which are conventional, strategic buyers and some of which are the financial buyers, the non-strategics. Anyway, there's a very active evaluation going on in the market right now and we're certainly participating in that.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","The best owner is really strong internal concept and Northern States is the off-taker for Mankato. It makes a lot of sense for business simplification for both ourselves and for that company, and I think that's a very good reason why they are the best owner of that asset...","Carl Seligson - Utility Financial Experts","I think that makes a lot of sense, thanks for that add on, and Tom I'm sorry, I'm going to miss you all in San Francisco, but I can't make it this year.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Oh, man, I hate that. It's always good catching up. Hey, I'm so appreciative of you joining us on the call. Really good hearing from you.","Carl Seligson - Utility Financial Experts","Thank you, my friend. Take care.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir.

Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides of this conference call. You can follow along by accessing the slides posted on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Tom Fanning","Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Art will go through the details in a few minutes, but first I would like to highlight two of the key drivers of our first quarter earnings growth; cold weather and continued economic growth.","First, the weather story. Around the industry, much has been reported lately on the polar vortex, the Southeast experienced the second coldest first quarter in the last 20 years and we set a new all time winter peak on our system of 39,130 megawatts. While the colder than normal weather had an obvious impact on revenue, that\u2019s not the only important story.","Operationally the Southern Company\u2019s system delivered on our commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to the customers and communities we serve as demonstrated by our crew\u2019s tireless work under the most challenging of circumstances to restore power to nearly 800,000 customers affected by the severe ice storm in mid February. The winter weather also underscored the importance of developing the full portfolio of energy resources. As weather-related demand and delivery challenges proved once again how volatile natural gas prices can be, Southern Company dispatched one of the industry\u2019s most diverse and the liable generation fleets, delivering more than $100 million in fuel cost savings by taking advantage of our fuel optionality.","Second, the economy continues to improve. 9 of our 10 largest industrial sectors which account for approximately 80% of industrial sales reflected positive year-over-year growth for the first quarter and all 10 of them were positive in March. Combined with solid customer growth and usage growth in our residential class, we were increasingly confident in the sustained momentum of the Southeast economy.","Let\u2019s turn now to our major projects. Construction progress continues at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia and at the Kemper County energy facility in Mississippi. First, tremendous progress continues in the construction of the Vogtle project which remained on schedule for the fourth quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2018 for Units 3 and 4 respectively.","Nearly two months ago, as planned, we successfully executed the heaviest lift to-date placing the 2.2 million pound CA20 module into the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. Our critical path focus remains on the major elements of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island with the CA05 module scheduled to be installed in the second quarter.","Other signs of our continued construction progress include the walls and concrete under the containment vessel, which will support the installation of the shield building panels later this year. Outside of the Nuclear Island, we continue to progress on the major other elements including the cooling tower and turbine building.","We are also very pleased with the progress on both the Unit 4. The CR-10 module, commonly known as the cradle was placed in the Nuclear Island during the first quarter and the containment vessel\u2019s bottom head is scheduled to be set in May.","In February, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Dr. Ernie Moniz joined us as the Vogtle site to commemorate America\u2019s first loan guarantee for nuclear construction. The DOE loan provides a committed source of funds that reduces financial risk, while delivering an estimated $250 million and present value benefit to Georgia Power customers. These savings should translate to lower base rates for customers over the life of the loan.","Including the DOE loan benefits, Georgia Power highlighted $2.3 billion of customer benefits in the combined 9th and 10th VCM report filed at the end of February. This came on the heels of the favor vote by the Georgia PSE to verify and improve the actual capital cost reflected in the 8th VCM. The current VCM report, which reflects $389 million of actual 2013 spending is expected to be voted on by the commission in August.","Turning now to the Kemper project, where we are winding down construction and ramping up our start-up activity. We continue to work toward our next major milestone, the heat up of the first gasifier, which is now scheduled for mid to late summer.","Additionally, we expect to place the combined cycle portion of the plan in the commercial operation this summer. As we mentioned last quarter, the start-up activity for the combined cycle are largely complete and it is expected to be able to serve customer\u2019s energy need during the upcoming peak season.","As we shared in our most recent disclosure, we\u2019ve experienced decreases in construction labor productivity due to a combination of adverse weather, labor turnover and inefficiencies. Having assessed the impact of these issues and the risks that additional unanticipated factors could have on the construction and start-up of the project, we\u2019ve recorded an additional pre-tax charge of $380 million.","This estimate includes the previously disclosed $184 million in increased labor and weather related expenses and additional $135 million due to the extension of the expected in service date and 61 million of incremental construction costs as an adjustment to the earlier number.","Our confidence remains high in the value of the TRIG technology and the entire Kemper project to Mississippi Power\u2019s customers. Our ongoing commitment to safety and quality is a primary importance as we focus on completing construction of this first of a kind plant and working through instrumentation and controls integration that is critical for the project success.","Meanwhile, Southern Power continues to expand its generation portfolio. Recently Southern Power closed on the 20 megawatt Adobe Solar Facility, our second solar plant in California. This brings Southern Power\u2019s solar portfolio to approximately 222 megawatts, all with quality, long term contracts.","We continue to work diligently on additional projects and hope to announce another solar acquisition very soon. Looking ahead, we remain confident in Southern Power\u2019s ability to execute its business plans for remainder of the year.","I will now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic review.","Art Beattie","Thanks Tom. For the first quarter of 2014, we earned $0.39 per share compared to $0.09 per share in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.30 per share. Included in these results for the first quarter of 2014 is an after tax charge against earnings of $235 million or $0.27 per share related to the current cost estimate for Kemper as detailed in the 8-K we filed yesterday.","Included in the 2013 results are after tax charges of $333 million or $0.38 per share for increased cost of the Kemper project and $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease investment. Excluding these items, we earned $0.66 per share in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2013, an increase of $0.17 per share.","The major factors which influenced our year-over-year adjusted earnings were weather, economic growth and retail revenue effects at our traditional operating companies. A detailed summary of the earnings drivers can be found in our slide deck for this call.","Weather in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the first quarter of 2013, added $0.08 per share to our earnings. Weather was $0.07 above normal for the first quarter of 2014, compared with $0.01 below normal for the first quarter of 2013.","Average temperatures were almost 5 degrees below normal and as a result, we saw the second highest number of heating degree days in 20 years.","Total weather normal retail sales for the first quarter of 2014 increased 1.3% compared with the first quarter of 2013. Our original forecast was based on a GDP growth estimate of between 2.5% and 2.7%. While it\u2019s still early in the year, it appears as though GDP growth estimates could actually be between 2.7% and 3%.","Weather normal residential sales increased 1.2% over the first quarter of 2013. Residential sales were positively affected in almost equal parts by an increase in usage, reflecting demand growth beyond the amount avoided through energy efficiency, and the addition of 10,000 new customers in the first quarter of 2014.","The first quarter industrial sales increased 2.8% compared with the first quarter of 2013, continuing the strong performance and momentum seen for 10 straight months. Manufacturing employment growth in our service territories exceeded the national pace in a first quarter that featured growth that was very broad-based. Some specific examples of segments that performed particularly well were primary metals and transportation, which grew at 6.4% and 6% respectively. In addition housing related segments including stone clay and glass, textiles and lumber as group grew approximately 6% year-over-year.","This positive momentum was also evident at the port of Savannah where container exports increased 8.1% over the first quarter of 2013. Finally, one of the best leading indicators is economic development activity. The pipeline remains robust with 340 potential projects that could deliver 30,000 more jobs and generate more than $11 billion in additional capital investment.","This reflects a 58% increase in projects, a 46% increase in potential jobs and a 107% increase in potential capital investment, compared with the same period last year. This potential is on top of a very strong quarter of announcements, which are expected to create an additional 3,000 additional jobs and represents $4.5 billion in new capital investment.","Before turning the call back over to Tom, I\u2019d like to share two additional items. First, as we have shared many times over the years, Southern Company is committed to maintaining a high degree of financial integrity including our single A credit rating. This commitment has served our customers and shareholders well by providing low cost financing and beneficial access to the capital markets.","Our plan to issue equity, which included a total of $1.3 billion of new equity over the 2013 and 2014 time frame contemplated additional risks for the Kemper project.","As a result and based on all of our current assumptions, we do not anticipate the need to increase our equity issuances due to the new charges reflected in our earnings results. We continuously monitor our capital structure and relevant credit metrics. As conditions change whether it is unexpected cost or better than expected success in acquiring new project at Southern Power. We will reforecast our equity needs as necessary.","Finally, I'd like to share with you our earnings per share estimate for the second quarter of 2014, which is $0.66 per share.","I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","","Tom Fanning","Thank you, Art. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors voted to increase Southern Company\u2019s common dividend to an annualize rate of $2.10 per share an increase of approximately 3.5%. This marks the 13th consecutive year that our dividend is increased. In fact since 2002, our dividend has increased a total of 57%. This track record is a direct reflection of the strength of our business model and the region our company serves. We have the privileged of serving 4.4 million customers in a region with an improving economy and a stable constructive regulatory environment. Our value proposition is bolstered by our ability to deliver industry leading customer satisfaction, lower electricity prices and the highest level of reliability.","In fact, the success of our customer focused strategy and how well this positioned the company to earned top quartile returns and generate strong operating cash flow over the long-term is the underpinning of our Board\u2019s dividend action.","Despite our challenges with the Kemper project. Our performance during the first quarter is a direct results of the sustaining successes, we produced elsewhere in our business during 2013. We will continue our focus on providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to customers and the communities we serve which supports our value proposition objectives for investors.","We are now ready to take your questions. So operator, we'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Good afternoon, guys. How are you?","Tom Fanning","","Super. Hope you are well.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Thank you, I am. So in reading through your 8-K on Kemper there was also a section where you discussed because of the decision to delay to start up to May 15th a reduction in bonus depreciation. So in order for you guys to not have to sort of pin that on the shareholder what now has to happen on the regulatory front?","Art Beattie","Yes, Greg, it's Art. As a number of things that could happen. That is not part of any of the write-off amount that we have included in the numbers today. We are in the process of working with regulators in Mississippi to reach what we think will be a global settlement of prudents and issues related to our seven year rate plan. Now with the loss of bonus depreciation, we will certainly have to rework the seven year rate plan assuming that that bonus depreciation is lost and we will come back and address that in a minute, in order to make sure that we don\u2019t violate tax modernization rules. So that\u2019s an absolute requirement.","Now when we think about bonus depreciation there is a couple of item avenues here; one could be that, we get an extended bill coming out of congress that extends bonus depreciation in the \u201815, so that would take care of it on its own.","Secondly there could be issues in our global settlement whereby we mitigate the impact on customers. So all of these things are in kind of a settlement stage with the commission as we address how we will help that through the regulatory process.","Tom Fanning","One other point we anticipate. You know that we produce electricity during I think in January made about a $1 million in revenue at the combined cycle. We expect that to go into dispatch this summer and go into service, as that goes into service that eliminates a flood of the bonus depreciation at [rents].","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Combine cycles are running off, our natural gas plant (inaudible) rate in the plan now?","Tom Fanning","Right.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Got it. One more question on the negative side and then a positive one. So on the Vogtle we haven\u2019t heard much on sort of the trending what\u2019s going on and important investor with regard to your case against CBI, more we heard any progress publically on the potential settlement, can you give us an update on where that stands and whether or not the costs, all things equal, notwithstanding the overrun that you're dealing with there have been staying pretty steady and on track?","Tom Fanning","Yes, Greg, I'm not sure, there is going to be much of a substantive update, it would be roughly the same we've been telling you. Essentially, we have venue in Augusta, we have, I think askings by both the Consortium and us with respect to the dispute.","I think the issue resides more clearly within the Consortium right now, they have issues to work out among and between themselves that's Toshiba, Westinghouse, and Shaw. But we have constructive conversation with those folks all the time. In fact, I want to say next week, Philip Asherman, the CEO of Chicago Bridge and Iron, I think the Head of Westinghouse, representatives from Toshiba, Georgia Power Management, Southern Company Management we are all meeting at Plant Vogtle.","We do that regularly just a kind of cut through any of the issue, in order to continue to advance project as well as it has been. So, I guess the point is we continue to have a very good relationship and I think we have said before, it's much better now when Shaw is out and Chicago Bridge and Iron is in. We'll see, it could happen quickly or it could happen late.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Great. And my final question is I'm noticing and it's not just you guys, but we're on the front-end of earnings, but there's been a handful of companies where their weather-normal sales growth numbers in the first quarter tracked ahead of the baseline expectation for the full year. Are we seeing just a little bit more of a bounce in the economy than you had modeled because you wanted to be conservative or is there some friction in your weather normalization model, when you have really extreme moves in weather that was the explanation one or the other managements gave, they are not sure that they are getting an accurate weather normal reading because it was such a big, such a strong weather quarter.","So is it, we are definitively trending better or is that we won\u2019t really know till we get a few more quarters ahead?","Art Beattie","Yes, Greg it is Art. And I have always said that weather normalization is more of an art than the science. But when we look at industrial sales, industrial sales are largely not weather normalized. So when we have a 2.8% increase in industrial sales that\u2019s a very good strong indicator. And as we have talked about in our remarks earlier, that\u2019s the 10th month in a row we\u2019ve had year-over-year growth in our industrial sales. So that is not impacted by what you brought up.","Now on the residential side, we could be seeing a little bit of that, but it is only one quarter growth, we did have a 0.5% growth in the fourth quarter. So, if it\u2019s not 1.3, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a whole lot less than that due to the fact that we have got extreme cold temperature.","Tom Fanning","","And my position with the fed, the fed was more bullish than we were, as we developed our annual guidance and just as of the first quarter, here again one quarter does not a year tail, but it does indicate that kind of economic, the macroeconomic effects or more closely 2.7 to 3 in terms of GDP than they were, our 2.5 to 2.7. So we\u2019ll see if it\u2019s a good start.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Great. Thank you guys.","Tom Fanning","","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital. Please proceed.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Hey Tom, hey Art how are you?","Tom Fanning","Hey Jim. Good.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Hey I am confused and don\u2019t comment on that. So, your second quarter last year was $0.66 and you\u2019re guiding to $0.66 for the second quarter this year. What might be some of the big mechanics that would at least, under that condition would put you at the high-end of your $2.72 to $2.80 guidance range for 2014?","Art Beattie","Yes, good question Jim. When you look at non-fuel O&M and I think we outlined this on our last call, we estimated we\u2019re going to spend roughly $300 million more at least in our regulated core business than we did in 2013. And if you look at our spending in the first quarter, it was only up year-over-year about 1.3%. So, we\u2019ve got some heavier lift to do on the expense side for the remainder of the year and when you look at our outage schedule, it is somewhat back-end loaded as well.","There are few other elements, at least in the quarter-over-quarter numbers that you need to remember. Alabama Power had entered into an accounting order that allowed them to differ some non-nuclear outage cost this year which will make their non-fuel O&M look a little lower year-over-year and that\u2019s a big influence on the first quarter non-fuel O&M numbers. But when you look at the O&M that we\u2019re going to add this year, at least in the second quarter along with new rates and you don\u2019t take normal weather, you\u2019re seeing about the flattish kind of equation there.","Tom Fanning","Jim, Art and I talked about this stuff all the time. It\u2019s not -- don\u2019t be ashamed to be confused, we have the same questions here. But I think it really does go to our pattern of O&M being roughly flat for the first quarter that presumed you\u2019re going to spend a lot more in the rest of the year. So, I think that really kind of does go there.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Okay. But I\u2019m glad the same way and I\u2019m still confused on Kemper County now if you don\u2019t mind me changing topics. So, I just need to be -- my memory needs to be refreshed. So, if the gasifier goes into service, let\u2019s just call September 1st. How do the mechanics work under all that if you\u2019re a customer of Mississippi Power, who benefits?","Tom Fanning","","The economic to Mississippi\u2019s customers are relatively fixed. In other words, there is $2.4 billion that they accrue; they had a full mix of capital up to 288. It\u2019s the (inaudible).","Art Beattie","","Jim, you said gasifier, did you mean the combustion turbines?","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","I\u2019m sorry. Yes, I did say gasifier, I apologize.","Tom Fanning","","No, I\u2019m okay.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Combustion turbines; I'm sorry. That's my mistake.","Art Beattie","","No, no problem.","Tom Fanning","Well, I mean a lot of how that might work is tied up in this global settlement as well. There is a host of issues; in fact there was some language in the recent continuance of discussions which indicated that there is some conversation going on between the company and the staff. So, I would like look for all of that to be kind of handled as much as it could in that settlement.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Any idea on the timing when that might happen?","Tom Fanning","","Not really, but look forward in the months ahead here.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Fanning","","Yes, sir.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Hey good afternoon.","Tom Fanning","","Hey Dan. How are you doing?","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","I am doing great, thank you. You guys when you kind of talked about the growth rate update last quarter and you pointed to the back-end of this decade, the reacceleration environmental CapEx part of that being coal ash some other things. We\u2019ve seen some other folks in the region have some issues around coal ash. I wonder if you could just kind of walk through maybe in a little more detailed spending that you guys have there and kind of how that paces out with more scrutiny. Does that change the timeline for when you guys may start spending that money?","Tom Fanning","I am going to turn this over to Art in a second, but if I think you kind of globally look at it here, we kind of have $6 billion of future environmental compliance investments that will manifest themselves at the end of the decade. Certainly coal ash is part of that, certainly affluent guideline, certainly 316(b).","There are a lot of moving parts there and the number can move pretty dramatically both in terms of the quantum, again our estimated $6 billion, as well as the timing. And it would not surprise us, but that these other issues could have some bearing hands to the ultimate resolution for a company like us. We are following it very closely and we will see.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. And I guess on the Casper decision where it is right now, is that going to have any effect on near-term spending or is the mass obligations pretty well covered for you guys?","Art Beattie","Dan, the mass contemplates most of that, I think when the original Casper was passed it was prior to the development or finalization the (inaudible) so since they both directed it, SO2 and NOx, most of that will be addressed through SCRs, through scrubbers or to whatever other compliance equipment we may have added to the unit. There maybe some small change dispatch of some of the units, the smaller coal units that are further back in the stack and won\u2019t operate a lot. And so, the only real impact made the fuel cost on an extreme depth. ","Tom Fanning","Yes. It is much more a dispatch energy issue than a capital issue for us. The math already spoke to the capital. ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay. So, one more on coal, we've heard a few people talking about little more concern about coal inventories for the summer after the cold winter having to run the coal fleet hard. Where do you guys sit on your coal inventories in, how is that they\u2019re going to get, captured if you have to start buying more actively in the open market to the fuel mechanisms?","Tom Fanning","It's fascinating, we made a big play in the past we talked a lot about 70% coal six years ago, 16% gas now. What we said before was 45% gas, 35% coal. Fascinating, average gas prices during the first quarter of \u201814 were 5 bucks in round numbers. First quarter \u201813, they were $350, so you are up almost 50% in gas prices with coal prices being relatively constant.","So, what that\u2019s done is we\u2019ve been able to shift our dispatch around to save our customers about a $100 million. So, we\u2019re marginally more on coal and gas is what we saw in the first quarter kind of 42 coal 38 gas. It's fascinating to kind of think about how that may roll out for the rest of the year.","Art Beattie","Dan, when you think about our inventories, we are very close to the targets we've set for ourselves this year. We are building up coal supply to meet the summer peak demands. And that will basically runs our average target to up to 35, from 35 45 days. So, we are just in the process right now of rebuilding after we increased our burns quite a bit of first quarter, above what we thought it would be.","Tom Fanning","","And that moves around a lot from plant to plant, obviously if we have plants like the branch unit that we\u2019re planning to close a little bit later, you will treat those a little bit differently than you will kind of ball win or a share or a (inaudible).","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Tom Fanning","","Yes sir, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","","Hey Steve.","","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","","Hey Tom just a follow-up on that last question. Would you, is it fair to characterize that you are running gas more maybe in the shorter months, so that you can rebuilt the coal piles or is it just you\u2019re just running dispatchers normally word and you just bring him more coal in?","Art Beattie","Yes, we're in great shape, we are running normal.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","","Okay. Just maybe if you could spend a little more time you mentioned that you\u2019re starting to work on settlement and Mississippi of various issues. Could you disclose or remind us what the issues are, is it both the good indication that you got, that you trying to kind of wrap altogether? And timelines and how much your are people cut on board together, is there going to be a lot opposition, likelihood that you able to get a settlement?","Art Beattie","Well, we think there is an opportunity for both the regulators and the companies to come out with some kind of agreement here. The 7 year rate plan was designed to recover cost and keep rates at the set level that we agreed to in January of \u201813 and that was a 15% increase in rates last year followed on by 3% rate increase this year, both of which are in place.","So, as these numbers move around, as our in service state moves around, we\u2019re going to have to amend that to make sure that we comply with tax normalization rules as I mentioned. So that\u2019s one element. And there are some other pieces of the pie that we might be able to include in the ground settlement that will keep customers [on those] in this agreement.","But it\u2019s mostly focused around those two very issues, 7 year rate plan and the prudency issue. We would like to get those solved on a simultaneous basis. ","Tom Fanning","And I guess just roll into that the in service of the combined cycle. We fully expect those to run. They\u2019re actually attractive and we\u2019ve actually had some interest in the wholesale markets for those things. All this could be round up together we think in a beneficial discussion.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","And just timing of this and\u2026?","Tom Fanning","It\u2019s always hard to predict those things. We\u2019ve got the continuance order. Let that play out and let events take their course.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. And then separately on Vogtle, I might have missed this in your presentation but is there any updates on the schedule for the Vogtle units and if not when will we get the next schedule update?","Art Beattie","As we filed in our VCM 9 and 10, we reiterated our plan to leave the schedule in place, CLD dates for Unit 3 fourth quarter of \u201817, Unit 4 fourth quarter of \u201818. And we did not change the amount that we are contemplating in terms of overnight costs at the same time.","Tom Fanning","And if you just go back Steve to the VCM 8 filings, that is our most recent schedule. Now of course we always continue to move things around within but that\u2019s it. And I would argue that probably Unit 4 is actually probably a little bit ahead. So we feel very good about our schedule right now.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. And just timing commentary from SCANA which obviously different units. But can you talk about having kind of a new schedule from the E&C guys in the fall to layout? Is that a time line that\u2019s relevant for you at all, are you just on a separate track?","Tom Fanning","It's interesting. I mean we try to work together to coordinate that practices and share information and a variety of other things. But it is very clear that we have a different contract. And without commenting on their situation, I can tell you that our contract as we suggested in the past is essentially fixed with performance schedules that are also fixed. So, I wouldn't spend a lot of time comparing say for example CA20 for us and CA20 for them.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay.","Tom Fanning","You will have -- they are operating under a different regime than we are.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks Tom.","Tom Fanning","Yes, sir.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","","Hey Michael.","Art Beattie","","Hey Mike.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","","Hey guys. Can you hear me?","Tom Fanning","","Yes.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Okay, thank you. Sorry, having a little phone issue. Couple of questions, if I look at your fourth quarter 2013 slide deck and went back to the appendix just at the CapEx by subsidiary, can you just walk us through -- and a lot of this is Kemper driven but a little of it may also be Southern Power driven. Just what\u2019s different from the CapEx you laid out for 2014 through \u201816 back on slide 25 of your fourth quarter deck versus what it is today when you look forward for the next couple of years?","Art Beattie","Well, Kemper will change a bit as we push more dollars into \u201815 now. And when I think about all the other companies, nothing has really changed that I\u2019m aware of. Our plan for Southern Power remains, some of that is capital for maintenance and other capital for our expansion point. So when I think broadly about that Michael, I just can\u2019t see a lot of change that is occurred since that day.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And so what\u2019s the -- I just want to make sure I am getting Kemper right. What\u2019s the remaining amount of CapEx at Kemper for 2014, meaning second quarter through the end of the year and then is the amount -- is that $25 million a month number for 2015 kind of still the good number, so four or five months into 2015?","Art Beattie","Yes. If you look at it, we got about $925 million remaining; about 800 of that in \u201814 and the remainder, the 125 would be five months in 2015.","Tom Fanning","That\u2019s the 25 a month.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","And maintenance CapEx is a little bit $100 million, $150 million, so that will get total Mississippi Power?","Art Beattie","That is correct.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Okay. On nuclear construction question, just curious is there any insight or any update you can provide from the folks in China, who are couple of years ahead of us in the process in terms of building new nuclear plants? Just any updates on kind of the construction timeline for either Sandman or the other units that are coming on line there that are using AP1000? ","Tom Fanning","Sandman and [Haiyang] you know that we have people that live there. And other various members of our team go there from time to time. It's interesting to think about how that's helped us. Some of it -- I would argue the very first benefit that we've seen out of all them going first and our people on-site have been supply chain related. I would argue also the way that some of the material was handled on site, once it is fabricated has been helpful for us. We've had better performance than they have.","There are some significant differences, particularly in the late end construction, where when you think about for example module, you think about how these things are racked, they tend to be much more people intensive than we are. Our processes tend to be much more automated.","The other thing that we find is where they have a specific problem, can we learn from it? Well, I'll tell you one, the way some of the panels were erected, they erected them horizontally. When they were picked up, they deformed a little bit and they had to worry about correcting that. What we learned was to erect to them vertically, so we didn't have that kind of deformation.","The other thing is just kind of issues that relate to the engineering around some pieces of equipment, I know one issue has been reactor coolant pump. I know one that\u2019s in service in China, we have that equipment, it will be resolved to our satisfaction well in advanced of any critical path.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","","Got it. Okay guys, thank you very much and appreciate the update.","Tom Fanning","Yes, sir. Thank you for calling in.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning ","","Hey, Paul.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Good afternoon. How are you?","Tom Fanning","","Super. Hope you are well.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","","Thank you. You\u2019ve mentioned some little room in your equity forecast, I mean is there continued pressures at Kemper, is there still contingency built in there?","Art Beattie","","We are probably on the cost, if we have additional cost then we may need, it depends on any other offsetting issues, either in CapEx or that might affect our equity needs, but we\u2019ll keep an eye on that over time and certainly advise you of any needs we may have. Again our target Paul is 44% equity ratio and right now we're solid in that range.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","","As I administered, you didn\u2019t address annual guidance on the call?","Tom Fanning","","We almost never do that, what we do is we do annual guidance twice a year, we do it once in January that sums up kind of where we believe we will be for the year, and then as been our practice really since I was CFO, so we're dialing back eight years or so now. We only do a revision annual guidance once we get through the third quarter, so it\u2019s typically our October phone call. What we provide is just quarterly estimates beyond that.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Fanning","Yes sir. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies","Good afternoon guys.","Tom Fanning","Hi Anthony.","Anthony Crowdell \u2013 Jefferies","Just following up on Paul's question, I think the guidance for equity in '13 and '14 was roughly about $1.3 billion. How much of that has been issued already?","Art Beattie","","In the first quarter we issued right at the $140 million so we\u2019re on track for our $600 million number this year. ","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies","And I guess lastly, when you think of Kemper and you guys have quantified maybe 2015 roughly $25 million a month I guess, over budget or incremental charges, what do you think is the biggest risk on cost overruns there? I mean it seems like there\u2019s been a labor issue, last quarter you spoke about and also this quarter, what\u2019s the biggest issue I guess with or sensitivity with higher cost at Kemper?","Tom Fanning","So I think it remains, we\u2019ve been very confident on that. When you transition away from construction to start up that\u2019s kind of the lion share of risk ahead of us now. The integration of the different systems of Kemper, it\u2019s a very complex animal in a combined cycle unit you may have three systems that need integration. Recall this one is coal gasification, it is gas handling equipment and all those related things, it\u2019s about 13 different systems. I mean I\u2019d like to think of it like fine tuning a 6 cylinder car versus a 12 cylinder car.","So just getting the integration of the various systems through start up is the biggest issue. Beyond that it is I think the unknown, unknown there is always something that could happen and nobody can contemplate. We, I think are allowing for normal disruptions through start-up you have those anyway it\u2019s something that nobody has foreseen we\u2019ll see.","When we rethought this schedule I can tell you we did a lot of soul-searching about it. You know from following us that we're a conservative company we always try and take a long view. And I think it is absolutely the right thing to do in our judgment to adjust this schedule. Because even though it produces some near-term pain, this is absolutely the long-term trajectory that represents best interest for our customer. And it\u2019s so important that we get it right at the outset. So that's what you see us doing here.","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies","Just lastly like a really weird question more like to your point unknown, unknown, it seems like the conventional part of the Kemper unit or Kemper plant CCGT whatever is working fine, you\u2019ve produced electric first quarter. Are there any changes to that seven-year rate plan you guys entered into back in January of '13, if the gasifier just for some reason just doesn\u2019t really reach commercial operation as intended?","Tom Fanning","There is nothing in the seven year rate plan, that is contemplated around that. But I will remind you Anthony that we have a lot of experience with our pilot project. Whereby we have overtime protected the operation of the gasifier. So our confident in the gasifier and having problems with it, is not high on the list. But as Tom mentioned, we have the gas clean up island, so we\u2019ve got to be able to continually integrate the gasifier, the clean up island and collection of the bio product and delivery of the reliable syngas in order to make sure that this plant operates as intend.","And as know we talk about this in the past, where we made mistakes I think on this project, was entering into a fixed price commitment back like 2009 or so, with only 10% of the engineering and I think where we did the feed studies and all we were very good in terms of what combined cycle allowance is going to cost and how the gasifier where we got bit was in the gas handling systems remember as we ramped up or carbon capture profile quantity and the type, the quality and the type, hangers and all the related equipment, it\u2019s going to be that we had a lack of experience.","The good news is we do have expenses to gasifier, we have the combine cycles already working. We know that the gas management system exists elsewhere, so my sense is all these component will work that\u2019s my judgment integrating them and optimizing them and time tuning them is going to be the challenge.","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies","Great, thanks for the color, guys. I really appreciated.","Tom Fanning","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar Equity Research. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","Hey, Mark.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Equity Research","Hey, good afternoon guys, how are you?","Tom Fanning","Great.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Equity Research","You talked a lot about Kemper and Vogtle. Can I just ask a couple quick questions around Southern Power to round it out? You mentioned you might have something coming down the pipe pretty soon here in terms of another solar project. Assuming that that is the case would that largely speak for the placeholder that you have in your CapEx guidance for the optional Southern Power projects for the year?","Art Beattie","","Yes, we had outlined Mark about, I think it was a 100 megawatts expansion in 2014 and roughly what we\u2019re talking about is somewhere near half of that, that with we've got other projects that we\u2019ve got on our list as well. So, we feel very good about our plan, our expansion plan for this year and for next.","Tom Fanning","Yes, every Board meeting or update the finance committee with essentially a red, yellow, green list of potential projects. Looking at the health of those development activities, we have a lot of confidence on Southern Power's ability to execute this year.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Equity Research","","Great. And just one nitpicky detail on the quarterly results for Southern Power, despite the topline growth you had some lower profitability on the operating line, I'm just curious is that sort of a one-time thing or was there anything in particular that was driving that?","Tom Fanning","We had some solar contracts who are (inaudible) some energy margins, I guess from the contracts with solar plants that were in service say midyear, last year, mid to late last year, that quarter-over-quarter increased revenues. But we also had a onetime tax issue that occurred, that was really a big help too. And had we not have the onetime tax issue, we may have been at or just below the -- our target for the quarter.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Equity Research","","Okay, makes a lot of sense. Thanks for that.","Tom Fanning","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Tom Fanning","Hey, good afternoon to you.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","","Thank you. Tom, when do you think you're in a position on Kemper to really lock down these costs? And tell us, look, this is it, and I think we don\u2019t expect any more overruns.","Tom Fanning","Hey Ali, I would say could have done that a year ago, every time that we have given you an estimate, it has been our best judgment. When things happen that we can\u2019t foresee we have to adjustments, I hate that but that isn\u2019t fact the case, every time we\u2019ve given an estimate it has been our best judgment at the time.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","","But is there anything in this remaining months to a year for completion where once you cross that line, you can say okay, it's pretty much done or will it go all the way to the end?","Tom Fanning","Well, I mean except for the unknown unknowns right, I mean so, what happens if I mean having forbid there is a tornado that comes across the side, or what happen if there is a major hurricane or what happens if as we integrate the system and just more complex, there is, we are not able to track it effectively or something, everything I know right now, I have great confidence in our ability to execute, we really fought a lot with each other over this latest adjustment, we would still effort our best to get this done in \u201814, but I think given the bawl wave of uncertainty that we were creating by the delay in productivity on the construction as a result of polar vortex one, two and some of the other issues, it just seem to us to be a conservative, prudent, judgment to push the schedule out to make, or I wish I could give you certainty that\u2019s not the nature of the base when you built something like this.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","","Right, also\u2026","Art Beattie","Hi, this is Art. Couple additional elements there and I think we\u2019ve kind of mentioned them already that you\u2019ve got milestones at there, the first gets fire heat up. We get by that we\u2019re producing syngas and then beyond that is making sure that the gasoline of island is doing its job and that we get reliable syngas that we can burn in our combined cycle.","So as we move through those elements. Those are elements of milestones that we\u2019ve set for ourselves that will tell the tail you about where we identify issues.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Enough. Separately, Tom I think in the past you have told us for planning purposes for next three years or so we should assume relatively flat earnings profile for 7 power if I recall correctly, anything change on that front as you\u2019re looking at opportunities today versus few months ago?","Tom Fanning","So not a significant change, but we continue to kick over every stone we can, we mentioned before that we\u2019re looking in some other regions of the United States in order to identify opportunities. It will be fun to see how the nation\u2019s so called organized market develop this year and next. My sense is when you look around the different regions of the United States particularly in the so called organized markets where you see coal plant shutdowns there maybe needs for more capital investment.","I think our model long-term bilaterals, creditworthy counterparties, no fuel risk, no transmission risk is the kind of economic commercial model that will support the kind of CapEx that needs to be brought there to those markets. My sense is particularly with our focus on coal ops in municipal utilities we have some potential to do more than we think we can do. And I can assure you that I guess we had Southern Power two weeks ago, I can assure you that we give them a high goal every time we can.","The other thing that could have some play in that, you maybe aware that Georgia Power then I guess second its phase, their advanced solar initiative, they had one I think it was 2010 that\u2019s called ASI and this was called ASI Prime or something. But it accounts for 525 megawatts of new solar in Georgia, 425 of which is central station and 100 megawatts of which is distributed generation.","We have challenged both of our companies; Southern Power and Georgia Power Wholesale, separate from Southern Power to compete in those businesses, especially with distributed generation around the United States, a lot of people have taken the posture kind of sliding it.","Our view is, let\u2019s do it right, let\u2019s create the right pricing mechanism for the energy and capacity, let\u2019s create the right pricing mechanism one that is fair to all customers for connection to the network and let\u2019s create the right mechanism for back-up generation.","Having done that if customers want it, my view is we should provide it. And so I\u2019ve directed folks inside Southern, and in fact we\u2019re competing with ourselves to play off into that environment. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how those bids turn out, that\u2019s another potential source of growth for us.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Got it. Last question, Tom you\u2019ve also indicated to us in the past as you look at your earnings profile being more back-end loaded in terms of growth, you would have looking at opportunities to fill that gap if you found them out there. Today are you seeing those opportunities, I mean we saw \u201copportunistic transaction\u201d that was announced this morning. Are you seeing opportunities out there for yourselves?","Tom Fanning","Was that an M&A question?","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Well, I think the way you had posted to us, yes; I\u2019m presuming it\u2019s M&A.","Tom Fanning","Okay. So, with us we do asset acquisitions all the time, I mean that\u2019s one of our ways. If you\u2019re talking about corporate M&A, it was interesting, I was -- we were listening to the different shows this morning; CNBC and Bloomberg and all that. A bullish thing on the economy is how much M&A is going on and in fact there seems to be a pretty good bid of it, Exelon and Pepco the latest example in our industry.","I\u2019ve bid on record for this and I bet you guys on the call to give this speech, as well as I can. But this is something that we have a fiduciary obligation always to evaluate, we are always kind of, we have a group of people who competitive and intelligence group here focusing on those deals. My sense is now as it has been forever that those deals are extraordinarily difficult to do, particularly in a regulated environment where for the amount of premium that you will spend in order to acquire the target, you are going to have to earn a return on and return out capital. That from an EVA standpoint is positive for shareholders.","Add to that regulatory complexity and a variety of other things, those are just hard to do. We work hard to try and make sense of them. But I can tell you it\u2019s just really hard and I wouldn\u2019t particularly count on them right now.","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Thank you.","Tom Fanning","Yes, sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","Hello Kit.","Kit Konolige - BGC","Good afternoon guys.","Art Beattie","Hi Kit.","Kit Konolige - BGC","So, just to revisit the Mississippi settlement talk one last time, can I ask who initiated the talks and what were the circumstances of their being settlement talks in the first place?","Art Beattie","Yes Kit, I believe the commission in and around the prudency hearing had pushed the dates of the hearing along with the staff, we\u2019re able to push those hearings out into August. And in some of their public remarks they mentioned the fact that they were looking for discussions towards some kind of agreement both on the prudency issue on the seven year right plan. So, that\u2019s kind of where it all started from and we\u2019re certainly a party to those as well.","Tom Fanning","Since we put the commission directed the staff to engage the company with potential settlement talks. So, we\u2019ll see how it goes.","Kit Konolige - BGC","Right. Okay, got that. And I mean obviously we don\u2019t know until there is not a settlement, but it sounds like you would hope that this could be a pretty comprehensive deal if you got there. Would you envision it as kind of accounting for any future possible further overruns or delays in the time table of the Kemper?","Art Beattie","I think it\u2019s just too early to tell, Kit. There is the prudency issue is important the seven year right plan is pretty important. But there could be other elements to the agreement as well.","Tom Fanning","The in service treatment of the combined cycle unit going forward.","Kit Konolige - BGC","Yes.","Tom Fanning","","And there is a host of things, how you would [wait] together with [path] is important. So, we\u2019ll try and get as comprehensive, as we can.","Kit Konolige - BGC","","Okay. One last thing so I kind of understand this. So obviously given your prior agreement, there can\u2019t be any further rate increases for customers as a result of this. Are we looking at potentially some change in the pattern of future rate increases? In other words, from a financial point of view for shareholders, what could change as a result of a settlement here?","Tom Fanning","Yes. Kit, I\u2019m a little reluctant to kind of dive into profiles and what is, let the talks happen and let\u2019s give a good results for everybody here.","Kit Konolige - BGC","","Okay. Sounds fair to me. Thank you.","Tom Fanning","","Thank you Kit.","Art Beattie","","Thank you Kit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","","Hey, good afternoon.","Tom Fanning","","Hey, good afternoon to you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Excellent. So quick question here, just following-up a little bit on the same wane of thought. Can you walk through how you think about the in service criteria for Kemper regime, and how that process works in Mississippi? I know you talk about a settlement here, but I suppose that\u2019s technically a separate process that we're going to be going through down the line. And then also perhaps a little bit of the key dates as far as that goes, particularly I\u2019m thinking in contrast to some of the performance issues we\u2019ve seen elsewhere.","Tom Fanning","","Yes, look in service has some [concentration] both for tax and for regulatory purposes. For tax purposes, it\u2019s essentially that you are integrated into the grid and you can demonstrate. We\u2019ve already demonstrated we can run Tampa to help during peak periods; we did that during Vogtle. And it\u2019s fun to actually have a live shot of the construction sites to both Vogtle and Kemper in my office and it\u2019s fun to see the cooling towers at Kemper blowing off steam, showing that they\u2019re generating electricity. We expect them to be fully integrated this summer. By the same token when we think about the gasifier island and everything else, I think the standard will kind of go to a reliable supply of same gas to the combined cycle units. Those will be kind of the standards we\u2019ll be looking for. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","And so that basically that\u2019s down the line here after May 15, to sort of\u2026","Tom Fanning","Again, the combined cycle as we expect the in services summer, declared in service both for tax and books. And for the gasifier and gas cleanup system, it will come probably later.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Okay, excellent. And then kind of going back to the equity question, sorry to have this one more time. If you don\u2019t end up getting either those two options with regards to making up the bonus D&A benefits, does that push you through the contingency you put in there or did that your comment before contemplate that as well?","Art Beattie","It contemplated that as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Got you. And then could you quantify how much contingency left or you don\u2019t do that?","Art Beattie","We\u2019re pretty close to the edge so, but again it\u2019s a function of more than just Kemper, there is lots of other CapEx that we spend. And so it would also impact how we\u2019re doing in that regard as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","I know you guys have spoken about, just the last subject here on coal ash. Obviously some adjacent states are kind of picking up the speed of reform on that. What are you seeing right now on your front as far as the need to spend and address both from a capital and expense perspective?","Tom Fanning","","We've had a very constructive relationship with all of our environmental regulators. In all of our states we meet or exceed all of the environmental regulations that are currently in place. We are watching with interest what happened elsewhere and what impact that may have. It was funny, it was notable background, the Kingston of that. I remember I would see a [relative time] and I can recall walking myself virtually every ash con we had. And we have this long track record of exceedingly safe reliable operation of facilities. The personal there were just surprised to see anybody was interested in how those were being run. I think with the events at Duke, there will be more evaluation of our practice and closure practices and all sorts of things. I think this is something that is probably inevitable. The question to me to what degree and over what time frame.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Great, excellent. Thank you all very much.","Tom Fanning","","Thank you. I appreciate you joining us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Please proceed.","Tom Fanning","","Hello Ashar.","Ashar Khan - Visium","Hi. How are you doing Tom?","Tom Fanning","Great.","Ashar Khan - Visium","Tom, I was trying to understand just trying to look through and I don't know if Art can help me on this. One thing which took a little people by surprise was when you came up with guidance in the January presentation you started off with 2.71 and then you subtracted $0.07, which was from dilution from the Kemper write-off 2014 and beyond. And you reset the base to $2.64. And then from there of course the growth came in for this year's EPS impact. With these write-offs, additional write-offs which have come in since the beginning of the year, should we then be modeling the similar kind, of course they are not to the extent that they happened last year, but should I be modeling something like for when you come out next year and all that, a slight decremented gain in the base EPS when if you were to go ahead and redo your EPS for next year, from this dilution impact from the write-offs and things like that, just wanted to get a little bit better understanding.","Art Beattie","","Yeah, so pretty said lot here and we think is no, because we don\u2019t think we will require any new equity and therefore there is a not a diluted impact we will be able to manage this we think.","Ashar Khan - Visium","Okay. Thank you so much.","Tom Fanning","Thank you. We appreciate you join us.","Operator","","And I am showing no further questions.","Tom Fanning","Well listen. Thank you all for joining us today. I know it\u2019s a busy day for everybody. A lot of exciting things going on. I am really gratified, I don\u2019t like the fact that we had to write-off on Kemper again and change the schedule. But I am gratified with the sustaining excellence of the company, when you think about all the good work we had, I know we talk about that a lot last year, we really accomplish a whole lot in 2013 and I think our first quarter in \u201814 is a demonstration of that benefit.","We thank you for joining us today. We thank you for follow Southern Company. We look forward to chatting with you further. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Please go ahead, sir.","Aaron Abramovitz - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Frank. Welcome to Southern Company's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information.

The slides we will discuss during today's call may be reviewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. As we report our 2017 results and look ahead to 2018 and beyond, our focus remains on investing in premier, state-regulated utilities and providing outstanding risk-adjusted returns for investors.","Whether it's great customer satisfaction, high reliability, strong economies, constructive regulatory frameworks or credit quality, our portfolio of electric and gas utilities is a tremendous driver of value. Additionally, Southern Power's large national portfolio of long-term contracted renewable and natural gas assets and Power Secure, a small, but growing portfolio of distributed energy resources, continue to be great complements to our customer-focused business model.","In 2017, we continue to provide the best customer service in the business. In fact, Southern Company and its four state regulated electric utilities continued to achieve the top five rankings on the Customer Value Benchmark Survey, while Nicor Gas and Virginia Natural Gas were named among the most trusted brands in their industry.","Customers are at the center of everything we do and our utility franchises operate in some of the most constructive jurisdictions in the country as evidenced by rate outcomes at several of our electric and gas utilities. 2017 represented one of our strongest operational performance years in recent history.","Our transmission team had its best year ever and our generation fleet performed exceptionally well. We also continued our track record of outstanding storm response during an active 2017 hurricane season.","Let's turn now to Plant Vogtle 3 and 4. Over the course of 2017, Georgia Power and the plant's other co-owners successfully navigated the bankruptcy filing by the project's primary contractor, Westinghouse. Southern Nuclear, the licensee and eventual operator of the plant, successfully assumed control of the site and the Vogtle owners brought nuclear-experienced Bechtel, on site as the prime contractor. The project owners also negotiated a new services contract with Westinghouse, which includes the necessary intellectual property rights to complete and run the project. Georgia Power filed its recommendation to complete the plant in August of 2017. Since then, there have been significant risk mitigating milestones.","First, in September, Georgia Power received a $1.7 billion Conditional Commitment for incremental DOE loan guarantees, which now total $5.13 billion and are expected to save Georgia Power customers over $500 million in interest costs. Between October and December, the Vogtle owners received 100% of the $3.7 billion Toshiba guarantee obligation, of which, Georgia Power's share is $1.7 billion.","In late December, the Georgia Public Service Commission unanimously approved and deemed reasonable the revised project cost and schedule estimates, which included an additional $1.6 billion in costs as well as November 2021 and November 2022 in-service dates for Units 3 and 4, respectively. As part of the approval, the Commission further adjusted ROEs during construction and allowed for decoupling of the rate base treatment of Unit 3 and Unit 4. Recall in 2016, the Commission deemed or presumed prudent $5.68 billion in project costs.","And more recently, following extensive bipartisan efforts in the House and in the Senate, the United States Congress eliminated the deadline for receiving advanced nuclear production tax credit, providing approximately $1 billion in future benefits for Georgia Power customers. We are grateful to the current administration and Congress for recognizing the importance of new nuclear generation and demonstrating renewed federal support for Vogtle 3 and 4. And at the state level, the Georgia Public Service Commission continued its vision and support by moving this project forward.","Now for an update on construction at Vogtle 3 and 4. Since Southern Nuclear has taken control of the site, we have sustained improvements in productivity and critical path execution. As you can see in the materials provided this morning, the team at the site is working towards a construction schedule that is approximately eight months in advance of the November 2021 and November 2022 in-service dates that were approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission.","Productivity is on track, with milestones continuing to be met, including the placement of the 225,000-pound Unit 3 pressurizer in January and the placement of 1,300 cubic yards of concrete inside the Unit 4 containment vessel in December. Of course, there is a long way to go, but these early results are encouraging.","And finally, federal tax reform has been a hot topic for many and it is no different for Southern Company. The net effect of the new law is that it is tremendously beneficial to customers and our economy. The lower corporate tax rate and the preservation of interest deductibility for utilities are expected to lower customer bills over the long term and help drive continued economic growth throughout our service territories.","However, in conjunction with those benefits, the new law also reduces cash flow to our companies. We are keenly focused on preserving our credit profile. Strong credit ratings accrue to the benefit of all of our stakeholders and preserving those ratings is the focus of ongoing dialogues with our state regulators. As Art will cover later, we will work to support our ratings in a customer- and investor-friendly manner.","I'll turn the call over, now, to Art for a financial review.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials released this morning, the adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2017 exceeded our estimates, and for the full year of 2017, we earned at the top end of our guidance range on an adjusted basis.","For the fourth quarter of 2017, we had reported earnings of $496 million or $0.49 per share, compared with $197 million or $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year of 2017, reported earnings were $842 million or $0.84 per share compared with $2.45 billion or $2.57 per share in 2016.","On an adjusted basis, for the fourth quarter, Southern Company earned $509 million or $0.51 per share compared with earnings of $295 million or $0.30 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016.","For the full year of 2017, on an adjusted basis, which excludes the charges associated with the Kemper Project, along with the related AFUDC equity resulting from extending the schedule prior to the suspension of construction, charges associated with Plant Scherer Unit 3 as a part of Gulf Power's rate case settlement, wholesale gas services, acquisition and integration costs and the net impacts of federal tax reform legislation, Southern Company earned $3.02 billion or $3.02 per share, compared with earnings of $2.76 billion or $2.90 a share in 2016. A reconciliation of our as-reported and as-adjusted results is included in the materials we released this morning.","The major earnings drivers for the full year of 2017 when compared to our $2.90 per share adjusted results for 2016 were the inclusion of a full year of Southern Company Gas, including our 50% interest in the Southern Natural Gas pipeline, retail revenue effects at our state-regulated electric utilities and an aggressive management of O&M at our state-regulated utilities, offset by mild weather, increased interest expense and increased shares.","Before we cover the details of our 2018 guidance and long-term outlook, I'd like to cover the impact of tax reform on our financial outlook. As Tom mentioned earlier, tax reform clearly provides an enormous benefit to customers and the economy. This opportunity, however, comes with a cost in the form of lower operating cash flows at our state-regulated utilities and, absent mitigation, lower FFO to debt ratios.","As we engage with each of our state regulatory jurisdictions regarding the impacts of tax reform, our objective is to provide meaningful rate benefits to customers while preserving our credit quality, which clearly benefits customers over the long run. Working constructively with our regulators, we are seeking to implement a variety of balanced solutions, which achieve both of those key objectives.","For example, in some cases, we'll seek to preserve cash flow by amortizing existing regulatory assets as an offset to tax-related regulatory liabilities. Also, where possible, we'll look to reduce debt at the utility level, which comes in the form of a higher mix of equity in our regulated capital structures. And finally, to ensure adequate credit metrics, we expect some level of de-leveraging at the parent company as well.","Successful execution of this strategy will result in a financial outlook with less leverage and stronger credit quality, which support the value proposition from our state-regulated utilities.","Now, turning to our 2018 EPS guidance, as you can see in the materials provided this morning, our 2018 EPS guidance range is $2.80 per share to $2.95 per share, with the midpoint of $2.87. A key driver for the starting point of this range is the receipt by Georgia Power of 100% of its $1.7 billion portion of the Toshiba parent guarantee.","Our success in this effort represents an important benefit to shareholders through a significant risk reduction for the Vogtle 3 and 4 project and results in lower cost for Georgia Power customers during construction. A high-level reconciliation of our 2018 EPS guidance range is available in the materials for this call. As for the earnings estimate, for the first quarter of 2018, we estimate that we'll earn $0.84 per share.","Looking towards our long-term outlook, starting with the 2018 midpoint of $2.87 per share, our long-term earnings per share growth outlook is 4% to 6%. It's important to note that the year-over-year earnings contribution from Vogtle 3 \u2013 Units 3 and 4 over the next several years is not linear due to the various construction period ROEs recently approved in VCM-17.","The earnings from Vogtle 3 and 4 represent less than 6% of our expected earnings over the next five years. Removing the Vogtle 3 and 4 contribution from the mix results in an underlying Southern Company earnings profile, supported by strong growth across our state-regulated electric and gas utilities, that is still expected to grow at 4% to 6%.","Compared to our 2016 Analyst Day, our long-term outlook is being driven by stronger state-regulated earnings profile that is backed by higher invested capital growth in our state-regulated electric utilities and a continued strong performance from our gas LDCs.","Invested capital in our state-regulated utilities is projected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 6%. This is driven by a $22 billion five-year investment plan for our electric utilities, which excludes Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and supports a 4% electric-invested capital growth. Additionally, the state-regulated LDCs within Southern Company Gas are projected to invest $6 billion over the next five years with an invested capital growth rate of approximately 9%.","As we discussed on our last earnings call, our future equity needs have continued to evolve over the past year. Over the next five years, we forecast an average annual equity need of approximately $1.4 billion.","Approximately 80% of this equity is expected to be invested directly into our state-regulated electric and gas utilities to support increased credit-supported equity ratios and to fund increased capital investments such as Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and our business modernization initiatives. These are terrific opportunities to improve our overall value proposition by enhancing our risk-return profile of our regulated franchises. We have robust equity plans, which can provide upwards of $1.5 billion per year of new equity and we have demonstrated an ability to source equity in an investor-friendly manner.","For example, we announced in 2017 the sale of Elizabethtown Gas, our planned sale of 33% of Southern Power's solar portfolio and the use of third-party tax equity on new Southern Power projects. As we look to fund our current equity need forecast, we plan to be equally thoughtful and investor-focused.","Our 4% to 6% growth rate assumes continued constructive regulatory treatment across our utilities, including tax reform mitigation plans and consolidated FFO to debt of 16% to 16.5%, excluding the impact of Vogtle 3 and 4 during construction.","Financial integrity and strong credit ratings provide significant benefits to customers and have always been a priority for us. That emphasis remains unchanged. The top end of our earnings per share growth rate assumes incremental investment opportunities in our state-regulated utilities, combined with aggressive management of O&M inflation, optimized equity funding and better-than-expected growth from our unregulated businesses, including Southern Power.","Now let me touch briefly on our dividend. Southern Company has an outstanding 70-year track record of dividends and dividend growth. Over this period, we've paid 280 consecutive quarterly dividends that have been the same or higher than the previous quarter. We are proud of this track record and continue to make thoughtful, sustainable dividend growth recommendations to our board. We fully believe the financial outlook we have presented, with its improved state-regulated profile, continues to support our objectives of growing the dividend at $0.08 per year.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Art. As we look forward, we believe Southern Company is solidly positioned to deliver on its value proposition as our customer and community-focused business model continues to serve us well across our portfolio of companies. We have a transparent, well-balanced path forward to 4% to 6% EPS growth, which should also support our dividend objective.","As we optimize the risk-return equation of our business, our strategies to preserve credit quality post-tax reform are intended to provide a solid foundation for value creation for both customers and investors alike.","Thanks, once again, for joining us this afternoon. We'll now move to question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello Shar.","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Hey guy.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","How are you?","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Good. How are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Great.","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","So just two quick ones. First, on the $1.4 billion in equity per year that was disclosed today. How much should we think about being allocated to sort of increasing the equity layers at the various utilities? Or another way to ask is, do you sort of have an allocation in mind between the various states for modeling purposes?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, about half.","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Okay, about half?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on, lastly on the tax reform assumptions that's in your base assumption, what you're assuming as far as the plan to credit back to rate payers and is there any potential to spread out further in time redeploying to sort of near-term capital opportunities in order to get you that incremental investment opportunities to get you to the top end sort of, how are you thinking about this?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. You know what's interesting about the incremental capital opportunities is we looked at the profile of our CapEx over time, I think you've probably heard this before, but we tend to be conservative in our projections. And one of the things that we have seen is that we budget really well for this year and pretty well for the next year and the year after, but starting in years four and five, because they can't see some of the CapEx opportunities, we tend to budget less and less.","And so, it's very common for us to have kind of a downward-sloping CapEx projection. When we looked in history, in fact, we tend to fill those things in. So in effect, what we have thought about is essentially levelizing as a concept a CapEx appetite at the state companies. And that kind of incremental opportunity gets you more to the top of the range. Of course, we will manage O&M so that there are no price increases to customers as a result of that activity. And I think we got good capacity to do that.","Shar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Well, thanks so much guys. That's very helpful.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Just curious on the dividend and sticking with that $0.08 when you have such a, kind of, significant incremental equity need. How did you sort of weigh that up here? Is it you're targeting a percentage growth because I know you've been at this $0.08 level for a while now? How should we think about where you want to be on payout eventually?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. So one of the things we're looking at, dividend policy is one of the ultimate signaling theories in finance, right? And when we look at our profile kind of over the next five years, it's clear that while our payout ratio may be in the 80% range for a period of time, once Vogtle clears to in-service, there is a sharp drop in our payout ratio.","When we look at the viability of our ability to deliver on the growth objectives that we've outlined here, we think it's very advisable to stay the course on the dividends, regular, predictable, sustainable and live with, for a period of time, kind of an 80% payout ratio. Maybe a little north of that from year-to-year, because we believe once we emerge from the construction of Vogtle, we'll be back down in the 70s in a pretty healthy way. It's better to stay the course than it is to try and vary over a temporary period.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that, Tom. And then just on slide 25, where you look at the growth with and without Vogtle. Just \u2013 it's certainly clear that the red 4% to 6% is starting off that midpoint of 2018, so...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And your \u2013 effectively the gray lines are showing us where you would fall within that given the earnings at Vogtle in any particular year.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. You got it right, Jonathan. The starting point is 2018 and the gray lines do represent the nonlinear benefit of Vogtle over that next four-year timeframe or five-year, yeah, four years beyond 2018.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","And I think it was important for us to point out kind of that fact, Jonathan. When you look at what Vogtle represents to our total earnings picture, it is only 6% of our projected EPS during this next four to five years. 94% of our earnings are going to still deliver 4% to 6%. So we would want to have that reflected in things like our P\/E ratio and stock price performance.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Please just correct me, you're pretty much saying that the top end of the gray dotted lines that you would expect to still be within the 4% to 6% off of the 2018 guidance in all of those years. And so, I'm curious, so what's the purpose of the \u2013 without Vogtle? Because it seems a scenario where you just don't have the Vogtle earnings, but sort of everything else is fine, just seems to be odd for me to imagine.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","I think we're just trying to point out the strength of the underlying business, excluding the earnings associated with Vogtle over the next few years.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. 90 \u2013 let me say it another way. 94% of our earnings are coming ex-Vogtle, and those are exceedingly strong and predictable over time. So all we're laying in is the notion that only 6% is associated with Vogtle during this construction period. Of course, once it goes in-service, it goes back to the earnings rate at Georgia Power.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can I maybe just \u2013 go ahead.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You sounded like you have something to add, Tom.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No. Go ahead. It's all right.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I was just going to \u2013 do you have any update on the latest with the Chinese AP1000 and when that might start up and I'll leave it there?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right. Yeah. Sure. Westinghouse continues to say they're ready to load fuel what we believe the delay in Sanmen and Haiyang as additional regulatory review of the reactor coolant pump and the squid valves. Now we believe, Westinghouse believes, there's no issue there. This appears to be a technical regulatory oversight delay. But we believe, we don't know of any problem and once the regulator in China agrees to go forward, they'll load fuel. We see no impediments.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","From what you just described, if there was an issue with that sort of feature, is that something that could be changed at the stage you're at or is that something that would be so endemic to the design that it would be hard to change?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, recall some years ago, there were some issues about the reactor coolant pump and there were changes made to the RCP. So that was done way back when I think everything conforms with our understanding of the engineering and ultimate operational performance. We think there's no issue. It's hard to speculate if there were a change required, what that would mean to constant schedule, I just wouldn't want to go there. But the clear understanding we have from Westinghouse, you know that we've had people on site for years now, is that there is no problem. This is a regulatory matter that the Chinese are dealing with.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So you still have people at that site kind of reporting back to you?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. We do.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We sure do.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, you bet.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, fellas. So when I'm looking at the guidance on FFO to debt, presumably the difference between 15% to 15.5% including Vogtle and the 16% to 16.5% excluding Vogtle is just, really relates to the earnings stream that you talk about on slide 24 where the clip above the $4.4 billion won't flip into cash flow until the plant's complete?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's it.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","I just want to make sure.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And we've run it by the \u2013 yeah and Greg, we've run this by the rating agencies and they think that this approach is sensible.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. So assuming the plant comes in when it's supposed to come in, goes into rates, that closes the gap between those two numbers?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, it does.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Great. In terms of the regulatory approaches you're making with the different states, and I guess I'm looking for a slide here; it is slide 13. You're taking the equity that you're raising and you're putting it into the following uses: higher regulated equity ratios, reduce parent debt, Vogtle CapEx, essentially. Can you take us \u2013 without burning up a ton of time, just take us through where you've already got sort of a plan in place; like in Florida, for instance, I think you've already got a deal on how you're going to use tax. What should we look for in terms of milestones and timing for understanding the outcomes on tax in Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Greg. This is Art. You're right. Gulf Power has filed a plan or a stipulated agreement with a couple of important interveners. I think the Office of Public Counsel and the Industrial Group there have signed on to the deal where there is an immediate, I believe, refund to customers of a lot of the unprotected deferred taxes, and it also provides for an increase in the equity ratios from 52.5% to 53.5%. And there are also some additional rate reductions that go into place for both their environmental rates and their base rates as well.","So it's a comprehensive settlement, but it is a great example of what we're looking for in each of our jurisdictions. That will be different for every jurisdiction we talk about. Georgia, you mentioned, asked for some kind of input or filing last week and that has been postponed for another couple weeks. So there's still discussions going on there, but nothing to point to.","Mississippi has filed an amended PEP filing there as well, and they have basically requested an increase in the equity ratio and provided for some mitigation of the rate increase that was initially filed there. That was about a 4% increase; that has now dropped to 2.5%. So that's another good example of what we are asking the regulator to do.","It varies by jurisdictions. In the Gas business, we have a number of ongoing rate requests that will include the impacts of tax reform. I believe in Illinois, they're going to adjust tax reform based on the January order that they got out of the rate request they filed last year. So it just varies by jurisdictions. Some we may see this year, some we may see next year; so just stay tuned.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","I'm sorry, did you mention Alabama, how you might go about this conversation in Alabama?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","There's nothing that \u2013 there have been discussions ongoing, but nothing concrete to share at this point.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Fantastic. Thank you, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Paul.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hey, how are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Terrific. Hope you're well.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Sort of a housekeeping question, I guess. When we do the numbers, it sort of looks like Southern Power came in a lot stronger than what you had initially been guiding to. I think you were looking sort of in the $0.30 \u2013 in the $0.40 range for them and for SONAT and it looks like it came in sort of north of $1, and it looks like the regulated pieces came in a little bit weaker. Are we reading that right, or are we missing some adjustments?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Are you talking for the quarter, Paul? Are you talking for the year?","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","For the year.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Well, there are a lot of moving parts with Southern Power. They had a lot of new contracts; seven new solar and four new wind contracts where you got most of a full year's worth of benefit there, year-over-year. You had a lot of increase in depreciation there, but I guess one aspect that was not expected last year, and I'm assuming we're talking on an ex-item basis here, that was some state solar investment tax credits that we discovered we qualified for; that accounted for roughly a $0.04 pickup at Southern Power.","So that, in my mind, is the only thing that was really boosting their numbers up this year. But year-over-year, I think the numbers were fairly close in terms of net income.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. So maybe we just need to take it offline to see if we're missing some other adjustments.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Paul, on Page 11 of the release, those are not ex items. Those are as-reported items so...","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","We try to just apply the adjustments that were broken out at the bottom of the page, but...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Okay. We can get back to you and get it right.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","And then, I guess, with respect to infusing equity into the regulated operations, would that happen after you get some form of decision out of the regulators or should we start infusing equity even in advance of getting a regulatory response?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No. We will only invest equity when we have the authority to do so and earn on it appropriately.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Okay. And then, is there sort of a north limit on what you would ask for in terms of an equity ratio?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You mean a ceiling?","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","What we're solving for is to...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","FFO to debt, yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","...get back to a FFO to debt percent. That's kind of the way we're doing it. And the beauty of this tax reform is, if you solve to an equity ratio, if that's the only thing you're doing. I said this on TV this morning, just broad numbers, I think we can preserve our financial integrity and still deliver in the range of 5% to 7% rate reductions, but that's if that's all you do. There could be a host of other things that could impact the regulatory treatment. But this is a win-win. There's plenty of room for us to preserve our financial integrity and deliver rate reductions.","Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Great. That's it from me. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good afternoon. Hey, howdy.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Howdy.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So on Southern Power, let me just pick up where you left off. Curious on what kind of growth you're seeing out of that business. I know you've talked about tax equity, et cetera, but through the forecast period, how much is that contributing given the updated forecast? And then maybe just a second on the back of that would be, what's the future of the company given what seems to be a little bit more of a modest growth profile or that subsidiary rather?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So I'm going to let Art fill in the blanks here. I'll give you the top line and that is certainly, we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the market. For 2018, we expect to earn somewhere in the $325 million range, but you're right. When you look at our overall plan, we are generally deemphasizing the contribution of Southern Power to our growth rate.","You must remember though, one of the things that we put in place in the past is a joint development agreement, largely for wind with Res. So we're still pursuing all of that discretionary growth and we'll see how that turns out. With respect to the equity required for those growth opportunities, I think the kind of incremental equity will be minimal as they'll likely be funded with things like third-party tax equity and internally sourced funds.","When you think about that, you should think about that contribution at Southern Power as one of the variables that could drive us upwards in the 4% to 6% range. Art, would you have anything to add there?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Julien, you are asking about where we're going to go and if you look at our 2018 expectations out of Southern Power, there's \u2013 not a lot of that growth is expected to be \u2013 or not a lot of that income is expected to be driven by new projects. Most of our joint development agreements, the opportunities there would probably begin delivering income in 2019.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","As we look year-over-year though, we'll certainly keep about the same level of production tax credits. We just put into \u2013 I guess we just signed an agreement on a new, small solar deal.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Solar deal, 20 megawatts.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes. And then we got our ongoing energy margins and our amortizations of ITC, which are, I think, year-over-year will be pretty close to the same, but we've also \u2013 are probably going to book in the first quarter some restructuring gains that will primarily be benefiting our \u2013 or optimizing our state apportionment rates across all the states that we have.","And that will be a pickup of $0.04 or $0.05 of earnings at Southern Power. So when you look at year-over-year, we're going to be pretty close to the same level of net income as we were in 2017.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And I think the real point...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","What about the state of the overall business if it isn't contributing meaningful amounts of growth? I mean obviously, that's a variable to be solved for, but how do you think about it in that context?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, we think that the state-regulated businesses, especially the way we've recast it, represents a lion's share of our growth opportunity. And in fact, when you think about kind of the equity needs, however we solve them, whether it's shares over programs or through investor friendlier kind of means, it represents I think 80% of the shares are going to be tied up in the state-regulated businesses. That provides the lion's share of growth going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. In fact, actually, if you were to break it down, how much of the 4%, even at the bottom end, is driven by the state programs versus, call it, energy infrastructure versus gas?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes. That one is hard to break down. We've got so many moving parts in here, so.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","What's interesting, we need to get back to you on that. But I'll tell you this, we have thought about this one. The net income profile of Southern Power isn't going to grow a whole lot over the future, but the earnings per share profile, we'll still deliver.","In other words, because we're using tax-advantaged equity, while R will grow modestly, E won't grow hardly at all, and so we'll still deliver pretty good EPS, but the thrust is right and we'll get you the right percent and everything else between the two. The real lion's share of our EPS growth right now is in the state-regulated businesses.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. All right. Thank you, all.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Tom, how are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Terrific. Hope you're well.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I am. Thank you. Quick question. You had some monetizations to raise equity. What would be a reasonable share count to use for 2018?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Hold on a second. Let's see, Paul. Our guidance range really assumes a range of possible outcomes. We said we have a $1.4 billion need. We certainly got a lot of tools at our disposal. The timing of that will be spread over the year. But as we've also said, we've got opportunities to do it in a shareholder-friendly way, which might mitigate that as well. So it's a hard question to answer and the range that we've given you is really the outcome of a number of different assumptions around all of the moving parts.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So I guess, one way to say it, Art, is kind of, at its most conservative, we can fully support this 4% to 6% growth rate and our credit metrics by using our internal plans and any at-the-market kind of effort. To the extent we do \"investor-friendly means\", means other than those shares, we could certainly improve within the range.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So, I mean Art's right. It's hard to say. It depends on the success and the opportunity we see elsewhere in the market on some of these other ideas.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, on your slide deck, slide 16, you've got parent contributing a negative $0.47, what was that in 2017?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We'll have somebody looking for it and somebody will look for it. I just don't have it at my fingertips.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, just back to a previous question, you said look for net income at Southern Power to be essentially flat in 2018 versus 2017?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. $3.25 million (45:57) would be my best guess; of course, it varies all over the place. Would be my guess.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Is Southern Power not going to see a pickup from tax reform?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes, they will be a beneficiary of that to the tune of $15 million to $20 million; but recall, also, that we are in the process of monetizing the 33% of the solar portfolio, which would coincidently kind of offset the benefit and the tax gain.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So the loss of that income.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","In 2018, so that's right.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","The benefit of tax reform equals the loss of income from the sale of solar. So the net effect is you keep income constant and you raise cash and offset shares.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, got it. I'm good and if you could just find that number, you can just inject later on. Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Hold on, $0.31, okay.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","What's the big driver there? I know that obviously the tax shield is a piece of that.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's the biggest thing...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","The debt has increased. So it's a full year effect of lot of the parent debt, right?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon. How are you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Paul. Great. How are you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","All right. On slide 6, I'm sorry if I missed this, but the gas supply write-off of $0.10 for 2018.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","What's causing that? I mean, could you just elaborate a little bit more on that? Is that sort of one-time in nature?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That was the amount of shares associated with replacing the hull, the credit quality hull from the write-off of the gasifier last year in 2017, at the ongoing carry and also the income loss associated with that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I got you. So is the income loss associated with no longer having the gasifier...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","...regulatory speaking and the impact of issuing equity...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Not having an earning asset there. And I'm proud to say, these guys do more of the shows than I do, but even the shows I was at, I can remember drawing people a line that showed the 5% growth, which is the $0.15 and then the write-off and then $1.7 billion from Toshiba, this is stuff that we've had out there for some time. And this tax reform, this negative $0.06, we're going to work really hard to mitigate that. So I think we're going to be exactly kind of where we thought we might be, based on the talk we gave kind of at the balance of 2019, I mean, 2017.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, when we look at the slide nine, you mentioned that there's this business modernization that you're going to be doing some spending on, but O&M is supposed to be reducing or offsetting the revenue impact associated with that number. What I was wondering is, given the other sort of substantial CapEx that you guys are projecting at the regulated utilities, what we should think about the ongoing rate impact of that? Sort of, how do we think about the amount of capital that you're spending, that you're putting into these businesses and your ability to do the business modernization stuff that you outlined on slide nine, with the other non-business mod, non-Vogtle CapEx, if you follow me?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, you bet. If you want to look at a company that's done just a terrific job at this, I would go right to Georgia Power. They did a variety of things where they invested in technology and really took money out of the business, not only O&M, but some other investments like a lot of the local towns.","But in that process, we've actually increased the reach to those customers, I want to say by a factor of 4. So it's interesting. Our customer base is getting used to more and more the use of technology in terms of managing our relationship with them. We still have important personal touch in the communities that we're privileged to serve, but I think Georgia Power has been a great example of taking O&M down and improving their CapEx potential.","One other really important \u2013 and let me say this just another way, if I reverse that. The technology investments, that is the modernization efforts, in many ways, permit the ability to take O&M out. And if you think about Georgia Power during this time, they were named The Most Trusted Electric Utility in America. So we were all worried about what does this all mean to our relationship with customers and it remains really strong.","One other concept. You guys know that I help lead for all the electric industry in America, whether it's IOUs, co-ops and munis, but the whole notion of providing appropriate levels of national security for this most critical part of our infrastructure is something that I'm very focused on. And I think this new word that starts to creep into, whether it's an infrastructure bill in Congress or in our dialogues around modernization goes not to reliability or potentially even service, but to the notion of resilience. That's going to become increasingly important as we think about protecting this most valuable asset.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But I guess what I'm wondering is, how should we think about the rates that \u2013 the rate increases that are associated with your CapEx and EPS growth? Do you follow what I'm saying? Just generally speaking, I'm not asking for huge granularity here.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","But just generally speaking, how much do you think we can offset, right?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Something below inflation.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah. That's what I would \u2013 and even our profile on nonfuel O&M will be to eliminate the inflation in the numbers and, again, to drive it below zero, if we can, to help fund these opportunities for mod capital.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And frankly, I think we have the capacity to do that. But if you wanted a number to use, it would be below an inflation rate.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, just finally on the sales growth, I noticed in the sort of appendix of the slides that you said flat to extremely modest, I think. Maybe I'm missing the term, but it sounded \u2013 I'm just wondering, just reiterate the sales growth that you guys are looking at in your service territory.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","They are flat.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, if you get specific by class, it's probably a bit of growth in the industrial class and a bit slightly negative on the residential and commercial.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You know, the Southeast still is good, though. You think about it, we've had better than U.S. experience on population growth for both our gas and electric properties. And job growth is much better than the national average in terms of our electric properties. So you know what? I mean, what we're seeing in terms of flat is really a function, I think, of technology on behalf of customers. One other effect that we think may occur during this year is, as other companies \u2013 this is actually good for the economy, but as other companies now can expense their CapEx, we may see a lot more facility improvements, store restructurings, manufacturing, and that may have the effect of increasing the rate of investment of energy efficiency. That's why we believe, this year, it's flat.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Hey, Tom. Hey, Art. Thank you for taking my question. I have two focus areas. First, when I look at slide 26, which has your CapEx by subsidiary on the regulated and at Southern Power, and if I compare it to the same slide in last year's guidance, so the fourth quarter 2016 five-year outlook, two things stand out. One is that the five-year capital plan for Alabama Power is up materially, $1.5 billion. And the other is that the five-year gas LDC spend is actually down from $6.7 billion to $6.1 billion, so $500 million or $600 million. Can you just talk about what the \u2013 what's happening on the capital side and what that money is being spent on in those two jurisdictions \u2013 or those two businesses?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, the gas one's easy. It's the sale of Elizabethtown is assumed. So you've lost Elizabethtown's CapEx; that's what that is.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","And Alabama's increase is reflective of modernization capital; that was not in last year's numbers.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, okay. So lots of the incremental T&D in Alabama and when you file for rate recovery under annual rate recovery methodologies, you'll benefit and customers will benefit by having the rate reduction that's caused by tax reform and that gets partially offset by the incremental capital?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. The other thing is...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, and of course...","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Go ahead. I'm sorry.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No, go ahead.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","My other question is it sounded like you're going to do the $1.4 billion or so of equity every year over the five years, but I'm just curious, when I look at the slide 26, CapEx comes down meaningfully after you're really $2 billion, meaning after 2019, meaning it's down almost $2 billion in 2020 over 2018, and almost $3 billion by 2022. Are you really \u2013 shouldn't you be in a position, if that's really what your capital budget is in the out years, that you're basically generating a lot of cash?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Well, there's a couple effects in there. Recall, we talked about a variety of means to raise the equity, and what you're referring to is essentially a plan that still achieves 4% to 6% growth, but which uses kind of sales of shares through our plants, okay? To the extent we could do, say, more investor-friendly means of raising cash and equity, that certainly would be lumpier and maybe, potentially, more front-end-loaded and may reduce, frankly, the number of shares required. We'll just see.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","And I think, Michael, as you look at Southern Power on that line, it basically reflects only the committed capital and maintenance capital to support existing assets or new projects that we've committed to. It would be incremental needs for beyond that and we've kind of set that out in a separate Southern Power slide. I believe it's in the appendix.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And the other thing that's going to impact timing, for sure, will be how the regulatory process has evolved at each of the companies. As I said earlier on this call, we're not going to invest equity until we have a regulatory construct that supports earning on it. So that also will have an influence as to how we send out the capital.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, Art. Much appreciated, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon. Thanks for joining us.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Absolutely. Thank you for taking the question. So my question, actually, was on the regulatory construct you just talked about. Can you be a little bit more specific in terms of some of the variables that are at play? For example, there's the $7.3 billion deferred tax liability. Wanted to understand how is that \u2013 is that protected or unprotected, or how much is protected, unprotected? And what kind of timeframe are you working towards in terms of refund or are you offsetting against regulatory asset? Some color or context around that cash flow profile would be helpful.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Praful. This is Art. Listen, I don't want to go state-by-state, because we're going to be getting ahead of the regulatory process a bit. It will vary by state. Some states have amounts of, say, storm damage cost, that is a reg. asset on their books. That might be something they themselves of to provide a temporary pickup in cash for recovery of that.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And deal with equity ratio later.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","And then deal with equity ratios later. So there are all kinds of pieces. And if you take out all of the assets, right, that's the total of the protected and unprotected deferred tax assets would be, what, $7 billion, $8 billion? And about...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","$7 billion.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","And about $5.7 billion of that is protected and the remainder would be unprotected. And that's at a Southern level. So it's going to vary by operating company and I believe in the K, you can find a breakdown by each of the companies.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And the other thing that would probably be helpful in thinking about this, what we're solving for is this kind of preserving financial integrity. So that means getting back to appropriate FFO to debt levels. Without mitigations, tax reform would translate into approximately 2% to 3% impact at the states and maybe 3% to 4% at the Southern Company level, so that's kind of what we're solving for here. That may be helpful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I got you. That is super-helpful. I appreciate that.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then secondly, just in terms of the Southern Power investment, you talked about $1.5 billion and you've not kind of shown in your plan, but you footnoted that there are scenarios under which you could have an incremental $1.5 billion in the out years in terms of Southern Power investment. Like what would be the variables that would trigger that potential incremental investment?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Greater than expected penetration on the res investments, for example.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","The joint development agreement.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's right. The wind deal that we've signed up that joint development for. And there could be a variety of other things. It comes with a transom. I mean, the whole point though is that is purely discretionary and our plan is that largely, we believe that would be funded through internal means or alternative sources of equity like tax equity, project finance or whatever. The clear message here is this 4% to 6% growth is being driven by investments and performance at our state-regulated entities.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. I appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Praful.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Stephen, how are you?","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh, great. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking my question. I think my questions have been addressed. As I understand it, just on the impact to FFO and tax reform, just given that essentially you're in discussions with a variety of subsidiaries, your overall take is it's not the right time to try to give more detailed guidance in terms of the exact impact to FFO from tax reform just given how many variables are at play, am I understanding that right?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, basically. When it's done, it will be done and we'll tell you everything about it. I think we have outlined though the potential effects of tax reform and we've outlined kind of how we believe we're going about it. So it's some combination of unwinding our regulatory asset or liability or how we expect to restore our credit metrics through equity ratios, for example. So that's kind of the how, the what will show themselves when we reach agreement. But we, historically, we don't like to get in front of the states as they go through these sensitive discussions.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. That's all I had. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello again.","Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey everyone, this is \u2013 hey, this is Eugene, actually, on for Shar.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Okay.","Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I apologize...","(1:03:26)","Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Well, I think you kind of touched on it already with (1:03:34) saying you don't want to get in front of the state approval process, but I guess to the extent, a follow up to Shar's question about the equity going into the regulated utilities. To the extent you're asking for approval for higher equity ratios, could we also \u2013 could we assume that once that's approved, that you'd be earning on that, the higher equity ratio like a hypothetical capital structure as opposed to waiting for actual equity to be infused into the utilities?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, I think that's a great question and it's all going to revolve around the timing, the timing of the approvals and when the equity is funded or how quickly it's funded and that may occur over time as well, so.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","But I think it will be our intention, you're asking a hypothetical. It would be our intention and it would be simultaneous. In other words, if we got the authority to increase in equity ratio, we would make sure that they had the capital that represented that equity in place.","Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. That's fair.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And I think it goes back to somebody's earlier question that said, you're looking at $1.4 billion per year and we said that might be lumpy based on regulatory outcomes. That would be a reason why.","Eugene Hennelly - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Understood. Thanks, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, you bet. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, it's been an exciting time in the industry. I know \u2013 I think everybody has been wrestling with what does tax reform mean and it's quite a process. The net of it is, we think there's plenty of economics there to have a win-win agreement with all of our jurisdictions, that is that we can preserve our financial integrity and reduce rates to customers and we think that's good not only for our customers, for the company, but also for the growing economy. I think it's been a real shot in the arm to us all.","The other thing I hope you'd take from this call is that as we've evaluated these opportunities, there's been a real redistribution of growth away from Southern Power. We're still committed to Southern Power. We still think there's opportunity and that provides upside to our forecast, but the real redistribution of growth in our focus really goes now to the regulated utilities that we have in some of the best jurisdictions in America. We think this is a plan that will be very promising and we will execute as well as we can and we'll update you as things develop. Thank you very much for being with us on this call. We appreciate your interest in Southern Company. See you soon.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude The Southern Company Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today Wednesday, July 31, 2013.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Tucker","Thank you, [Kamika] and welcome to Southern Company's second quarter 2013 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. To follow along during the call you can access these slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com.","Tom will open today's call with an update on regulatory activities, as well as the latest on the construction on Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 and Kemper County IGCC project. Art will then provide an overview of our second quarter financial results, as well as the discussion on sales and the economy and a brief update of our financing plans. After closing remarks from Tom, we will move to Q&A.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas A. Fanning","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Our company continues to excel this longstanding mission of providing clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy to the customers and communities we serve and our 26,000 employees remain committed to the customer focus velocity that has been the firm foundation of our company\u2019s FERC 100 years.","Throughout our business, we are developing innovative solutions to the energy challenges that can fund our region and our nation. We also continue through our traditional operating companies to engage constructively with elected and appointed officials at all levels of government.","In fact, all of our operating companies have significant state regulatory activity in progress during 2013. [In summer], Alabama Power completed a series of informal hearings two weeks ago to review the Rate Stabilization and Equalization or RSE rate setting process. These hearings included constructive engagement by the public service commissioners, staff, interveners, and the public.","We believe that Alabama Power demonstrated that its return on total invested capital is fair and reasonable and serve its customers\u2019 long-term interest. We expect to learn and results of this review later this summer. Georgia Power has arguably the busiest calendar for the year with three major regulatory filings.","First, Georgia Power filed an integrated resource plan in February, which was recently approved by the Public Service Commission. It was an important step forward in affirming Georgia Power plant for complying with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards or MATS rule, included in the PSC ruling was the decertification of approximately 2100 megawatts of older coal generation unit and fuel switching for another 1400 megawatts.","Second, Georgia Power founded eighth Vogtle Construction Monitoring or VCM report in February and is currently in hearing regarding its request. Georgia Power is seeking approval for actual cost of $209 million incurred from July through December of 2012. As yet another demonstration of our constructive regulatory environment, Georgia Power entered into a stipulation with the PSC staff today to weigh the requirement to amend the certified cost during construction.","This agreement which is subject to PSC approval recognizes that the VCM process already addresses the verification and approval of actual expenditures every six months. This stipulation also will board the debating of the issues that maybe pertinent to Georgia Powers ongoing commercial dispute with the Vogtle 3 and four contractors.","The decision which will now only address actual cost through December 2012 is scheduled for October 15. Third, Georgia power has proposed a three-year rate plan and has asked to increase state rate by $482 million of the one-time increase in January 2014.","Hearing to the schedule to be held in October and November with the decision by the Georgia PSC scheduled for December 17. Meanwhile Gulf Power has filed for a base rate increase of $74 million. These rates will become effective in April of 2014. We currently expect hearings to conclude in December with the decision in the first quarter of 2014.","Finally, at Mississippi Power, our hearing has been scheduled for October 1 to address the seven-year rate plan for Kemper County, IGCC. As a reminder, this rate plan will cover the cost of the facility for the first seven years of operation consistent with the settlement agreement we reached with the Mississippi PSC in January of this year.","Finally, I would like to give you an update on our Vogtle and Kemper County projects. First, plant Vogtle. Our progress at plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 remained strong with more than 50% of construction now complete. Since our last earnings call, the Unit 3 containment vessel bottom head has been set and wall structures have taken shape throughout the nuclear island. The Unit 3 containment vessel lower rank is more than 75% complete, and the middle rank is more than 40% complete.","Meanwhile, at Unit 4 the nuclear island waterproofing and mudmat activities were completed and the installation of basemat rebar is progressing well, applying lessons learned from the same activity conducted for Unit 3. Assembly of the Unit 4 containment vessel bottom head is also complete. Aside the nuclear island, work is proceeding on the turbine building foundation, cooling tower structures, and water intake structure, and modifications are being made to existing switchyard and transmission equipment.","Upcoming major milestones are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter include the setting of the Unit 3 auxiliary building module also known as CA-20 and the placement of the first nuclear concrete in the Unit 4 nuclear island. Vogtle remains a great value to Georgia Power customers. We call that our regional estimate was for 12% rate increase for capital costs related to Vogtle plant 4, however, taking into account all the benefits that have been realized since certification. That estimate has been reduced to a range between 6% and 8% as well the remaining annual increases are expected to be less than 1% per year.","Meanwhile construction at the Kemper County energy facility is also progressing well. Since our last earnings call, the lignite mine has been placed into service and the final heavy lift, as well as a significant portion of the start-up activity for the combined cycling unit have been completed. Recognizing that piping is a key area of focus at this stage of the project, it\u2019s important to note that 90% of the piping has been fabricated and almost half is installed. And then we have been achieving our key installation targets for steel [went high].","Looking ahead for the remainder of 2013, start-up activities include the first fire of the first combustion turbine in late August, syncing the steam turbine to the grid in our service and heating up the first gasifier by year end.","Our May 14 in service state to which our construction start-up plans are tied remains achievable. Yesterday afternoon, Mississippi Power filed its latest project updates with the Mississippi Public Service Commission. This update reflects the results of the most recent review of project activity and costs, which included input from additional industry construction specialists. The result of this review is an increase of $450 million to the project completion estimate, which is reflected in the financial results we released this morning. About half of this increase is for expected cost to achieve this schedule, which is centered on two-key days, the first gasifier heat up in late December and the in service date of May 2014. About 30% of the increase is related to the changes in material and the remaining 20% is related to additional project contingency.","As a reminder, we are ordering our commitments to Mississippi Power\u2019s customers and regulators and are not seeking recovery of plant cost above the $2.88 billion cost cut, net of the OE grants and exception to the cost cuts. While productivity, start-up and systems integration remain the most significant risk to the cost estimate and schedule, the Kemper project team remains focused on executing our plans and safely completing this facility to provide Mississippi Power\u2019s customers a clean, safe, reliable, and affordable generation resource for decades to come.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview.","Art P. Beattie","Thanks, Tom. For the second quarter of 2013, we earned $0.34 per share compared to $0.71 per share in the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of $0.37 per share. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, we earned $0.43 per share compared to $1.14 per share for the same period in 2012, a decrease of $0.71 per share. Our results for the second quarter 2013 include an after-tax charge against earnings of $278 million or $0.32 per share related to the increased cost estimates for construction of the Kemper project. Recall that for the first quarter of 2013, we announced a similar after-tax charge of $333 million, or $0.38 per share. This brings the total of after-tax charges related to the Kemper project to $611 million or $0.70 per share for the six months ended June 30, 2013.","As explained previously, Mississippi Power will not seek recovery of estimated cost to complete the facility above the $2.88 billion cost cap net of DOE grants and exceptions to the cost cap. Year-to-date 2013 also included an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share, for the restructuring of a leveraged leased investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013.","Also affecting year-over-year comparisons is a $21 million or $0.02 per share of an insurance recovery related to the 2009 litigation settlement with MC Asset Recovery LLC recorded during the second quarter of 2012. Excluding these items, earnings for the second quarter of 2013 were $0.66 per share compared with $0.69 per share for the second quarter of 2012, a decrease of $0.03 per share.","Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2013 excluding these items were a $1.15 per share, compared with $1.12 per share for the same period in 2012, an increase of $0.03 per share. The primary driver for our second quarter results was milder than expected weather, resulting in a decrease of $0.04 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Weather was actually $0.03 per share below normal, compared with $0.01 per share above normal for the same period a year ago.","As a point of interest, the second quarter of 2013 featured the seventh highest level of rainfall in the past 50 years across all of Georgia and Alabama. While this lower temperatures and contributed negatively to our earnings, it also enabled us to increase hydroelectric generation by more than 400% compared to the second quarter of 2012.","Including the results of the first quarter, this has resulted in fuel cost savings for customers of approximately $70 million this year, further evidence of the significant value provided to our customers by a truly diverse generation portfolio. A more detailed summary of our quarter-over-quarter drivers is included in the slide deck.","Turning now to a discussion of our economic outlook for the remainder of the year, earlier this month we reengaged with our economic roundtable participants. As a reminder, this group consists of several regional economists and executives from a handful of our largest customers. The group agreed that the national economic recovery is advancing, but at a very slow pace.","GDP in the first quarter grew at 1.8% and estimates indicate that growth in the second quarter was likely less than 1.5%. GDP growth in the second half of 2013, meanwhile is expected to be in the 1.5% to 2% range, becoming slightly higher than that in 2014. Economic uncertainty continues to hinder the recovery with businesses focusing on issues such as global economic health, costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, and U.S. fiscal and monetary policy.","We believe that all of these issues are affecting electricity usage among all three of Southern company's customer categories. The roundtable participants also reaffirmed, however, that the Southeast is once again on track to outpace the national recovery with the State of Georgia setting the pace. In our regions, commercial and residential sectors, real estate developers and retailers are more upbeat based on consistent sales levels, increased construction activity, and upward pressure on land and property pricing.","Industrial customers meanwhile have had a somewhat more tempered outlook on the second half of 2013, driven by the recent slowing of exports and cautious inventory management. However, there is good news in certain segments with auto production shifting from Asia to the U.S. and increased reshowing activity in appliances and textiles.","In terms of retail sales results for 2013 year-to-date, weather normal sales for all customer classes reflect a decline of 0.7% versus 2012. Adjusted for the leap year effect, overall sales growth is essentially flat. Focusing on the second quarter, total weather normal retail sales decreased 0.5% when compared with the same period in 2012.","Industrial sales grew 0.6% for the second quarter of 2013, compared to the second quarter of 2012. Of our top eight segments representing more than 70% of second quarter industrial sales, six reflected positive growth. Perhaps more importantly, seven of the eight reflected better year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 2013 than they did in the first quarter, even when adjusting for the leap year effect.","Segments exhibiting the highest growth during the second quarter were primarily in the housing-related segments such as textiles at 4.2%; lumber at 12.2%; and stone, clay and glass at 5.9%. Residential sales declined 0.5% and commercial sales declined 1.6% during the second quarter of 2013 on a weather normal basis, compared with the second quarter of 2012.","From an economic development standpoint, the positive momentum of last year has carried over into 2013 as the Southeast continues to be successful in attracting new industry. The State of Georgia, for instance, is bringing in manufacturing, distribution, and new corporate headquarters, as well as communications, IT and life sciences industries.","PulteGroup, a construction company, and PointClear Solutions, a bioscience firm are relocating their headquarters to Atlanta, while General Motors, InfoSystems, Ernst & Young and Aetna Health are all bringing well-paying IT jobs to Atlanta. Georgia is also bringing new film studios into the state with the help of tax incentives.","For instance, Midian Studios is building a studio complex outside of Savannah, and is expected to create 1,200 jobs, while Pinewood Shepperton plc the producer of the James Bond series is building a $1 billion movie studio near Atlanta.","According to the Institute of Supply Management, 19 states are leading the U.S. manufacturing resurgence, and Alabama and Mississippi are amongst those at the top. As expressed recently by the Chairman of Airbus Americas, Alabama puts forth an exceptional and well-coordinated effort in locating new industry such as Airbus, (indiscernible), Mercedes-Benz and ThyssenKrupp just to name a few. This focus on economic development is basic to our DNA across all of our traditional operating companies. As we continue to work together to encourage economic growth for our region.","Moving now to an update of our financing plan for 2013, we have so far this year issued $1.4 billion of debt securities with an average life of 19 years and then have average rate of 3.1%. Our plans include issuing another $2 billion of debt by year-end.","Turning now to our equity issuances, factoring in the updated Kemper cost estimates, we have updated our financing plan to include approximately $520 million for the remainder of 2013, and approximately $600 million in 2014. We plan to begin issuing new shares through our employee and dividend reinvestment plans in August, shortly after filing our second quarter 10-Q. We should be well positioned relative to our long-term equity ratio of approximately 44% by year-end 2014. Our industry leading financial integrities in A credit ratings continue to be priorities for us, as they have served our customers and investors so well for years. Now I\u2019d like to share our earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2013, which will be $1.13 per share.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thanks, Art. As our business environment evolves, Southern Company remains the same, and enterprise that succeed by excelling at the fundamental and relying on the knowledge, skills, and dedications of our people.

It enables us to deliver excellent value drivers, including our commitments, just relating financial integrity, regular, predictable, sustainable growth in earnings per share and likewise dependable dividend to growth.","We are now ready to take your questions. So operator, we\u2019ll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Good afternoon, guys. First question is on sort of near-term, long-term earnings aspiration. I know that you guys expect GDP growth to be better in the second half. What can\/would you do if we get into the deep into the third quarter and we are still seeing economic conditions, sort of below your expectations. Do you have the ability to manage your cost profile such that we could still be comfortable with this year's earnings guidance?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah, I believe that.","Art P. Beattie","Yeah, Greg, we kind of looked at the sensitivities around that. Of course, weather in the first half was less than what we expected to be and we flexed around O&M to offset some of that. As we look at the end of the year, if I were to assume that we would get no loan growth through the remainder of this year. The O&M flex is actually less than what the O&M flex would be last year in terms of our ability to move around that.","Thomas A. Fanning","Last year we made up $0.11 of negative weather I think\u2026","Art P. Beattie","About 7.5% reduction in on-field O&M from what we had planned.","Thomas A. Fanning","All right. So we feel confident.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay. And then longer-term is there a reason why your earnings per share growth rate slide is not in this deck as it was in the first quarter where you are targeting 4% to 6% long-term growth off 2013?","Thomas A. Fanning","No, not really. Let's just kind of lay out what we do know. So if you lay out the equity issuances that Art described, kind of year-by-year dilutive impact of that, this year is like $0.015, next year is like $0.025, and the third year is $0.02 cumulatively that $0.015, $0.04, $0.06.And that that's our best guess at this point, okay.","Outside of that, we've got all of these \u2013 as I described in detail, we have all of these regulatory proceedings going, and you know that the outcome of the Georgia hearings are really important to our forward earnings forecast. So we\u2019re very confident and our forecast for the year, earnings range we described, and as has been our practice and everything else, once we get a little more clarity on these regulatory issues, we will cover long-term guidance as we always do in our January call.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Right. So when I look at the financing in the CapEx plans, which you've alluded to here were $1 billion higher over the next three years relative to the deck that you showed us on the Q4 call. And it looks like the majority of that is in generation and I'm presuming that the vast majority of that's Kemper?","Thomas A. Fanning","That's correct.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","But you are also somewhat higher on T&D, which obviously gives rate base growth, so that's positive, and there were some other small things. But it looks like the vast majority is the generation, right?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes,sir.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning","Of course, the swing, yeah and the other swing factors will be how active we are at Southern Power.","Art P. Beattie","Correct.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Right, yeah, that was my last part of the question was then those Southern Power numbers are to some degree placeholders for opportunistic, transactions to either build or require assets, is that right?","Thomas A. Fanning","Perfect. That's it.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thank you.","Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, Michael.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Tom, real quickly, following a little bit on Greg's question about Southern Power, how much of that CapEx $2.4 billion or so is actually spoken for at this point?","Art P. Beattie","Well, we just closed the deal early, I guess, in the first quarter on Campo Verde, and the amount of total investment there is about $450 million. So there will be some equity allocated to that. But the rest are still placeholders, and we're actively working on other projects, but we are not in a position to make any statements at this time.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah, you know, that our practice is to only announce stuff when it's basically done. I mean, we are closed on some things, but we\u2019ll only announce that when we have clarity.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. But it's an area where if you wanted to \u2013 if projects didn't meet the return hurdles compared to some of the regulated businesses you can alternatively invest in, you could ratchet down CapEx from this number at Southern Power pretty quickly?","Art P. Beattie","Sure. The other issue is, as with all of our companies we have maintenance requirements, which requires capital et cetera. But you're right, I mean to the extent, we want to ratchet back capital at Southern Power that is absolutely at our discretion.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","And is there anything in the incremental CapEx in the new generation line, incremental related to Vogtle?","Art P. Beattie","No.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks. Thanks, guys, much appreciated.","Art P. Beattie","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski, Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, Angie, how are you?","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So I might have missed it, but how do you incorporate the impact of those write-downs of Kemper County on your equity needs? And should I worry about a potential increase in dilution if those write-downs were to occur again?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah, Angie, that was what I laid out when I was talking with Greg. The annual dilutive impacts of the actions we've taken today are $0.015 in 2013, $0.025 in 2014 and $0.02 more in 2015, that relates to the timing of the issuance of the equity, okay.","","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.","Yeah, but that assumes that there are no additional write-downs wherein you haven't really started the gasifier yet and isn't that the most crucial portion of the IGCC plant?","Art P. Beattie","That's right. Let me just repeat though just to be very clear with everybody. I gave you individual years in the aggregate, to give you the aggregate effect. It\u2019s $0.015 in 2013; aggregate $0.04, aggregate $0.06 in 2014 and 2015. And you are right, so we believe we\u2019ve taken action including adding $100 million to contingency. Most of that is related to the start-up and you are correct. The most important issues going forward really move away for materials to the start-up processes. And when we talk about meeting schedule, it\u2019s important for us to highlight two guideposts, if you will, two milestones. Obviously, the endpoint is targeted in Service Day May of 2014. The most important milestone prior to that then will be achieving first fire in the gasifier, which we expect to achieve by year-end 2013.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.","","Okay. Great, and separately, could you tell us anything about Alabama. I mean, I see that you are showing a projected decision, but is there a possibility for settlements maybe some agreement on shedding some of the ROE and increasing your equity ratios?","Art P. Beattie","","The words we used were very intentional. When you look at Alabama's return on total invested capital, taking into account equity ratios, embedded cost of capital, they have one of the most attracted debt balance sheet off of the benefit of their customers in the utility industry. We think that they are in a very fair position. Rather than get what the Commission might do, let's wait and see. We think we'll get some clarity reasonably soon there.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.","Okay, and my last question is what's going on with the legal dispute with Shaw?","Art P. Beattie","So, recall, Shaw was purchased by Chicago Bridge & Iron, and the dispute really goes to the consortium, which is Westinghouse, Chicago Bridge & Iron, and the leader of consortium is Toshiba, okay. I can't give you much of an update except to say this, we could settle that shortly or it could get into a prolonged mode and go to litigation, in which case, it would just be whenever the litigation is concluded; might take some time. I will say that we think that the acquisition of Shaw by Chicago Bridge & Iron was positive in terms of our ability to negotiate and resolve that dispute. But in terms of giving you any further clarity as to amounts or timing, we're really not in a position to do that. I'll say one more thing. The decision by the Georgia \u2013 the situation essentially the breach of the (inaudible) and we think there's soon to be approval of the Georgia Public Service Commission with respect of eliminating the need for the recertification process. They recognized as one of the important factors as they don't want to get issues like that in front of our ability to negotiate successfully with the consortium. All of this, I think is constructive.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Art P. Beattie","Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Ali, how are you?","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Hey, Tom. How are you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning","Great.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Just to be clear on the stipulation. So if I understood you correctly, you have said that you\u2019re going to withdraw your request to certify the increase in the construction cost, is that what you're seeing in that stipulation?","","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah, there is two factors that I think people recognize. When you consider the effectiveness of the VCM process that is essentially a process whereby the Commission evaluates and reviews and approves six months' worth of construction on some lagged basis, it's typically lagged six months. So in essence, right now in front of the Commission, our cost related to July 2012 to December of 2012. We will hear their decision in October. This is the eighth time we've been through the Vogtle Construction Monitor process. We think it's working exceedingly well.","They have an independent monitor, Dr. Bill Jacobs and that process is going exceedingly smoothly and we feel like that process is essentially developed the standards where you to layer on top of that, another process to recertify the plant. So what we've decided and what we've stipulated to, shall we say, is eliminate the need to recertify. Just let the VCM processes work, so there will be VCM 8, 9, 10 and so on, until the conclusion of the project. We feel like that accomplishes the same thing in terms of evaluating costs.","","Art P. Beattie","","And, of course, the other thing I just mentioned was you don't want to get issues out in front of the negotiation in terms of being able to resolve successfully the commercial dispute.","","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Right, but to be clear then, so what you are seeing, Tom, is that both any extra cost that you incur as well as any delays that you may incur is that still \u2013 I mean, your sense is that through the VCM assuming they approve it, that should implicitly improve any cost overruns et cetera?","Thomas A. Fanning","","Yeah, and here again, I\u2019m just going to pick a little bit. I wouldn't call those cost overruns. I know there are increases in cost, but remember the math here, originally we were at 12% associated with the capital cost of Vogtle 3 and 4, now we think we are between 6% and 8%. The remaining annual price increases that we expect to complete Vogtle 3 and 4 less than 1% a year. The $381 million largely increases in cost that are associated with changing the schedule as we have are largely, not exclusively, but largely associated with our own required oversite cost.","Recall that the brick and mortar cost of Vogtle 3 and 4 over this period has only increased 0.5%. So we think all of these things work exceptionally well. And any of this increase to $381 million will not cause an increase in rates to customers. So we think that VCM process is going to handle this exceptionally well and we don't really need to go through the recertification that was originally contemplated.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. Secondly, just to clarify, as you walk through the math on the equity issuance that you now factored into your plan and the $0.06 of dilution through 2015. So when we factored than in, does that still keep you on that 4% to 6% EPS growth rate or does everything ratchet down by that $0.06 is the way we should be thinking about this","Thomas A. Fanning","So the question that we will address in January that I mentioned before, there is a lot in front of us right now in the state regulatory plate, if you will, and, obviously, the biggest issue there is Georgia's triennial rate case. The second probably biggest right now will be the Alabama decision; of course, a bit is related to the Gulf decision, and of course, we have the ongoing process in Mississippi. I think it's best for us all to understand, if we're talking about $0.015 and another $0.025 in 2014, I mean, that all feels very manageable to me. But what we've got to do rather than try and reassess long-term growth rates is let these processes go through, we'll give you a lot more clarity once we know how we end up in all four of our jurisdictions at the end of this year. This is just a big regulatory year for us.","","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","And so last question, Tom, looking at Kemper today with all the information and the extra roughly $1 billion of cost, is that project still as attractive to you as you thought it would be going in frankly given where we are today?","Thomas A. Fanning","Let me split that into two answers. Is it attractive to Mississippi's customers as we honor the regulatory settlement that we reach, it has the economics of a nuclear plant; relatively high capital cost, very cheap energy. It's exceedingly attractive in that respect. Is it attractive to Southern shareholders? No. We are taking a hit here. We understand that nobody here is happy about that, but that's the honest truth.","","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, sir.","Operator","Thank you (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Ridzon is with KeyBanc.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, Paul.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning","Paul, good afternoon.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Most of my questions have been answered. Are you reaffirming guidance? I wasn\u2019t quite clear.","Thomas A. Fanning","We typically don't do that. We give guidance once a year and then we give estimates every quarter, but if you're asking are we confident for the year, yeah, we are.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll (inaudible).","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Hi, Steve.","","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yeah, hi, Tom. Just a clarification on the equity issuance plans. So at the beginning of the year, I think, you guys had ranges of zero to $300 million a year. Should we kind of assume that you are now kind of doing the $300 million for both 2013, 2014, and then adding another $700 million essentially for Kemper?","","Art P. Beattie","","Yeah, I think that's \u2013 Steve, this is Art, I think that's fair. I think if you go back to where we were, the way we think about, we kind of wipe out zero to $300 million now. We're taking into account the needs for equity capital at Mississippi and possible equity capital needed for Southern Power and that's what the new numbers represent.","Thomas A. Fanning","And we\u2019ve already suggested we've done Campo Verde, which is $450 million.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. So I guess obviously, time is just that reflecting more confidence that you are going to do the Southern Power projects or is it more just wanting to kind of have extra balance sheet strength given all those stuff around?","","Art P. Beattie","Yeah, there are some placeholders out there that we are providing for but it is also a supply thing. When you go out and raise equity capital, you can't just turn it off. So\u2026","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Right","Art P. Beattie","\u2026let you shut down your program.","Thomas A. Fanning","I think we are conservative. So I think it is a conservative estimate.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And then I apologize just on clarifying the Georgia stipulation.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Yeah.","","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So you would still do the annual reviews of the six month cost, but the full recertification of the project with updated data you would not do?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah, essentially eliminate, waive the rule\u2026","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Waive the rule to do full \u2013 and that's from here on in, that's not just this time?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah. That's right and just let the VCM process work.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning","Everybody is happy with I think the way that works out. There is one nuance, and I am actually glad you raised the question again, because remember in VCM 8, normally it\u2019s a six month process and because we were going to do recertification and all that other stuff, we extended the timeframe from August into October. And so what we are going to do on that would give you either an overlap or a contracted period for VCM 9. What we\u2019re essentially going to do is roll VCM 9 and 10 together. So we\u2019ll probably make some filing around VCM 9, but that will go through the evaluation of that cost along with the filing associated with VCM 10. So imagine, if you will, 9 and 10 being rolled together, then we\u2019ll be back on this six months cycle.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And just do other parties to the case kind of agree with this, I know it was just filed today, but do you expect there will opposition to this settlement, do you think everyone will agree?","Thomas A. Fanning","I can't speak for the parties, Steve. I think the Commission will approve it.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And I think, wasn\u2019t the report coming out from the examiner shortly?","","Thomas A. Fanning","I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","From the independent monitor, sorry.","Thomas A. Fanning","Friday.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Friday. Is that still going to come out?","Thomas A. Fanning","I think so.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. Okay, thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. The last question Steve asked was what I was going to ask. To follow that up with, there has been some noise in sort of local press about the Governor talking about potential sharing of additional cost of Vogtle. Could you have any comment on that, Tom?","","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah. Absolutely, we've been in contact with the Governor about that. Actually, look, the Governor has been resolute in his support to this project. We think that quote that has been widely reported, probably over-reported in our view, was taken out of context. The quote that people are referring to which him responding to what something somebody else said, and there were statements after that quote. It really relates to he think Georgia Power is doing a terrific job at the project and those project is great. The State of Georgia is proud to help lead the renaissance and variety of other things. I would not view that quote taken by itself to lead to anything that says the Governor lead to anything that says the Governor wants something other than the process that is currently being followed to happen, nobody is suggesting that.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then on Kemper, it seems like this latest cost increase had to do with the review you've been doing since you changed the management. And you have couple of places in your disclosures you suggest that this is something you'll be continuing to do on the go forward. Can you just give us any more comfort or characterize how this analysis is done and how your confidence level, say, versus when you took the initial big write-down before you changed management?","Thomas A. Fanning","So, if you recall, the first adjustment we made was right on the heels, frankly, it was a surprise to everybody and it was right on the heels of all the big changes that we made. We also disclosed that in fact an ongoing review was occurring. And recall the first review was tied up, I would argue mostly with the issues related to material, and price, and quantities and metallurgy and all sorts of things, and not just price, it was cable and hangers and everything else.","So that's kind of what I would say most of that was and it was our best estimate at the time, but we all were very clear that there was more to go and we had to go back and look very closely. I would argue that the 450 is characterized, I would say, the whole group and now we have \u2013 we brought the bear not only the outsiders and insiders we've been using, but construction industry specialists, particularly in gas handling systems, outside construction management evaluators, we have a variety of people in the boat right now.","Like, for example, when we evaluated the contingency that we had, this $100 million extra contingency, we actually had five different estimates of contingency that were resolved into one estimate. It has been a very, very thorough review. And just to tell you this is nothing that is arm\u2019s length, me and my management team, we have something called an Executive Review Board, that\u2019s me and Art; and then it\u2019s Paul Bowers of Georgia Power, he used to be President of Generation; Charles McCrary, CEO of Alabama, he used to be President of Generation; Mark Crosswhite, our COO; Kim Greene, our CEO of Southern Company Services; she actually had experience in generation at TVA.","We had Chris Womack. I am probably leaving some people out, but we all went out to the plant site, and spent a whole afternoon diving into all of the details with management. Recall, leading the management team is the new CEO there, Ed Holland, and then we have our best construction guy, Ashley Baker, and a variety of other people. And we\u2019ve really torn these numbers apart.","It is our best estimate. If I had to tell you where the future exposure may occur, I think it relates to schedule. Interestingly, if you go back to some of the accounting issues we had after the year-end restatement of first quarter and everything else, was worries and perhaps lack of evidence about our ability to double the productivity of installing pipe, for example, in a month. Well, in fact, in the month of June, we did that. So these were things that people were questioning and looking hard at. In fact, the team on the ground accomplished that very challenging objective. So it\u2019s a challenge, but the report so far is that we believe the targets are achievable related to schedule, and that is where I think the biggest risk is right now.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks, Tom. Can I just ask one other thing on \u2013 in the release, you sort of stressed the rainfall situation and mild temperatures, and tie a lot of that together so went on in the economy in the second quarter. I think weather have sort of become a little more normal in the first month of Q3. Have you seen things to set back on to trajectory or is?","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, Jonathan, it may have been normal in New York, it\u2019s been awful here.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning","It\u2019s raining right now. It\u2019s unbelievable how much. It\u2019s just didn\u2019t mild, let me just put it that way, but lots and lots of rainfall.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So whatever you were saying Q2, you\u2019re continuing to see it?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah, it got a little warmer kind of at the end of July. But today again, it\u2019s cloud cover and rain.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning","So we will see. I think let me just give you a little more line, we would like to do that. What is normal weather? How much of that we had? I\u2019m looking at Art right now.","Art P. Beattie","Yeah, Jonathan, if you go back and look at above normal weather in the last 22 months, we\u2019ve had three months out of those 22 that were above normal.","Thomas A. Fanning","I know you said it was the seventh weather quarter for Alabama and Georgia, it was the second weather quarter for Georgia in the past 50 years. This is just extraordinary what we\u2019re living through right now.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for all the color, Tom.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Julian Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities","Hi, good afternoon. Can you hear me?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, sir, can hear you fine.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities","Excellent, so quick question, and again, this kind of relates back to SCANA\u2019s comments at the Analyst Day, but when it comes to the timeline for Vogtle and receipt of modules, how is that going? I mean, they talked at least initially about receiving some parts perhaps ahead of schedule versus others. So, are you seeing anything like that, maybe offset some of the pressures on schedule that we\u2019ve talked about thus far?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, look, I think the major milestones that we pointed out in the fourth quarter will be CA20, it\u2019s kind of the major critical path for us, and then of course, flooring the basemat in Unit 4. So those are the two big ones. We have seen an improvement. we\u2019ve noted and if you read the Independent Monitors\u2019 report that has been an area of concern for some time is getting material out of the manufacturing facility in the Louisiana. My sense is now that the material is being manufactured. it\u2019s really now focused on getting nuclear quality documentation related to the material that is being delivered. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on now. We\u2019ve sent our own people to the site. That process is improving, and recall too that Chicago Bridge & Iron\u2019s acquisition of Shaw, we think it is a big plus to improving that situation.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities","Excellent. And then going back to the IGCC side of the equation, you talked about short-term debt last go around to the kind plug the balance sheet if you will temporarily. Is that all out of the picture here? Just want to be very clear, I mean, you talked all about equity, but just want to be sure on the debt side. What\u2019s going on there?","Art P. Beattie","Yeah. And again, I think we mentioned that it\u2019s resolving Southern\u2019s equity ratio back to a point before we began with the write-offs associated with the plant, that would be 43.5%, 44% and getting Mississippi by that same timeframe back to close to their 50%, which is contemplated in their seven or eight plant. So there maybe some intermittent that and downloading, but we\u2019re not going to fund the cash to Mississippi until they needed to do the construction additions that we\u2019d outline.","Thomas A. Fanning","And that\u2019s what we thought it was kind of instructive to give you the year-by-year effect that we\u2019re seeing right now. Of course, you could see some variance there.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities","","Great. so all of that\u2019s out of the way, the equities will be done now resolved everything?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah. what we\u2019d describe relates to the effects of Kemper, completely.","Julian Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities","Great. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony C. Crowdell \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Hey. How are you guys?","Art P. Beattie","Good.","Thomas A. Fanning","Good. How are you?","Anthony C. Crowdell \u2013 Jefferies LLC","So far, so good. Hopefully, two softball questions, the first one relates to the Great State of Alabama, and there was language in the press you saw \u2013 you read from some of the commissions in Alabama that there may be some change in Alabama\u2019s rates or whatever. Just what is the processes, has that become like if there\u2019s a decision to maybe change the rate structure for Alabama Power, has that become a full litigated rate proceeding and if rates were reduced it\u2019s more of end of 2014 event than maybe an end of 2013 event? And the second question is, your relative potential exposure or what could potentially be higher in Kemper, would be maybe scheduling. Is there a way that \u2013 is the company I guess tied down to getting the unit on line, is there a certain date, or if you don't make the schedule, why spend the money; whatever, not work three shifts or whatever you're doing just to get the unit, I guess finished with a lower cost estimate?","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, well, let me take Kemper; you take Alabama. Art used to be the CFO of Alabama. He knows that State intimately. Look, we're spending some extra money every month now in order to hit the date. I mean, we've talked about that before. And remember, the first milestone, the focus on is to get that gasifier heat up by the end of the year, so 12\/31 is kind of what we want to do there.","What we save by spending more money now is exposure beyond the in-service date is essentially whatever is going to be required to continue to get startup complete, plus carrying cost, plus whatever, and depending on how regulations works. So this is kind of a murky area. We'll have more clarity on this probably later in the year. But the additional cost beyond May could be somewhere between $15 million a month and $14 million a month, and all that's driven by kind of how you recover the AFUDC, what happens to the test revenues, to the electricity you sell as you continue to start-up process, how the regulatory capture mechanisms will work and how much more kind of maintenance you will have to do in order to complete start-up.","So I know that's a wide range, but it's a whole range of factors that we are looking at. In any event, we think that the actions we're taking now that relate to increased cost to meet schedule is a dominant solution and represents no regrets; ultimately delivering we think long-term, great value to customers. Art, why don't you talk about Alabama?","Art P. Beattie","Yeah, Anthony, on the question about where does Alabama go and what kind of arrangement, does it become more formal or does it become some kind of agreement. It's really hard to say at this point, but I would imagine that it would be some kind of consent agreement that both the commission and the company would sign on to, but again that's a function of whatever the outcome of the commission's recommendation would be.","Anthony C. Crowdell \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you for your time, guys.","Art P. Beattie","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, Mark.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Equity Research","Hey, good afternoon. Hey, how are you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning","Good.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Equity Research","One quick question, that you've covered the big construction projects a lot, so I'll leave that. But I wanted to talk a little bit about the power usage situation. I know that there was a lot of impact from the weather, but I cannot look at the commercial and wonder a little bit about what's going on there so far in the year and wonder if you could provide a little bit of color on \u2013 and what you think is driving that kind of the decline?","Art P. Beattie","Yeah, Mark, we kind of look at that as well, we were up in the first quarter on a weather normal basis. We're down in the second quarter on a weather normal basis. And as we look back over the last six or seven quarters, commercial has been very volatile, so it's kind of hard to get a pattern of growth. But as we think about it in the second quarter anyway, the lot of rainfall certainly has an effect on temperatures, certainly has an effect on usage from that perspective, but we think it also impacts recreational activity, which reflects a lot of usage in the summer time going to the beach in the rain or going to amusement park, what have you. These are just kind of examples and we try to cite to ourselves, but it\u2019s again, it\u2019s a contrary to us as well.","Thomas A. Fanning","So let me give you an example. You would not believe the depth we go to, they get our keen information and try and get some enlightenment about this. We actually measure the traffic on the Pensacola Beach Bridge, and in fact in the second quarter, the traffic on the Pensacola Beach Bridge was down 10%. what that tells you is, nobody wants to go sit on the beach when it\u2019s raining. Likely and I have heard this from some other folks at the fed, likely it reduces traffic to restaurants, I mean things like that moves itself. So I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing here is just a lack of activity or reduced activity as a result.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Equity Research","All right, fair enough. I think this is going to be a little bit bigger picture. and I know MATS obviously, a much bigger impact on your fleet. but I\u2019m just wondering if you could share some thoughts, you\u2019ve got the rehearing of CSAPR here in October, and the administration\u2019s new draft rule \u201con CO2\u201d something that\u2019s probably far out in 2015, but it\u2019s kind of a line in the sand, I guess. So I\u2019m wondering what your feeling is around the political situation and how that might play out?","Thomas A. Fanning","","So I\u2019ll take the political situation in GHG. I\u2019ll let you take the rest of the stuff if you want to, how about that? So it\u2019s pretty clear I think that there is a succession of move increased regulation around carbon intensive energy forms. and the latest I think is greenhouse gases, the President came out and made an important speech in our view about that. Here is kind of our beliefs on that. Number one, nothing that President said to us was terribly surprising; I think we wait to see how the details emerge, so that will be key. our sense is consistent with what I think general beliefs are, and it\u2019s what we\u2019ve suggested in other calls, that probably the end of the summer sometime, they will come out with some standard for new sources, and probably 2014 will be existing sources. Recall there are important considerations that will need to be made in order to understand the aggregate effect of everything going on in EPA in terms of regulations, because you just had this big math rule that caused certain companies to spend billions of dollars.","now it impacted us more in terms of shifting away from coal and shutting down some coal plants and converted some coal plants. We already had our scrubbers and SCR is pretty much in place. The other thing that\u2019s just interesting to know, I mean think about Southern\u2019s position relative to almost anybody else in the industry. When you think about new sources and exposure to carbon intensity, we\u2019re leading the renaissance of nuclear in America, no carbon. We are going to get done successfully with Kemper County that has a carbon footprint equivalent to or less than natural gas.","So that\u2019s positive. We\u2019ve made a huge shift away from coal to gas to where we used to be 70% energy from coal, now we\u2019re 45% with gas. we\u2019re the third largest consumer of natural gas in United States. We have extended our reach either through ownership or through contracts with now about 1,200 megawatts in about the last 12 months in terms of renewable, that\u2019s for procuring wind energy and either procuring solar, or owning solar. When you consider that plus what we\u2019ve already been doing in terms of energy efficiency. It\u2019s easy for me to say that it would be hard to find somebody that\u2019s doing more in terms of kind of handling the GHG issue in a very practical \u2013 both tactical and strategic way.","Finally, we continue to be the only company in our industry, invested in proprietary robust research and development. We continue to work on new ideas. We continue to promote energy innovation. and I think that will be a keystone of ours going forward. In terms of things away from carbon, I\u2019ll let Art comment on that.","Art P. Beattie","Yeah, Mark. I guess the biggest item we\u2019re dealing with right now would be the new affluent guidelines that were published in the proposed rules that were published in June. Our comments are due in September, I think they outlined eight different options with four preferred. we\u2019re evaluating a lot of data around these and we will be involved in commenting on the rules by that September date. Don\u2019t really have a good feel in terms of cost related to that at this point.","The other rule as you\u2019re probably aware, coal ash the final rule timing is still uncertain, but it might not be until next year. That\u2019s certainly the biggest element in terms of cost for us. and then of course, 316(b), those rules were postponed from April till November. and we\u2019ll get a better chance to see what that final rule looks like as well. But the biggest element of the three of those is probably the ash rule, and there is a number of other things going on as well, but I\u2019ll stop at that point.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Equity Research","","All right. Thanks a lot guys.","Art P. Beattie","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Art P. Beattie","Good afternoon, Dan","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hey. Just question on the solar program, in Georgia, they got approved by the commission during the quarter. Just kind of, if you could share your thoughts on how you see that playing through (inaudible) and the investment from Georgia Power versus maybe Southern Power, and when we could see action?","Thomas A. Fanning","You bet. So, 525 megawatts were approved, 100 of that I think it\u2019s targeting distributed generation, which I\u2019ve talked about at some length in the past. And then kind of the other 425 would be your more traditional central station approaches. So that\u2019s part of the 2013 IRP, Integrated Resource Plan that is competitive road. in other words, anybody can go through a process and try and win the business. What we have said internally is that we\u2019d like to win a good bit of that business. And so there\u2019s really three ways, at least three ways we can attack it. One is the Georgia retail approach, essentially rate basis, another would be Georgia wholesale that is Georgia providing generation on a wholesales basis like they do on some of their other energy contracts, third will be essentially Southern Power or something similar to Southern Power owning it.","Now the only nuance, Dan, I\u2019ll throw on you there is distributed generation is enough of a different animal. We may take even a special business unit approach to that. we may pull together some folks in the system and take a look at kind of how we might approach that business. That\u2019s much more a people-intensive business than these central-station approaches. And then finally, recall that anybody they goes after this business will have to pass essentially an evaluation by an independent monitor that will regularly as they do here assess competitive bid.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Tom, when do you think you could have more on that and would that be potentially carve out of money, if you think, we\u2019re going to Southern Power or do you think that would be your additive to the CapEx program in the slides today?","Thomas A. Fanning","I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s near-term. I bet you, I don\u2019t know when soonest you could probably get stuff done, maybe by 2015, 2016 somewhere in that timeframe, those will be kind of when I think the generation would come in. So back up a little bit, so a year or two in advance of that, something like that.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay, got it. And then on just accounting anytime, you guys give a good rundown on the industrial side. but can you talk a little bit about residential as far as household formation and home construction looks right now and yeah, down demand for residential, how deep are the usage reductions you guys are seeing amongst that customer price?","Art P. Beattie","Yeah, this is Art. What we\u2019ve seen so far is we\u2019ve added year-to-date about 15,000 new customers, new meters to our systems, and our estimate for the year was about 24,000. So we\u2019re making good progress on that front. However, we look at the usage of some of those new customers; a lot of them are multifamily rent units, some are single family homes, but the vast majority, I think are multifamily. And the way I kind of view it Dan, is, you build a new multifamily apartment building and it's occupied over time.","So, our usage per customer for those new units is way down. And I think there is a function of getting people to move in fully and to occupy those residences as a normal customer would. That will turn around. And we think that's part of our second half equation. But again, we've done a bit better than what we've expected on new customer growth and with the housing improving here in Atlanta and in Georgia. We see that continuing, again, with all the announced jobs, IT type jobs, in and around Atlanta that will be attracting new people into the state, will certainly put more pressure on that equation as well.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","When you guys look at kind of the relationship between usage in GDP and that sort of thing, if you look out to say 2014, 2015. What kind of load growth, do you think is durably sustainable, once we get past kind of the slow first half of this year, if we do see a recovery?","Art P. Beattie","Well, it is our kind of long-term estimate. Heuristic, it's still pretty good 50% to 60% of GDP growth. So that's kind of what we've been doing. So the other thing it's interesting, in fact, we've just had a guy come speak to our Board. Dan, one of the interesting thing that really confounds people, I think, the people especially to think that energy efficiency is going to deplete electricity usage, is that the economy is getting more and more electrified. And there is all sorts of interesting dynamics, when I give these speeches, I always hold up my iPhone at that point. So we have all these juicy devices in here your arm. But it is kind of much more than that.","When you stream something like you want to watch some episode of Mad Men or something, you watch it for an hour on your iPad. It isn't just what's going on in your house, you are lighting up servers all over the place. There are much more significant compound effect of greater bandwidth in the information economy that are electricity intensive. And we think and the work that we all have done and we showed this at the last fall financial conference, we continue to see the evidence. That in fact, electricity consumption is trumping the drag by energy efficiency. So, we think we'll see this for some time. Longer term, electricity sales we would think would be in the 1.3% range.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","I guess, one last question because it's been regionally tropical, has been kind of the long-term contracted generation going into some sort of yield coal mechanism where you can offer a big yield off the cash flows and then raise capital when you need to invest. Have you guys, you've always done this before. But have you guys looked at Southern Power as potentially unlocking some value going that route?","Art P. Beattie","When you think about Southern Power and the long-term contracted business that it already has it is such a well good match to our regulated model. It really doesn't differentiate it like it would for say, NRG and provide them with that benefit. Southern Company is already a deal co, in a way I think but\u2026","Thomas A. Fanning","Here is the other way to answer that. We look at everything all the time and we will look at the deal co, concept. I am not sure unlocking value with Southern Power serves our long-term interest. We used the other word here that in the world of finance there is lots of tricks and no magic. We really like the way our pieces fit together now. If it ever does make sense and provide sustaining value increase rather than instant gratification we will do that. But we remain committed to a long-term prompter on those issues.","","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Very good. Thank you, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes sir.","","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Videla Marti with CDP Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Videla Marti \u2013 CDP Capital","Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Videla?","Videla Marti \u2013 CDP Capital","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, how are you?","Videla Marti \u2013 CDP Capital","I\u2019m doing well, thank you. I'm wondering I missed the very beginning the date on which you expect to hear from the commission in Alabama? And secondarily, I think the, if I recall properly the ROE adjustments we've seen for a much smaller gas LDCs has been in the range of about 200 basis points roughly. So, I'm wondering if you could just remind us what your sensitivity is at Alabama Power for with regards to I'll call it 100 basis points or whatever adjustments on the current ROE range you have.","Thomas A. Fanning","So, let me just first say and we said this in I think, we said a little bit in the script, we said it in our first question. Look, we think the ROIC that Alabama enjoys is appropriate and serves our customers\u2019 long-term interest, and in fact when you consider the equity ratio, the debt ratio, the embedded cost of capital, Alabama is reasonable and fair. Number one, let's not get ahead of what the commission wants to do, but that's our position. In terms of when the commission will rule, it\u2019s just going to be in the months ahead. We don't think it's going to be six months, but I think it will be in the next quarter or so.","Videla Marti \u2013 CDP Capital","","There is no president in Alabama for doing anything retroactive, I think the decisions \u2013 I don't call anything from the decisions from Mobile and whatever that had anything to do retroactive for the full year of 2013, this is all perspective, correct?","Thomas A. Fanning","That's our understanding. But you remember Mobile and Alabama are completely different, they have a much thicker equity ratio than Alabama does. I would hesitate to draw parallel between one company and another. The other thing that would be fun to work at is if you could get a view of the webcast or whatever of \u2013 any of the proceedings. Alabama enjoys a lot of support by its customers. I think Alabama demonstrated successfully their side of the art.","Videla Marti \u2013 CDP Capital","All right, Tom. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes sir, thank you.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Hey good morning.","Thomas A. Fanning","Paul how are you?","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","How are you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning","(inaudible).","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","First of all, if the Kemper schedule for coming online slips past to 2014 spring deadline, what happens to the deal we subsidy? Is there any risk there or\u2026","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, you lose them.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","You lose them for sure?","Thomas A. Fanning","You lose ITC.","","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Okay.","","Thomas A. Fanning","Not the deal DOE stuff, I'm sorry. So, the $133 million investment tax credit is what you would lose, I'm sorry I thought you were referring to","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","","Okay","","Thomas A. Fanning","It's not the deal we're funding\u2026","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","The deal we're funding with refine money.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Just sort of bigger picture here, Vogtle, is the first new neutral plant in decades. And, I mean just how do we see it in terms of, in the context of Kemper? I mean, obviously Kemper has been a disappointment, as you mentioned, in terms of what was projected and what happened in terms of costs. Could just, I mean not any great detail, but just sort of a bigger picture, obviously, it's understandable that somebody might simply think hey, that Kemper, which is also sort of a cutting-edge technology kind of thing, why won't that happen at Vogtle?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah. Let me give you a simple answer.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Yeah, simple.","Thomas A. Fanning","The simplest answer is we agreed to a cost cap was only about 10% to 15% of the engineering done and what's happened is as we've completed the engineering, we ran into the problem that oh my goodness we're going to run over on cost and schedule, and we've reduced the schedule. At the same time, we agreed to the price cut. That actually occurred in early 2010, okay. We didn't know we had a problem then. But in fact, that's when we had a problem. We only knew we had the problem once the engineering became complete and we saw the implications of the rapid construction. By any investigation that we've done here the construction has actually been exceedingly effective, okay. That is completely the opposite of what we have seen in Vogtle, because recall the licensing process by the NRC.","Remember there were two pieces, the DCD, the Design Control Document was essentially a large scale engineering effort of the technology AP1000 and then the COL, which put that technology on your site and took into account all the site-specific issues and then resulted in the combined construction operating license. Essentially, spoke for the lion share of the engineering as you thought about moving forward with construction. It was exactly the opposite of what we did at Kemper. Man oh man, I think that's going to serve us well on Vogtle. I think that's just one single big reason, why I don't expect Vogtle to be anything like Kemper.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Is there any risk of not having recertification at all to shareholders? In other words, I mean I'm just wondering, is there any by far going recertification, is there any \u2013 just could you elaborate what the impact, if any need that actually have?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah Paul, I think it's really kind of a timing issue. You are going to evaluate all the cost along the way whether you do one or the up. If you force recertification now, the commission could do a lot of different things with the new cost, otherwise they're going to cover those same costs through the DCM process.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","","So just duplicate really is recertification.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah, really is. Yeah.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","","Okay. I just want to make sure. And then just finally, on sales growth, the view of labor statistics I think released today the revised 2012 GDP at 2.8%. Now they also served lowered the first half of this year or the first quarter whatever. But I mean, generally speaking, this 0.5% to 0.6% of GDP growth doesn't seem to have held in weather adjusted for you guys right. It was like 0.4% for 2012 and you guys are characterizing with leap year, this year so far being flat. So without getting in to what's going on with industrials or commercial whatever just in general, I mean, and I just also noticed with the Gulf Power saying that you guys are coming in a little bit sooner to expected because of sales growth. So, I\u2019m just sort of wondering is there any thought about potentially revisiting of the projections there with these sort of adjustments?","Art P. Beattie","","Yeah, Paul, we look at that all the time. Our marketing research, load research folks are constantly evaluating. We've had some extreme weather in both 2012 and 2013. And so when you get to weather normalization, it begins it gets a little more fuzzy on the margins than it does when you got more normal weather. So there\u2019s lots of issues here that could influence your actual results. Again, the long-term, we kind of use that more long-term than we do short term. But sometimes those things will move on either side of it. Just in the period of strange weather and slower than expected economic growth.","Thomas A. Fanning","Just to underline what Art said, and we try to get you guys to, I mean, we understand you have a difficult job trying to figure all this stuff out, that's a good long-term heuristic to use to help you understand it. Just remember that what we do is detail bottoms up approach and then we circle back with the economic forms that are on hold to confirm what we're seeing inside. And then we have also insight through my work with the Fed. And I will say that what we're coming up with internally is very consistent with what the Fed is timing.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC"," Okay, and then just in terms of long-term EPS growth and I know this is, I think Ali and Greg were asking about this. Just to understand this, I mean you did mention that it's a regulatory year obviously, things with Kemper didn't work out exactly as we had previously expected, is the 4% to 6% growth I know that you guys usually address this in the fourth quarter. But I mean, you did mention to Paul Ridzon that you were sort of reiterating the guidance when asked in terms of 2013, in terms of your confidence. How should we think about your confidence for the 4% to 6% growth in January, if you could just elaborate a little bit more on that just in terms of how do you feel about that given all the stuff that's been happening?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, yeah, I think, I would say what I said before, I appreciate you asking again. The most dominant thing is what's going to happen with Georgia. The second most dominant thing is what\u2019s going to happen with Georgia. The second most dominant thing is what\u2019s going to happen with Alabama. I think we\u2019ve separated out the effects of Kemper, $0.015 this year, $0.025 independent, $0.04 in the aggregate next year, et cetera. I mean, we\u2019ve been through that. So my view is, I\u2019m just a little reluctant. I guess, what I\u2019m saying is our 4% to 6% remains until I see a reason to change it, and I\u2019m not going to change it until I see what happens with these regulatory calendar that we have in front of us in 2013.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Okay, I appreciate it.","Thomas A. Fanning","We\u2019ll stick to our guns on that. We will give you new estimates in January.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks a lot guys.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is a follow-up question from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Tom, just a follow-up on Vogtle, real quick. I want to make sure I understand the stipulation you guys signed today.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Every six months, will you all simply go in and ask for approval of the money you spend the prior six months on the plant and you won\u2019t come in and give the commission an update on here is what we expect the total plant costs to be overall meaning till the end of construction or will that last data point still be given to the commission?","Art P. Beattie","Yes. You know, this is\u2026","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, it\u2019s Michael, I\u2019m sorry.","Art P. Beattie","I\u2019m sorry, Michael, I forgot. The way we think about it is there will still be communications with the commission about total costs. And we\u2019ll still file those projections with them, but the actual approval will come in each of the six-month processes as Tom has described.","Thomas A. Fanning","That\u2019s right.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","Art P. Beattie","And all that, Michael, you should know was hand in glove, we have an independent evaluator. It\u2019s exactly the processes that we\u2019ve been following so far through VCM 1 through 7 and the process we\u2019re following now with the exception we are not going to do the recertification, with a 5% cost figure includes.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, okay. So, it\u2019s strictly not having to go through the formal process of getting commission approval, but they will still be the disclosure in the public domain about whether the cost has gone down, due to construction or due to lower financing costs or whether \u2013 kind of your long-term projection of the total plant cost?","Art P. Beattie","That\u2019s correct.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning","The only thing we didn\u2019t talk about I was just interested, I think I want to throw out that we received some positive momentum certainly since we have Secretary Moniz assume his position with respect to loan guarantees. Our view is that, we had a renewed sense of urgency. I can\u2019t tell you that we\u2019re more likely to get it or not, but I can tell you that the temperature has been turned up on the parties in seeking to achieve resolution on that negotiation. We didn\u2019t talk about that. I probably ought to throw that out there. That is another important factor that\u2019s positive for Vogtle.","Anyway look, we\u2019re continuing to work hard. We hate the fact here, we had another increase on Kemper. We\u2019re continuing to work to make sure that that covers everything that we know. It is our best estimate. We\u2019re going to work hard to bring that thing in now on time with the new numbers. We appreciate you following us and we\u2019re going to work hard on your behalf.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Southern Company's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.","Daniel Tucker","Thank you, Rebecca. Welcome everyone to Southern Company's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call. To follow along during the call you can access these slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com.","We have a full agenda for today's call. We will begin with a brief recap of 2014 operational highlights, followed by an update on the Kemper and Vogtle projects. We will then discuss fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results and sales results, and finally we will provide earnings guidance for 2015.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas Fanning","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that Southern Company's franchise operations have never performed better than they did in 2014.","In 2014, we continue to provide the best customer service in the business. In fact, Southern Company and its four traditional operating companies occupied the top five spots for all customer classes combined in the customer value benchmark survey, our annual peer comparison of United States electric utilities. This marks the 11th time in the past 13 years that Southern Company has ranked in the top cortile for all customer classes in that survey.","And earlier this month, those of our traditional operating companies that were rated in the J.D. Power & Associates survey, all ranked either first or second in their respective categories. Alabama Power was also named the most-trusted residential electric utility in America by Lifestory Research, an independent consumer market research firm.","In terms of system reliability, we have continued to set and raise the bar. Our 2014 peak season EFOR of 1.9% was particularly exceptional compared to the most recent five-year national average of around 9%. And our transmission and distribution businesses performed superbly, setting all-time system records for frequency and duration of transmission outages as well as an all-time system record for distribution outage frequency. Meanwhile, we achieved our second best year ever in the duration of distribution outages.","We also continue to grow our wholesale renewable portfolio through our Southern Power subsidiary, which added three new solar facilities in 2014. The 20 megawatt Adobe facility in California, the 50 megawatt Macho Springs facility in New Mexico and the 150 megawatt Solar Gen 2 facility in California.","Southern Power also had a 131 megawatt solar plant under development in Georgia that is expected to begin operation in late 2016. With completion of this facility, Southern Power is expected to own more than 460 megawatts of solar capacity, and is clearly becoming an industry leader in the advancement and operation of this important technology.","In these areas and many others, Southern Company's franchise business continues to lead the way, strengthening existing operations and seeking new opportunities to expand our reach, all for the benefit of the customers and communities we serve.","Let's now discuss our two large construction project, beginning with plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. As you can see from the site photo, we have included in our slide deck, progress continues on Vogtle 3 and 4, including completion of the 601 foot Unit 3 cooling tower in December. Our focus continues to be on quality and safety for the entire project with the two nuclear islands, as our critical path going forward.","Major concrete work is progressing on both units, as we prepare for key module placements later this year. For Unit 3, we are working towards installation of the CA01 module inside the containment vessel this spring and the first shield building panel this summer. For Unit 4, we are working towards installation of the CA04 module in the containment vessel and assembly of the CA20 auxiliary building.","Vogtle 3 and 4 remain a valuable investment for customer. Considering all of the $2.3 billion in projected customer benefits, including production tax credits, DOE loan guarantees and CBI pay-in rates, in addition to the benefits of low cost nuclear fuel, we expect the net rate effect on Georgia Power customers to be approximately 6.8%. Recall that when the Georgia Public Service Commission initially approved the project in 2009, base rates were expected to increase 12%.","L.A. last week, we disclosed the receipt of a revised forecast for completion from our contractors that reflects an 18-month delay from the previous estimated in-service days. The process of reviewing the revised forecast for completion, the drivers for change and possible mitigation opportunities continues.","We have not agreed to any change to the guaranteed substantial completion dates, nor do we believe that all efforts to mitigate the contractor delays have been made. Based on our review thus far and considering the fixed and firm nature of our EPC contract, we believe the contractors are responsible for their costs associated with the delay and any costs to mitigate. We will still be responsible for our share of the owners cost.","For example, cost associated with oversight and operational readiness, which we estimate to be approximately $10 million per month. We will also continue to incur financing cost of approximately $30 million per month. Our contract also provides for liquidated damages for each day the two units are late, and this stipulation should help mitigate the cost of any delay.","Largely because of the protections provided in our EPC contract, even if one assumes the entire 18-month contractor delay, the rate impact to customers is minimal and were made solidly inside our earlier projection of 6% to 8%. We will continue our review process and plan to file our 12th Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report with the Georgia Public Service Commission on February 27.","Now, let's turn to an update on the Kemper County IGCC project. As we shared with you in October, we are moving down three parallel path towards first syngas production in the third quarter of this year. I'm pleased to report that all three paths, operational training, control systems validation and start-up and check-out activities are underway and progressing well.","Steam blows and a series of low pressure tests were completed in late 2014. The first quarter of this year will include critical airflow tests as well as first fire of the gasifier this spring. During the same timeframe, we will be testing and tuning our Lignite delivery system.","The combined cycle at Kemper project also continues to perform very well. We expect the fine tuning we've enabled to do while operating the unit on natural gas will benefit the project greatly during the final integration with the gasifier.","With construction largely behind us and in recognition of the critical startup and operational activities ahead, in early December we augmented our existing team by adding a new Site Vice President, Chip Troxclair. Chip brings over 30 years of industry experience to the project, primarily in the startup and operation of gasification plants. Chip's extensive background combined with existing expertise, already on site, will help us navigate the startup process all the way through the operation of the facility.","Turing to the regulatory front, we continue to have constructive discussions with the PSE staff in Mississippi. As is our usual approach, we prefer to let those discussions conclude, before we share any details.","I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic review.","Arthur Beattie","Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had solid results for the fourth quarter 2014 as well as for the full year 2014. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we earned $0.33 per share compared to $0.47 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we earned $2.21 per share compared to $1.88 per share in 2013.","Our results for the fourth quarter 2014 include after-tax charges of $43 million or $0.05 per share. And the earnings for the full year 2014 include after-tax charges totaling $536 million or $0.59 per share related to increased cost estimates for construction of Mississippi Power's Kemper County integrated gasification combined cycle project.","Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2013 include after-tax charges of $25 million or $0.03 per share. And earnings for the full year 2013 include after-tax charges totaling $729 million or $0.83 per share related to increased cost estimates for construction of the Kemper project.","As a reminder, Mississippi will not seek recovery of estimated cost to complete the facility above the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of Department of Energy grants and exceptions to the cost cap.","Results for the full year 2013 also include an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leverage lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2013 also include $12 million or $0.02 per share of insurance recovery related to the March 2009 litigation settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery, LLC.","Excluding these items, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 were $0.38 and $2.80 per share, respectively, compared with $0.48 and $2.71 per share, respectively, for the same periods in 2013.","Earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 were positively influenced by retail revenue effect at Southern Company's traditional operating companies, offset by increased operating and maintenance expenses. Full year 2014 earnings were further positively influenced by closer-to-normal weather and increased customer growth compared with the full year 2013.","Moving now to an economic and sales review of 2014. As expected, economic growth in 2014 was modest, but after experiencing weakness during the first quarter, the company expanded strongly throughout the remainder of the year. This expansion was led by manufacturing output, increased exports and a stronger domestic economy.","Total weather adjusted retail sales grew 0.9% in 2014 led by industrial sales, which were up 2.3% in the fourth quarter and 3.3% for the year. We have now enjoyed seven consecutive quarters of positive year-over-year industrial sales growth in our region.","We experienced growth across all major industrial segments, with sales now at pre-recession levels. The strongest segments include primary metals up 8% and transportation up 6%. Housing-related industries continue to improve with both lumbar and stone, clay and glass up 5%.","Weather adjusted residential sales were essentially flat for 2014. Customer gains in the first quarter of 2014 were interrupted due to extreme weather, but began recovering in the second quarter.","In fact, we added more than 31,500 new residential customers in 2014, 15% ahead of 2013, and saw the issuance of 57,000 residential building permits or 6% more than in 2013. Personal income, meanwhile, grew at 2% in 2014 compared with flat growth in 2013, but a higher share of multi-family customer gains continues to challenge use per customer growth.","Weather adjusted commercial sales were down 0.4% for the year and continue to be challenged by high office and retail vacancy rates. In Atlanta, for example, vacancy rates were 18% versus a national average of 17%.","On the bright side, however, employment growth continues to absorb excess office and retail space in Atlanta, which is ranked number 10 nationally in overall office market activity and number one in hotel occupancy rates. Meanwhile, our economic development pipeline remains robust with more than 300 projects, representing 43,000 potential jobs and over $29 billion dollars in potential capital investment.","Major announcements in the fourth quarter of 2014 included the decision by Mercedes Benz to relocate its U.S. headquarters to Metro Atlanta, a move that will add some 800 jobs to the local economy. General Motors' decision to locate a technology development center in Metro Atlanta creating 400 jobs and plans by Unisys for a research and development center in Augusta, which will create some 700 jobs. In addition, H\u00e4ring, a manufacturer of precision automotive components will locate a production facility in Hartwell, Georgia creating an additional 800 jobs.","Looking ahead to 2015, industrial sales are expected to lead the way with growth of 1.7% continuing the momentum of the last seven quarters. Some of our industrial customers could be positively impacted or affected by lower oil prices, while others could be negatively affected by an increase in the value of the dollar and a slowing global economy.","Elsewhere, we anticipate continued residential growth of around 1% and commercial sales grow of approximately 1.4%. The primary driver of residential sales growth should be continued strengthening of residential customer growth and a continued recovery of the economy.","The strengthening of personal income growth. Both residential and commercial sales should benefit from lower oil prices, which some have characterized as a $700 per car oil dividend. As noted earlier, the Atlanta office market is one of the most active in the U.S. with vacancy rates dropping throughout 2014.","In 2015, we expect to add more than 1 million square feet of office and retail space to be added in just three new Atlanta area mixed use developments, Ponce City market, Avalon and Buckhead Atlanta. These new commercial projects are expected to absorb the majority of their new space during 2015 and should therefore contribute to increased energy sales this year.","As a final note, we reengaged earlier this month with our economic roundtable group of regional economist and executives from several of our largest customers that meets twice a year. The panel has indicated that they expect GDP growth of approximately 3% in 2015, consistent with our own expectation, but we're cautious about the potential impact of a stronger dollar in the short-term and higher oil prices later in the year.","The group agrees with our expectation, that industrial activity will continue to improve, but believes that growth will be more restrained than in 2014 and that U.S. housing markets will continue on an upward trend. Meanwhile, the group expects the global economy to remain sluggish.","In addition to our new sales forecast, we have included an updated capital expenditure forecast and financing plan in our slide deck. Our CapEx forecast totals $16.6 billion for the three-year period, 2015 to 2017. With environmental compliance CapEx for MATS wrapping up in 2015 and early 2016 and Kemper CapEx concluding in early 2016, the CapEx for our traditional operating companies is projected to decline from $5.4 billion in 2015 to $4.2 billion and $3.9 billion in 2016 and 2017, respectively.","As we highlighted during our call in October, and as Tom reiterated earlier in this call, Southern Power had tremendous success finding new renewable projects in 2014. The 2015 and 2016 base CapEx forecast for Southern Power include the projected investments for several of these projects.","As we look ahead, Southern Power continues to pursue additional renewables projects that meet our investment criteria. To account for these new potential investments, we have designated $1.9 billion as a placeholder CapEx for 2015 to 2017. Since the 30% investment tax credit will be reduced to 10% after 2016, most of the placeholder dollars are allocated 2015 and 2016.","Our external financing plan reflects zero equity needs for 2015 to 2017. Our forecast assumes more than $1.8 billion in additional draws over the three-year period on our DOE loan guarantees for plant Vogtle 3 and 4. And I would like to note that we have been very pleased with the success of this financing program. The financing savings we have captured through our draws to date have exceeded our projection, further increasing the benefits that we have gained for customers since certification of the project.","Moving now to EPS, our earnings per share outlook. Our earnings per share guidance for 2015 is $2.76 to $2.88 per share. We have slightly widened the range for 2015, particularly to address to account for potential variability in Southern Power's earning. As I discussed earlier, our plans assume that Southern Power will continue its efforts to find renewable projects that meet our investment criteria.","The middle of our guidance range assumes that Southern Power is able to invest all of the placeholder CapEx that we have included in our forecast. The size of the range recognizes that we may find fewer or more projects than we are currently forecasting. It is also intended to capture the potential for projects to slip out of 2015 and into 2016, which would shift the ITC benefits accordingly.","Of course, our guidance range also accounts for the normal variability we have historically seen in our traditional operating companies as well as Southern Power, including normal variations in weather, the economy, and wholesale energy prices. As has been our practice for many years, we have considered much of this potential variability in developing our flexible O&M spending plan. Going forward our long-term EPS growth outlook is still in the 3% to 4% range. In addition, our earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2015 is $0.55 per share.","I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas Fanning","Thanks, Art. After a successful year in 2014, Southern Company is entering the New Year with a strong sense of momentum. We see a franchise business that is operating better than ever, solidifying its position as an industry-leader in all phases of the business. We see important progress on major capital project and a continued commitment to resolving challenges in a manner that is consistent with our customer-focused business model. And we see a strengthening economy and a region poised to grow in the months and years ahead.","In short, we believe Southern Company is well-positioned to succeed in the year ahead, behind the strength of our 26,000 employees and their commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to the customers and communities we're proud to serve. We are now ready to take your questions. So operator, we'll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","So couple questions. When I look at the guidance range for this year, it's like $0.03 lower on the high-end and maybe $0.04, $0.05 lower on the low-end than the aspiration you had in the last year's fourth quarter earnings call. Those aren't big numbers, but can you give us a sense of what the drivers were, that caused the range to come down slightly year-over-year?","Arthur Beattie","Yes, Greg, you're right. It's a little overweight. We are where we were with some minor tweaks. We've had some cropping of the top-end due to a couple things; additional bonus depreciation that we have not factored in the last year's numbers, and we issued slightly more equity than we had communicated last year. Most of that being due to stock option exercises, primarily in the fourth quarter.","So instead of raising $600 million of new equity, we raised $800 million of new equity. So we've got more shares outstanding. And those two things will crop the top-end a little bit. The bottom-end really is, as I've said in the script, mostly related to performance variability around Southern Power. If we didn't get any of those price holder investments, than that's where we'd be at the bottom.","Thomas Fanning","And timing of those as well.","Greg Gordon","Two more questions. Second question when I look at Southern Power on Page 8 of your earnings release; you gave the quarter ending and year ending net income by segment and Southern Power did a $172 million in '14. Is it your expectation that at the midpoint of guidance you'd be at around the same number, the high-end, the low-end or are you higher or lower than that.","Arthur Beattie","It might be in and around that, maybe a little more that that. But it would require that we do something similar that we did last year in the terms of our Solar acquisition.","Thomas Fanning","Yes, Greg, that number at midpoint is $180 million.","Greg Gordon","And that assumes you deployed the amount of capital you just articulated?","Thomas Fanning","That's right. But as Art said, it's highly dependent on how much and when, and all that, it's a little lumpy.","Greg Gordon","Final question. Can you give us a sense of, I understand your legal and financial position with regards to your relationship with your constructor at Vogtle, what are the next series of milestones that we need to be mindful of to see how this interaction evolves? Have you worked with them to get the performance that you want, and they in turn pushback against you on what they deem to be their perspective on the costs?","Thomas Fanning","Just recently we were given a 10,000 page document that speaks to an intergraded project scheduled, and so the very first steps are to kind of wait through all of that detail and to really kind of turn data into information. We need to work with the contractors to understand the assumptions underlying that new schedule that they have provided.","Even from the outset we believe that they have not taken, and this is in the words I've been using consistently, this is like an unmitigated schedule. And that we believe there is lots of things that they could do to improve it. Weighing against that are the facts that, and this has been disclosed thoroughly on VCM 11, that they just have continued issues with respect to engineering and construction and we look forward to their effort to resolve those issues.","If you want to something describe those issues, it's the VCM 11 process. It's exceedingly open process. The independent monitor, Dr. Jacob testified that length in VCM 11, so you can get all the information you want to get. I think it's very clear that the contractors have just had continued difficulties. We say all along that you will always challenges and the issue is how successful you are, is determined by how well you resolve the challenges. We are working with the contractors to resolve their challenges.","Complicating all of these issues is the fact that we believe there are financial disputes among and between Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge & Iron. And we think that's having an impact on the schedule that they have delivered to us, so it's really going through all of that.","We are very comforted by the fact that we are committed to building a quality plan, a safe plan, and we are also very much comforted by the fact that for the additional costs, even if you believe it's going to be 18-month delay, which we dispute that the rate increases to customers remain within the 6% to 8% level, not the 12% that was originally contemplated. And we believe that for our additional cost, there are liquidate damages to help offset those costs.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Eggers.","Dan Eggers","Just on the CapEx plans. If you compare last year's CapEx plans to this year's CapEx plan, obviously they all have this backward shape that you've shifted it out a year from what you had last year. What do you see is the ability to fill in kind of '16 and '17 to maybe stabilize that CapEx plan looking out or are we going to have wait until further in the decade to see that happen?","Arthur Beattie","What we've got in there now are placeholders from Southern Power. Obviously, we could do more. We've got the tax appetite to do a little more than what we've outlined there. But we are still incubating other opportunities around the things that we talked about last year, be it expansion of our ability to take advantage of additional rate-based items and our investment in pipes and other things, but we are not in a position to work to talk about that yet. But in addition to that we've got opportunities possibly on the environmental side, which aren't fully vetted yet. Tom?","Thomas Fanning","Well, what I would add is this kind of spectrum I've chatted about here on the stump really since the Dallas Financial Conference and then again in South Florida. We kind of have this spectrum of opportunity, Dan, of kind of at a minimum buying back our own shares. We've talked about how, for the amount of business risk we see we maybe equity over capitalized.","On the other hand, given the kind of high market-to-book PE ratios, however, you want to describe it, maybe it's more attractive to buy somebody else's shares. But as we've talked in the past that's always been a very challenging proposition for us across. We have a big EVA shop, we believe that we would have to be reasonably clear about a way to earn a return on and return up the premium associated with any sort of activity there. And I think in the middle is kind of where we've tipped our hand as to our sweet spot, and that is buying other assets. Certainly, that's what we did in '14. So look for us to be active, creative and aggressive in looking for opportunities.","Dan Eggers","Now, you spent a lot of money on assets this year successfully or in the process, but it didn't really change the growth rate with the deployment of capital. Is that reflective of the fact you're seeing some pressure on the returns you're getting on those projects or is it other things mitigating some of that upward inflation you would have expected on growth?","Thomas Fanning","We've always been reasonably conservative in terms of setting our IRR curves for the kind of risks and projects we see. One of the things we mentioned back in October that we thought was emerging in the market remains true and that is we do have compared to a lot of people scale and a robust tax appetite. And therefore, we look like a pretty good customer, pretty good partner in these deals. So my sense is we're still going to see those opportunities. It's not causing us to drop our IRRs in any respect, we're able to maintain those to our satisfaction.","Dan Eggers","And I guess one last question on loan growth. Your expectations in residential and commercial show your positive year-on-year comps, after this year not really showing those gains. What do you think will be the biggest factors to convert that from flat to growth this year?","Arthur Beattie","We are looking at a lot of strong employment growth. I think we've seen that across the board, especially in the Southeast we've actually outstrip the U.S. growth rate and employment. And our manufacturing employment is also stronger than the U.S. As the economy continues to improve, as consumers consume the benefit of this oil dividend that we mentioned in our script, we think household income is also going to be helped by the portion of that household income that's disposable.","That will translate, we think, into more commercial sales and hopefully will translate into more household formations, which I believe jumped pretty strongly in the fourth quarter nationally. We saw a pretty strong customer growth in our fourth quarter period as well, about 10,000 new customers on the residential side. So there is a number of elements there that we're looking at.","I mentioned on the commercial end, we've got a lot of new projects coming in and around Atlanta. There are really three areas of Atlanta that are trending towards real strong growth. One is around the Perimeter, and that is where Mercedes is going to more than likely announce their headquarters. And that's a really strong market for new office complexes.","There is a midtown development in and around Georgia Tech, which is mostly office related, but it has been real strong as of late, as new companies have announced citing of that to take advantage of the technology development out of Georgia Tech. And then most recently as Porsche moved their headquarters down near the airport. And that is a longer term development opportunity. But they're looking at expanding office space, Class A hotel space and other residential opportunities in and around that particular area.","So there are number of things that we point to. Some will affect 2015 directly, some will be later, but those are real strong indicators to us that we are going to see a turnaround in commercial and residential growth per customers.","Thomas Fanning","Dan, let me do a quick deconstruction on the household income statement. When you look at the revenue part of a household, its wages, and while we have seen some pressure there from a variety of factors, people withdrawing from the work force or people moving from fulltime to part time or whatever full time jobs they have, a disproportionate share going to service kind of industries.","We still see pressure on the revenue side, but on the cost side, the expense side, if you will, the household as Art mentioned, I think energy prices, low gas prices have really helped. So the net consequences, net income may go up, and we believe its either going to be through increased saving, in other words retiring household debt, which is a good thing, it makes the economy more resilient or more consumption.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","Just first quick question, just where did 2014 CapEx come in at?","Arthur Beattie","Hold on a second, Steve, let me get that in front of me. We were very close. I think we've slightly under-spent the totals that we had, but it won't be around in the way of differed.","Steven Fleishman","I guess the reason I ask is it's a bit of the same question, but from what I can tell just going back to last year your 2015 CapEx is up $1.4 billion from a year ago for '15 projection. 2016 looks like it's up a $1 billion, but it's the same growth rate, and if not even a little bit of a lower 2015 base. So again, just to clarify, the bonus depreciation, I guess is a piece of that. Maybe you could quantify how much of that might be impacting the rate base.","Arthur Beattie","And Steve, you're right. The delta there is Southern Power. That's kind of what we're looking at. Remember, what we did in '14 was essentially put almost a three year CapEx allocation into one year. And that was kind of low $1 billion kind of allocation number. We're moving that number up to around $2.5 billion. So that's kind of what we're doing on CapEx. The delta it's mostly with Southern Power.","Thomas Fanning","Yes, Steve, if you look at the traditional operating companies, we were within $20 million in total of what we budgeted for the year. If you throw Southern Power in, we actually spent $310 million more than we had forecast from a CapEx perspective.","Steven Fleishman","And just a separate question on the Vogtle information. I know you disclosed expected monthly owner's cost for delay, but did you get any update from the consortium in terms of what the expected total construction cost of the plant will be?","Thomas Fanning","No.","Steven Fleishman","And is there any way based on the issues that they've mentioned in the saying to kind of estimate that?","Thomas Fanning","Well, just remember, Steve, we are still going through the details of the latest integrated schedule. So we really don't know what's involved and what their assumptions are and everything else. Its 10,000 pages, so we got to go through that. And mean what we really need to know I think it is our belief and we received assertions from the executive management of the contractors throughout 2014. And in fact, the schedule could be short. So we need to understand what their position is. We need to understand what's required.","Our contract is very clear, that it is the obligation of the contractor to undertake all methods necessary to meet the schedule requirement in the contract. That means adding new shifts, adding more people, staying overtime. Typical things you would expect to see on any construction undertaking. So I won't know the answer to your question, until we kind of sort through all those issues. We're working as hard as we can to do that right now. You should look to the VCM 12 is probably a more instructive kind of position for us to be in. We'll file that February 27.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","So just picking up on Steve's questioning. Just curious, you've said here today that the liquidated damages should help to mitigate the impact of your cost, which I imagine means the $40 million a month number you referenced. So is it a safe assumption that the per-diem amount adds up to a little less than $40 million a month or have you disclosed that at any point?","Thomas Fanning","We had not, but we've gotten a lot of questions about it. And we've informed our partners that we probably needed to disclose what we think the amount is. So here we go. There is a lot of factors that I'm going to give you subject to, but essentially if you evaluate kind of the maximum amount of liquidated damages assuming the full 18 months delays, again subject to a lot of factors, we believe that Georgia Power's share would be about $240 million.","Jonathan Arnold","So what about, you say 18 months delay, but does the LDs kick in April of next year, pending your current litigation.","Thomas Fanning","Yes, right, they would kick in as of the guaranteed substantial completion date, which is a term in the contract of April '16 and April '17.","Jonathan Arnold","So that $240 million number you've just given for Georgia Power share is that more than 18 months? Is that kind of from April '15 to '17, so it's more like a three year?","Thomas Fanning","That's right. You got it. There is a limit. We aren't anywhere close to it right now, so I just want to give you that. To the extent there is other issues, there could be more liquidated damages.","Jonathan Arnold","So what is the math behind that $240 million? Is it a daily amount or is it -- ","Thomas Fanning","That's what it is. It's a daily amount, and you can back into that if you want to.","Jonathan Arnold","And the limit is $240 million?","Thomas Fanning","No, the limit is way in excess.","Jonathan Arnold","So there's a longer delay effectively that would come into play.","Thomas Fanning","That's right.","Jonathan Arnold","And then just you mentioned a couple of times that you would remain within the 6% to 8% range on customer rate impact.","Thomas Fanning","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold","What are you assuming in now that you've faced the incremental cost you've talked about, less this $240 million something like that?","Thomas Fanning","That's right.","Jonathan Arnold","And what's the rule of thumb? Is there any rule of thumb you can give us of what would push you above that range?","Thomas Fanning","We think we're still way short of exceeding that range. We've talked a lot about estimates and all. We are more near than middle of the range than we are at the top, let me say it that way. And we think we've got lots of range, to stay within that range that we've been discussing.","Jonathan Arnold","And just one final housekeeping thing. There was a big downtick in depreciation in the fourth quarter. It was 424 million and has been 500-ish a quarter. Was there something unusual happened there?","Arthur Beattie","Yes, Jonathan, there was. Alabama Power had been deferring some O&M cost under a previous commission accounting order. And they filed a new depreciation study with the commission last year. And they found out they had available some cost of removal elements of the depreciation that they could offset these other deferred cost with. And so there was an entry made in the fourth quarter of last year at Alabama, which actually increased non-fuel O&M and decreased depreciation. And so it had a nil effect on income, but that's why you see the deltas in those particular line items.","Jonathan Arnold","On the subject of non-fuel O&M, as you talk about your 2015 guidance is what's a sensible run rate, given you've had obviously some noise in the numbers this year?","Arthur Beattie","We got back to what I would call a more normal element this year. So I would take the 2014 number and grow it by 3% to 3.5%. About 1% of that will be environmental and the remainder would be just normal company operation.","Thomas Fanning","John, let me just add a little more line up on that. The reason we're able to keep the 6% to 8% range in place is because of all the benefits that we've added on this $2.3 billion. We mentioned in the course I think of the opening comments that we've been very happy with our ability to finance under the DOE loan guarantee.","And in fact, we're exceeding where we thought we'd be on our estimates on that. I think we did a drawn in December, $200 million, for about 3%, and the average life was 22 years or something like that. So it's been a terrific vehicle for us and actually performing better than what we thought of. That $2.3 billion looks awfully good.","Jonathan Arnold","Does that include the 800 of PTCs, correct?","Thomas Fanning","That's right.","Jonathan Arnold","Would you have any recourse against the contractor, if sort of further delay sort of push those off the table?","Thomas Fanning","I don't know, John. And here is my view, I frankly think, my opinion, the contractor has given us, we believe, is an unmitigated schedule. We think there is flexibility to improve the schedule. It doesn't take into accounts. The comparative good progress, the date of our plan, I think we still have a descent amount of room before we're exposed to losing any of the PTCs for Unit 4. Unit 3 we're still very well protected.","Jonathan Arnold","But if you did, would you have recourse to that?","Thomas Fanning","I don't know. I don't think so, but that's to be decided by a lawyer I guess. You can claim anything in a lawsuit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon","Where are you assuming with regards to stock options in your '15 guidance?","Thomas Fanning","Paul, we got no assumption for additional equity in 2015, 2016 or 2017, to the degree we have stock option exercises. We have plans to put in place a repurchase program that would to the degree we have proceeds to reduce those back down to as close to the zero level as possible.","Paul Ridzon","And I guess, given that you're already $200 million ahead based on last year?","Thomas Fanning","Based on last year, but that's where we're holding it, right. And we'll obviously see some more this year, but that's our plan to address.","Paul Ridzon","And then what have you achieved and what remains to be done or to qualify for the full DOE benefits or tax benefits at Kemper?","Thomas Fanning","We have filed for those -- at Kemper, I'm sorry. I was thinking Vogtle. I'm sorry. You're talking about investment tax credits?","Paul Ridzon","Yes.","Thomas Fanning","You're talking about phase 2 investment tax credits that would relate to our carbon capture percentages. We have to have it in service by April of '16 to qualify for those. So right now, our schedule would meet that requirement. And there would have to be 65% or proof of 65% of carbon capture for all the gas that was produced, the syngas that's produced.","Arthur Beattie","And that is our target.","Thomas Fanning","Yes.","Paul Ridzon","That's the only hurdle?","Thomas Fanning","Yes. It's a deadline and an amount removed.","Paul Ridzon","And then the 200 over, where you're on the options, are you going to use that to buy stock in '15?","Thomas Fanning","At this point, we're just going to see what kind of activity we get. We'll make whatever adjustments we think are necessary. The idea going forward is no new equity issuances.","Arthur Beattie","That's correct. We ended up the year with a common equity ratio of about 43.5%, and so that's still within our marginal planning. We don't plan on going north of that, but again we'll just see what we get and we'll take out as Tom described as much of what we raise as possible.","Paul Ridzon","What was your yearend share count?","Arthur Beattie","I'm sorry.","Thomas Fanning","The yearend share count.","Arthur Beattie","Just over 900 million shares.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","I have one or two Vogtle questions and then some housekeeping ones. When you go back and read the Vogtle testimony, some of the interveners, not the public staff, are kind waving the flag of prudency, meaning, or imprudency. Just curious for any comments you have in that regard, whether they really have a leg to stand on by making that type of argument? What is the requirement in Georgia for something to be for a prudency disallowance or prudency review of Vogtle? Can you kind of just go through that from a regulatory construct please?","Thomas Fanning","Yes, sure. We don't think there has been any credible testimony that suggests there is anything imprudent in the project to date. When you think about kind of the brick and mortar cost to the plant, as provided by the contractors, where -- I forgot the last number, I think it was 0.5%. I mean it's right on the money.","In terms of our own oversight cost, this is kind of a $10 million per month that we see. It's absolutely prudent for us to have oversight, because we are absolutely committed to providing the highest quality safest project possible. Recall also, part of those cost are tax issues and insurance and some other thing. I just don't see very many legs at all for any imprudence evaluations of that.","Michael Lapides","And just some housekeeping items. How much bonus depreciation cash flow benefits you expect in 2015? And which of your segments rate bases will that have the greatest impact on?","Arthur Beattie","Mike, let's see, that's $625 million that would impact 2015, and maybe $125 million to $140 million in '15 that would impact '16, and it's mostly in the regulated OpCos, but I don't have a split for you.","Thomas Fanning","We can certainly get back to you later, if you want.","Michael Lapides","Or just kind of pro rated across the subs based on size and scale somehow?","Thomas Fanning","I mean that would be reasonable.","Michael Lapides","And Art, the comment, you answered an earlier question about Alabama and what happened to D&A in the fourth quarter. When we think about going forward, is that the new run rate kind of what we saw in the base kind of a lower new base of what we saw in the fourth quarter of '14 or is that more kind of the run rate of what we saw in prior quarters and the fourth quarter '14 was a one-off?","Arthur Beattie","I think the prior quarters would be the better run rate number to go with. But when you think about non-fuel O&M in that regard, most of those deferred cost were deferred in 2014. So I would leave those in the base for non-fuel O&M.","Michael Lapides","Meaning, grow O&M by 2% a year like you commented, but also ensure the D&A is kind of looking at the first nine months kind of run rate-ish?","Arthur Beattie","Yes, exactly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","I just wanted to talk about growth in terms of gas demand and as you think about supplying your customers. As you think about your growth profile are there some moving parts that could cause you to want to be more aggressive in terms of growth in gas infrastructure investment. How are you all thinking about that these days?","Thomas Fanning","Really interesting stuff there. If you dial back to 2014, remember we have switched a lot away from coal to natural gas. And one of the things that we always warn people was that gas was more volatile and there were certain risks around it. It was not a panacea.","What we saw in the year 2014 was that we generated about the same amount of energy with coal as we did gas, about 40% each. Why was that? Because we had the fuel flexibility during polar vortex one and two to switch off spiking gas and be able to run our much cheaper coal fleet. In fact, over the year we saved about $125 million of fuel savings, because we had that flexibility. So let's keep in mind what's trying to happen in regulatory space in terms of shutting down coal in America.","Now, interestingly in the fourth quarter, we flipped that with very cheap gas prices. We ran the numbers; gas generation went up to about 49%; coal flipped back to about 31%. So going forward, what do we expect? The budget for 2015 would show gas at 44% and coal at 36%. So we'll see.","Now, how does that impact kind of our appetite for gas infrastructure? I had mentioned to you all before that we could see ourselves getting involved in gas pipelines now, because gas is much more kind of synergistic with the rest of our business, as opposed to say where we were five, six, seven years ago.","One of the things we find is that there are lots of price disparities of gas transportation, say, from the east to west side of our system. We've been able to evaluate a lot of opportunities. We're seeking those out aggressively. And I think the kind of notion would be that we would in fact be an anchor tenant to whatever we invest in. So we are working very hard to make those things come real we'll see.","Stephen Byrd","So it sounds like just given the kind of commodity environment we're in though, that certainly more gas supply and becoming an anchor tenant certainly very high in your list of things you're interested in doing?","Thomas Fanning","Sure it is. And we're going to be disciplined in how we invest. And I'll tell you something else, here again commenting on 111(d) to the extent that we've got to add more gas units in the future, we need more infrastructure. We are pretty well filled up right now in terms of FT, which is how we cover all of our units. So we need a competitive supply of gas, we need more infrastructure and we can participate in that.","Stephen Byrd","And that will be effectively additive to the kind of spending that you all are thinking about currently?","Thomas Fanning","That's correct.","Stephen Byrd","And then just quickly on nuclear. Just curious as you watched the progress in China, especially at the Sanmen project, anything to report there or is it sort of just moving along as planned?","Thomas Fanning","I think it's moving along. They're resolving the valve issue there. So I think it will not have a complete impact on kind of where we are. So when you think about the reactor coolant pumps, there have been some design issues that have manifested themselves in China. We think those are getting dealt with satisfactorily.","We don't think that they will impact our critical paths. At another way, we're benefiting from not being the alpha plant here and we're learning from our Chinese experience. So we have people located in China. We follow those very closely. We've learned from them already. We're happy with where we are, at least from our China experience.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin","Springboarding off of Stephen's question on gas infrastructure, we've seen a little bit more color on how alternative capitalization structures trade. Just what are your latest thoughts on if you were to go into that route? Would that be considered more part of your regulated utility operations? Would you consider alternate capitalization structures for those? Just a little bit of updated thoughts there?","Arthur Beattie","So you guys have heard the old saying that -- I believe in the long run view of finance, there's lots of tricks, but there is no magic. If there is a structure that makes sense, then we'll certainly consider it. We've never been of a fan of yieldcos. We think those are short-term positive, long-term troublesome. If it's an MLP, if there's a real tax advantage, we would certainly consider those things. But we believe that keeping a simple balance sheet and providing long-term value is really the right course of action for us, but we'll consider anything.","Brian Chin","And then one last question from me. Could you just remind us again of the dividend policy and dividend outlook, given the revised change in CapEx spending and guidance?","Arthur Beattie","Sure. Of course everything I say about dividends is subject to Board approval, that's their deal. But we've been on a $0.07 trajectory for sometime now. And we feel that having a regular, predictable, sustainable flow of earning per share that permits for a regular predictable and sustainable dividend policy is how you maximize value. If you look at our TSR over any kind of longest timeframe, you will see that the vast majority of TSR for us is driven by our dividend policy.","So that remains foremost in our thinking about how to grow value for shareholders. So of course, I got to be subject to everything, but most importantly subject to final Board authority. But we feel very confident in our ability to deliver sustainable dividend policy as we have in the past into the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha","Tom or Art, just wanted to clarify the 3% to 4% growth rate in EPS that you showed us off this new 2015 base, was that specifically referring to 2016 over 2015 or was that a longer term growth rate?","Thomas Fanning","Long term. It's kind of both, but it's long-term. What we see in our projections is that we're able to stay within that envelope pretty comfortably over a long timeframe. I got to give you all of the admonishments about things that are unknown and everything else, but for what we know right now, we can stay within that envelope for a long time.","Ali Agha","And Tom, just correct me if I am wrong, but I thought previously, when you guys had originally given us '14 through '16 earnings guidance and then some longer-term outlook, I thought the plan was given the way the spending was working, the 3% to 4% was '14 through '16, and then you would accelerate beyond that, but I guess that's not the case.","Thomas Fanning","No, no. Here is kind of where we are. We are kind of in the same spot. Let's think about the years ahead here and I don't want to give too much more color other than kind of the commentary we provided in the past, but if you look at kind of '15 to '16, things look pretty normal there. '16 to '17, you have the expiration for 30% investment tax credit, that could have some impact on your ability to impact earnings per share through investment tax credit investments associated with Solar. So that could have a shaping impact.","And then beyond that we've always talked about really environmental CapEx and the start-up of new-generation CapEx, all of that remains the same, and that really shifts the nature of your curve. So what we said was when you consider the impact of 111(d), which depending on how the final rule looks could have a dramatic effect of the backend CapEx curve as well as Coal Ash and 316(b) and a variety of other things. We'll just have to see how those turn out, that's all what I have been talking about.","Ali Agha","So think of this really '15 through '18 or that time period, and then in the late in the decade things change?","Thomas Fanning","Well, certainly as we know more we'll adjust it. What you should take comfort in, as for what we know, we think this is a very comfortable envelope.","Ali Agha","Separate question. Art, if I did my math right, it looked to me that your effective tax rate in '14 came in lower than previously thought. What was driving that? And how should we think of an effective tax rate for '15 and beyond?","Arthur Beattie","Ali, are you talking about the cash tax rate or are you talking about the accounting book effective affected tax rate?","Ali Agha","I'm talking about the book tax rate, Art, adjusting from Kemper charges and all of that. If you exclude all of that the book rate looked a little lower to me.","Arthur Beattie","Well, I'm looking at over the last few years in total though. You could have had some effects from Southern Power and their investment tax credits, which was booked in the fourth quarter of this year. And then, you've got higher AFUDC as well, which is not taxable.","Ali Agha","But your book tax rate doesn't change very much, your cash tax rate changes a lot, right. And for 2014, it looks like a little over 8% there.","Arthur Beattie","Yes.","Ali Agha","And then, Tom, as far as Kemper is concerned, I mean you had a position now with the latest round of charges to kind of say, hey, if the confidence is much higher then, hey, I think we've got it all now under control cost-wise or still too early to make that statement?","Thomas Fanning","Yes, Ali, I've been burned in the past, haven't I? Look, we've got Chip Troxclair in place here and we've had very good conversations. In fact, I had the whole management council of Southern Company at Kemper about a week ago. And I think the team is working hard. And so yes, we've got a lot of confidence, especially in the schedule. We're doing I think a better job at managing kind of the want tos in terms of CapEx as opposed to the must haves in terms of CapEx as we finish start up.","The one caveat I just have to throw out to you all that I have been consistent about from day one are the unknown, unknown. If you start the thing up something may happen that nobody thought about. We've added more inventory to insulate ourselves against risk for machines that don't work the way they're supposed to or just defective workmanship.","The good news is, when I evaluate kind of the work we've done in pressurizing [ph] trains A and B, steam blows, welding inspection other things, we've done pretty well. We had some hiccups here recently in some of the pulverizers and some of the lignite drying equipment, but we've already provided for fixing those issues. We're working hard to stay within the estimates we've given you. So I'm as confident as I can be, there are things that could cause us trouble in the future. But I feel as good as I have been.","Ali Agha","And my last question, Tom, when I look at the weather-normalized sales that you provide us and I looked at the four quarters of '14, this fourth quarter was the slowest over the 2014 period. Was there anything particularly that was causing this slowdown and which you don't thing will continue in '15? Or how would you explain that?","Thomas Fanning","I don't get excited about quarter evaluation whenever I look at this stuff, because especially on weather normal adjustment, there's all sorts of variability. I tend to look at kind of longer-term, longer trends and see what's going on. The biggest issue I think facing kind of residential and commercial sales growth is this issue of, and its curses and blessings, industrial strength, during the downturn recall that a lot of our industrial customers retooled, put in technology, and in fact, we've been able to grow, but the efficiency of output has been terrific.","Well, the good news is that's given us strength even against the weakening dollar, right. The bad news is we haven't added jobs as much as we thought we would, and therefore wages haven't grown. We think that we were starting to kind of take up that slack, and we're starting to see the signals as the things, Art, went through that in fact jobs will return, wages will increase and therefore spending will increase.","Those are the longer-term trends we see. And don't just hang it on wages. Remember the information Art gave you about the household income statement and how the expense item largely for energy, thank goodness, are going down, people have more money in their pockets to spend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Barnett with Morningstar.","Mark Barnett","So you talked a lot about kind of the bigger projects and what not, and I appreciate the new details. That's really helpful for us. Just wondering more maybe on the O&M trajectory that you've seen so far this year, would you say that I mean if the fourth quarter haven't seen the segment breakout yet. So would you say that you're seeing more of that in one particular OpCo or another? I mean for example, as a lot of that being driven out of Alabama?","Thomas Fanning","Real quick. Here, again, as I was talking earlier about don't go off on one quarter about consumption. Don't go off in one quarter about O&M. Because we have this flexible O&M system we had in place for years now, which helps kind of attenuate our ultimate financial results.","Arthur Beattie","But there is something, Mark, and I addressed it on an earlier question, was related to the Alabama entries that roughly bumped up non-fuel O&M by $100 million or so, more than what we expected in the year, but that occurred in the fourth quarter. So Alabama, if any of them, and as I said earlier, most of those were 2014 deferrals anyway, so they would have occurred throughout the year, had we not deferred them and then cleared them up in the year.","Thomas Fanning","So what kind of a long-term O&M growth rate '14 to '15?","Arthur Beattie","3% to 3.5%.","Thomas Fanning","3% to 3.5%, that's a good trend.","Mark Barnett","I know there can be some quarterly noise. I just wanted to clarify, because it sounded like it was probably related to those regulatory things. Just a second question, I guess, maybe another way of looking at some of the comments you've made already about the clean power plan. What kind of conversations have you started, particularly in Alabama and Georgia, about kind of handling compliance and handling the plans that would be necessary, should it survive in this current state or how to I guess approach proposals?","Thomas Fanning","Look, Mark, thanks for kind of raising that. We haven't really talked about that. You know that we work in a real-time fashion with the folks in our states. We have a common purpose and that is to serve the customers and communities with clean, safer, liable, affordable power. And I know that certain initiatives out of EPA or elsewhere get high focus on certain issues, particularly 111(d) would be carbon. We have to balance those results. For the benefit of this, I don't think there can be more privilege to serve.","When I think about where EPA is 111(d), we know and I think they know that they have a flawed proposed rule. And they've received, now I forget what the number is, over 4 million comments or something, it's unbelievable. But they're going to have to I think deal with some of the low hanging fruit, if you will, in the final rule.","I am guessing, we do get a final rule some time in the summer time maybe call it August. And I think they will deal with some resolution on this kind of cliff 2020 date. I think they will also fix things like nuclear and particularly nuclear under construction.","So look I think it's almost premature to comment kind of where we think they'll end up. We've had lots of opportunities to talk to them, so has everybody else, 32 states have come after them in terms of comments, attorney general, governors, public service commissions. I think there is a lot of ground to cover before we have a final rule. Let's see what the final rule looks like, and then the ball will be in the court of the states in order to implement their state implementation plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Julien DumoulinSmith","Well, it's Julien here. So I wanted to follow back up here quickly on Southern Power, going rewinding back to the start of the call there. The $180 million midpoint you talked about I think for '15, how much of the ITC benefit is baked in there? And by the way the kind of the second part of that question is really, you talked about the '16 to 17' exploration, what kind of an impact do you think that is in terms of a headwind, if you kind of lose those benefits for new projects? I know, it's a little detailed.","Thomas Fanning","I'm going to guess that kind of the benefits from ITC, and don't get too precise on the $180 million, that planning estimate, it's very lumpy. But the specific question was, what's the assumption in the midpoint? It's $180 million. The contribution from ITC is probably over $40 million. So that's what you should think of.","Julien DumoulinSmith","But then it probably falls off pretty materially in '16. So the roll off by '17 is -- ","Thomas Fanning","So '16 is probably okay. It will probably be a similar number, perhaps even more depending -- so you have a project that comes in, you think it's going to come in at December of '15, slides into '16. So it really is lumpy and dependent upon when you close these deals and when they go in service.","So '17 you should kind of estimate that, as ITC drops from 30% to a 10% kind of number under current tax law then you should shave off some percentage. So let's say two-thirds of $40 million to $50 million number just in rough math, right. So that's the kind of math I would use, if I were you. That would be the earnings per share headwinds.","And I'm talking specifically about solar right now. To the extent we invest in wind, it has a different profile. To the extent some of our CapEx is associated with gas pipeline that has a different profile. So I'm attaching all of that on solar.","Julien DumoulinSmith","I was going to ask you, I mean, more holistically, what do you think about solar spend in general? I mean, the Southeast has seen a lot of projects, but we haven't heard much on you guys from Florida or Alabama. I mean, is there a potential there, I mean either via the utility themselves or via Southern Power? I mean is this something you could see more spend in '16 or is it tricky to see that happen, just given the timeline and the 30% ITC or et cetera?","Thomas Fanning","I frankly would expect to see more of the solar outside the Southeast. There may be more opportunities. But when we originally got into solar, we really started looking at where the solar resources were the best, right. The Southeast tend to be kind of cloudy. It has high humidity. It's not the best area for solar, even though there has been a lot of movement in the state of Georgia.","Recall, Georgia Power was voted the Investor-Owned Utility of the Year last year by the solar industry. So we're going to continue to look wherever I think the resources are best, where the contracts are the best. A particular area of emphasis for us also has been with the DoD, the Department of Defense. We've announced several base solar deals in Georgia and I think we've announced one in Gulf, and then we'll see about other bases elsewhere in the Southeast. So look for that.","Julien DumoulinSmith","Now, let me turn my attention just a little differently here. The gas infrastructure that you alluded to earlier is that under Southern Power as well? And when we find out details about that, I mean I imagined that's probably tied to your talk earlier about carbon rules and finalization, and ultimately what kind of coal to gas switching we really are going to see in the Southeast, is that kind of a good way to think about it?","Thomas Fanning","Julien, whatever you did to Michael is kind of what I'll have to say about gas pipelines. I don't want to reveal the nature of discussions on any gas pipelines at this point. But the specific question you asked about kind of would it be under Southern Power, I wouldn't be surprised that we put it in another sub besides Southern Power. That's really kind of a governance question.","Julien DumoulinSmith","And then lastly, let's turn it back to Kemper quickly. You kind of alluded to potentially hashing out of deal in the state again. And I know you don't want to touch it too much, but what's the timeline there? Because I know we've talked about before having a deal and then it seems like that slid a little bit, just given the timeline of the project it slid. When could we see something come to resolution there, if you will, and what is it relate to specifically? Is this the first half prudency review that you guys are going to try to hash out? And again, I don't mean the pry too much.","Thomas Fanning","Julien, what we've talked about in the past is kind of a grand settlement, where we've ramped to get all of the kind of issues that relate to Mississippi Power. And for host of reasons, I know you understand, we don't want to say too much about that. We would like to see those issues resolved sooner rather than later. So let's just leave it there, if we could. I appreciate your indulgence. And one other comment I just want to make, we talked about other subs, other subs could be OpCos for gas infrastructure.","Julien DumoulinSmith","The utility OpCos?","Thomas Fanning","Yes. Just depending on opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","I want to follow-up on a comment you made regarding the consortium and potential conflicts among the contractors, as to who is suppose to cover what. And I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on that?","Thomas Fanning","What I would prefer that you do is go to their own statement. CBI has been reasonably public about these things. These are my words, not theirs. With respect to the contract, they have essentially, I call it, intercreditor agreement, but it's an agreement to share the cost and benefits of the contract among and between ourselves. And I think there are some financial disputes between the two of them. And we believe anyway that those disputes have some bearing on this unmitigated schedule we got.","Paul Patterson","That actually leads me to my sort of second question, which is if one of the contractors, I know this is kind of little extreme, but let's say one of the contractors is unable to fulfill the obligations. Are the other contractors obligated? Is there a surety bond? Is there any protection, I guess?","Thomas Fanning","Yes. The major mechanism you should look for in contract is the guarantee, the corporate guarantee of Toshiba for the financial integrity of the obligations of the participants as contractor.","Paul Patterson","And then finally, with respect to the sales growth. Just to sort of follow-up on Dan's question, the numbers have been coming in a lot less than what you guys have expected in the past. And you do mentioned sort of some of the things, the oil prices and what have you in some of the developments that are happening there that you think will be -- that will improve the situation, I guess going forward.","I know you guys analyze this very closely. Have you guys reappraised what you think long-term customer usage will be, efficiency deployment what have you? Is there any, because the numbers do seem to have come in just historically a lot lower. And I am just wondering if you guys have any sort of new ideas or any differing ideas as to what you've had in the past about what's going on with -- ","Thomas Fanning","Let me just kind of pick at that a little. Our plan was set last year at 0.7% sales growth and we actually had 0.9%. The difference was the fact that industrial was a blockbuster year at 3.3%, relative to weather normal flat elsewhere.","Arthur Beattie","Paul, it's a long-term sales growth number. Total retail sales are going to be in the 1.2 percentage range. Now, whether that's a reassessment or not that's kind of our current look long-term. I don't know that it would be termed a reassessment of that, but it's probably lower than it was five, seven years ago. But a couple of other things you need to think about is in-migration into the states, we continue to see that.","And to give you a little more land gap around that, if we look at things like United Van Lines has ranks their top 10 states for inbound moves; Georgia and Florida are number eight and number two respectively. We've seen most of our customer growth in those particular regions, 1.1% customer growth in both Gulf and Georgia over the last year.","Thomas Fanning","And if you recall during the recession, in-migration grows up.","Arthur Beattie","That's correct.","Thomas Fanning","But we think that was our housing related. Now, that housing is freeing up, we're seeing the migration again.","Arthur Beattie","So say reflection of, yes, is it a turning point? We certainly hope so, but it's based on the evidence, not just a bunch of drawn lines and hopes and wishes. The other thing that I think I would point to is the information that we have been traveling under is kind of similar to what the Fed has been traveling under. The Fed has called for some higher GDPs and actually show up and where the softness is and their projection has been in household wealth creation, just as we talked about. So as we improve that I think our overall picture will improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Dan Jenkins","So I just had a couple of clarifications related to the construction projects. First on Kemper, I think you had mentioned on your slide that the next set of milestones are the gasifier first fire, and I think case of that's going to be in March. But I was wondering on the gasifier airflow testing, what the timing is of that milestone?","Arthur Beattie","Yes. We are currently in the process of that, but we still look at three main milestones here: first, fire to the gasifier, is it going to be this frame; the first syngas production, which is the second milestone I would point to is sometime this summer; and then in the late summer and fall, we expect to have reliable syngas to each combustion turbine. Those are the three milestones that we would rather point to than the micro milestones of, what you mentioned the, airflows. Those are sub-processes to the major milestone that I am pointing to.","Thomas Fanning","And in fact, Dan, what we've been doing so far, and that's what I'm trying to gratified with, the tests that we've done so far, they have gone reasonably well, have been testing the financial integrity of the construction and it's gone very well.","Dan Jenkins","And what did you say again was the timeline for the production of the turbine?","Thomas Fanning","Reliable syngas, it was, for one turbine its late summer and for the second its fall this year.","Dan Jenkins","And then looking at your Slides 5 and 6, I just want to make sure I am understanding this right. I think you mentioned in your opening remarks that for Unit 3, the CA01 set is going to be in the spring. That's not in the picture, I don't think on Slide 6.","Thomas Fanning","Yes. That one is not in the picture.","Dan Jenkins","But then that is a near-term thing in the spring pretty much as that CA01 set?","Thomas Fanning","Yes. So the spring could go, I mean theoretically, it's April, May, June. That's kind of what we are looking for on CA01.","Dan Jenkins","And then in your third quarter slide you had some talk on core on horizon the CA20, which I think, if I am not mistaken that's what the green one is on Unit 3, right, in the picture?","Thomas Fanning","Yes, that's correct.","Dan Jenkins","So when is that supposed to be set for Unit 4 the CA20?","Thomas Fanning","Dan, if I could, here instead of getting specifics here, if I could ask you on, we just got this new integrated project schedule and there maybe some impacts for the longer term issue. That's why we stuck with near-term here and kind of very near-term. The longer term issues could be impacted by the resolution of the schedule.","And so we're going to have to be a little -- I don't know, a little vague until we probably get the VCM 12. VCM 12 that we filed later this month and then will kind of discuss throughout the spring. We'll have much more detail there for you. I think we'll be in a much better position to estimate those kinds of issues.","Dan Jenkins","I guess what you're saying you want to retain some flexibility around that based on -- ","Thomas Fanning","That's right. Thank you for that.","Dan Jenkins","And then just you talked about the fact that there's this unmitigated proposal by the contractors, but what do you as some of the potential mitigation efforts that they have I guess look forward so far that you think would give us some confidence that the schedule could be shorter than these 18 months?","Thomas Fanning","Dan, here again, I got to ask your patience. Let us go through what they've given us. We've received assurances by executive management of the contractors in 2014. We have our own ability to adjust. We have our own scheduled progress to date. There is a host of issues here that cause the foundation for our belief to be that there is something we could do, and that the contractors aren't exercising. All of their obligations is required under the contract. But let us get to the end of this discussion with contractors before I open up what the number may be.","Operator","Our final question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium.","Ashar Khan","I guess most of my questions are answered, but Tom, I guess I keep asking the strategy question. Because when you were the CFO, the risk adjusted was kind of the corner stone. And so as you in the board look into investing in Solar, what it has induced is now a higher range on the earnings availability, which further adds to the volatility of kind of a risk-free investment as there used to be. And I am just trying to understand why that is happening?","Thomas Fanning","I got you absolutely. There is kind of a glib answer and there is kind of a deeper answer. The deeper answer is you know having known me for, gosh, over 10 years or whatever it is, a long time that I have been a deep proponent of the notion that value as a function of risk and return. And when we think about our business model, we always seek to achieve the best risk adjusted returns. When you look at the value driven by our franchise, which is the overwhelming delivery of value to Southern, the franchise is as good as it's ever been. And I feel terrific about the state of the franchise.","When I go to the opportunity that is in front of us, with particularly Solar that opportunity is driven by kind of the initiatives that we have seen. When we originally dabbled our foot in water on Solar, we thought it might be applicable in the Southeast. Sure enough it was and so we started slow and gained some momentum and in fact Georgia has turned out to be a big participant in the solar market.","Along the way, particularly last year, we were surprised by the fact that a lot of people were really looking to Southern, because we had scale. We had a tax appetite. We are a great partner. We understand technology. And I had mentioned before First Solar is kind of in that realm.","The only risk that we seek that adds to kind of our corporate data, if you will, is just the lumpiness of the investment, not the technology of the investment. And we think the degree of investing is achievable, so while you may see some spread over time, we think we'll be able to hit the numbers that we put out there.","The final comment, you all know that I've never been enormous fan of tax advantage investing. Certainly, the ITC profile is something that's attractive. We think we had tax appetite to be able to consume those tax benefits in a timely manner. And remember too, that one of the coincident benefits of that kind of investing has been the very strong cash flow compared to our EBITDA in the long run.","So as we see ourselves moving through time where we're slowing down our CapEx from a corporate standpoint, particularly the operating companies, we're finishing up a construction cycle, the fact that these opportunities avail themselves, the fact that they help earnings, the fact that they improve cash flow, the fact that long-term we believe there is very low technology risk, and we're dealing with very credible partners, we think maintains this very attractive risk adjusted profile.","Recall too, at the end of the day, the foundation of our investment is based on our ability to deliver long-term dividend growth. I think we finished our in 2014 with a payout ratio around 74%. We've been able to perform. The other thing that we said, I think in October and I always get my calls confused, but we're one of I think two companies in the industry that over the last 10 years somewhere in there has been able to produce within our earnings range every year 100% at the time. For all my purposes, I can't guarantee that going forward, but at least our track record is exemplary.","And I think when you think about management teams around the system around the industry, when you think about business models around the industry, I think Southern Company is a company that's going to continue to deliver that performance in my opinion for a long time.","Ashar Khan","I totally agree with your later points, but it just creates, Thomas, we used to write, there used to be I forget what those terms used to be called, the synfuel tax credit earnings, which Congress used to have and everything. These are now ITC earnings now coming into utilities of things, I think there is a differentiation of quality of earnings going down?","Thomas Fanning","Yes. But Ashar I would really differentiate, and we should take this offline just for the benefit of everybody else on the call, but we should really differentiate synfuel from ITC. There is an enormous industry for solar. It's pretty clear that not only the administration, but Congress is in favor of promoting tax code that helps renewables. That's very different than synfuel. And I feel very confident about the ability to sustain these tax credits and how they will improve our cash flow and really helps Southern and therefore our shareholders for years to come. I really would think about those differently.","Operator","And at this time there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","End of Q&A","Thomas Fanning","Yes. Thank you. Once again, thank you all for joining us. We really enjoy these times together. I am really delighted with the results that we've been able to show in '14. When I was just talking with Ashar about the value of the franchise, when you look at the foundation that is Southern Company, it is as good today as it has ever been in my memory.","And I think we can continue to produce the kind of results that have tremendous value to our customers and our shareholders. We are taking advantage of other opportunities in the market, in solar and other areas, and we're seeking to add to that platform of value creation. So thank you for your time today. We will continue relentlessly to meet the challenges and provide the best opportunity available as an investment to you all. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Melody, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Southern Company Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday August 8, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Scott Gammill, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead, sir.","Scott Gammill - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Melody. Good morning. Welcome to Southern Company's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Drew Evans, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in the Form 10-K, second quarter Form 10-Q and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. The slides we will discuss during this morning's call may be viewed on our Investor Relations website at investor.southerncompany.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Drew and I will cover our usual business updates in a few moments. But first, we'd like to provide an update on Vogtle 3 and 4, reflected in our reported earnings for the second quarter as a $1.1 billion pre-tax charge which represents an increase in Georgia Power share of the projected cost to complete Vogtle 3 and 4.","We continue to project construction completion date of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4 respectively and the new cost estimate does not reflect any changes in the project schedule. After Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in March 2017, part of Southern Nuclear's new self-perform role was to develop a new cost estimate for completion of the project as Georgia Power and the other owners no longer had the benefit of a fixed and firm EPC contract with its original contractor.","This was the first time that Southern Nuclear had brought access to Westinghouse's more detailed cost information, invoices, subcontract and planning and schedule documents, including the basis of estimates being discussed between Fluor and Westinghouse. Southern Nuclear began building what became the VCM 17 estimate to complete or ETC based on data and information obtained from Westinghouse and Fluor as assessed by Southern Nuclear and independently reviewed by its consultants.","As a reminder Georgia Power submit Semi-Annual Vogtle Construction Monitoring Reports for VCMs to the Georgia Public Service Commission. These filings and the hearings which follow are an important part of the regulatory framework for the project. The 17th VCM filing in August 2017 was used by the PSC to make its post-Westinghouse bankruptcy go or no-go decision for Vogtle 3 and 4. As with any forecast, the VCM 17 ETC was based heavily on assumptions regarding scope of work, labor productivity and cost escalation. The VCM 17 Report also included discussions of project risks, including an acknowledgement that work was still ongoing on key terms that could impact costs that the craft labor force may be unable to maintain their productivity improvement and that some scope may be unidentified at the time of the ETC.","Recognizing the potential for cost increases relating to the transition of the project, Southern Nuclear added cost escalation in the form of contingency to the estimate. This contingency was intended to cover costs expected to be specifically allocable within a reasonably short period of time. Georgia Power submitted the VCM 17 ETC to the Georgia Public Service Commission on August 31 2017. In addition Georgia Power provided the PSC with independent estimates of the cost to complete, which were in general agreement with the Southern Nuclear ETC, following an exhaustive review of the VCM 17 Report, the PSC in December of 2017 approved Georgia Power's recommendation to continue construction. The proposed new project structure and $7.3 billion as a reasonable total cost for Georgia Power's share of completing the project. This cost reflected Southern Nuclear's as initial ETC net of the $1.7 billion Toshiba parent guarantee and partial customer refunds of that guarantee.","In the year since completing the initial ETC, Southern Nuclear has been able to maintain project momentum consistent with the schedule approved by the PSC. Although the PSC recognized that the $7.3 billion revised capital cost forecast was not a cost cap, Southern Nuclear undertook efforts to manage the project within that forecast while at the same time sustaining project momentum and transitioning project management.","In connection with this effort, Southern Nuclear determined that it needed to implement changes at the project to lower project risks and maintain its schedule. Among others these changes included expanding the scope of Bechtel's contractor duties and resulting fees, increasing field supervision and engineering support and implementing craft labor incentives to attract and retain adequate staffing. The project team has also continued its efforts to firm up other estimated costs, such as the 60-plus subcontracts that had not yet been negotiated at the time of the initial ETC. Many of these new subcontracts reflect changes in market conditions and in some cases increased scope.","As part of the process to continually review and assess cost and schedule and based on a years' worth of experience managing the project, Southern Nuclear recently revised its estimate of the cost to complete the project. Based on this latest estimate, we now recognize the previous contingency was insufficient to fully offset forecasted cost increases. The new estimate reflects the Georgia Power's projected share of total costs has increased from $7.3 billion to $8.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion dollars. This increase includes a base capital cost increase of approximately $700 million and a new construction contingency estimate of approximately $400 million. We will continue to monitor and evaluate costs associated with construction of Vogtle 3 and 4 and provide updates on our estimate as appropriate.","Although we believe the increased projected costs are reasonable and necessary to complete the project we have made the judgment that it's in the best long-term interests of investors, customers and other stakeholders that we not disrupt project momentum by seeking approval of the base capital cost increase so soon after receiving PSC approval to continue with the project. Therefore when Georgia Power files the increased cost estimate with the PSC as part of VCM 19 later this month, Georgia Power will not request recovery of the $700 million in base capital cost increase and precluding these costs from increasing customer rates. Therefore the customer impacts contemplated in VCM 17 remain the same in VCM 19.","As to the contingency included in our revised capital cost estimate, which is approximately 35% of the total increase, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate such cost for rate recovery as and when appropriate. We are hopeful that this revised ETC and new contingency will be sufficient to take Vogtle 3 and 4 project to completion. That said, we recognize that a nuclear construction project can continue to experience challenges and that unanticipated events may require further revision to the forecast and project schedules to get to completion.","Meanwhile progress on construction continues. Several major milestones have been met and we've achieved scheduled completion date and we continue to project in-service date by November 2021 and November 2022 for Unit 3 and 4 respectively. Our primary construction contractor Bechtel continues to plan work based on a schedule months ahead of these dates. We will continue to monitor and evaluate productivity rates and attracting onboarding and retaining electricians and pipefitters continue to be priorities. We are having success with these initiatives but we have more work to do. Additionally both Southern Nuclear and Westinghouse personnel continue to learn from the now for four AP1000 units in China which have loaded fuel and are currently in state-up phase.","I will now ask Drew to provide a few details on the financial aspects of the new project estimate.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Tom. The $1.1 billion pre-tax charge reported for Georgia Power, which translates to a $790 million after-tax charge is an estimate of the increase in future cash expenditures for the project. However, in recognition of our commitment to the credit quality of both Georgia Power and Southern Company, we plan to issue approximately $800 million in incremental common equity through the remainder of 2018. Likewise, Southern Company will contribute this equity down to Georgia Power to maintain its target capital structure and credit profile consistent with the Georgia PSC's Tax Reform Order earlier this year. This incremental equity is expected to come from the types of sources that we've used in the past.","While our future financing activities are subject to market conditions and other factors, our current financing plan does not assume any discrete equity offerings or block sales. All else being equal, we project these additional shares to equate to approximately $0.02 of EPS dilution in 2019 and to reach approximately $0.05 by 2020 or 2021 as the project spends and the estimated increase cost to complete are included to complete the project.","Even with these efforts, we do not anticipate any change to our 4% to 6% long-term EPS growth rate guidance. We expect to continue evaluating opportunities to offset these effects and optimize our overall financial plan, including additional investor-friendly sources of funds.","I will now turn the call back to Tom for a brief update on recent initiatives.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks Drew. In May, we completed the sale of a 33% minority interest stake in Southern Power Solar portfolio and we completed the sale of Pivotal Home Solutions in June. In July, we closed the sales of Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas and Florida City Gas. Cumulatively these transactions accounted for more than $3.7 billion in proceeds.","We have completed the appropriate FERC filings for the sales of Gulf Power and Southern Power plants Stanton and Oleander. These regulatory approvals are expected to drive the timing for closing on these transactions. Our current expectation is that both transactions will close during the first half of 2019. We are also making great progress on third-party tax equity financing for the vast majority of Southern Power's existing wind portfolio, which we expect to produce more than $1 billion in proceeds. We hope to close this transaction during the fourth quarter of 2018.","Southern Company has demonstrated tremendous discipline as both a buyer and seller of assets. The AGL Resources and Southern Natural Gas transactions, for example, have proved to be terrific complements to our portfolio of companies, further strengthening our expected long-term growth profile. Likewise, our recent divestitures have proven to be an effective source of equity with a significantly lower cost of capital than new common shares. Southern will continue this disciplined approach as we seek to further improve upon our state-regulated utility centric growth profile.","And as a final note, yesterday the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved a settlement for Mississippi Power Company PEP filing receiving the majority of the requested amount.","Drew will now provide some specifics on our second quarter earnings performance.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Tom. For the second quarter of 2018, we reported a loss of $154 million or $0.15 a share. This compares with a loss of $1.38 billion or $1.38 per share in the second quarter of 2017. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we reported earnings of $784 million or $0.77 per share compared with the loss of $723 million or $0.73 a share for the same period in 2017.","Excluding charges associated with Vogtle, Kemper and other items described in our earnings material, earnings for the second quarter of 2018 and the six month period ended June 30, 2018 were $0.80 and $1.69 per share respectively. These results compare with $0.73 and $1.39 per share on an adjusted basis for the same period since 2017.","Major year-over-year earnings drivers for adjusted second quarter 2018 results include the positive effects of constructive regulatory outcomes and weather at our state-regulated utilities and increased contributions from Southern Power's renewables fleet. These impacts were partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization, as well as operations and maintenance costs.","Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I want to provide our outlook for the remainder of 2018. Historically, we have not provided updates to our year end EPS guidance until we report third quarter results. In light of our performance year-to-date, which is tracking ahead of our plans on an adjusted basis and the impacts of reducing our new equity needs with the Florida asset transactions, we're updating our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year 2018 to $2.95 to $3.05. Finally, our estimate for the third quarter adjusted EPS is $1.05.","Tom, I'll now turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks Drew. Once again, I want to thank everyone for being with us this morning. I'm sure you all have many questions regarding the topic we've addressed on today's call. So let's go ahead and open the floor for questions. Operator let's take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking up our question. Just one thing I noticed in the disclosure in the 10-Q around Vogtle was that you need to have a new vote of the co-owners which needs to come in at 90%. Can you just talk to us Tom about how confident you are around that process and what would happen in the event that one of them didn't come along?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Sure. I have to be very careful not to speak for our co-owners here. There is a governance process that these events trigger that we refer to in the disclosure. Jonathan, the only kind of characterization I can offer, because I want to let their own governance process to speak for themselves, is to say I think that we've had real-time communication with our co-owners and certainly in the past they have been supportive and constructive in our relationship. Beyond that, I really would prefer to let their own process speak for itself.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What's the timing on when you think that will play out?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Certainly it'll be at the very end of the third quarter perhaps into the fourth quarter, but I would expect something late September.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then as to sort of \u2013 you know, I realize you don't want to speak for them, but what would your \u2013 how would it affect your plans if one of them wasn't to move forward?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, based on the current structure, in fact, the Georgia Power Board voted, made a recommendation to the Southern Board, we concur with that. We are moving forward. Anything that was an alternative as a result of any of these governance processes, we just have to take that up at the time.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe, if I could, just one more on the \u2013 looking at the sort of performance slide where you show the metrics. What happened with the top one where it seems to kind of move sharply higher in July? I know there's been some reports that you shutdown work at the site for a day or two. Could you talk about that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That was it. Yeah. That's pretty much it. Look, if you look at kind of the general trend, we've suggested, I think, for a couple of earnings calls now that, while we've been going very well, and in fact, if you go back in time and look at kind of the December 2017 when we were really beating this green line which is predicated on a 21 month schedule or a April 2021, April 2022 completion date. Remember that variance was really because we worked through some periods where we had planned otherwise to have a lot of dislocation in work from holidays. So that's why we've made up a lot there. And then we started saying, certainly as we approach early part of this year, when we start working in some rather confined spaces with the reactor vessel core that we thought that we would see some erosion against that 21 month kind of schedule. The other thing that I think is important earlier this spring would be, we had a ton of rainfall and that impacted our ability to deploy productively. But I think the spike at the end \u2013 you got to be a little careful, this is a four week rolling average, but a lot of that spike may be attributed to the two-day-or-so stand-down on the site.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And what was the story there?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Sure. I think it was just recalibrating all expectations on site, whether it is leadership's oversight of personnel, whether it is the commitment of personnel to complete their task as efficiently as we need, it is medicine that we take from time to time that is painful, but generally produces good long run results. The focus is to meet with year-end completion percentages and we just took tough action to recalibrate personnel on the site to make sure that happens. And I think the results following that have been pretty good.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just finally, you've given this disclosure that electrician and pipefitter staffing is between 85% and 90% of plans. Could you just calibrate that to the prior disclosure where I think you needed to hire 700 of one and 400 of the other by October? I think that was what was in the VCM, like what does the 85% to 90% mean in the context of that target?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's kind of where we are now versus the plan. We need to continue to ramp up. I think our staffing projection would show we reach our peak in November. I think we feel really good about where we are on the pipefitters. I think the electricians is the one that continues to require focus. We have a lot of different arrows in the quiver to address that. We still believe we can hit everything we need. But it goes to getting workers from Canada. It goes to re-segmenting work on site, it goes to perhaps getting personnel from Puerto Rico and other areas. Look, I talk to Brendan Bechtel, either in-person, on the phone, text, e-mail, people on the site are focused on this. We absolutely realize that we need to hit these targets. People remain confident, but I think it is the biggest risk area we face right now.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Do you have a number of how many more you need to hire?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, there is a schedule. I think we can get it for you. I just don't have it right at my fingertips.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","I think the best way to think about it is current populations are at about two-thirds of what the expectation is...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","By November.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","By November.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We can get you more detail on that. It represents about 600 jobs...","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But that two-thirds of November, but 85% to 90% of plan, is that...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's...","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Those are not conflicting comments?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. Plan is like where we are now and then we need to add about 600 more by November.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Right.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And is that 600 relative to the 1100 of both categories that was disclosed in the last VCM or relative to the 700?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. It's just the electricians. And yes it is relevant to where we were before.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Sorry to, for all the questions though \u2013 thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No, no, great. Thank you, Jonathan.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hi, Steve.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning. I think staff or the commission has been saying again that there's not a full integrated project schedule. Could you talk to that, because it seems like that's pretty important having confidence in these numbers?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I would argue that we have a good schedule. We continue to work on refining the schedule, but that's something that is ongoing all the time. In fact, I'm just looking at \u2013 I was just reviewing this morning even. The construction milestones for the rest of the year, there's plenty of detail here and I can go into tens of thousands of lines of detail, but I have 20 big things that have to happen during 2018. And I would argue something like on Unit 3, 18 of the 20 have been met or are expected to be met within the parameters, only two are not. They're off by, on one case, one item a month, another case a little over a month and neither one is critical path. They both have plenty of float left.","On Unit 4, 16 out of 20, the variances look like a week, two weeks and three weeks. Again, none of those are critical path. We completed the resource loaded schedule in May. And so this is something that we always \u2013 this is an ongoing process that we always look at refining the schedule and as we see, new expected completion dates or as we see actual performance that's different than planned, we always review the schedule. But I would argue, we do have an integrated schedule right now and we are meeting it.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And just I know the dates are November 2021, 2022 are the same, your schedule had like an earlier timeline. Could you just tell us what your internal schedule is relative to those November dates, is it still seven months ahead or...?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's what we've said before. We've been managing the site to what's called a 21 month, not 29 month. But what that means is April of 2021 for Unit 3 and April of 2022 for Unit 4. That's what we're managing the site to. And the data we show in the metrics that we've had in these earnings calls, I guess really since we've taken over, would show that early on we were even beating the 21 month schedule, the April schedule, that was at the end of 2017 roughly. And we said that we thought that those achievements would be challenged because we're moving into a very tight constrained part of the site, the nuclear reactor vessel is just a much closer environment with a lot of people and a lot of material and we thought that that progress would be challenged, and in fact the data has followed precisely what we've suggested.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","And Steve I'd say that the Direct Schedule Performance Index and the Direct Cost Performance Index that we show you is based on that April time schedule.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just lastly, just could you \u2013 I'm sure you informed the commissioners and political leaders ahead of this, just any reaction from them to this news? Obviously shareholders are absorbing most of it. But could you just...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. Yes we have. I would argue that the commission remains supportive of the project as does the broad political public here in Georgia. If you think about it from a customer economic standpoint, customer impact standpoint, because we're making the tough decision not to include these base capital cost today, the same customer impacts remain today as existed in VCM 17 when this project was approved.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I'll let others ask questions. Thanks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just wanted to talk about the contingency, you mentioned there could be some potential in the future for customers to absorb that. Can you remind me, where are we at the moment in terms of how the commission calculated the net present value to customers of this project? I'm just sort of thinking about the incremental changes to that net present value over time. I just want to level set where we are at the moment.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Somebody should check me after the call, but as I remember the calculations back in the VCM 17, there was something like $2 billion of value to customers by pursuing this course of action. That's what I remember about the present value benefit. If that's not correct or if there are degrees of freedom around that, we'll get back to you. But that's what I remember. And recall...","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","...that with the action we've taken today that's \u2013 those economics are preserved.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And then I have more of a just a mechanical question around the joint owners. If the joint owners chose not to move forward and Southern Company chose to move forward, mechanically, how is that handled like a little rusty own how that would sort of mechanically work its way through?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. So the technical answer there is that the project would be deemed to be cancelled I believe. And then of course, you could take a variety of different paths beyond that. But the technical answer is, if you don't get the 90% vote the project is cancelled. Then you have to figure out how or whether to proceed beyond that. There is no prescription per se beyond that action. Of course, we could all negotiate whatever but that would also require Public Service Commission approval and a variety of other things.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. So Tom, in that scenario would that likely involve Commission involvement in terms of reviewing the plan at that point if the project is technically cancelled?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Of course. Yes it would, of course.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's all. That's all I have.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. So just following-up on Georgia Power's balance sheet just in terms of the authorized equity ratios and how you're thinking about the latest write-off, I know you talked about corporate level equity at this point. Can you just specify how you're thinking about financing at that level and just how you think about that perhaps having an impact on next year's rate case, if at all?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. You may recall that Georgia Power reached an agreement with the Public Service Commission following the new tax legislation. It was constructive and was designed to support their credit quality, which is so important as we think about building a asset like Vogtle 3 and 4. The solution in order to reach a similar FFO to debt calculation was to increase the equity ratio from 50% to about 55%. They put that in place effective immediately essentially, and also said that they would address it again later in the 2019 rate case. So we've been down streaming equity into Georgia per that order. And the plans that we've laid in front of you today that relate to the $800 million additional equity requirement also are consistent with that plan.","And just to review the bidding, because I think it's informative. When we got the new tax law, we thought it was going to be about $7 billion of incremental equity across the system and that was associated with also increased equity ratios. With the transaction that we announced with NextEra, we essentially took $3 billion off the table, in other words we were carrying about assets that were worth about $3.5 billion in our current valuation and sold them for about $6.5 billion. So the $3 billion netted against any future equity requirement. Further, we announced the forward sale to tax equity of the production tax credits associated with wind that's another $1 billion. So the $7 billion was reduced by $3 billion and then reduced by the $1 billion, and so it is now net $3 billion. When we think about the actions that we are taking this morning and the additional $800 million, the $3 billion becomes $3.8 billion. And what we said earlier in our opening comments is that we still don't believe that requires any block sales and we believe that we can handle this therefore with at the market sales, or our normal plans as well as investor-friendly equity. We think we've got plenty of gunpowder to handle this issue.","From an EPS standpoint, the effect this year and we've increased the equity in the EPS range from $2.80-$2.95 now to $2.95-$3.05. We think the dilutive effect of this action today is only about a $0.01 this year, but within the $2.95 to $3.05, $0.02 in 2019 and $0.05 kind of thereafter. And what we also said is we will undertake plans to reduce, eliminate that effect.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","And Julien just to give you a little bit of this \u2013 a flavor of this mechanically because look the expenses are probable, we will take that write-down at Georgia Power reduces equity, we will \u2013 however it is paid out over time, this is part of our future expectation for constructed costs. But because we want to maintain the capitalization there for regulatory purposes, we will inject the $800 million today. This will improve FFO to debt in the near term, but certainly the expectation is that it will be used to fund construction over the longer-term.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And just to underline what Drew is saying that what we have done today is made a new estimate to complete. Those are dealing with not actual expenditures per se, but rather future expenditures. But we're taking the action immediately to improve the balance sheet.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","So from a cash standpoint, there's a difference, it actually works to our credit quality advantage.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Let me clarify this just to be exceptionally clear cut about this. The $0.05 that you just talk about over time, none of that pertains to any change in the earnings ability for the asset itself, right, this doesn't change any of the basically tracker earnings, this is simply a question of balance sheet and dilution effect.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's exactly right. It only relates to the incremental equity that we're using in order to preserve credit quality.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And sort of to clarify earlier your response to Steve's question on the tight construction period here. Can you elaborate a little bit more on when we're going to be \"through that\" if you will, right? I suppose over the next little bit, you seem to describe that it's a particularly difficult stretch of construction. When do you anticipate to be through it per your definition? And more importantly to that also the hiring ramp as well in tandem, right, I suppose both seemed to go hand-in-hand with the schedule.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. I think the next 18 months Julien are where we're seeing the big intensive pressure. After about 18 months we see a pretty good ramp down in terms of staffing et cetera on the site, so something like that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I'll let it there. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Just to follow-up on the dilution and offsetting it with \u2013 offsetting the $0.05 out in the future. Is that mostly going to come from cost cutting or is that part additional project growth and rate based growth such as thinking like the grand (39:40) mechanism in Georgia, what do you see is offsetting the dilutive impact?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You know it's all that and potentially investor-friendly equity, as we've discussed before. Just pick Elizabethtown for example, I think AGL made a heck of an acquisition there in the past and your carrying value there I'm looking at Drew, it was around $700 million, you sold it for $1.7 billion. So you picked up about $1 billion solely on Elizabethtown. As I described the economics of the Florida transaction, we picked up $3 billion there.","The other thing that I think is important to note, our cost position we should think about it company-by-company for example Georgia Power, remember basically postponed an action in 2016, with its normal three year accounting order process that's pushed into 2019. Georgia Power's already done a whole lot of cost management, have been able to maintain an earnings profile that's been really good. And in fact by our own data Georgia Power, which showed their cost metrics are about top quartile in the industry. And the other thing that you should see as an evidence when we talk about improving our earnings range, I hope, I'm really encouraging us all not to treat this as a precedent, but because our numbers are so far ahead of our original guidance, we decided to give you new guidance at this call.","Normally, our process has been that we give original guidance at the yearend calls, which has been the end of January, early February. And we only update that in our October call, after we get through the summer months. That has been our process really even going back to my days as CFO. We were just so far ahead, $0.30 ahead that we felt we ought to go ahead and change the guidance from $2.80-$2.95 to $2.95-$3.05. Part of that performance has been our performance on cost recognition and the whole modernization effort. So I think that, Michael I think it's all the above. I think its cost management. I think it is the deployment of modernization to give us greater resilience, better customer service, increased CapEx and then of course investor-friendly equity.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And a follow-up on Julien's question, what do you see as the next big cost pressure coming up over the next 18 months? I guess right now we're in the middle of a kind of a labor squeeze. What's the most expensive item over this next 18 months that you're going to be monitoring going forward, is there a particular piece of equipment or type of integration that's happening that'd be particularly costly?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You know it isn't so much of that, because we have all the major equipment in place. It really deals with what we've been saying for some time now. And that is our ability to deploy labor productively onsite. That's going to help us get to our schedule and that has certainly cost ramifications. We've got to keep productivity on the site up, and actually improve the amount of hours worked every month onsite as we get through this ramp-up process into November and then for the next 18 months.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. So there's no critical path item as there was when we were still installing modules?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No, no, no, there is always critical path. I mean critical path by definition is whatever work is required that really sets the timeframe in which you will be ready to go in service. For example, remember I just mentioned 20 major construction milestones this year for Unit 3 and Unit 4 and I gave a broad outline when I was talking to Fleishman. The critical path right now within the Auxiliary Building and that kind of critical path because successful completion on time of the Auxiliary Building allows us to begin testing of the major other components, which will set the timeframe for the rest of the schedule. We have no major material component. Everything is onsite. It's really a matter of putting it together at this point.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. Sorry, if you said this before. I mean, when is your Auxiliary Building part of it going to be completed and through that?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Let's see, well, I'm looking through the end of this year. We have kind of by November 2029 and we're ahead \u2013 the schedule right now we call for December of 2018 for essentially the control room in the Auxiliary Building to be in play and we're actually beating that right now. And that's based on the April schedule. We are beating it by not a whole lot, by about a week on each of the concrete floors et cetera.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. All right, thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, Tom. Thank you for taking my question. I'm sure you're privy or have seen data especially given your role with the Federal Reserve down there about labor conditions and the broader market. Just curious, how would you compare the labor differences that you're seeing at Vogtle 3 and 4 versus what kind of other large either manufacturing or industrial construction projects in the region are seeing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah right. I think what we're seeing is skilled labor is kind of the most intense part. It's a fascinating question. We are seeing kind of a spotty labor constraints around the United States. So IT, high skill manual labor, pipefitters, electricians, electricians specifically because there's other activity going on around the United States. And it's requiring something special to draw those people to the sites, that is one of the big change conditions that we have seen since the original ETC was put in place that we're reflecting today. The per diems that we have put in place appear to be working. We do appear to be attracting more people. And interestingly, our turnover once we've gotten them onsite has been cut in half. So we have been seeing turnover kind of over 10%, 12% somewhere in there. Turnover now around 6%, so \u2013 6% or 7% somewhere around there. But anyway we're able to attract and retain better with these per diems.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's super helpful. And Tom, one follow-up and hate to ask this, but almost have to, given what's going on in the neighboring state...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Ask away.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","...two states over. What in the original nuclear law from 2007, 2008 is the process for potential cost recovery if the project is abandoned during construction?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. We have law in place that basically says any prudently incurred cost is recoverable. And recall there are at least three segments of costs that have been ruled on over time up to \u2013 I hope I get these numbers right, up to about $4.5 billion or so have already been deemed to be prudent. Up to about $5.7 billion or so have been \u2013 wait, up to about $4 billion have been found prudent, up to about $5.7 billion or so have been presumed to be prudent. And then up to the $7.3 billion, they are deemed to be reasonable, but the burden is still on us to prove prudence. I think those are the three separate buckets. And if I've missed any of those numbers on those buckets somebody correct me, but I think broadly that's where we are. And the prudent would determine that it is recoverable.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And is there a set regulatory process to go through that was laid out in the legislation or is it just kind of enabling legislation and the owners and the PSC would kind of have to figure out what the process or docket would look like?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","The PSC will make the prudence determination and then it will apply against law.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciate it.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes sir. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Tom. Have any events in the past triggered a co-owner vote that you needed the 90% majority?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. I guess there's two triggers that we think about. One is a new ETC in excess of $1 billion, $1 billion or more. And the other one I think relates to a lack of recoverability. And in fact...","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Tom, early...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And Paul one other issue, this two-trigger feature was an agreement that was modified last year at the time we decided to go forward.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And I think you earlier said that you would not seek $700 million of the $1.1 billion, what about the $400 million contingency?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. So it's essentially this determination. We think of the $700 million they were prudently incurred and reasonable, okay, but because of the proximity to VCM 17, we think for the good of everything going forward and in order to maintain momentum, we're not seeking recovery.","With respect to the $400 million, contingency has never been part of \u2013 in a broad sense part of the allowed costs. What the Commission likes to do in the practice of the staff and frankly we followed that because contingency by its nature is something that we think we'll spend, but we don't know what it is just yet, we don't include those. As these costs become known then we would submit them for recovery. But the $400 million right now is an estimate, but we don't know where we will spend it. As we know more, we preserve the right to ask the Commission for recovery. There is no cost cap. That's been proven before by law in VCM 12 and 17.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then lastly, you kind of blew right through your guidance, what were the big drivers relative to your thinking on the last call?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, it was really two things. One was kind of the success we had with the sale of assets to NextEra and the lack of having to issue new equity this year. And the second was the success of our modernization efforts. That is kind of the dual issue of cost management and increasing CapEx to improve resilience and customer service. Drew?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Yeah. I'd say, one of the largest items is the success we've had with tax reform implications in each of the state regulatory jurisdictions. And so we've seen very positive and productive outcomes from Georgia in particular that relates to both the power and the gas LDC and also in Alabama.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I know that added $0.03 in the first quarter and $0.05 this quarter. What do you think the full year impact of that would be?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Pretty decent run rate, as you've seen in the third quarter as a lot of the stuff matures. The biggest driver in the future will be the increase in equity content in the Alabama utility \u2013 in Alabama Power and so we'll just have to track that through the next couple of quarters.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. First question, Tom as you said, your equity needs previously had come down to $3 billion and now they are $3.8 billion with this extra $800 million. Can you just remind us how we should think about that? You know the $800 million obviously comes this year, but the base $3 billion, should we assume that sort of evenly distributed over the five years or how should we be thinking about how that equity gets layered over the years?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Ali, I think that's probably a fair way to think about it. We'll use our traditional programs of dividend reinvestment and then also sort of an at-the-market program that will begin shortly. But our intent is to move that equity out commensurate with some of the spend that we're doing. And even though our projection has changed, the 36-month timeframe really is intact.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, it's a reasonable modeling assumption, just to put that in ratably.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I see. Okay. And how much have you done if any through the first half of this year?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Less than a couple of hundred million.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And also then to clarify the comment that as you pointed out, you had this \u2013 if you model it out, there is the $0.05 dilution that comes in from the extra equity, and you've talked about keeping the 4% to 6% growth rate intact. So is the implication that you're going to offset that $0.05 or is it that even with the $0.05 dilution, you're still within the 4% to 6% range? I want to be clear what you were conveying there.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, yeah. No, it's a good point of clarification. If we did nothing to take away the impact of the $0.05 long-term, this is in the 2020-2021 timeframe we are still within the 4% to 6%. Okay. And we intend to diminish that impact over time through our actions, through modernization, special investor-friendly equity or whatever. So, even without any effort to eliminate, reduced the $0.05 we're still within the 4% to 6%. My point is we're going to attack that with great vigor.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Understood. Got it. And then with regards to the investor-friendly equity, Tom, if you look at your portfolio, are the opportunities more at the Southern Power level? I know you're monetizing the wind, you're getting $1 billion from that, are they at the gas level? Is there more to be done on electric, can you just give us a sense of where there is opportunity in that portfolio?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. I think we've kind of shown our hand. If you look at our portfolio, Ali as you have, we have been I think very disciplined buyers and sellers. Recently, it has been Elizabethtown and then the set of assets to NextEra, where NextEra I think had special interest in pursuing some assets. We think we've got an argument anyway that a lot of our assets are undervalued in our current valuation. I think if you projected kind of Elizabethtown values on all of our gas assets you would have a different valuation for Southern Company. What we're able to do, I think is to be proactive and monetize some assets at higher valuations than otherwise you would expect to see as if we issued equity on our own. That has been the core. Everything we have done from an investor-friendly standpoint has been accretive. We think we still have the capability to do that, when you look at the different pieces of our portfolio.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","And Ali, we're asked this question quite a bit. What's core and what's non-core? And reality is that it's \u2013 the simple answer is that it is all core. There are certainly some things around the edges at the margin that we have to be responsive to, but we think we've built a portfolio of assets that we really enjoy operating.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Last question is more mechanical, if you will. Your effective tax rate on an adjusted basis seems to be coming in lower than what we had. For modeling purposes what is the right effective tax rate we should be using for the adjusted earnings trajectory?","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Generally right around 21%.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","21%. Got it. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question. Your line is open.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Angie,","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. How are you? Okay. So, two things. One is, so it looks like the increase in the cost estimate has to do with labor-related issues and supervisions et cetera, but nothing to do with actually steel prices et cetera. So I'm just wondering if that's a next issue that might arise. And secondly, on the financing of the incremental equity with potential asset divestitures, I mean, I understand that you can get very good prices for some of your assets. But by shrinking the company in essence, you are increasing your exposure to this project in a sense. And so I mean, I know that it actually might be still prepared to issuing straight up equity, but just if you could share your thoughts on these two topics.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Angie, that's a great question. In fact let me just hit that one first and I will come back to your first one I think.","When you think about \u2013 another way to think about what we did with the Florida assets, we sold 5% of our earnings that goes to your point of, well you are increasing your exposure, but we sold 5% of our earnings at that time about 12% of our market cap. It was enormously accretive. And when you think about exposure to earnings when we do accretive things, it actually decreases the exposure from an accretion dilution standpoint.","So I think when you look at the results cash Elizabethtown same thing, it was the highest valuation ever paid to our knowledge anyway, 37 times earnings on a gas distribution asset. So I think the way you should view any sort of these investor-friendly divestitures have been, it's not sales at the market, because sales at the market would do exactly what you're suggesting. These are sales well above our current valuation and therefore they are accretive and they are accretive to the point of overcoming any exposure \u2013 any increased exposure to Vogtle 3 and 4. I think the math will bear that out pretty clearly.","On the first part of your question, you referred to steel play. Let me be very clear with everybody. And I think we've said this in several calls that the major equipment is onsite, we don't have big exposure to that. We do have almost \u2013 I guess most of our steel is already purchased. We do have commodities, but we think we're accounting for that in this estimate. And the commodities go to the really small things. It goes to the small pipe, it goes to the wire and cable. I think the issue really does go more to deployment of productive labor onsite and maintaining hours worked per month so that we can hit the schedule and everything else that we adhere to. And so far our estimate of schedule remains at \u2013 we are confident on 29 months and we're performing ahead of that right now. So I guess that's what I'd say. Even the subcontracts, which was a big part of what we started seeing here in late May, when we started letting out the subcontracts and they turned out to be significantly above cost from what we estimated in the original ETC those tend to be labor related as well.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Did I \u2013 yeah.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So just one follow-up. So how do you come up with those contingencies?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Sure.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I mean, it's tough for us to say if $400 million is actually a large contingency or not. And it seems like your previous estimate was perceived to be very conservative and also included contingencies and now, I mean, yeah, I mean just how can we actually get appeased by this one?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Again it's a terrific question, and one, we ask ourselves all the time, how do you know you got enough? When we did the original estimate, you may remember from all the work we did that we had lots of different input into that estimate. And I think I kind of covered some of this in the script, but more specifically we had the input of a variety of consultants. We had a completely separate path of a different consultant give us their own estimate of what ETC would be. And then, we took the ETC and went through the regulatory process. Even the independent monitor was thoroughly debated; even the independent monitor thought it was reasonable in the process that we followed with sound. So we think we did a reasonable effort at the time that we made the ETC.","At this new estimate, when we started seeing, as I mentioned before, trends that showed our contingency original was getting consumed faster than we thought, and especially in late May when we started getting feedback on the subcontract that we got from Westinghouse, I can tell you when we first got the Passover from Westinghouse of subcontract, we said, gosh let's add 50%. Well now in hindsight, we think we should have added over a 100% cost. And in some cases not just the cost, but the scope has been bigger than what we expected. We had KPMG take another look at our new estimate in terms of contingency. We've worked with Bechtel and others.","We developed something we call a risk register. And what we do in the risk register, for items that we don't have complete transparency on, although we know where we believe they will be, we actually take a range of a low and a high and we perform analysis as to probabilities and we come up with a probability weighted contingency estimate. This is essentially how we developed the estimate. We look at line items, we involve site management and we include it in an overall assessment as to the project. Does this 35% contingency as per the $1.1 billion increase look reasonable? So we do all the kind of quantitative testing. We do the qualitative judgment kind of testing. To the best of our ability, we think we've got a sound estimate here.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And the last question, okay, so shareholders are eating the $700 million. Now you're about to file the VCM report. I thought that those reports are actually just to true up the actual cost of the project and given that as you said there's no cap, I mean what kind of assurance we have that next VCM is filed and there is another cost increase and another portion of that cost step up has been absorbed by shareholders.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. So we're taking a reserve today for the entire amount of the $1.1 billion on a pre-tax basis. Okay. So that is a tacit acknowledgement that we're not seeking recovery of the $700 million base capital increase. It does not address the contingency that is the $400 million balance, and that's because we don't know exactly how, when, what we will incur those costs. We believe it is a reasonable estimate of what may occur. Therefore, we include it in the reserve. But because we don't have knowledge, we can't ask for recovery yet. So we've taken an income affect for the whole amount. As we go through each VCM and as we start to eat into that contingency there will be some analysis of whether we get to recover those costs or not. But we've already taken the accounting hit for it. Okay.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yes. Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And let me add one last thing just to say it again the $700 million that we've identified that we are not seeking recovery was really due to our judgment on maintaining project momentum and its proximity to the December 2017 decision by the PSC.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks for joining us.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Hi, guys and thanks for sitting through the marathon session. I know it's not easy. Just coming back to Vogtle and just stepping back a little bit right. The expectation was that most of the risks were managed at this point and it's more of a regular construction project. And now we have such a big cost increase. It almost seems like the unknown is what we're kind of dealing with right, the consultants haven't dealt with it before, obviously your team hasn't done these kind of projects before.","How do we get comfortable and how do you at your stage, I know you've clearly done the contingency and you've kind of fought through it, but at some point there is a level of unknown in these projects that everybody's dealing with. And so how do you get comfortable with it and how do you manage that risk that every other earnings call we don't have some concern on incremental cost that was just unknown that we just \u2013 it's something new that's come up?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Praful, thanks for that. Very reasonable question. Look I think we should take comfort in that. Well, yeah, we should take comfort in that we've been onsite now in this role now for about a year. And for a lot of the estimates that we used in developing the ETC they are no longer estimates they are reasonably known. In other words, I want to say of the subcontracts, we have about 75% of them are pretty well known, in other words actual and all that. There is still 25% or so, 30% somewhere in that range where we've gone out on the subcontract and at least we know bandwidths of where we think they'll come back. Now we still have time and material situations and we've got to be productive in terms of how we follow that work because a lot of the subcontract work depends on the work that Bechtel does and so maintaining schedule is so important.","I think one other thing you can take some comfort in is that the schedule part of this has still been working pretty well although as we continue to say, we're in the challenged part of that schedule. So our actual performance is better than kind of the November timeframe. But still that's the part that we're really focused on. The other thing that I think you should take some comfort in is that we do have essentially a complete design. We do have a technology that is being demonstrated right now with 4 units at least being in start-up in China. I think there are a lot of factors that cause us to have a lot more confidence today and the fact that we've taken additional contingency 35% of this new estimate. Now having said all that, I got to acknowledge and we've seen it before, we don't know our future conditions and we don't know, how all this will turn out, what we're giving you is our \u2013 is I think the most reasonable judgment we can make with additional contingency.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Fair enough. Understood. And secondly, in terms of asset sales or potential asset sales as you look to fund some of the equity need, one of the points you made earlier on one of the questions was that it's accretive because it's relative to where Southern is trading, the value you're getting for those assets is clearly at a higher multiple. But I'm sure when you look at it internally, you don't value your entire portfolio within Southern at the same multiple as in different pieces within your business are trading at different multiples.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Absolutely.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So it's really probably unfair to compare it to Southern consolidated multiple. So I just wanted to check when you compare and when you try to look at, okay, what is an accretive price and as you look to divest assets, how are you kind of benchmarking the right multiple?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Praful, it's absolutely right. I'm just trying to use something that everybody else can see. Okay. I'm just trying to use a reasonable benchmark that people can look at, when you look at 37 times earnings in an LDC, I think everybody would say, well, gosh, relative to kind of how it would be \u2013 how we \u2013 essentially, if you look at the buy and sell, what we bought it for and what we're selling it for is pretty clear that we bought very well with both AGL and SONAD and in that we've sold very well in respect of the pieces of those assets. And in respect to that, they are enormously accretive. I would just give you anecdotal information, even Florida City kind of went off at about the second highest multiple ever paid for an LDC with the first being Elizabethtown. It was pretty close to the Piedmont price. The Gulf price to our knowledge anyway was the highest multiple paid for an electric asset. And we think there were certain conditions and NextEra which made them willing to pay those prices. You're absolutely right. We certainly have a risk return profile for every asset that we own and those are unique as per every asset that would include every asset owned by Southern Power for example. So your point is exactly right. My shorthand and talking through just is something that everybody can point to on the Street without knowing the vagaries of how we value every asset internally.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","And I think that's pretty consistent with what you always talk about, Tom, in terms of risk and return. And Praful we focus really on evaluating the growth of an asset. It's opportunity for investment, its scale and its scope. And so it really is a multi-variable equation. We do have to compare it to the costs to our shareholders of issuing additional equity. I think we feel comfortable certainly in the $3.8 billion that Tom talked about today that that really is equity that can be issued in normal course without a lot of pressure, but we will still evaluate all options versus five or six major investment criteria within the core, but we have to take advantage of dislocations where the market is valuing certain segments of the portfolio maybe more aggressively than others.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Understood. Thanks guys and surely you have done a great job with the asset sales there, so appreciate that. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Thank you. Appreciate your questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Ashar.","Ashar Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC","Hi, good morning. How are you doing? I was just trying to get a better sense of the earning powers going forward if I can. So if I understand correctly the earnings that you have improved for this year, as you said are four factors, which is lower dilution from equity and better earnings from your subsidiaries because of the plans. So can one say that this is probably the right base from which one has to build going forward?","Except I don't know if you can help us that from the asset sales that you have announced to-date and which I think so will not be part of the earnings profile going forward, how much earnings do we lose from the assets that you have announced for sale or have completed sales, which is in 2018 forecast? And if you were to take them out and do a pro forma for those asset sales that have been announced or will be completed as part of the NextEra transactions, how much earnings do we lose from the 2018 guidance? Can you help us on that on a dollar basis?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sure. Yeah, Drew and \u2013 I'm looking at Drew, so let me take the first shot and let you correct it or whatever. Go back to the math I gave you on the Florida transactions, we sold 5% of our earnings and we got for, 12% of market cap at the time. The offset of the equity and therefore the $3 billion incremental value we generated by that transaction was way more accretive, $0.10 in this case, $0.10 plus actually than the lost earnings. Okay. So if you just remove Gulf Power you lose earnings of X, but we're able to increase earnings by over $0.10 because of the value we created by the transaction. Okay. So that takes into account all of the removal of equity and debt and everything underlying, the earnings of an asset. And because the price was so high, it was accretive, even removing those earnings. And what we're able to...","Ashar Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC","It was accretive by $0.10 or what is the accretion exact?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. What we said on the Florida transaction, the one with NextEra was \u2013 it was actually $0.10 and actually a little better than that and what we did with the $0.10, we took about half of that and we applied that against further reductions in debt to give us even more margin on the FFO to debt calculation. We really wanted to build a little shock absorber into our credit quality.","The second part, therefore, the remaining $0.05 or so, improved our ability to earn within the 4% to 6% range. Recall we had established the 4% to 6% range, then we did the Florida assets, then we said we're still within the 4% to 6%. So conceptually we moved higher within the range. And then what we said as a result of this transaction, there's kind of $0.05, if we don't do anything, there's $0.05 negative carry beginning around 2020-2021 somewhere in there. And we said, we're still within the range, even if we do nothing. And then, what I said was, we will work very hard to lessen or eliminate that effect. And what we said was a continuation of our modernization plans, which were partially the engine for improving our earnings this year as well as investor-friendly equity and other strategies. Drew, improve that answer.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","Well, maybe I'll try to answer a couple of the specifics that you asked related to what we've based-off of and what the implications are. And if you think back sort of the seminal event for us was tax reform which led to a pretty substantial equity requirement so that we could maintain credit quality of each of the underlying utility subsidiaries and so generally when we talk about growth it is off of the 2017 baseline that that established.","And as Tom said, we've been working toward a 4% to 6% range. We felt like the opportunistic sale of the Florida properties reduced the equity burden and pushed us further up into the 4% to 6% range. Certainly, this write-down of about $800 million and its required equity raise moves us down a little bit more within that range, but still within the range. And our goal is to offset a lot of that activity or a little bit of that dilution with internal activities related to modernization, cost control and a variety of other factors. So I think, generally when you think about the loss in net income for those things, they are as we've described 4% to 5%, but the impact on EPS and our expected growth rate is basically unchanged.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Ashar, and I know you know this. But let me just remind us all for the record here. While we are in this construction period in Vogtle as part of the settlement to go forward, Georgia has some reduced earnings rates, once all the assets clears to in-service for Units 3 and 4 we go back to the normal earnings rates. And so there is a little bit of a shake also to our year-by-year earnings. But I know you're aware of that.","Ashar Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC","No, I'm aware \u2013 I was just trying, Tom, to build up my 2019 earnings profile for you. And so, if I'm doing it correctly, I guess I wanted to do it before you announce it and I'm not surprised in the February call is that it seems like that the things that you have taken, or the actions you have taken, the accretion is more frontend loaded. And with this transaction that is announced as you said the dilution which you will offset, even if the dilution comes, its way backend loaded in the third year or so. So in essence, as we have started the year and where we are right now in the first week of August, there is more upfront accretion from the asset sales which should help the earnings profile in the near-term. And I just wanted to make sure my conclusion on that or the way I'm going is correct or wrong?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And Ashar, of course as with past practice we'd be glad to follow-up with you after the call to kind of refine that.","Ashar Khan - Verition Fund Management LLC","Okay. Thank you so much. So kind of you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you sir.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open please proceed.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good morning. Can you hear me? Hey. How you doing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes sir.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So just really quickly back on Vogtle. When we are looking at the cost increase, is there a breakdown I guess on sort of productivity and efficiency versus just sort of pure \u2013 the cost of the labor itself in terms of the price increase that you sort of hadn't anticipated?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I'm sorry, ask that one again.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well is there \u2013 sort of a \u2013 do you have a breakdown in terms of the sort of the efficiency or the productivity in other words there's a lot more people that you have to employ to sort of get a job done versus just sort of the increase it sounded like that you guys were experiencing in terms of labor costs than what you had previously expected. Do I understand that correctly that that's sort of the two components?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, that's right. You know Paul, one of the things that we're involved with right now that we are keeping our eyes on like hawks is the amount of productive hours worked in a month. So I would say we're kind of in the 85,000 hours a month right now. We need to get that up to November by I don't know a 125,000. That's kind of the ramp-up that we are currently in. And so there's really two factors there, right. One is getting workers on the site, so that's the earlier dialogue that we shared about pipefitters and electricians and all that. And the second thing is once we get people onsite getting them to do productive work. So making sure that if there're X-hours in a day that we actually turn wrenches and produce results in accordance with what we think. That's kind of the trend that we are following right now and that will drive certainly schedule, which we're ahead of right now and cost.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So you're ahead of schedule, that's sort of my follow-up is that, so because you are ahead of schedule, is that why these additional hurdles that you're seeing in terms of productivity what have you, aren't delaying your in-service date, is that how we should \u2013 I mean not extending the in-service date, do you follow what I am saying, I mean, why is it that you guys are having these cost issues, but it doesn't seem to be impacting the schedule?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, if you think about it Bechtel, the Cost Performance Index really relates to work being performed by Bechtel and we are above the 1 there. But Bechtel has a contract which has its own contingency and has its own. I think if you think \u2013 I think the benchmark that we talk about internally is Bechtel on a 29 month schedule is about 1.4 or so, somewhere around there. We'd like to get them certainly below. We've been talking about 1.22, we'd like to get below 1.2, in order to keep our performance ahead of schedule as we've been saying.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Andrew W. Evans - The Southern Co.","I think it's also fair to say that a lot of, about half of the cost increase that we're taking, is in an effort to stay on track and lower the schedule risk that's there. And so that does include wage inflations per diems, specialized trade a lot of the activity and what we're performing is the completion of these projects in November of 2021. And that's certainly going to be a big component of why we've decided to spend these additional funds.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, and Paul just another way to attack this thing. If you go back to this graph I guess it's page 11 or whatever, but if that number, this cost performance index is at 1.24 that would indicate about a \u2013 let me just do this, June schedule somewhere around there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just in terms of regulatory. Have you guys foreclosed \u2013 I mean, just to make sure that I understand this, have you guys foreclosed any recovery associated with this additional cost or is it that you're just simply not going to be seeking it now....","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. We are clear that we are not going to seek recovery on the $700 million. We are reserving the right because there is no cost cap, on the $400 million contingency. The reason that we have not included that in any estimate is really part of our past practice, the Commission or the staff likes to approve contingency, as contingency becomes a real expenditure, we will then decide whether it is reasonable and subject to recovery.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you. Operator, any more questions?","Operator","No. At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. Thanks everybody for joining us today. Certainly, this is not news that we welcome. I think it represents a reasonable estimate as to how to proceed. I think it preserves our regulatory relationships. I think it preserves, I think an equitable assessment of our stakeholders. I know that's painful as a shareholder. But I think in the short run this is pain that is worthwhile in order to preserve long run performance. And I think we've demonstrated the long run impacts here with the discussion around really even current EPS performance and how we've blown through the top of our set range with all the good work we've done this year with the Florida transaction and with our own modernization efforts, but also a nod to the future effects of this announcement today. And I think it's our opinion that this action today preserves the best long-term value for our shareholders, short-term pain, but long-term gain. We think we're able to maintain this performance and provide, I think, a very attractive risk return profile to investors. Thanks everybody for joining us today. We look forward to chatting with you soon. Operator, that's all.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Southern Company's second quarter 2018 earnings call.

Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As always, we appreciate your interest in Southern Company. We have a long list of outstanding accomplishments for 2016 and we are well positioned for continued success in 2017 and beyond. We shared many of our 2016 successes at our Analyst Day, but I'd like to recap just a few.","Our longest standing strength is the operation of premier state-regulated utilities. The addition of Southern Company Gas broadens our opportunity to leverage our customer-focused business model, which has long supported constructive regulatory relationships, world-class customer satisfaction and regular predictable and sustainable returns on investment.","As evidenced by the efficient merger approval processes that were completed in the first half of 2016, all of these newly added LDCs have constructive regulatory framework and well-established regulatory relationships. Recall that one of the key rationales for our acquisition of Southern Company Gas was to create a platform for future growth in gas infrastructure.","On the heels of completing the AGL Resources merger, we acquired 50% of Southern Natural Gas which serves the vast majority of our state regulated utilities in the Southeast and is arguably the crown jewel of the interstate natural gas pipelines in the southeastern United States.","Not only does our ownership provide for stable long-term earnings and cash flows, it is also expected to provide growth opportunities in the future. At Southern Power, we invested nearly $5 billion in 2016 and began a shift towards wind. At the very end of the year, Southern Power signed an agreement with RES to jointly develop 3,000 megawatts of wind projects with an in-service date of 2018 through 2020.","Southern Power will co-originate the PPA's for this pipeline of projects and will procure turbines through two supply agreements with Vestas and Siemens. Our initial turbine purchases in 2016 provide a safe harbor for 100% of the 2016 production tax credit value for the full development pipeline.","We plan to invest approximately $1.5 billion per year to grow Southern Power over the next five years and the pipeline of projects under our joint development agreement accounts for most of the expected investments in 2018 through 2020 timeframe.","The addition of PowerSecure early last year provides Southern Company with another important option for the future. PowerSecure is well aligned with our customer-focused business model, providing customers with the energy infrastructure solutions they increasingly demand. With the slowing of electricity usage, we've positioned Southern Company to serve a nationwide base of customers on both sides of the meter.","This strategy includes opportunities under the alliance we announced with Bloom in late 2016. Much like Southern Power and our interstate natural gas pipeline investments, PowerSecure is positioned to build and own distributed energy infrastructure under long-term contracts in a manner that should provide for regular, predictable and sustainable results.","At Vogtle 3 and 4, we continue to make progress on construction. In addition, in December, as another example of constructive regulatory environments that are key to our overall success, the Georgia PSC approved the prudence agreement we announced in October.","As a reminder, the Georgia PSC approved our 2015 litigation settlement with Westinghouse. In addition, the PSC either deemed or presumed prudent costs aggregating $5.68 billion while providing contingencies for both cost and schedule. The schedule contingencies provided in the prudence agreement consolidate the project timeline to allow for completion of both units 3 and 4 by December 31, 2020. This PSC action provided more certainty concerning the prudence and collection of project costs for both the company and investors.","At Southern Power, we've already announced the acquisition of the Bethel Wind Energy Center. This 276 megawatt facility is now in service and places Southern Power's ownership in renewable generation resources north of 3,200 megawatts. In addition to wind project, natural gas generation under long-term contract remains a priority for Southern Power.","As you recall, we acquired the Mankato combined cycle facility last year. The Bethel Wind project and the expansion of Mankato represent approximately $600 million of Southern Power's $1.5 billion growth capital for 2017. At Southern Company Gas, yesterday's approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM rate, that's GRAM rate structure by the Georgia PSC is yet another example of a constructive regulatory framework for our premier state-regulated utilities. This forward-looking mechanism will provide timely recovery of important infrastructure and growth investments in Georgia over the long term.","In addition, Southern Natural Gas recently filed a proposal with FERC for expansion of the natural gas lateral that serves Plant McDonough-Atkinson in Georgia with an estimated investment of $240 million. Our 50% share of this investment, $120 million, is part of the $300 million placeholder CapEx we included for pipelines in our Analyst Day materials.","In 2016, by expanding our premier state-regulated utility portfolio, continuing to invest in energy infrastructure projects under long-term contract and financing our 2016 growth on very favorable terms, we were able to extend our EPS outlook to five years with an EPS growth rate of approximately 5%.","Our EPS outlook is resilient to a variety of different outcomes and supports our regular, predictable, and sustainable objectives. And subject to board approval, that should enable us to follow-through on the dividend policy we outlined at our Analyst Day in October.","I'll turn the call over now to Art for a financial and economic review.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see from the materials released this morning, the adjusted results for the fourth quarter met our estimates and we exceeded our guidance on an adjusted basis for the full year of 2016.","For the fourth quarter of 2016, we had reported earnings of $197 million or $0.20 per share compared with $271 million or $0.30 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year of 2016, reported earnings were $2.45 billion or $2.57 per share compared with $2.37 billion or $2.60 per share in 2015.","On an adjusted basis, for the fourth quarter of 2016, consistent with our estimate provided at our Analyst Day, Southern Company earned $235 million or $0.24 a share during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with earnings of $403 million or $0.44 per share during the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year of 2016, on an adjusted basis, Southern Company earned $2.73 billion, or $2.89 a share compared with earnings of $2.63 billion, or $2.89 a share for the same period in 2015. A reconciliation of our as-reported and as-adjusted results is included in the materials we released this morning.","Our adjusted annual result of $2.89 per share was just above the top of the 2016 guidance range we established a year ago. The major earnings drivers when compared to our $2.89 per share adjusted results for 2015 were retail revenue effects of our regulated electric utilities, weather and continued growth at Southern Power. These positive drivers were offset by the issuance of additional shares, higher non-fuel O&M expense, higher depreciation and lower weather-adjusted retail electric usage. A more comprehensive list of drivers is included in the materials we released this morning.","We continue to see retail electricity customers using less. This trend is true for all classes, especially commercial. Industrial sales are lower due to persistent strength in the dollar, weaker demand for domestic manufactured products and lower oil prices, hitting three of our largest industrial segments in 2016, chemicals, paper and primary metals. However, the outlook is somewhat brighter in 2017 with prospects of potential infrastructure spending, lower tax rates and higher levels of confidence as reflected by the ISM Manufacturing Index, which rose to 56 in January, a two-year high.","Residential sales are flat, influenced by increased levels of efficiency and a continued trend from single-family homes to multifamily housing. Commercial sales trends are reflective of similar moves to more efficient lighting and HVAC systems as well as an increase in ecommerce, putting pressure on the growth of bricks and mortar retail stores.","Our expectation for retail electric sales growth over the next several years, as we outlined at our Analyst Day, are between zero and 1%. In the near term, we expect 2017 electric sales growth to be towards the lower end of that range.","Somewhat offsetting declining retail electric sales is strong customer growth, especially in Georgia and Florida. As we look across our state-regulated footprint, which now covers nine states, we are seeing employment and population growth consistent with national trends, with slightly stronger growth in Georgia where we serve both gas and electric markets.","Southern Company Gas has experienced strong customer growth in its gas distribution territories especially in Georgia, Florida and Tennessee. This reflects an increase in migration to these states and strong employment growth.","In our gas and electric markets, our economic development pipeline remains robust as most of our states are well positioned to create jobs over the next several years and we expect to support continued customer growth and infrastructure investment.","Before I turn the call back over to Tom, I'd like to cover a few final items. First, our earnings estimate for the first quarter. We estimate that Southern Company will earn $0.57 per share in the first quarter of 2017. We are also reiterating our adjusted EPS guidance from our Analyst Day of $2.90 to $3.02 per share for the full year 2017 and an EPS growth rate of approximately 5% for the next five years.","Secondly, I'd like to touch on potential tax reform legislation. No doubt we will all be keeping a close eye on this issue, but we also know predicting the outcome is impossible. There are two very public proposals garnering attention, one, from the Trump administration and one from House Republicans. Both proposals focus on three primary elements: reducing the corporate tax rate, expensing of capital expenditures and eliminating the interest deduction. Each of these elements impacts customers and shareholders in different ways and it is far too early to know exactly how these proposals might be implemented, or exactly what, if any, transition rules would be established.","Having acknowledged that uncertainty, let me share some potential impacts of the major tax reform proposals under a few different scenarios. We estimate that the administration's proposal would be slightly accretive to EPS through 2021.","When considering the three major elements of the Republican \u2013 House Republican proposal, the impacts could range from slightly accretive to approximately 5% dilutive through 2021 depending on the underlying assumptions. In all of our House Republican plan scenarios, we have assumed a 20% tax rate. However, there are a wide range of assumptions related to capital and interest deductibility.","Our worst-case scenario assumes no interest is deductible and there are no incremental investments to offset potential rate-based reductions relating to deducting 100% of capital. Our best case assumes interest on existing debt is grandfathered and that incremental capital projects offset reductions in rate base. We are engaged with policymakers regarding tax reform on several fronts. Our priorities are preserving both the interest deduction and current tax treatment on CapEx as well as ensuring fair and comprehensive transition rules.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Art. Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to briefly address our two major generation projects. Progress at Vogtle 3 and 4 construction site continues and the actions of our contractor are indicative of a focused commitment to improve productivity in critical path areas of construction and to complete projects in a timely manner.","We are closely monitoring the status of Toshiba and Westinghouse. Our fixed-price contract continues to protect customers and shareholders alike. Westinghouse has provided us with an updated schedule that reflects commercial operations date of December 2019 for Unit 3 and September 2020 for Unit 4. The company is currently reviewing this schedule in an effort to confirm that these projected dates align with our expectation.","The prudent settlement approved by the Georgia PSC in December provides flexibility to accommodate these schedule changes. You will recall that the PSC order prescribes the completion of both units by year end 2020. And we are seeing improvements in productivity and believe this momentum will be sustained given the recent announcements by Toshiba and WEC.","At the Kemper Project, we achieved integrated operations of both gasifier trains and combustion turbines in late January. Following a short outage in early February to make modifications and improvements to clean the gas cleanup systems, the plant returned to integrated operations of both trains including the capture of CO2 and the production of sulfuric acid and ammonia, all of acceptable quality under the related off-take agreements.","On Monday; however, Mississippi Power determined that an outage to remove ash deposits from gasifier B's ash removal system was necessary. Gasifier B has been producing syngas 60% of the time since November of last year.","During the outage, gasifier A and combustion turbine A are expected to remain in operation, producing electricity from syngas as well as producing chemical byproducts. As a result of this latest outage work, we are currently expected to reach sustained operation and place the full IGCC facility into service by middle of March.","Mississippi Power expects to file for an accounting order from the Mississippi PSC that will allow deferral of depreciation and operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $25 million per month pre-tax for the assets placed in service until rates are in place. Our 2017 EPS guidance assumes receipt of this accounting order.","In the coming months, Mississippi Power expects to file for cost recovery with the Mississippi PSC. We plan to file both a traditional rate case and an alternative multiyear rate mitigation plan, as provided for under Mississippi legislation passed in 2013. Our goal is to achieve an outcome that balances the interests of customers and investors alike, an objective which often presents challenges.","Our commitment to the financial integrity of Mississippi Power and Southern Company has not changed. As we have done to-date, Southern Company expects to maintain a capital structure and credit metrics for Mississippi Power supportive of investment grade ratings.","Likewise, we plan to continue targeting a minimum 16% FFO to debt metric over the long term at The Southern Company level. Moreover, our overall objectives as a company remain constant. We continue to believe that focusing on the customer, operating premier state-regulated utilities and investing in energy infrastructure projects under long-term contracts will continue to support regular, predictable, sustainable, long-term earnings and dividend growth for our investors. Our tremendous successes in 2016 provided the foundation for a resilient financial outlook, including approximately 5% growth in earnings per share.","Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question coming from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I had a question on Kemper. And I guess in your last Form 8-K, you referenced the economic viability analysis that you were going to update and I believe the Form 8-K says that this has been negatively affected by cost and the lower gas price forecast. Can you give us any more specifics on what negatively affected means?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, sure. So let me first give the context. I guess we've been filing these economic viability analyses since about 2009, somewhere around there, did it annually as a requirement through 2014. In 2015, I guess the Commission of the staff asked us to file another and we did. And then the idea was to update that whenever we saw a major change. We didn't see a major change in 2015, so we didn't file one there.","And then in 2016, the predominant change that we saw really related to a lower long-term gas price forecast. That was kind of by far the major effect. And it resulted in a reduction of gas price forecasts of 25% to 30%.","Now, when you look at the outcome of the so-called 3x3 matrix, so there's nine boxes, essentially what you're able to see is that throughout time, this project has been somewhere between six to nine boxes that are green. That means that as currently formulated, the plan is economic relative to variances in high, low and medium gas prices and some spread of what carbon costs or price may be.","The latest especially result of a new gas price forecast reduced the number of green boxes to three. If you had not had the reduction of long-term gas price forecast in this current edition, we would have been back to around six green boxes.","So, Jonathan, I guess my advice to people looking at that is kind of this: the real result is due to the reduction in the long-term gas price forecast. That's the overwhelming change, the big change. Obviously, there are others. It is a point in time. When we had this plant certificated, we all thought that gas prices were going to be double digits and there was some spread that were way higher than where we are now.","And recall again, and it was interesting. I actually went back in conjunction with this last board meeting we just had, as I started to think about the whole regulatory situation and recovery. And going back to 2008 when this plant was first filed for in Mississippi, it was really structured as a gas-price hedge. In other words, we saw volatile and high gas prices and nobody figured that gas prices will fall this low. But at the time Mississippi was looking at being exposed to 70% gas generation and 30% coal, adding Plant Ratcliffe, Kemper County to the mix gave us kind of a third exposure to gas prices, a third Kemper and a third coal prices.","Interestingly, Mississippi's customers have been able to benefit from the dropping gas prices along the way because, as you know, our combined cycle gas turbine has been in service and has been having an operations profile much better than what you typically find in the United States; so all that to say is it's an input. The big change is really related to gas prices. Obviously, operating costs did go up since 2015 about $40 million a year, but it'll just be part of the input that goes into the evaluation of recovery. I'm very happy to say that once we achieve in-service, we will be able to give the regulators and the customers of Mississippi essentially what was certificated back in 2010.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Tom, let's follow up on that. Is there a scenario where the sort of lack of green boxes causes someone \u2013 is there a determination to be made that it would be better for customers just to run this as a gas plant?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Jonathan, I suppose there's a million different scenarios we could evaluate. The good news is and you folks know as well as we do and it's been a painful process. Getting to this point, we certainly have taken our lumps, but we have delivered what was certificated back in 2010, I think we will, and we'll see how that goes, based on the order, we're going to give them what was required for us to build and we'll see how that discussion goes. Certainly there's a lot of different ways the regulatory process could unfold from there, but that's our starting point.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, Tom, thank you for the full answer. I appreciate it.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you. Always appreciate you calling in.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","How are you doing?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Quite well. Thank you very much. So perhaps just to kick it off where Jonathan left it. Can you elaborate a little bit more on this filing in Mississippi around the $25 million a month? What's the timeframe for that to kick into effect, what should we be tracking there...","(28:27)","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, exactly, sorry, apologies.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. That's all right.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Is that a good leading indicator on thinking about ultimate recovery of Kemper in a future rate case?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I really don't think it is, to be honest with you. It's interesting. So once we go in-service, we think on a pre-tax basis, the run rate's about $25 million a month. What it will be \u2013 when we file for tax and accounting in-service is essentially prescribed by accounting and tax rules. So when we hit that level, we think that four or five days of continuous integrated operation will make that determination.","We're having some conversations with the Mississippi staff about what the kind of threshold for our operation will be in order to get the accounting order, but everybody should understand that whether these costs fall inside an accounting order or outside, until we get an accounting order, they will all be subject to review and recovery under the rate filings. So really just has to do with the accounting presentation in the meantime.","I think the general thrust of the staff is that they want to see more sustained operation as yet undefined beyond what's required in order to call this thing in-service for tax and accounting purposes. We're having those discussions now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Awesome. And then moving back to the other side of major project. You discussed productivity trends going well thus far. Where are we in that kind of hiring process ramping up? Are we almost done with that? And then just to be clear about what you said earlier, I assume that between any kind of liquidated damages from the consortium and the fixed price guarantee that ultimately, there's fairly limited changes to your or customer-incurred costs as a result?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I think there's almost no changes to incurred costs. I mean, it's pretty clear. We've been meeting with management. In fact, Steve Kuczynski, our CEO of Nuclear and I met with, I want to say Westinghouse's Chairman, Toshiba's Chairman, I think the President of Westinghouse in D.C. in December, Paul Bowers and the team there. He's our CEO of Georgia Power, have been meeting with management all along the way. So you should view us as having a reasonably continuous contact with management.","It's very clear to us. I think it's clear to the contractor that all these issues, especially issues related to productivity at the site are for their account. In all the media releases that you have seen, there has never been a dispute raised to that effect.","The predicate of your question was just a wee bit off, though. One of our predicates of the question was that staffing wasn't where it needs to be. Really, staffing is, Julien, I think the bigger issue there is productivity of the staffing that exists. And interestingly and I think we have a slide in the deck \u2013 did we find a slide in the deck? It's page 23 that \u2013 and it's in the appendix. It shows the productivity, if you will. It's a productivity-looking slide, anyway, of various activities that were accomplished in Unit 3 and then the duration of those activities later for Unit 4.","And what you can see by that chart is effectively true that broadly, productivity at Unit 4 is a lot better and we're learning a lot from having undertaken activities at Unit 3. So that's why you see the difference in the change in schedule from six months and three months.","It really has nothing to do with the amount of staffing on site. The amount of people we need are on site. Further, we believe Westinghouse is pulling in the best nuclear construction people and project management talent from all over the country to augment their efforts on site particularly in the nuclear island. And so, they are all about trying to improve their productivity and improve their own financial results.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. That's fair. And then, yeah, just confirming that there is no \u2013 it changed for consumers, right, and yourselves, more importantly.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. No. In fact, what you should \u2013 the way I think about LDs (33:12) is they really offset owners' costs for any delay.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. So I just wanted to confirm that I guess V.C. Summer is going to be, looks like a few months behind you, right, so you're ahead of them by about three to four months; is that right?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You ought to ask them that.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Do you think that \u2013 all right. So you don't have any opinion as to why you guys might be a few months ahead of them or whether...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We really try to stay away from those things. I think we're much better served paying attention to our own project at this point.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And there's no change to the cost of the projects as far as you can see...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Not to us, not cost to our customers, no.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Okay. And...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And the schedule remains within the prescription that we settled that was agreed to by the Public Service Commission in the settlement and the prudence hearings.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. Has there been in any movement on the IRS review of tax credits or anything like that at this point?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","We're waiting on the Congressional tax committee, joint committee of Congress, and we believe that sometime in the first half of this year that we should hear something from them.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And you're referring to the Section 174 deduction?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, that's the Section 174. I assume, Michael, that's what you're asking about.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right, right.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","For Kemper. Okay. Not for Vogtle, right? Kemper?","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Okay.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. And I guess that's about it for now. Thanks.","Thomas A.

Fanning - The Southern Co.","Absolutely, my friend.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","How are you doing Frank?","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Hey, it's better. The last call, I got called Steven, so Frank's not that bad.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Or Bill or whatever.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Just obviously everyone's hoping for a great outcome at Kemper, the company's been making progress. But is there a scenario that happens at Kemper where Southern, the parent, no longer supports the operating company?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We've been over that a lot. We try to evaluate every potential card that could get turned up on the table here. It's our belief that we will maintain our support from Mississippi Power in the manner that we have described. It's just not in anybody's interest to consider in any serious way something other than that.","Anthony C. Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Congrats on a good end of 2016 and nice start to 2017. Real quick on Vogtle and then I'm going to turn to Southern Natural Gas for a second. On Vogtle, the projects are getting closer, meaning the Unit 4's in-service date is, I think, you said September 2020. What happens if this pushes out another couple of months into 2021? How should we think about the risk to things like production tax credits or \u2013 meaning the ability to qualify for them or for things like bonus depreciation treatment for Vogtle 3 and 4 if they come on line after 2020?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, so I'll hit production tax credits and let you do bonus, but, listen, our team in Washington is working really hard to get an extension for the two projects that are under construction. And so we're working that angle and we think actually there is a good vehicle, good circumstances in which to make that happen.","The second thing that I would say to you is this six-month and three-month kind of extension to the schedule. If something we're reviewing, when you look at that slide that I showed you, our \u2013 that I talked about before, yeah, page 23, Vogtle Unit 3 versus Unit 4 duration. Our position has been that, gosh, we ought to be able to hit Unit 4 really pretty well on \u2013 without any kind of three-month schedule extension. I think the schedule extension there may do more with staging work among or between the different units rather than the productivity we're seeing at Unit 4.","So I think Unit 4's schedule remains absolutely under discussion and we'll see where that goes. Over the next month or so, we're kind of tying the proposed schedule change to what the lower-level schedules would indicate right now. We have to make sure those things all gee-haw, if you will. So that'll be the topic of a lot of review over the next four to six weeks. Art, do you want to talk about bonus? I'm sorry, go ahead, yeah.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, just on the PTC, is the goal to try and get an extension in the PTC date kind of as part \u2013 a part and parcel or an amendment to some broader tax package or is this going to try and get this done in some separate type of legislation?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We've actually had a lot of different kind of ways to do this. We'll see. And then \u2013 let me just tell you there's a lot of support in Congress for this. This is not an adversarial or any kind of controversial thing. Getting stuff done in Congress, as we all know, is hard, so \u2013 but it's got a lot of support. But my...","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Tom.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Mike.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, Art, yeah.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Do you want to know about bonus?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","What happens if the plants come on line post 2020, what's the treatment for bonus D&A if they don't meet an end of year 2020 in-service?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","I believe it's zero.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Of course, all that's subject to change under what's being proposed, so we'll see what happens.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. And then finally, Southern Natural Gas, you introduced the new lateral off of the pipeline where you're a 50% owner with a large midstream company. Do you see a lot of other opportunities like that and do you see those coming to fruition over the next three to five years, meaning bolt-on projects, bolt-on laterals or even storage, or is the growth, kind of the bigger growth off of that pipeline, off of that position more longer term than that?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah we \u2013 I think we did at our Analyst Day, we outlined $300 million of opportunity and this is a piece of that $300 million. And we're looking at other opportunities jointly with Kinder Morgan on opportunities just like this.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Beyond the $300 million placeholder, if you go back to Rich Kinder's analyst call after we announced the acquisition of 50% of Sonat, he referred to a lot more growth opportunities. We support those things. We're aware of them. We're working with him where it makes sense. None of those additional growth opportunities are in our financial plan.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Tom. Thanks, Art.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","You bet, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Ali, welcome.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Good afternoon.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","First question, Tom, just wanted to clarify your earlier comments, this economic viability test at Kemper, so just to understand, is this one of the tools that the Commission is going to use to determine what investment gets recovered as part of the rate case filing? And this last test where you had the three in green boxes, is that really what goes in front of them when they're doing that analysis or will there be any updates to this?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, I mean it's just another piece of input that goes into the process. It's nothing more than that. We know that gas forecasts have changed a lot over time. And with respect to whether we should recover it or not, I don't think \u2013 I mean as a matter of fairness, I cannot imagine that the company is going to be held accountable for changing gas price forecasts.","We all entered into this certificate, this order from the Commission in 2010 with the understanding that this was a gas hedge and, in fact, it remains a gas hedge. There are still green boxes on the economic viability analysis which would indicate that under certain scenarios, this is a very economic thing to do. And let me remind you, if you had 2015's gas forecast instead of 2016\/2017 gas forecast, you would have six green boxes.","So, just because you have this more recent snapshot of what we believe about the future, which we all know has changed dramatically over time, that does not mean anything about the imprudency of costs incurred.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then switching to Vogtle, as you said, you've been, obviously, closely in contact with Toshiba, Westinghouse. Just remind us in the scenario that for whatever reason Toshiba's financial health implodes further or they are no longer committed, what are the backstops and what would be the scenario if they cannot complete the rest of their obligations?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, Ali, some of that is public, but they are \u2013 we have every reason to believe that Toshiba is going to remain viable. They have recognized the fact that they do have an obligation as a parental guarantee under these contracts. We believe it's in their best interests from an economic perspective to complete these projects and our expectation is that they will and that's what we've been communicated to by them.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And if you think about it, when you look at the credit banks that support Toshiba and the government, they own about 20% of the stock. Further, there's about 170,000 employees in Japan and elsewhere that are impacted by the viability of Toshiba. Further, the nuclear renaissance in Japan, such as it may be, the cleanup from Fukushima and then restarting other nuclear reactors, Toshiba has a central part of that role for Japan.","They're just an important player in the economy and we continue to get feedback that Abe's administration supports Toshiba. Two other financial facts; one financial fact. We have and we've disclosed this I think a lot, almost $1 billion, $920 million of letters of credit and further we have a multibillion-dollar guarantee to Toshiba the parent.","So there's a lot of reasons why we believe, including Toshiba's own statements and moves that are now in the press that I should just let you look at in the press rather than me comment them that Toshiba's taken hard steps necessary to improve their financial viability and that they remain committed to these two projects. Ultimately, success on Vogtle will inure to the success of Toshiba long-term.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Fair enough. And last question we've been seeing consistently, Tom, the weather-normalized sales have remained negative, in fact got a little worse in the fourth quarter, negative 1.5%. I know you alluded to some of this, Art, perhaps in your commentary, but what is causing this consistent negativity and what's the optimism that we see, at least flat, if not slightly better as we look at 2017 and beyond?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. It's really this and we're seeing it at the Fed, too. I'm not going to mix (46:21) the data for you, but the strength of the dollar has slowed exports, number one. Number two, low oil prices have slowed things like expansion of pipelines and a variety of other things.","So we have seen already those effects weigh on industrial sales. In the commercial sector, we've seen real improvement in terms of office occupancy and a variety of other measures. But there is a secular change, we think, going on in the commercial sector really related to ecommerce that is changing the nature of big-box department stores particularly.","Further, we are seeing things like energy efficiency take a lot bigger share, particularly lighting and HVAC, from the commercial sector. On the residential sector, we're seeing, we think, at least for now \u2013 of course, that sounds kind of weird, for now a secular change, but a secular change away from kind of primary housing in the 70%-30% to multifamily more to primary 60%, multifamily 40%.","We think those things may be generational, in other words, the younger generation not wanting to get tied down under a mortgage and home ownership and actually prefer the flexibility of apartments. It could be still people under recovery. It could be people not wanting to extend their credit risk from a household standpoint and we have seen at the Federal level larger savings rates in the household income level.","All of those things would suggest that the residential buying power isn't what people had hoped it would be in the past, say, three years. The good news is that we still see an influx of customers into the Southeast. And when you think about it, not just the Southeast; if you add together Southern Company Gas and the traditional electric operating companies at Southern Company, you're talking about 70,000 new customers.","We went from 4.5 million customers to 9 million customers. And one of the things we're definitely looking at is how do we increase the margin, how can we increase more sales and more value associated with having a customer, whether we sell either therms or electrons in front of the meter or whether we put energy infrastructure on the other side of the meter.","Fortunately, this thrust on the other side of the meter is happening outside our territory, high price, low reliability, low customer satisfaction areas. The Southeast remains a bastion of strength in that regard, low prices, great service, great customer satisfaction.","So, look, what we're trying to do is take advantage of all of our natural resources to improve our own organic growth, but where we're losing organic growth to things like beyond the meter sales or energy efficiency, we're playing offense where we can to improve our posture and gaining value from customers there, whether they're inside our territory or not.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it, one last clarification. The 5% growth over the next five years, that's pretty straight line, it's not front end or back end loaded, is that the way we should think about?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah it's pretty straight line, yeah.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Just take the bottom of the range and the top of the range and grow them by time; that's what we showed you in October and we stand behind that. And that permits, assuming the board continues to agree, our dividend policy that we outlined in October as well. I think that should show everybody in the investment community great strength and belief in our future. And remember, this is not just lengthen, it's strengthen.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenmark (sic) [Glenrock]. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hey, how is it going?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Awesome. How are you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm managing. I wanted to touch base on Vogtle. So I hear you on the confidence and all the good points you're bringing up on Toshiba and its economic needs, but your partner to the North, SCANA, not your partner, but whatever, the guys who got the nuclear plants as well, they seem to be taking some potential contingency planning with respect to whether or not Westinghouse can complete the project from seeing potentially other contractors or even themselves taking a role. And I was wondering are you guys looking at anything like that or...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Sure. Look, and again, I don't want to compare to SCANA. I will not do that. I will just tell you about what we're doing and that is, I hope I get these numbers right. We have about 400 people on site involved in oversight and have had that and recall that we've had people all over the world in the supply chain.","I would argue that Southern Company, unlike anybody else in the United States, has the technical depth to be able to step in if we need to and finish the project. Further, we have all the contractual rights with respect to getting IP to make sure that we can run the project successfully, et cetera. We've been through every one of those contingencies. I think those are way more tail risk than they are substantive, but if they ever become substantive, we are primed and ready to go.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then with respect to Kemper, looking through this 2017 economic viability analysis, for some reason, I'm not sure if it's redacted, it just doesn't appear to be there, the actual gas price assumptions. And I was wondering if you guys could tell us on the high end what those gas price assumptions are, the ones with the green boxes.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I'll give you a point estimate. At 2020, the hygas forecast is a wee bit over $5 per million Btu. So think about volatility and gas prices, could you be at $5 by 2020 conceivably? And then beyond 2020, there's obviously a trend that continues to grow in that manner.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Now, you guys are clearly in sort of the testing phase and what have you; so you guys want the gasifiers and everything to work. But in the current environment, it sounds like you probably \u2013 it would be more economic to run the plant just simply on natural gas and not run the gasifier. Is that correct or I mean how long would this testing phase sort of go through \u2013 would you expect the phase in which you'd have to sort of run the gasifiers just to show that it's working okay?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet, man. Yeah, Paul I got you. I got you. So here we go. So, actually, when we've had the gasifiers kind of ready to go, they've actually been performing pretty well. Like I say, we've been able to demonstrate once they're ready to go, they're in the 50% to 60% availability. Remember, all we talk about during this first year is something like 35% availability.","So who knows what it will be over a year, so I don't want to guarantee anything, but we're actually happy once we get the things up and running and look at the way A is running right now.","The other issue that I think is important and inherent in your question is this notion of what is the energy value of the plant to Mississippi's customers. And I've talked about this a lot in the past and, actually, I've been reasonably conservative in how I've postured that. I've used, I think, the range of numbers with you all on a gas-price equivalent at about a, I don't know, $2.75 to $3 per million Btu equivalent. That didn't include all of the value of the by-product sales and it really probably hived off more O&M than what our people would traditionally use in a dispatch assessment.","And we have run this thing back through our system planning people. If you do the traditional dispatch assessment and you include the value of all the by-product sales, we believe this thing will dispatch out at about $1.75 per million Btu.","So from a used and useful standpoint, this plant has tremendous energy value. Now, would you rather run the plant, keep it going \u2013 it has a rather large fixed O&M component and get the benefit of the energy or would you rather convert and just run on natural gas is kind of the question you'd get to and that underlies, I think, your point. But these are things that we will discuss with the Commission as we file the rate case. The other thing that that analysis still ignores is what's the value of the plant as a gas hedge? So there is absolute value there. It'll be interesting to see how all that assessment goes forward.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Welcome.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Hey, Praful.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks, guys. So first question on the tax reform side, the slide you provided was helpful, but wanted to get a little bit more context more specifically at the holding company level. Could you give us some color on the earnings impact at the holding company level if the interest deduction went away?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, that's included in our worst-case scenario. Obviously, the holding company would be a heavyweight on the downside for tax deductibility and so it's incorporated into that scenario. All we've really tried to do, Praful, is just to outline the top and the bottom scenarios, but there roughly is about $0.5 million a year...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","...$0.5 billion.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","...$0.5 billion a year of interest expense that's exposed, so, what we've done is project that out to 2021.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's helpful. And then as you think about the commercial segment and the additional CapEx at the commercial segment, clearly that is funded with CapEx at the holding company. So wanted to understand with the tax reform, not just the interest deductibility, but broadly tax reform, how does the commercial segment growth get exposed both from the economics associated with holding company leverage and other tax reform that might impact economics at the project level for the commercial segment?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, Praful, when we talk about commercial, we're talking about the commercial class in our regulated business. We're not talking about the unregulated businesses which I think that you're referring to.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","If you're talking about...","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, my question is more directed at the unregulated investment.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's correct.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, if you're talking Southern Power, they finance off their own balance sheet.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's correct.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Not at the parent level.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's right.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right, but interest deductibility will still impact the economics; so will other tax reforms. So what I'm trying to get at is how do those projects and the growth of those projects get impacted by the tax reform?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, listen, I mean I've been walking around the hill on this. I chair EEI and I have a finance background and we kind of go through all these things with all the people that we should, both in the White House administration and Congress, both on the House and the Senate. And I can just tell you there's interesting nomenclature up there and this notion of eliminating interest deductibility is a grand experiment and has the ability in a very near term to radically change. Of course, this depends on how this thing is factored in over time, transitional, but radically change how America finances long-term capital. And if we're trying to stimulate long-term capital, I'm not sure that that's the right way to go.","On the flipside, you say, well, how can we help on the national income statement? There's this idea about expensing capital. I understand some people like that. But given the long-term nature of the kind of capital that this industry commits to, whether you give bonus depreciation or not has very little influence on our spending habits. We really do, for example, Vogtle, Kemper transmission lines, these are long-term trending capital commitments and varying tax treatment over time has very little influence on our behavior.","We always do what's right for customers. So when you think about it, it makes much more sense and these things in scoring are really pretty close. Keeping interest deductibility is about equal to keeping the current tax depreciation and not expensing CapEx. The government is purporting to give us a benefit that really has very little value. So that's kind of where we are on all that.","With respect of Southern Power and what the incremental effect may be, I think we've been awfully famous over the years and enormously successful. We've done this for the Board, Art, our ex post review of the performance of the portfolio at Southern Power and it even exceeded ex post our review of what was required by our own disciplined IRR approach.","The other thing that you just have to understand is there's a lot of people around those deals right now, particularly tax equity, projects without tax credits. There's all sorts of uncertainty going forward. Just rest assured we'll use the same discipline and my sense is the market will react to that as well.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful context. So just to understand, the Southern Power CapEx, like the $8 billion that you have from 2017 to 2021, do you see any risk with that spend depending on what happens on tax reform?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Well, there's uncertainty with respect to tax reform. But you should know that by virtue of the agreement that we signed with RES and then ultimately with the turbine suppliers that we have safe harbored our PTCs in the 100%. And you show me, but I am not aware of any tax law change in which they unwound commercial decisions once entered into. So my sense is from the value of the PTC that we just entered into with that arrangement last December, we think that will persist under any tax reform.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. That's really helpful. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, Andy. Great to have you with us.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Thanks, Tom. I appreciate it. I hope everything is good with you all.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Just a couple questions. Maybe just \u2013 I just have some questions on Kemper and on Vogtle. So on Kemper, the only thing I think that I have left is, in your 10-K, you talk about $105 million of increased O&M annually, possibly I guess on the disclosure here. Could you just describe that and who would pay for that?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, we have already \u2013 are you talking about the 20 \u2013 first year O&M, is that what you're referring to?","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","It says operations, main expenses have increased an average of $105 million annually and maintenance capital has increased by $44 million...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","...for the first full five years of...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, we talked about, at the Analyst Day, I think, the fact that we had an additional $68 million in the first year and that we were going to expense those in the first year of operations, so that is included. As we go through, and I think Tom talked about it already, and look at the fixed O&M cost associated with the asset, that is part of the negotiation that we'll go through with the regulator around what's best option for customers. So it is part of the equation that we're going to through and it's incorporated.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Andy. Yeah. And you may be referring to O&M that was in place, estimated way back in 2000. It actually probably first got filed around 2008, was subject to review in 2009. Part of the order in early 2010 and that dealt with a level of O&M that was estimated at that time. That since has been updated; in 2015, it was updated to $100 million and then most recently in October, again revised in November of last year, was updated to around $140 million. So the increase over, say, 2015 till now is about $40 million a year. So I think what you're reading is probably from the certificate level.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Right. Okay. So the bottom line is that...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You can't get the benefit....","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","...renegotiated...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. You can't get the benefit of the plant \u2013 all those energy savings I mentioned without that O&M, you can't separate the two. And recall also, in 2012 the Commission specified the operational parameters that we're going to have to stand up to. We believe we can hit those parameters. O&M is not part of those parameters. Those things deal like with availability, heat rate and by-product sales and something else.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. And then I guess this issue about removing ash deposits has kind of plagued, maybe I'm inaccurate, but have plagued both gasifiers. Can you maybe just describe kind of what that issue is, again not in a long way?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, I'll do it in a short way, the very short way.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","How does that get resolved?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, sure there were really two different kinds of issues. But one of the things we've always said about this was, if you remember one of the big technical risks was lignite in, ash out, that was kind of one. And then the other one you may remember from years past and you've been around us for a few years is this notion of the instrumentation and getting all the digital controls synchronized. Remember this is a pretty complex plant. I'm happy to say all the instrumentation has, even though it's complex, has really performed terrific, so we haven't had hardly any problems with that.","With respect to lignite in and ash out, I think we've \u2013 part of regular start-up practice is to iron out all the bumps in the roads. And I think you may remember from all the conversation in the past about lignite dryers and all those other stuff, we solved lignite in. Ash out, we've kind of had two different kinds of problems. This one recently is a really different one.","Okay. The outages that we took in the fall were related to clinkers and what they dealt with was ash that was melted due to some temperature excursions as we brought the plants into and out of service. We think we've solved all of those problems.","This latest problem really dealt with the notion that on Train B, I guess, we started and stopped it about 7 or 8 times and this is \u2013 they use the word agglomeration. But if you can imagine, there are vertical and horizontal pipes in this plant. And what we have seen is, when you turn the plant on and off, the fluidization inside the circulating fluidized bed boiler stops. And whatever ash is in there will sit on a horizontal pipe. And what they think happened in this latest run was that some of the ash just started sticking to each other.","When a plant is running and the velocity of the ash is going through the plant, it doesn't stick and it performs exactly the way you want it to. They think it just stuck together, so they're going to take the plant out of service, get it out, start it up, and they think it'll run fine.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","So is that like more of a \u2013 I guess, obviously it's an engineering issue, but it's trying to predict kind of the right heat to use?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. But we've done that. That's the early problem and they've solved it. And one of the advantages \u2013 just to remind you, this thing runs at a lower temperature, therefore less O&M. You don't have clinking and scaling and its operational performance should be better than a conventional boiler.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. I think I understand it. I guess we can talk more about it next week. And then \u2013 up in Boston and then up...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, great.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Yeah, that was exciting. And then...","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Although we don't want to go to Boston, you know.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. It's all right; I wish the Giants got that far. And then on the Vogtle side, so just to understand, I guess you have this letter of credit. And I have gone over it with IR, but I just want to make sure that I'm clear on it. This letter of credit which is $920 million or $930 million and your portion of that is 45% of that. That expires every July, is that right, and then needs to be renewed? Is that correct or is that incorrect?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","I believe that the banks are in the position to renew it automatically every year. If they fail to renew it, there's a 60-day notice on the bank's part to let them know they're not going to renew. We have an option if they do that and that Toshiba can't replace the LOC to draw on a 30-day notice. So we're in \u2013 we think we're in good shape around all that.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","So there doesn't have to be a default, which is right now why \u2013 when you would draw that if it...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","It's kind of one of the conditions. I wouldn't call that a default, but if the...","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","No, no, that wouldn't be a default. But if they fail to, so obviously, you know, forget them pulling it, right, the bottom line is if there's a default or something like that, you obviously could draw on it.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And just recall the reason they had to post these letters of credit is because their financial condition fell below a certain level. So long as their financial condition is at that level, they have to provide LCs or they're in default.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Right, but if the banks decide to pull it, you within that 30 to 60-day window of when you're informed, you can actually draw on that letter of credit; is that correct?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's it.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Correct.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Right, okay. And then do the banks I mean, I guess who's money is it? Is it Toshiba's money or the bank's money that is that 900 and whatever million dollars?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It's our money at that point, pal.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","No, no I get that part, I'm saying but right now. It's a bank guarantee, right? Right the banks go over Toshiba, right? You get the money.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","It's the bank's money. It's the bank's money and Toshiba is a creditor to the bank.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Right. And is there a scenario where the banks just decide not to pay you or is that kind of out there farfetched type thing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's pretty farfetched, my friend.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. Okay. And I think that's it. I actually \u2013 in a bankruptcy situation for Toshiba, how does your fixed cost contract kind of work? And I guess the letter of credit stands; so that's fine, but do you just become a creditor or is there any type of backstop in that type of scenario?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We have the LCs and other than that we're an unsecured creditor.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Got it.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We just think that's really unlikely.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","The bankruptcy or the unsecured creditor part?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","The bankruptcy part.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Thank you, Andy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hello, Tom, how are you?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Awesome, hope you're well.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You got that Hinkley yet?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hey, man, I'm working on it. I'm working on it.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You're working on a few things I guess?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. No kidding.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","One of the Form 8-Ks a few months back talked about sustainability of nitrogen with Train A and Train B simultaneously. I assume that's been fixed or you wouldn't be this far?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes. Here is the deal; we need supplemental nitrogen in order to basically start up both trains. But we have the technical performance profile that once we are in operation, we don't need to supplement nitrogen that we are able to run the process and the nitrogen on site is sufficient.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And back to energy efficiency. You keep seeing usage per customer decline. Does that plateau or is technology kind of keep moving the bar on you enough that this can go on for several more years?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","That's an interesting question. And I think you'd have to talk about different markets. In the commercial market, we think it may have a little ways to go. In the residential market, it's just a matter of change-out of appliances and how many new multifamily units are in place versus single-family homes. So that ebbs and flows over time. And I think we're seeing a slowdown in construction of apartments at this point. And whether that morphs into more single-family homes, we'll just have to wait and see.","But there is kind of a natural slowing down of this effect as you replace out HVAC and lighting, particularly in the commercial sector. So my sense is the rate of decline would slow to zero eventually. It will approach a limit as inefficient equipment is replaced with efficient equipment. And then your profile of growth really goes to two things. One is adding more customers and the other really goes to things that relate to electrification. Whether that's electric transportation or whether it's feeding the digital economy, I think there's lots of reasons why we should expect organic growth of electricity to be reasonably resilient going forward once we account for energy efficiency.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","I think another driver, Paul, would be the fact that bonus \u2013 remember, 50% bonus was passed at the end of 2015 and companies are seeing low interest rates. They're using bonus. The payback on these kinds of improvements get to be pretty quick and so that may be driving some of it in the near term.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So bonus is \u2013 has acted to accelerate the swap-out?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Well, that's a theory. Whether they're actually doing that or not, I'd just say that it certainly would be a piece of low-hanging fruit.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","And just to contrast with my earlier comments about tax benefits like that impacting capital decisions, Art's right. Bonus and those kinds of things typically impact short-term flexible investment decisions, discretionary capital as opposed to long-term committed capital that we would incur with a plant or a transmission line.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Makes sense. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yes, sir. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Big Dan, how are you?","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Good. How about you?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Awesome.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So, have a couple questions; first around Vogtle. The CapEx schedule that you lay out on slide 17 for new generation there, does that reflect the updated schedule you got from Westinghouse or did you not have time to reflect that yet?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","No, no change for that yet.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Remember, we're still reviewing what they're doing and it's going to be a month and a half or so before we kind of get to the bottom of what they're suggesting right now. So there is a lot of uncertainty with respect to their schedule right now in terms of our agreement to it.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. I assumed that, but I just wanted to verify that that was the case. In terms of Units 3 and 4, I was wondering if you could let us know what the current critical path items are for each of those units.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yeah, still the critical path goes through the nuclear island, so on Unit 3, we are now morphing beyond just concrete and rebar. And we're moving into installation of equipment. We installed the reactor vessel. I guess in the near term on Unit 3, we're looking at steam generator installation, at least the first of two. We'll begin the reactor coolant piping. And then I guess a little later this year, we'll get the second steam generator in and then the initial energization of Unit 3 site is a big deal and that should be on the horizon as well.","Unit 4, we're still putting module walls into the reactor vessel of Unit 4. They're still pouring concrete in certain areas and setting those last modules inside the containment vessels or containment buildings so that that's just part of the process of where they are, and I think Tom showed you the productivity of that unit compared to Unit 3. So we're well along our way in Unit 4.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Are there any of those key components that have yet to be delivered on site or do you still have some that are being fabricated off site?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","No. No, no, no. Everything is on site as part of \u2013 as well as I'm aware and I believe it's just getting concrete to a certain level and making sure that you're doing things in an orderly manner to support the new placements.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. One other issue I was wondering about is I know SCANA in one of their filings mentioned a concern they had with the ITAAC submittal process and the amount of support they were getting from Westinghouse related to the timeliness of that.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah. I mean, we love our brothers and sisters in SCANA. I would argue that our perspective on that is a wee bit different. We have led the charge in working cooperatively with the NRC to put in place something called UIN, Uncompleted ITAAC Notices.","If you can imagine what an ITAAC is, it's a checkout of a system in the plant. And what we've done is essentially when you finish a system like in your house, the HVAC, you'd submit it, the test and the test results, so it's the process of the test and the result of the test and it would be checked off as completed.","We saw \u2013 this is some years ago in ICU, (79:33) this is one of our big risk factors. We saw a bow wave, if you will, of these ITAACs going forward. And so, what we did was worked with the NRC to develop this UIN, Uncompleted ITAAC Notice procedure, where we will essentially outline and get the NRC to agree to the process, leaving a blank for the ultimate result of the test.","Now, what that does is take an enormous amount of review off the forward calendar and puts it right here, so that when we get the test, fill in the blank, boom, check the box and move forward.","The other thing that we have been working on lately is consolidating some of the ITAAC. So what's the number, 892 or 75 per unit? We think we have a way forward to knock off 200 of those per unit, just by consolidating some things that otherwise look duplicative. So I think we've made a lot of headway there.","If you go back and listen to what I've said now in these past few earnings calls, if ITAAC is one risk factor and productivity is the other, I would put the productivity risk factor at this point as much more important than the ITAAC risk factor. Still bears watching; we're still all over it. I would just pay more attention to productivity than ITAACs at this point.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Good. Then the last thing I wondered is, if you could just give us a feel for on your financing for 2017 that you have on page...","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Yes, I believe there's a slide in the appendix, Dan, that outlines our 2017 financing plan.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Yeah. Just wondering, though, for those numbers, are those pretty much spread throughout the year for the various units or if it's some more front loaded or back loaded?","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","I don't have the schedule in front of me, but we can get that information to you.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. That's all I had, thank you.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thanks, Dan, always good to talk with you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question coming from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello again.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, just one last question. With the liquidated damages being triggered by nuclear fueling at the end of the year for 2018 for Unit 3, 2019 for Unit 4, has the proposed delay from Westinghouse, do they exceed that? Is this something that's going to be negotiated as you review whether to accept or reject the changes that they've proposed?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","I suppose you could negotiate anything, but right now, that schedule would trigger liquidated damages.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","It would. Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","If you believe that schedule, sure.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. I just wanted to make sure about that. All right. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","We've made no contract amendments at all.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. And then liquidated damages was specifically applied to the owners' cost, right, the $6 million a month plus $30 million of financing?","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","No, it's just one way to think about it. It's not applied to anything; it's just cash to us.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Just in general, okay.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Thanks.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question coming from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Hello, Ashar. Great to hear from you.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Hi, how are you doing? I just wanted to \u2013 one thing that was written in the 10-K, if I can just read it out and if you can just help me a little bit on the definition of one of the words.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, please do, yeah.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Mississippi Power has evaluated various scenarios in connection with its process to prepare the 2017 rate case. And Southern Company and Mississippi Power have recognized an additional $80 million charged to income, which is estimated minimum probable amount of the $3.31 billion of Kemper IGC costs not currently in rates. That would be recovered under the probable rate mitigation plan to be filed on June 3, 2017. Tom, can you tell me \u2013 I don't know, can you guide us a little bit? What is this minimum? Is it 10% or 15%? I was trying to get a better sense of this minimum language that you used, which corresponds to this $80 million write-off.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me tag team it. The first thing is let me make sure you get the context right. So the traditional rate plan is something that we will file. The rate mitigation plan is designed for us to hit as precisely as we can the revenue requirements that were contemplated under the original certificate. And I've said it to you all before, not only does the rate mitigation plan give us the economics that the Commission thought they were getting when they certificated the plant, they will have a plant that operates under this original certificate, so that's kind of the big picture. Part of that rate mitigation plan assumed essentially not asking for recovery of depreciation, amortization on the 15% uncovered portion of the plant.","Arthur P. Beattie - The Southern Co.","That's correct. Ashar, you'll remember the plant was certified at a 100% level to be entered into agreement to sell 15% of it. That was undone since, but the rate mitigation plan that we will file basically does what Tom outlined, it recognizes that we won't charge Mississippi for the depreciation\/amortization of the 15% of the asset for five years. And that's what the $80 million represents.","Ashar Hasan Khan - Visium Asset Management LP","Okay. Thank you so much. That clarifies it. Thank you so much.","Thomas A. Fanning - The Southern Co.","You bet. Always great having you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Aaron Abramovitz - The Southern Co.","Just want to say this. I know we have Vogtle and we have Kemper, but if you kind of look past these headline items, we're at a really important point here, so we tried to stress in our October presentation. You think about our earnings that we're forecasting forward as we said in October, $290 million to $302 million with a midpoint of $296 million, when you look at the operating companies that are state-regulated, something like $278 million of earnings of the $296 million are coming from those entities. And that does not account for the long-term contracted bilateral contract that has served us so well for so long and have a risk profile similar to those state-regulated entities.","I think from a risk-return standpoint and therefore a value accretion standpoint, Southern Company has lengthened, strengthened and improved its value position going forward.","We'll get Kemper started up. We'll go through the regulatory process. We'll continue to make progress on Vogtle. And I think from an investor's standpoint, we're as good as we've been in many, many years. We appreciate your attention today and we look forward to talking with you soon. Take care. Operator, that's all I have.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).","And also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday October 29, 2014. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Tucker","","Thanks Scott. And welcome everyone to Southern Company\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Art Beattiem, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning, as well as the slides of this conference call. To follow along during the call you can access these slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Tom Fanning.","","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. In a few minutes I will provide an update on our financial results as well as our sales and economic outlook. First I would like to begin with an update on construction activities at Kemper County and Plant Vogtle. ","First, an update on the Kemper County IGCC project. Last night, we filed our latest 8-K and monthly PSC report for the project, which reflect a quarterly increase in cash comps of $418 million consistent with in-service date in the first half of 2016. As you recall the 8-K, we filed approximately one month ago reflected $88 million in increased non-schedule related cost and indicated that the schedule was likely to be extended into late 2015 pending a review by the project team. ","Since that time, the project team has worked through their latest comp analysis and identified additional non-schedule related cost of $20 million for a total of $108 million. The remaining cost increases totaling $310 million can all be attributed to the extension of the schedule by 10 months. We currently estimate that each additional month will cost $20 million to $30 million and our increased forecast assumes the high-end of that estimate. ","As a reminder major construction is essentially complete and the combined cycle portion of the plan has been in service since early August. Is then performing extremely well running at a capacity factor of 80% and has an Equivalent Forced Outage Rate or EFOR of less than 1%. That compared to an industry average for combined cycle of closer to 4%. With the combined cycle producing energy for customers, it\u2019s important to note that the schedule extension we have disclosed before the gasifier and gas cleanup systems of the facility. ","These two complex systems are key long-term value drivers for customers as the ability to utilize Mississippi lignite along with the capture and sale of byproducts like CO2 are both key to delivering reliable low comp energy to customers for years to come. Within this long-term value in line the project team has recommended and we have agreed to adopt a more methodical approach to operator training, control system design, start up activity and integration of the gasifier and gas cleanup system. ","I am proud that work that has been done in Kemper. There is a very clear distinction between the outstanding quality of work on site and our frustrating difficulties as far with accurately forecasting cost and schedule. We will continue to work diligently towards the successful completion of this project and once we get past start up integration, which no doubt will include many challenges, we expect that facility to benefit Mississippi power customers in a safe and reliable manner for decades to come. ","Meanwhile, progress continues towards in-service dates for Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Unit 4. Our most recent major milestone was the setting of the CA05 module for Unit 3. This module provides structural support and also serves as a safety barrier within the containment vessel. The 50 foot tall lower ring of the containment vessel has also been set in Unit 3. ","While the critical path and with it most of the external focus has been on the Unit 3 nuclear island. The progress around the remainder of the side is noteworthy as well. For example, the units 3 cooling tower is now more than 500 feet tall with less than 100 feet remaining to build. We have also made significant progress on the unit 3 annex building which is critical for the initial energization and testing of the plant electrical components.","Meanwhile, at the unit 4, the first concrete poured inside the containment vessel and we\u2019ve completed the foundation for the 500 kilowatt transmission switch yard that will serve the entire site. Upcoming near term milestone for unit 3 include the reaching of Elevation 100 in the nuclear island bringing the initial shield building module to ground level where they will serve as the foundation for the remainder of the shield building. We also expect to see unit 3 cooling tower completed before year end.","The CA01 module, which is schedule to be placed during the first quarter of 2015 is the largest structural module to be placed in the nuclear island and we\u2019ll have the unit\u2019s steam generator. Unit 4 also has several upcoming milestones including structural module CA04 and CB65. Fabrication of CA20 modules for unit 4 is currently underway with on-site assembly expected to begin in the next few months. As you know, the latest Vogtle construction monitoring report was filed in late August. More recently, Georgia Power filed its direct testimony in support of the VCM11 filing.","Hearings are scheduled to begin November 05th, with the commission voting next February. Obviously, a project of this magnitude comes with many challenges including among these is the ongoing pressure on the construction schedule which we believe is still achievable. We will continue to work through issues on a daily basis and are very pleased with how the project has proceeded thus far. Through the combination of diligent oversight and quality assurance effort, our fixed and firm EPC contract and the robust regulatory process, we believe we\u2019re well positioned for success with this project going forward. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Art, for a financial and economic overview.","Art Beattie","","Thanks, Tom. For the third quarter of 2014, we earned $0.80 per share compared to $0.97 per share in the third quarter of 2013, a decrease of $0.17 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we earned $1.88 per share compared to $1.41 per share for the same period in 2013, an increase of $0.47 per share. Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 include after tax charges of $258 million or $0.29 per share and $493 million or $0.55 per share respectively related to increased cost estimates for the construction of Mississippi Power\u2019s Kemper County project.","Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 include after tax charges of $93 million or $0.11 per share and $704 million or $0.81 per share respectively related to the Kemper County project. Earnings for the first nine months of 2013 also include an after tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding these items, earnings for the third quarter of 2014 were $1.09 per share compared with $1.08 per share for the third quarter of 2013 an increase of $0.01 per share.","Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 excluding these items were $2.43 per share compared with $2.24 per share for the same period in 2013 and increase of $0.19 per share. A primary driver for our 2014 third quarter results was more normal weather compared to the same period in 2013 resulting in an increase of $0.06 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Third quarter 2014 earnings also benefited from retail revenue effects at our traditional operating companies as well as increased industrial sales and residential customer growth.","Revenue increases were largely offset by increases in non-fuel O&M expenses. A more detailed summary of our quarter-over-quarter drivers is included in this slide deck. Economic activity and sales growth in our region reflect a recovering economy and for the remainder of this year, we anticipate continued improvement with expected quarter-over-quarter GDP growth of 3% for both the third and fourth quarters of 2014. Despite recent volatility consumer confidence has improved more than 10 points since 2013. ","","Residential building permits are 11% higher for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 and initial unemployment claims are now close to prerecession level. Additionally, the monthly U.S. economic policy uncertainty index is trending toward prerecession level. In summary, the economy is recovering but still considered fragile and subject to event risk. This economic data is reflected in our sales results. Industrial sales were up nearly 5% in the third quarter of 2014 compared with the third quarter of 2013 with expansion across all major segments. For the first nine months of 2014, six of our top 10 industrial segments show sales above prerecession level while our housing related segments are recovering strongly but remained below their prerecession marks. ","Segments with the strongest growth include primary medals up 12%, transportation up 7% and housing related segments of stone, clay and glass and lumber up 7% and 6% respectively. Expectations for continued strength in the industrial segment are upbeat. This supported by an expanding ISM manufacturing index which indicates increasing levels of employment production inventory new orders and supplier deliveries. Also our surveys of top industrial customers continue to indicate that a majority expect continuing strong product demand from their customers for the next six months. ","Meanwhile, we have a normal residential and commercial sales remained relatively flat in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2013. Residential customer growth continues to recover with Southern Company reporting positive customer additions during the third quarter of 2014. But the first nine months of 2014, we have added more than 21,000 new residential customers about 4,000 more than expected. However, weak household income growth continues to challenge growth in customer usage. We continue to see evidence of strong economic development activity within our region. One recent example is the announcement of the new Army Cyber Command headquarters at Fort Gordon near Augusta Georgia. Consolidating U.S. Army cyber security functions for the first time and bringing nearly 4,000 jobs in East Georgia. ","And just this morning the Navy Federal Credit Union announced it will be adding 5,000 new jobs in Pensacola, Florida. These are in addition to the 2,000 new jobs announced in May of this year. The first 2,000 jobs will be in place by 2016 and the additional 5,000 are expected to be in place by the early 2020. Other economic development and announcements include a tractor manufacturing adding 650 jobs to an existing facility in Hall County Georgia. A carpet manufacturing facility expansion that will bring 350 jobs to Cartersville, Georgia and a new medical research and development facility bringing 300 jobs to Metro Atlanta. So overall, our economic development pipeline remains robust in on a positive long-term trajectory. ","Now turning to our fourth quarter estimates; an EPS for 2014, our fourth quarter estimate is $0.37 per share this implies a year-end result of $2.80 per share excluding charges related to Kemper which is at the very top of our annual guidance range of $2.72 to $2.80 per share. Included in our fourth quarter estimate is the initial earnings impact of the Solar Gen 2 project recently announced by Southern Power. This transaction with first solar will increase the size of Southern Power\u2019s growing solar portfolio by almost 30%. ","The 150 megawatt project, which will be 51% owned by Southern Power and used to serve a 25-year purchase power agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric is expected to be completed in December of this year. In addition to the Solar Gen 2 project, Southern Power also completed a transaction to purchase 90% of the 50 megawatt Macho spring solar facility in New Mexico earlier this year. And recently purchased options to acquire development rights to approximately 100 megawatt of utility scale projects associated with Georgia Power Advanced Solar initiative.","As you know we previously provided a forecast of placeholder CapEx for Southern Power of $1.4 billion over the three year period 2014 to 2016. With the projects we have either already completed or for which we have options to purchase, we have already utilized about $1 billion of that estimate. Given our recent successes in the solar power market and the availability of additional projects, we will reassess our placeholder forecast for Southern Power in conjunction with our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call in February of next year.","One final note, we do not anticipate issuing additional new equity beyond what we had planned to issue even with the recognition of additional costs for the extension of schedule at Kemper County. We will continue to assess on a consolidated basis, the level of equity capital needed to maintain our financial integrity. This will be a function of many factors including potential changes to our CapEx forecast and potential extension of bonus depreciation.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Tom Fanning","","Thanks, Art. As Art indicated we were having great success at Solar Power, in fact Southern Power\u2019s accomplishments are only one example of our growing reputation as a national leader in the development of solar resources. Notably in Georgia, in addition to the approval of Georgia Power\u2019s advanced solar initiative that Georgia public service commission recently approved 3 rate-based solar project totaling approximately 90 megawatts at Forts Benning, Stewart, and Gordon. ","These projects are expected to be the largest solar generation facilities operating on any U.S. military base. In addition, the commission recognized a memoranda of understanding between Georgia Power and the U.S. Navy to build a 30 megawatt solar facility at Kings Bay Submarine Base near St. Mary\u2019s, Georgia. Final approval of this project is expected soon. In recognition of these initiatives, which could increase Georgia Power solar resources to nearly 900 megawatt by 2016, Georgia Power was recently named the 2014 Investor Owned utility of the year by the Solar Electric Power Association.","Renewable energy is just one component of our commitment to build the nations only truly diversified generation portfolio, one that makes use of new nuclear, 21st century coal, natural gas, renewable and energy efficiency. Our ability to balance field diversity benefits customers directly by helping keep prices well below the national average. Add to that our industry leading reliability as evidence by our 2014 summer peak season E4 of 1.6% compared to the most recent 5 year national average of around 9%. Likewise, our transmission and distribution businesses have performed superbly with our rate of service interruptions and the duration of those interruptions at historically low level.","As a result it\u2019s no wonder, our four traditional franchise utilities scored the four highest customer satisfaction ratings among national peer utilities this year as measured by our annual customer value benchmark survey. I\u2019m intensely focused as the entire management team here at Southern on startup activities at Kemper County.","Despite those challenges, the Southern company franchise is in a good shape as it has ever been. Our customer focus business model with its emphasis on outstanding reliability exceptional customer service and prices well below the national average remains the cornerstone of our business and a key driver of long-term value to Southern company shareholders. We are now ready to take your questions. So operator, we\u2019ll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","","So can we talk about the CapEx forecast a bit?","Tom Fanning ","","Sure.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","So on two fronts, one on Southern Power, you've indicated you're doing really well finding opportunities to put that placeholder capital to work, a lot of it in solar, and that you're going to reassess whether there's an opportunity to spend more basically. Do you see a big enough opportunity to put capital to work at a good enough return that it could move you outside of the 3% to 4% earnings guidance range that you've laid out for people for 2014 to 2016 or is it sort of it pushes you around inside that range? ","Tom Fanning ","","Hey Greg, let\u2019s carry that conversation next February. I\u2019m a little hesitant to get into kind of revising the forward forecast let\u2019s just say that we\u2019ve had a better than expected rate of success in solar so far using up all of our kind of allocation for CapEx there in solar and I think the presumption is that there is opportunities to do more with respect to the long-term forecast we\u2019ll handle that in February, that\u2019s okay.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Let me ask the question a little differently then. The assumption inside the current guidance was that you'd spend the $1.4 billion? ","Tom Fanning ","That\u2019s right.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","And earn some sort of reasonable return on that capital; is that fair? ","Tom Fanning ","","Yes. ","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Okay. My second question goes to everything you're seeing on the economic development front, seems like things are going really well. The industrial load has been great. At what point do you reassess your 2015, \u201816, \u201817, \u201818 CapEx forecast in light of any sort of upside changes in the economic forecast? Or do you think that sort of sufficient to have the infrastructure you need to keep it with the way the economy is ramping? ","Tom Fanning ","","I think I got it, Greg. As we look forward I think you are talking about new capacity additions I assume. ","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Yes, or increased distribution spending because of housing formation? You name it. ","Tom Fanning ","","There will be some minor affects there but new generation still in the mid 2020s, at least under the current economic forecast that we have. So it would be on the line so more distribution growth to serve some of these customers maybe some transmission but it wouldn\u2019t be a lot at least into the current forecast. ","Art Beattie ","","Yeah Greg, the other thing I would just add. There is enormous swing variable and that deals with where EPA is going to come out with this Carbon rule 1-11D find their own calculation this is EPA\u2019s own calculation not ours. They would have projected to build over 5,000 megawatt to combine cycles by 2020. Now I don\u2019t think that a practical assumption not only given the lead times required to build combined cycles plus considering the state of natural gas infrastructure in the Southeast. So my sense is these things are going to have to be bit more fluid than what EPA is assuming. But depending on how that rule turns out you could see a swing in CapEx also. ","Operator","","And our next question is from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","","Tom, I just want to make sure I'm not reading too much into your comment on Vogtle, but you made a comment about ongoing pressure on the construction cycle, but you guys thought still manageable. Did I hear that correctly and can you just maybe give a little more color on what's going on that's putting some pressure on timelines? ","Tom Fanning ","","Yeah I guess it\u2019s out there. SCANA has had some announcements about schedule and cost and all that and we have not I think that\u2019s an obvious kind of conclusion people who make. I would just point to the fact without commenting on SCANA\u2019s situation, that we have a different side and different state of construction and certainly a different contract. Our contract is essentially a fixed price turnkey arrangement. And while there is always a challenge with respect to cost and schedule. I think given the commercial status of our contract with Consortium, we have been assured by Consortium personnel that in fact we can\u2019t meet the schedule. It\u2019s always a challenge it\u2019s subject to change, but we believe as we sit here right now that we can go in service Unit 3 at the end of \u201917 and in service unit for at the end of \u201918. ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Then just kind of against the Kemper rule of thumb, the $20 million to $30 million a month for the delays, would that not apply in the Vogtle situation because of the contract you guys have in place? Or something..","Tom Fanning ","","If there were a schedule delay that would be owners cost. Essentially overhead cost with our own over site. But certainly the cost involved with housing workers and whatever other time related cost was really for the account of the Consortium. ","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you. And then I guess one last question, on the solar development, we've talked to you about the yield co\u2019s before, but can you explain where you guys are taking advantage to win some of these projects rather than relative to the yield co's? You seemingly have reasonably low cost of capital at this point? ","Art Beattie","Yeah Dan this is Art Beattie. We feel like we have got a lot of the relationships with the developers out there. we have done a lot of projects with the likes of First Solar, the one thing I know is when they do a deal with us that we are going to be able to close, and we are going to be able to in an efficient manner. We have access to low cost capital with decent credit rating. So we still feel like we can be competitive. ","This recent transaction that we did with First Solar was a little different than some of the others. We basically bought not only 51% of the operating asset but basically the vast majority of the tax benefit. So we are finding different ways to get deals done and this was what we thought was be a win-win for both Southern Power and for First Solar. And we think that both parties are pretty happy with. ","Tom Fanning ","","The other thing I will just add here too is, you know that we have been very careful about not over expanding on our tax appetite we have found ourselves in a substantial carry forward position that we have always kind of been very careful about tax advantaged investing. I think given that we do have a tax appetite and that we have a strategic kind of reason for being in this space. It gives us a very nice niche in this market that seems to be evolving and I think we tend to be a pretty attractive partner for that reason and all the reasons Art just mentioned. So, my sense is there will be some more opportunities ahead.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","","The $1.2 billion of CapEx you're able to spend with the tax credits coming back to you, with bonus depreciation, would that affect your ability to monetize some of those benefits, if you think about perpetuating this level of investment or can you manage bonus and these tax credits? ","Tom Fanning ","","One can only say what\u2019s going to happen with balances and move things slightly through time but even if you get some enormous sense of new tax benefits it won\u2019t move us but a year or so. So, does that shift your IRR curve? Sure but it\u2019s not in a substantial way. Nothing like multiple years of carry forward.","Operator","","Our next question is from Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital, please proceed.","","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","","A couple questions, the first one is on the fourth quarter earnings estimate. Can you remind us what would drive the $0.11 decline year-over-year? ","Tom Fanning ","","Well, if you go back and look at our fourth quarter earnings let\u2019s say 2010 forward there is a pretty good variability in our level of earnings in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s subject to where we are at the end of the third and that\u2019s true this year. We plan on making up for what year-to-date been and under spending of our non-fuel O&M and as you know we traditionally do that in the last half of the year and in this case a lot of that will be done in the fourth quarter. So that is the main driver in the reduction and year-over-year earnings from 2013 and the fourth quarter to 2014 and the fourth quarter.","I think we did a presentation at one of the investor conferences where we were able to show that over the past 10 years or so we\u2019ve hit our range 100% of the time we can\u2019t ever guarantee that going forward but that is our past history. You know that for a long time we\u2019ve had a practice of being able to structure our O&M spending in such a way that we essentially account for through optionality, variability in weather and through a reasonable variability in economics sales forecast coming to fruition and et cetera. My sense is we\u2019ll continue that practice of matching in the fourth quarter here.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Okay. Second question is on the dividend, a lot of folks are raising their dividend more than historical rates. I just wanted to get a sense as to what you're thinking about the dividend, especially as it relates to a GAAP payout ratio going forward. ","Tom Fanning ","","So, we\u2019ve been very consistent with this one of the Southern mantras here is regular predictable sustainable increases in earnings per share which provide the regular predictable sustainable increases in dividends per share. For a long time, now we\u2019ve been on a $0.07 per year increase in the dividend per share rate while this ultimately is the decision of the Southern Company Board, management is in a position where we believe very strong we\u2019ll be able to continue that trajectory for years to come.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Okay, just double checking. Thank you.","Tom Fanning ","","Thank you.","Operator","","And our next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank, please proceed.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","","Could I just ask you to maybe clarify how the accounting will work on the solar deal in the fourth quarter and perhaps quantify what the impact on the quarter is? ","Art Beattie","","Yes, Jonathan, this is Art. Basically the solar gen 2 project will I believe provide about $30 million of net income on its own. And\/or so and then there are some other year-over-year effects that will mitigate that number somewhat for Southern Power along with the other expenses at Southern that I talked about on the earlier call that will get us to our 237 estimate. But we can give you more detail on that if you like offline Jonathan but basically it will be 51% the cash flow will go to us. and we\u2019ll get the vast majority of the investment tax credit.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","In terms of timing of how that gets booked, is that all being booked in Q4? ","Tom Fanning ","","That\u2019s our expectation.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay, so the ongoing number will be less, but $30 million is the right number to use in the quarter? ","Tom Fanning ","","That\u2019s approximately correct.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Tom Fanning ","","But there are lots of details in there around basis differences and how much -- so we can give you more detail on that.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Second topic, I was just curious, can you shed a bit more light, Tom, maybe on what you said the project managers have sort of recommended and you have agreed that you should sort of be more methodical about how you work through startup. Is there a practice, this is obviously a significant delay in a large number. Can you give us more color as to what exactly you're going to do differently and how you've arrived at that determination? ","Tom Fanning ","","Sure and I just want to tell all you investors of Southern that I'll bet you I'm more frustrated than you are and I certainly empathize with any of you that are frustrated. I can tell you that we have had very direct candid tough conversations with the team on executing on this. What the more methodical approach deals with is essentially an extended schedule that relates to training. Recall not only is this an Electric project but it is a chemical and gas process project. There is specialized training and given this is first of a kind technology we are doing kind of a more methodical approach to moving people through all facets of any kind of operational requirements with respect to running this plant. The second we talked about a lot over time and that deals with recall you talk about how complex the integration of this project is and we often use kind of the example of in order to get a combined cycle plant to work you need to integrate three system. This plant has 13 systems. ","One of the efforts that we are spending a lot of time on in order to do it well is essentially the digital control equipment and the simulator associated with that and so as you would think about the challenges involved in integrating these 13 processes we are following that through on the simulator as well and that also extends to training so that when we get the digital control equipment exactly the way we want it and the simulator the way we want it and the training the way we want it, we will have moved people through again an extended process whereby when we reach the intended in service date, we're ready to go. And I would point to when we turned on the combined cycle it has worked beautifully. Did we have to fine tune it a bit? Yes but overall when you look at the performance of that part of the plant, fantastic and when we looked at whatever we've completed on construction and the pressure testing we've done so far and everything else, the plant has performed well. ","Our intention is to do start up so that at the end of the day this plant operates as well as it can when we put it into service. The final piece of all of this is adding a little more time into the startup processes. The packages, the turnover packages, the execution of the checkout of the systems, the analog to this and the nuclear world would be the I-tax. In other words, as we go through the various turning on the various systems before we get them all to run together, just being very kind of methodical there also allowing more time. So I guess what I'm saying when you consider training all personnel and all facets of this plant when you consider the integration of the digitized system and the simulator when you consider the time involved in going through the startup processes of all of the segments, we have added more time in there. We've had a lot of tough discussions about this like I say. I'm frustrated with it. I think this is the best of our judgment and I think this approach is painful in the short-term but I think it gives us the best long-term results that will demonstrate the value of this technology.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","","So I am following up one thing you just said. It seems you might be suggesting that you don't really have the training protocols established to your satisfaction yet so you've got to do that and then implement the training or is it just. Am I understanding that right?","Tom Fanning ","","No. Here is the deal. In this world it\u2019s called PSM. It\u2019s called Process safety Management and that involves when you basically it\u2019s a regime under which procedures have to be followed. When you turn the plant on an introduce gas live into the turbine. That is the whole new regime. There are no right lifelines about how you must operate. And I think we have brought in a lot external consultants here people that worked at Chevron, people that worked at BP and other places. And I would say here again our approach rather than trying to push something that might qualify we are taking more time to do more in terms of training, so that everybody is essentially up to speed on all facets of the plant. For example, one thing you could do is just train certain people of certain aspects of the plant. We're taking this methodical approach to make sure that we have the best kind of foundation for a safe, reliable operation once we go in service. ","Operator","And our next question is from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc, please proceed.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Good afternoon. You indicated that, despite the latest Kemper write-off, you don't think you need to backfill equities, protect the balance sheet. Where are you finding that upside? ","Unidentified Company Representative ","Well, we and as I said in the call or in the script we continue to look at it on a consolidated basis. We, as you know we\u2019ve contemplated issuing 600 million of equity this year we\u2019re on very we\u2019re on track to do that we may in fact issue just to hear more than that this year but we\u2019ll see. So at the end of this year we should be in fine shape and as we move forward it\u2019s going to be a function of our need for capital which is also a function of our CapEx is also a function of accelerated depreciation opportunities and those things. So, it\u2019s difficult for me to sit here and be premature to say I\u2019ll need X amount of equity in order to do this. But based on our plans we assumed no new issuances of equity in \u201915 and \u201916.","When we look at the plans that we have in place we already had shall we say placeholder\u2019s room for additional problems elsewhere for example at Kemper or somewhere else. What we\u2019re seeing at Kemper fits within those thresholds and within those thresholds we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll need to issue new equity and what Art is referring to is one of the big swing that I would see is what if Southern Power has lots more opportunity that could give rise depending on the way tax law changes that could give rise but we already had contemplated we had placeholders, room so that the kind of equity issuances we talked about and really turning off equity was already provided for, we\u2019re well within where we think we need to be from an equity capitalization standpoint. ","The last thing I\u2019ll just mention here when you look at our profile in terms of reducing CapEx compared to our rather immense invested capital base we started trailing off cash flow and one of the things we suggested in the past still is in front of it as an option and that is reducing our equity capitalization as a percent. So, my sense is we\u2019ve room.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","So you're just kind of eating into the head room that you built in conservatively? ","Tom Fanning ","That\u2019s the way we plan.","Art Beattie ","And things continue to evolve, so we\u2019ll evaluate that and will assess it as we move through that.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Kind of going out on a limb here given your conservative DNA, would you guys ever think of an alternative financial structure like a yield co? ","Tom Fanning ","Boy, I did in one of the recent conferences I did a presentation on yield co. and I don\u2019t think they make sense for Southern, if you\u2019re interested in the something other than the reader\u2019s digest version I would be glad to give it to you, I don\u2019t think they make sense for us.","Operator","And our next question Is from line of Michael Weinstein with UBS, please proceed.","Michael Weinstein - UBS","A lot of my questions already answered so I just want to follow up on the throwing off of cash flow, you're saying that might also be Vogtle and Kemper together will eventually be cash flow producers so that you might be able to withstand a little more of a lower equity ratio until they do? Is that basically what you're saying? ","Tom Fanning ","That\u2019s correct, it would be after those are operational and that was start depreciating those assets is going to be throwing out a lot of cash.","Michael Weinstein - UBS","Also, is there any consideration of other than solar in Southern Power, such as biomass opportunities or any opportunities in other forms of renewable energy? ","Tom Fanning ","Yes, sure. One that we looked at in the past it was way back in my time as CFO, those of you who have been around that long may remember we used to have a placeholder in the plan for like $250 million of wind and we used to push around on all the different wind deals. The reason we\u2019ve always been bullish on solar is that it had direct application into our service territory and so therefore we loved especially PV solar we want really bullish on thermal solar. When we thought about wind especially looking at the portfolio and that time frame we were of the opinion that the risk return profile really didn\u2019t fit us given some of the technology challenges and some of the other challenges that industry was facing.","What we\u2019re seeing now is a more technology certainly in term of technology it seems like there is two or three kind of really mature ways to harvest wind energy and recall also that wind doesn\u2019t make sense really in the Southeast except for maybe offshore. We don\u2019t the climatology so my comment on wind as a potential would be that I think we\u2019re finding that area to be a bit more suitable and we would most likely do with other than the South East so that\u2019s something we could do. We\u2019re very happy with our biomass deal in Texas. That was the largest bubbling bed technology in North America, I guess it\u2019s a biggest in the world, that was the biggest biomass plant in North America when it was built and unlike Kemper, we built that on time, on schedule and it worked beautifully. To the extent there are other biomass facilities available we will certainly look at that. They come and go on our project development with given all the environmental issues it\u2019s kind of hard to get those done, but we certainly consider that. and let me just lead you with all this discussion about renewals for us gas is still the priority. We think we are preeminent competitive generator in gas and we have just the terrific track record of executing there. ","So what if EPA comes forward and they start requiring more shutdowns of coal and more gas to be build we are going to be very well positioned to help executing that. ","Michael Weinstein - UBS","Thanks . Do you have any kind of estimate as to what the timeline of EPA is at this point where they stand on the issue? ","Tom Fanning ","You know that, I guess it was yesterday, there was kind of a new alert out they were willing to rethink some of the points of their proposed rule. But what I understand right now, and this is very premature, we're just kind of understanding what's in that latest update is that they are going to try and maintain the same schedule of responses and final rule making. So my sense is you're going to see responses by around December 1 and you're going to see a final rule next summer.","Operator","","And we have a question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. ","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hey Tom. Two questions for you. One, can you give a little insight, it\u2019s been a couple quarters now in terms of the big spread between what you're seeing in weather normalized industrial demand versus what you're seeing in weather normalized commercial and residential demand. That's one question, second totally unrelated. Can you give an update at all on the litigation between you and the Consortium members regarding some of the I think it was like $900 million or so of potential cost related to Vogel? ","Tom Fanning ","Yes you know what I'm going to do? Give you a top answer on the first one and let Art dive into more detail there. The second one on the litigation I think I can hit pretty easily and I don't mean to sound glib here but there's just nothing much to report. We continue to have very productive discussions. We need with Phil Asherman and Danny Roderick and members of Toshiba regularly, there are portal meetings, we get along, we solve problems but you know there's two ways to think about how those discussions occur. One is between us and the Consortium and the other is within the Consortium they have obligations. And so it's not just as simple as us and them, it's them and them. ","So that's about all I can say on that. There's always been a big difference in weather between industrial and residential and commercial. Industrial sales just aren't very weather sensitive. Certainly, the residential and commercial are. Art do you want to give more color there? ","Art Beattie ","Michael as I said in the script, a lot of its driven by household income and the lack of growth in household income. If you look at the split of residential between growth in customers and growth in usage. Growth in customers was actually positive 0.7% I think on a year-to-date basis and growth in usage has been a negative 0.6 so I mean we're flat. So that's an indication that our people are sitting in their kitchens trying to make decisions on how to make the budgets work and so we're feeling the effects of some of that. ","I think you're also seeing that true say at Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart lowered their sales forecast growth for the same reason. Another factor to think about on a residential side. When we look at new customer additions about 35% of our new customer additions are in multi-family homes rather than single family homes. Our existing customer base is about 20% multi-family. So, multi-family additions use about 70% of the energy of a single family home so that could be another factor, so because we add a new customer it doesn't mean that they are all the same. ","These are factors that we have to think about as we move forward and try to predict where sales are going to be. ","Tom Fanning","I gave some comments on this. I did this morning just a bit and that very kind of interesting exchange with Joe Kernan, but I think the Fed and economists all over have over shot where we thought we would be on GDP recovery and I think that it's because you have a bit of a false signal, a false positive on improving unemployment when you consider the jobs that are getting there, they are getting filled, are lower paying service related jobs compared to the past when you consider more part time labor accounted for when you consider disaffected workers. Household incomes are generally flat and you know, that's what we've got to look to. The people that are having flat incomes making tough kitchen table economic decisions as Art said aren't spending money. And I think they have this kind of psychological issue of dealing with the recent recession and something that I don't think is all bad is savings rates are up so people are consuming less. I don't think that's all bad. We don't need an economy and peoples income leading on the edge I actually kind of I\u2019m okay with where we\u2019re on that but that seems to be I think in my opinion a more important statistics than household incomes than say unemployment.","Art Beattie ","","Yes, I was going to comment on the commercial and unless you want to ask a different question.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","","No, that's exactly where I was going.","Art Beattie ","","Okay, the commercial side it\u2019s still flat slightly negative if you do the splits there customer growth is up but usage is down and so what we see in Georgia particularly around Atlanta was an overbuilt market especially in the retail side and especially in the office side and it\u2019s a little different. The parameter is doing great but the center city, there is a lots of vacancy. So, it\u2019s a different story depending on where you go but the other thing on the retail side is the what I call the amazon.com effect is the fact that more shipments are being made by mail and by the internet I think they doubled since 2009 and so you\u2019re seeing that effect on the vacancy issues around the retail space.","Tom Fanning ","","When Art said parameter he is referring to a highway that runs in a ring centrally around Atlanta it\u2019s about 60 mile long highway around Atlanta. So that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing some commercial growth rather than the internal kind of core part of city. ","Operator","","And our next question is from line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar Financial, please proceed.","","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Financial","","Hey, good afternoon guys. Just a couple of follow-up questions, actually, on that last point. I might have missed it, but when you talk about some of these factors that are underpinning the changes in residential and commercial demand, can you talk about what maybe your look forward is for 2015? I know you do a lot of work on your numbers and a final kind of demand not expecting that kind of a number, but what you sort of see in your forecast and in your budgets up to this point and how that's going to impact 2015 versus 2014 so far?","Tom Fanning ","","Again it\u2019s going to be a function of the economy as it is always is and we don\u2019t want to get out and find out where we\u2019re going to be February, we\u2019ll talk more robustly in February when we have our revised numbers but if you go back to the 2014 forecast for \u201914 to \u201916, it was roughly a 1% growth maybe a little stronger than that as you move through the year \u201916. But again we redo that every year and we\u2019ll comment more on that in February about our new look.","Art Beattie ","","And without regard to the future, this year our plan was based off 0.7% retail sales and it\u2019s one. So we are reasonably above where we thought we\u2019d be, so the question that we\u2019ll answer in February is what\u2019s our forward guess on that.","Mark Barnett - Morningstar Financial","Okay, and just a quick one on Southern Power. Obviously solar has been in the headlines and you've had some nice progress there so far this year. I'm just wondering, given where in generation economics have moved for a lot of people this year, have you seen any interesting gas projects that you'd be considering or is that sort of lower priority at this point? ","Tom Fanning ","","Yes, we actually think there are some on the shelf I want to kind of lay low on that but you want to know a really good kind of target audience with respect to those projects are co-ops and municipal utilities. We have a great track record of serving them here in the South East I would bet you 40 years ago they were kind of the enemy and now they are great partners and they\u2019re wonderful people and we\u2019ve got along great and produced I think really good business results for them and us and I think our reputation is proceeding us and I think we have around the United States more prospects to do more such deals with other co-ops and communities in the United States away from the South East.","So I think there will be some opportunity there. And I\u2019ll tell you something now, you know that outside of South East in the United States may presume that we\u2019re in the so called organized market. Our business model will remain the same long-term bilateral contract, credit worthy counter parties, no fuel risk no transmission risk. That\u2019s the way we like to do it.","","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley, please proceed.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","","Hey gentlemen. Most of my questions have been covered, I just wondered if we could discuss the Sanmen nuclear project in China and just generally interested in your thoughts on progress there, lessons learned for the US, or sort of as you look at execution risk in China, how's that project been going? ","Tom Fanning ","","Well, we\u2019ve had people that live in China that kind of work around that site and we have teams of people that regularly visit sandman to bring back those learning. I would bet you I don\u2019t know I would love to see what buzz\u2019s opinion is here something like up that you 60% of what they do is applicable to what we do where we\u2019re different than them is in the degree of automation particularly in welding practices, they tend to use a lot more manpower, we tend to use a lot more automation. And it worked pretty well. We kind of believe that they are going to be in service sometime later 2015 and as they commissioned that plan that will be very helpful. The other thing that has been helpful to us is they are dealing with some issues with the vendor for example the design of reactor cooling pumps. And I think as they resolved those problems that will out benefit. ","Operator","","And our next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed. ","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Just a couple questions, Art, can you remind us, through the nine months, how much equity you've issued so far this year?","Art Beattie ","We're right at $500 million through September 30.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And if I heard right you may cross the $600 million by the time the year is over?","Art Beattie ","","Yeah, but it\u2019s not completely significant. ","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Then, can you also remind us, on a normalized basis, what's the O&M base we should be thinking about for you guys and the growth rate of that going forward?","Art Beattie ","Yeah, Ali, I think what we outlined for this year is that we would be in the if you look at total Southern, we would be just over 4 billion and I think we're going to be very close to that number if we spend what we're going to spend. And as we move forward I'd say a 3% growth rate, maybe 3% to 3.5%. Two of that would be just 2% and 2.5% just core and the other 1% would be related to environmental, environmental O&M. As we start up all these environmental projects that adds a different layer of O&M to the core amount. ","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. My third question, can you remind us why was Southern Power down so significantly quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter? Related to that then, the Solar Gen 2 project in the past, Tom, you've talked about the run rate of net income for Southern Power around the $170 million a year level. How should we now think of that with the portfolio changes going forward?","Art Beattie ","","Yeah, Ali I think what I said and we actually checked this in preparation of this call. I think I gave a range to about 145 to 175 somewhere around there. and I think we are going to end year at the upper end of that range. ","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, and why was it down?","Tom Fanning ","","It was benefited from solar revenues this year, additional plants and things versus last. But there was some particularly high depreciation expense related to new plant and service. There was a slight change in the methodology went to a units of production method of depreciation that also caused the delta. And then we did some major outage work at one of our units where we had to really catch up on some accelerated retirements just due to the accounting issues related to that one particular plant and that really drove a lot of expense into Q3 of this year versus last. That's why it's down quarter-to-quarter.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Tom, to be clear are you suggesting that, call it, $170 million to $175 million run rate, is that a good run rate going forward as well or does that change with the Solar Gen 2 and other activity that you've done there?","Art Beattie ","","So if I recall kind of the forward curve, Southern Power in the near term had a decent run rate kind of $160 to $170 something like that. It certainly picks up what you have is kind of a filler. We have contracted capacity that picks up again at a certain timeframe. So at the end of the decade it goes up into the 200. But for now I think it\u2019s a decent assumption and certainly we will update you in February on that. ","Operator","","And we have a question from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. ","David Paz - Wolfe Research","","Okay, this is David Paz for Fleishman. Just a quick question, Tom. Going back to Vogtle, do you expect a -- is there a timeline for when you get a new schedule for post-2015? ","Tom Fanning ","It's under consideration right now. They are rebaselining and what they're working hard on is see what you always kind of work on here is you have heard that they have had some challenges out of their Lake Charles facility and so the Consortium is working hard on mitigating whatever challenges that they see, certainly with respect to the schedule, and they're obligated to meet that schedule to us via the contract. So one of the things that we meet with them on when I say that Asherman and Roderick and the pertinent members of Toshiba get together. It is to give us the new schedule, right now they know that they have a commercial responsibility to fulfill and so we look forward to seeing how they\u2019re going to do that. So that\u2019s kind of it I don\u2019t have a time frame in which we will see a new schedule but I can tell you that as a topic of current conversation.","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP Capital, please proceed.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital ","","Good afternoon, Tom. Earlier during the call, you referenced your tax appetite. I'm wondering if you can both kind of, in a cumulative sense, give a sense of what your cumulative tax appetite is and kind of like the options in which you are looking at in order to optimize that and whether the optimization of that balance has been considered as part of your forward views that you have provided us in the past?","Tom Fanning ","","Yes, when you say tax appetite a lot of it varies on bonus depreciation or not so that the numbers going to swing around the good bit absent kind of an extension of bonus depreciation our number would imply and investment appetite of over $2.5 billion. So to the extent you get bonus depreciation path it could subtract, it is current form, we got current bonus depreciation extended again. It would probably take away about 1 billion of that over 2.5 billion number and I\u2019m being very general here because there is a lot of uncertainty with respect to how these things manifest themselves but that would be a decent working number for you to think about.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital ","In terms of the way to utilize a lot of these tax deferrals and everything like that, usually, I think, you were implying earlier about taxable income creation or acquisition in order to optimize utilization of various renewable credits and those types of things. Can you expand a little bit on that if I understood you properly or how we should think about that?","Art Beattie ","","I\u2019m not sure Vedu I mean what that basically says is in normal circumstances Southern Company is a tax payer and our kind of cash tax rate on our booked taxes there are cash tax rate is reasonably high. To the extent, we get bonus depreciation or something else that serves to reduce our effective cash tax rate I think right now this year I\u2019m going to say our effective cash tax rate is around 7% or 8%. So there is still a little bit of headroom. It\u2019s those kinds of factors so my sense is when you look at our normal business we don\u2019t have significant tax deferral items in play. So letting the system run on its own, we become a full tax payer.","That gives rise to the $2.5 million, $2.6 billion investment opportunity given the extension of investment tax credit or solar and wind and everything else to the extent that moves from a 30% number to a 10% ITC number than your investment opportunity your appetite actually goes up. So there is a lot of swing here, what I try to do is outlined what I like is caveman math. Under current circumstances without an extension, you\u2019re somewhere in the $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion investment opportunity range. Obviously that can swing. ","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital ","And these are all cash items? This doesn't affect what we end up seeing on the GAAP financials? This is all cash flow items in terms of how these things swing, correct?","Tom Fanning ","","Well in term of calculating tax appetite that\u2019s right ultimately there is a book income impact such as Art described on solar gen 2.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital ","Okay. If next week or whatever, with the elections, if the republicans get the Senate, you're particularly talking about bonus depreciation extension or whatever. If, like I said, if that comes to pass, given the folks you've talked to, what do you think is reasonable or feasible that could occur that's relevant to your business that you'd like?","Tom Fanning ","","That\u2019s just pure speculation, my sense is you\u2019re going to see some sort of extender bill whether the democrats hold the Senate or whether the republicans get it. Whether it\u2019s a permanent, whether it\u2019s a two year, whether you\u2019ll extend that kind of the provisions related to wind and solar, my sense is whichever party get the Senate, you\u2019re going to see something that would be my guess. It may also depend on how comprehensive they want to go and therefore what the timing will be of the implementation of that.","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed. ","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","","Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to hit on Kemper, two questions. One is, you gave a risk of a schedule each month, the cost that shareholders could bear. I just want to know, is there any regulatory risk associated with that seven-year settlement that the gasifier's not in service. Was that part of the settlement that had to be in service by a certain date? The second question is, when do we get through the forest here? Is there a point in the schedule where the gasifier goes online and that's when we could exhale or another point in time where we know the write-offs are behind us?","Tom Fanning ","","It does not include anything for the settlement the grand proposal we are working. And certainly there is risk in that, I can\u2019t say that there is not. What I can say about the settlement is we continue to have productive discussion but I can\u2019t predict the outcome of those discussions. What was the other thing you wanted?","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","I really wanted to know .","Tom Fanning ","","Yes. When are we going to get first gas through the gasifier? When is that?","Art Beattie ","","That\u2019s scheduled till July of \u201915. ","Tom Fanning ","","Summer of \u201915. That will be a big deal. What we will provide you in EEI is essentially a chart that will layout kind of three club, segments of risk. One is all the milestones that we need to accomplish before we get gas to the turbines and then kind of once we get gas to the turbines we are the milestones following that. And like again I think we are looking at summer of \u201915 for that event to occur. That\u2019s kind of what I would say in a broad sense we will have more detail for you actually we will hand out that thing in Dallas.","Anthony Crowdell - Jefferies LLC","Just lastly I guess with the gasifier. Anything about seven-year global settlement. How much of that I guess what\u2019s in rate base or what is been recovering rates it\u2019s related to the gasifier.","Art Beattie ","","Well we have rates in place an 18% increase associated with 2.4 total capital investment that we earned on. There are securitization bonds that take us to $2.88 billion. Those are all represented by rates. It\u2019s hard to say if you wanted the segment out what is currently part of the combined cycle, I would say something like $900 million to a 1 billion somewhere around there of the $2.88 billion. Round numbers again. ","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of Kit Connelly with BCG. Please proceed.","Kit Connelly - BCG Partners","Lot of my questions have been answered. I thought I'd inquire about your interest in the pipeline business. As you say, you burned a lot of gas in your power plants, utility in Southern Power and a couple of the big companies around you next year into Florida and Duke and Dominion have talked about the Atlantic coast pipeline. How do you look at the pipeline business as far as your forward book of business goes?","Tom Fanning ","","So it\u2019s interesting. We actually go through a process of pretty disciplined pretty rigorous here whenever we think about different companies or different lines of business. And frankly we just covered this with our Board a week ago and our offset kind of strategy Board meeting. And the way I tend to think about it is kind of the red, yellow green chart. So green for us would be an integrated regulated electric utility with make move and sell elements within that. Yellow, to me, would be things like a gas pipeline. It has kind of a similar risk return characteristic, it is not necessarily something we know in depth and that we decades of experience with like we do with others. But it is certainly something we would consider. You are right when people think about Southern Company we will run into it from time to time. People think we are big coal company. We are still big but rest assured that Southern Company I think is the third largest consumer of natural gas in the United States. Gas is a part of our future and that will become increasingly important. And so therefore it make sense for us to consider gas oriented investments along the way. So Kit it\u2019s something we absolutely would consider. ","Operator","","And we have follow-up question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed. ","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Thanks, Tom. Quick question for you, on page 12 of your handout, you show your Q3 gas combined cycle capacity factors up to 76% versus 68%. Non-PRB is up 44% versus 40%. Where do you see your capacity factor for gas going into the fourth quarter? Where do you think you'll end up for the year? Because it's been quite a turnaround as natural gas prices have come down, right?","Tom Fanning ","","Yes, I mean Greg you\u2019re all over it. I think just depends on kind of what the weather hold and everything else but we\u2019re seeing sub $4 gas right now you\u2019re going to see pretty strong performance by our combined cycle fleet over time. At some time -- .","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","","Do you think you'll be at or above the 66% capacity factor you ended the year at last year at the rate you're currently running? ","Tom Fanning ","","Pure gas.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Thank you.","Tom Fanning ","","Depends on a host of factors but yes if you asked me to bet, I would bet.","Operator","","And our next question is from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital, please proceed.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Just to make sure, because I think when you said this, I didn't hear it correctly. I meant that stuff came out right when it was being discussed, but what did you say about rebaselining in the consortium? Did you say you were expecting them to come back with rebaselining?","Tom Fanning ","","Sure, the question I think I forget to even ask if somebody asked the right question and that is in fact the consortium SCANA talks about and they are coming back to us with schedule that will meet our in service date. And in talking with senior management we believe that can be done. Now in order for that to be done they\u2019ve had a lack of performance particularly in Lake Charles facility. And so you\u2019re always in this position of mitigation. So to the extent Lake Charles doesn\u2019t perform the way you wanted it to what they\u2019ll do is essentially farm business out as they have to Newport News to make sure that we get the material and the documentation I think was pointed out appropriately in a suitable manner. So, the consortium is working hard to mitigate whatever operational challenges they have, that is always been the case, we believe they can mitigate to the extent they preserve in service date. That\u2019s all that is, that\u2019s an ongoing process.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Again, from what I think you're saying is, either you stay on schedule and costs to stay on schedule could potentially go higher to stay on schedule or costs could kind of not go up as much and the timeline would slip. Is that kind of the way to think about it? ","Tom Fanning ","","Well here is the way I\u2019d think about it. You get into, they\u2019re going to provide at the schedule that mitigate any problem they have so that they can abide by the contract we have which is essentially a fixed price turnkey contract. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that they try to issue change orders to that effect but whether or not we accept the change orders depends on what cause the delay or whatever. If it is their own performance it\u2019s for their account, if it is because the NRC did something which may then do something different then that would be a changed order that we would likely accept. Right now, we believe that they are down to deliver a plan in service and we believe they can deliver it and we look forward to they\u2019re meeting their obligations under contract. And I guess we have good constructive conversations with these folks. ","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","When do you think you should hear from them and then us hear from you? Would that be in the fourth quarter or would that be some time in 2015? ","Tom Fanning ","","We\u2019re having conversations with them right now and I think the other thing I\u2019d try to suggest I hope I wasn\u2019t too obscure when I did it. I was talking about the consortium in respect of the commercial dispute and I said it isn\u2019t just between us and the consortium, is there an effect is a my words but there is a relationship an accreditor agreement, whatever, there was a sharing agreement within the consortium among them between Westinghouse and CVI overwritten by Toshiba. So, to the extent there are commercial obligations that the consortium have to fulfill they have to decide at partners, how they\u2019re going to fulfill that. That really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with us. It\u2019s those issues which have to be worked, which complicates the delivery to us of our fully mitigated schedule. We continue to work constructively on it and we look forward to that happening in the next few months or so. I can\u2019t guarantee what date in which we will get a fully mitigated schedule but we\u2019re working on it.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Got it. Then just back on earlier question as well, same subject mat, going back in time, so on the original dispute between Westinghouse, CVI, and your group, what exactly is going on there? Were there actually talks going on or is there an arbitrator or are we kind of just in the court stage that's going to take a while? Can you give us any update on that? Because I guess CVI seems to suggest on their call, again, it was just kind of a one liner, that things hadn't moved along anywhere on that or were not going.","Tom Fanning ","","Well look what I can say is this. We are in litigation mode, so in other words we are going through periods of discovery. We are taking depositions. I can get you detail on when we think hearings will begin and all that of course that\u2019s all subject to what judge ruling on certain matter whereas the venue is Augusta Georgia. That\u2019s kind of where we are. At the same time parallel activity we are having settlement discussions with the consortium and they are very cordial. So this is not bomb throwing and missile launching, this is good constructive talk. And I am trying to convey that it\u2019s not just us and them it\u2019s them and them with us. ","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","","I understand. So basically, there are talks going on, but at the same time, parallel the court process continues. It could take quite some time to play out. Is that fair? ","Andy Levi - Avon Capital ","","That\u2019s right sure. And we would love to settle but we are also prepared to go to litigation as we get a settlement that is desirable for the benefit of our customers.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital ","","Just as far as the costs for that or any rebaseline, just to understand, that's something that would be negotiated, it sounds like, based on your contract between CVI and Westinghouse? And your position right now, at this stage, is that you're not willing -- well I don't want to negotiate on the telephone. But basically we should expect those two to be paying that difference, at least it's your position at this point, is that kind of fair? There's some big dollars involved.","Tom Fanning ","","My only point is, it\u2019s pretty clear then public knowledge there been some challenges with material coming out of Lake Charles. As a way to help mitigate their challenges and fulfilling their obligations under the contract, they've enlisted some subcontractors, for example, Newport News. To the extent they are able to perform my sense is they are going to be able to hit our in service states and everybody is going to be happy with the ultimate outcome that\u2019s where we believe we are right now. ","Andy Levi - Avon Capital ","","Just kind of the dollars involved and whose going to eat those dollars and CVI doesn't have as much flexibility, obviously, as Westinghouse or Southern Company or people within your group. ","Tom Fanning ","","Andy I think we need to. You know I am not going to go there. ","Andy Levi - Avon Capital ","","No, I understand. It\u2019s interesting to see how it ultimately goes out. Okay thank you very much. I will see you soon. ","Operator","","And our last registered question at this time with Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please proceed. ","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","First, I just have a clarification on what you said a little bit ago about Kemper. I think you mentioned July 2015 is when you're looking for syngas to go to the gasifiers, is that what I heard? ","Tom Fanning ","","That\u2019s the good general date I would get that precise but yeah. ","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So is that the same as first syngas production that you were talking about on your slide from last quarters?","Tom Fanning ","","Yes. ","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, then I also had a couple clarification questions on your Vogtle construction update on page 5 of the presentation. I'm just trying to get a sense of timing of when you know, for the near-term items and those you expect to occur in 4Q? What's the timing kind of related to the cooling tower? Then for Unit 4 for the MCD65 is that before year-end or how should we think about that?","Tom Fanning ","","Dan I think the CA1 module is first quarter next year. We should complete the cooling tower in the fourth quarter of this year. And then as far as Unit 4 we certainly should do in the fourth quarter offsetting CA04 and CD65. I think that\u2019s where we are. ","Tom Fanning ","","Yeah the way I would read that is near-term is kind of year-end. ","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then on the horizon is early next year? ","Tom Fanning ","","Yes. ","","Tom Fanning ","Operator anymore questions?","","Operator","At this time there are no further questions. Sir are there any closing remarks. ","","Tom Fanning ","Yes sir. Thank you all for being on the call. Thank you for being loyal shareholders. I am disappointed with our schedule and cost performance. We are just rigorously directed and improved our performance there I think we put a methodical schedule that we can hit. I\u2019m going to put intense focus and make sure that we do adjust as well as we can. The project team there understands the intensity of my focus. ","Other than Kemper, I would say that the franchise is operating just as well as it ever has when you look at customer service, you look at reliability, you look at safety, you look at just kind of how we\u2019re delivering value to the communities we\u2019re privileged to serve this company has never been better.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, January 29, 2014.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Tucker, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Tucker","Thank you, Kenitha. Welcome to Southern Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Tom Fanning, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company and Art Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In addition, we will present non-GAAP financial information on this call. Reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure are included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call. To follow along during the call, you can access these slides on our Investor Relations website at www.southerncompany.com.","We have a full agenda for today\u2019s call. We will begin with the brief recap of 2013 operational highlights followed by an update on the Vogtle and Kemper projects. We will then discuss fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial and sales result. Finally, we will update our forecast of sales, capital spending and financing which support our earnings and dividend forecast for the next few years.","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.","Thomas A. Fanning","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. 2013 was a year of operational, regulatory, and financial challenges for Southern Company and apart from our difficulties with Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County, Mississippi, we achieved tremendous success in meeting these challenges and what was arguably our busiest year ever from a regulatory standpoint. ","We\u2019ve done unprecedented level of activity across all four states. The results in each of our jurisdictions demonstrate that our continued focus on the customer helps support constructive regulatory engagements.","In Alabama, minor adjustments were made to the RSE mechanism that will serve customer interest well. In Georgia, the PSC approved another constructive three year agreement for Georgia Power. Georgia Power also completed another successful integrated resource plant and in the third regulatory proceeding in Georgia, the VCM Eighth Report was approved unanimously, bringing the aggregate total of costs approved for plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to $2.2 billion with no disallowances.","In Florida, the PSC approved the settlement agreement reached between Gulf Power and all of the interveners in its rate case. And in Mississippi, we reached a settlement in January 2013 that paved the way for Kemper-related rate increases in 2013 and 2014 and a subsequent rate increase in 2015 for the securitization of certain project costs. Combined, these steps are projected to stabilize the impact on customers before it lead seven years. ","Even with the backdrop of the regulatory proceedings in all four of our retail jurisdictions, Southern Company and its four traditional operating companies occupy the top five spots in the 2013 Customer Value Benchmark survey, which compares our customer satisfaction ratings with those of peer utilities.","We experienced the best year in our company\u2019s history in terms of transmission and distribution reliability, continuing a trend of improvement over the past decade. And most importantly, we completed our safest year ever. ","For the third consecutive year, Southern Company achieved a new all time record low, in recordable incidence rate and also saw reductions in loss work day cases and preventable vehicle accidents. This continuing commitment to protecting the health and safety of our workers is a key component of Southern Company\u2019s workplace culture and I\u2019m extremely proud, of our most recent results in this area. ","Let\u2019s now discuss our two large construction projects; progress at the Vogtle 3 and 4 construction site is remarkable. We\u2019ve included photos in our slide deck that indicates how much the site has changed over the course of 2013. Also included is a recent photo of CA20, the auxiliary building modules for the Unit 3 nuclear island; the photo which was taken inside the onsite module assembly building showed all of the structural walls assembled, prep work continues to ready this module for a placement in the nuclear island next month.","We overcame early issues with the sub module fabrication and documentation in Lake Charles Louisiana. Our demonstrated ability to work through challenges is indicative of the strong collaborative relationship we have with Chicago Bridge & Iron and Westinghouse as well as a testament to the rigorous oversight we have in place for this project. ","As we look ahead to 2014, the site will continue to change shape in dramatic ways. Product risks on the Turbine Island and Cooling Tower for Unit 3 will continue and the Nuclear Island for Unit 3 will really start to come out of the ground. After the placement of CA20, we are scheduled to see two of the containment vessel rings stacked on the bottom edge, the large CaO-1 module placed inside the containment vessel and the six foot thick walls of the Nuclear Island will come all the way to ground level.","Progress on Unit 4 will also continue and a year from now, we expect that many of the units components to be further along than Unit 3 is today. We are also pleased to announce after an extensive negotiations on loan guarantees, Georgia Power has delivered its documents to DOE. Now there remain a series of steps that must be taken prior to closing and while we can\u2019t disclose final terms, we do believe that our earlier estimate of approximately $200 million of present value benefits is still representative of the loans value to customers.","Combined with other customer benefits including production tax credit, four of which we have qualified after the completion of the concrete basemat pours in the nuclear island, we project approximately $2 billion worth of additional benefits to customers relative to the amount originally certified by the PSC. We will continue to provide more color on these savings and other aspect of the project in the next Vogtle Construction Monitoring report which is scheduled to be filed in late February.","The Kemper IGCC project also continues to make progress and we are still working towards a fourth quarter in service states. During 2013, the transmission infrastructure was completed. The pipelines were all completed and the lignite mine was place into service. At this stage, more than 75% of the piping has been installed and testing of the combined cycle is underway.","In fact, we produced electricity using natural gas throughout most of January, generating approximately $1 million to offset project costs. We will move towards testing of the gasifier in the second quarter, which will mark the first heat up of a gasifier at the facility. The key milestone expected prior to commercial operation is a reliable supply of syngas to the combined cycle.","Recognizing that there are risks associated with start-up activities, we have recorded an additional charge for the project of $40 million pre-tax, $25 million after-tax in the fourth quarter of 2013 to increase the contingency for those risks.","Overall, we continue to anticipate this Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 and Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County will benefit customers with clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy for decades to come.","I will now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview.","Art P. Beattie","Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had strong results for the fourth quarter of 2013, which positively influenced our results for the full year.","For the fourth quarter of 2013, we earned $0.47 per share, compared to $0.44 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the full year of 2013, we earned $1.88 per share, compared with $2.70 per share in 2012.","Our results for the fourth quarter 2013 include after-tax charges of $25 million or $0.03 per share and earnings for the full year 2013 include after-tax charges totaling $729 million or $0.83 per share related to increased cost estimates for construction of the Kemper project.","As a reminder, Mississippi Power will not seek recovery of estimated cost to complete the facility above the $2.88 billion cost cap net of Department Of Energy grants and exceptions to the cost cap. Results for the full year 2013 also include an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013.","Earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2013 include $12 million or $0.02 per share and earnings for the full year 2012 include $21 million $0.02 per shares of an insurance recovery related to the March 2009 litigation settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery, LLC. Excluding these items, earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2013 were $0.48 and $2.71 per share respectively, compared with $0.44 and $2.68 per share respectively for the same periods in 2012. ","Year-over-year results were positively influenced by revenue effects associated with new generating capacity at our traditional operating companies, as well as reductions in interest expense and AFUDC. These positive effects were offset by significantly milder than expected weather. Increased depreciation and amortization and non-fuel O&M expenses. And an increase in the number of shares outstanding.","A full listing of earnings drivers were about the full year and the fourth quarter is included in the slide deck. Our full year 2013 results are perhaps best understood however by examining the response of our traditional operating companies to unexpected headwinds in revenue. Weather in territory was especially unseasonable in 2013 resulting in one of the mildest summers in the past 20 years and rainfall during the third quarter of 2013 was the heaviest in nearly 100 years.","The impact on our base revenues equated to negative $0.14. At the same time retail sales growth in 2013 was slightly less than anticipated. 2013 therefore marks yet another year in which our flexible spending plans have proved an effective in offsetting unforeseen shortfalls in revenue. Each year as part of the development of our financial plan we build flexibility into our operations and cost to serve as a mitigation for revenue variances.","Since 2010 with the economy struggling to recover and with two very mild weather years back to back our O&M spending has been down $500 million compared against our plan helping us to deliver on our short-term financial commitments while adding more than $7 billion in capital assets. All the while, our operating companies have been keenly focused on safety, reliability and customer satisfaction with a view towards maintaining the long-term sustainability of our business model.","Moving now to an economic and sales review of 2013. As expected economic growth in 2013 was slow during the first half of the year, but picked up considerably during the second half of the year. This trend is reflected in our retail sales results which showed improved growth in the second half of the year in all customer classes. For example, industrial sales which decreased 0.7% in the first six months, increased 3.6% during the second six months and 4.8% during the fourth quarter. Bring it as to 7 consecutive month\u2019s year-over-year of industrial sales growth.","So strongest segments included paper up a 11%, primary metals up a 11% and pipelines up 6%, housing-related industries improved as well was with stone, clay, and glass up 9% and lumber up 5%. Commercial and residential sales were essentially flat for the year although we did see a noticeable increase for residential in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, our economic development pipeline remains robust growing nearly 20% in 2013 compared with 2012. Our traditional operating companies are currently supporting some 350 potential projects representing 35,000 jobs and $15 billion in capital investments.","Earlier this month we reengaged our economic roundtable participants. As a reminder, this group consists of several regional economists and executives from a handful of our largest customers. The viewpoints of our roundtable participants are well aligned with Southern Company\u2019s economic forecasts. The momentum experienced during the second half of 2013 is expected to carry over into 2014 with anticipated GDP growth of between 2.5% and 3%.","Industrial activity and exports are expected to be the key drivers with growth expected in chemicals, steel, auto manufacturing and transportation. The housing market is improving but likely has a long way to go before returning to free 2007 levels. Multi-family customer growth is 10% higher is a 10% higher share of our growth than during the pre-recession period, consistent with many antidotes about robust growth in multi-family housing. Building permits were up more than 25% over 2012, but are about 50% below normal levels.","The dynamics of supply and demand in this sector are returning to historical levels which should translate into an increase in single family home starts. This continued recovery of the housing sector will support stronger residential customer growth and further support a rise in activity we saw at housing-related sectors in 2013 with expectations of continued growth in 2014. Much of the feedback we have heard from our economic roundtable participants is consistent with the factors that drive our electric sales outlook for 2014.","Overall, our forecasts reflects 0.7% growth from our 2013 weather-normalized results. As one looks at how the forecast breaks down by our customer class, the expected trend is similar to that of the past several years and that industrial growth leads the way. Specifically, our forecast of 0.7% overall growth assumes a 1.1% growth for industrial sales and about half of that rate for both residential and commercial.","Now let\u2019s focus on the other elements of our new forecast including our three-year projection of capital expenditures and the associated financing plan. Based on our CapEx forecasts for 2014 to 2016, it totals $14.5 billion more notably the forecast reflects a slowing trend in the rate of capital investments by a regulated subsidiary. The main drivers of this trend are expected completion of Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County, Mississippi, the transition to startup activities for Vogtle units 3 and 4 and the expected completion of compliance investments for EPA's MATS rule.","In addition, we have outlined potential Southern Power investments for the three-year period which totaled $1.4 billion. These placeholders represent potential acquisitions or new build capacity projects consistent with Southern Power\u2019s longstanding capacity contract-oriented business model as well as potential opportunities to invest in additional PV solar projects over this timeframe. As always, we will provide the details of any specific opportunities as they arise to an appropriate level of certainty.","Overall, our three-year CapEx total is expected to be $15.9 billion. As we turn to the financing plans for the next three years, there are several things to note. First, the only equity issuances we are forecasting over the three-year periods are the same $600 million in 2014 that we highlighted late last year. This was primarily driven by our desire to preserve our target equity ratios in light of the estimated Kemper loses recorded in 2013. Our current forecast anticipates that all this equity will be issued through our various internal plans. We currently project zero equity needs in 2015 and 2016.","Secondly, we have highlighted the appropriate size and timing for Georgia Powers draws under the DOE loan guarantee program and an estimated total for securitized bonds to be issued by Mississippi Power to fund a portion of the Kemper project. As our cash profile continues to improve over the next several years, our three-year financing plan reflects very little new capital market issuances which may increase with potential new investments by Southern Power.","However, it is important to note that our forecast would still reflect zero equity needs for 2015 and 2016 even if we spend the entire amount reflected in our CapEx forecast for potential Southern Power growth projects. We have provided a more detailed financing schedule in the appendix of our slide deck which breaks these out by subsidiary. All of the forecast elements we discussed sales, CapEx, equity and cash flow factor into our earnings guidance which I would like to share with you now.","First, let\u2019s focus on 2014. As noted earlier, our 2013 earnings per share results of $2.71 excluding charges came in a year of extremely mild weather, heavy rainfall and a still sluggish economy. However, we largely overcame the financial impact of those external factors by demonstrating an ability to mitigate revenue shortfalls with lower spending. ","As a result, it\u2019s fair to consider $2.71 a normalized earnings per share result. Using $2.71 as the starting point, we then adjust for the additional share dilution resulting from the estimated Kemper losses, which totaled $0.07. As we have shared previously, this step change is simply a function of the new shares we\u2019re issuing to preserve our target equity ratios at both Mississippi Power and Southern company. ","Growing 4% to 5% from this adjusted starting point establishes a midpoint for our new 2014 guidance range. To establish a reasonable range for the year, we then add plus or minus $0.04 a very modest 1.5% to this midpoint to set a range at $2.72 to $2.80 per share.","Now let\u2019s transition to expectations for 2015 and 2016. In our last earnings call, we shared a very distinctive trend where we are beginning to see which we are beginning to see in our long-term forecast. More specifically, we highlighted a slowing of EPS growth in the middle of the decade. This slowing is largely a function of a slowing level of capital spending especially relative to a capital base that has grown significantly in the recent years with new generation and environmental investments. ","Combined with the increased operating cash flow associated with these same projects, the rate of growth and total invested capital slows over the next several years. Consistent with these trends, our estimates for earnings per share growth for 2015 is 3% to 4% from our 2014 guidance range and our estimate for 2016 is another 3% to 4% above our estimate for 2015.","As we look beyond 2016, we continue to see potential for the growth rates we accelerate. For instance, we are likely to see new generation investment opportunities later this decade for both Southern Power and our traditional operating companies as well as new environmental spending. ","Additionally, beginning several years ago, we raised our equity ratio by several hundred basis points to preserve our financial integrity during a period of increased construction risk. As our major projects are completed, there maybe an opportunity to unwind some of that equity ratio cushion and maintain our credit quality at the same time; this would also have a positive impact on earnings per share growth. ","In accessing our earnings estimates for 2014 through 2016, we have also reconfirmed our ability that continuing with dividend increases of $0.07 per year is sustainable. While dividend increases are subject to Board approval, the implied payout ratios associated with a $0.07 per year increase are reasonable within the context of our strong cash flow, business model and constructive regulatory jurisdictions. ","So to summarize, we estimate EPS growth of approximately 4% to 5% in 2014, off of an adjusted 2013 base. Our growth estimates for 2015 and 2016 is 3% to 4%. Beyond 2016, we see potential to reaccelerate that growth. Based on our level of confidence, we expect to continue our current dividend growth strategy. As a side note, our earnings estimates for the first quarter of 2014 is $0.56 per share.","I will now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thanks Art. Earlier, I highlighted something that I want to take a minute to reinforce namely our track record of delivering regular, predictable and sustainable earnings along with that, a consistent dividend growth trajectory. ","We are extremely disciplined in how we approach earnings guidance and dividend in Southern Company. We provide guidance once a year during our fourth quarter conference call in January like this one and we have never changed our guidance range during the remainder of the year.","Additionally, our range is tentatively small relative to those of other utilities. On the average, over the past decade, our guidance range has been the smallest relative to the other 19 companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index and as an affirmation of Art\u2019s earlier point on the effectiveness of our spending flexibility, we have been inside or slightly above these narrow EPS ranges every single year over the past decade as we were inside those ranges other than excluding items.","Combined with the fact that we have had sustainable dividend growth every year for more than a decade, even through the toughest of economic times, we believe the risk return profile of Southern Company remain an unmatched value.","We are now ready to take your questions. Operator, we will now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hi, Steve.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Tom. How are you? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever first on a call, surprised. When you look at the growth in 2015 and 2016 in terms of earnings growth, it doesn\u2019t totally match the growth in the capital. That you show 2015, 2016 so 2015 has higher capital growth and it slows in 2016, but the earnings growth it\u2019s kind of consistent, can you maybe explain just those differences?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Art P. Beattie","Steve, are you saying it that earnings growth is slower than the CapEx growth, is that where you are going?","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","","No, it isn\u2019t. CapEx growth in 2015 is about 5% the investor capital growth, in 2016 3.5%, but then the earnings growth for both years are kind of consistent, so the 2015 growth theory year should have been higher to match the capital growth and then slowdown in 2016?","Art P. Beattie","So I get a lot of things going on there, but we\u2019ve got invested capital that\u2019s actually expected to grow, but it\u2019s been offset with some cash as well and Southern Power is also an element of that as well. We include there assume some expansion at Southern Power and some of that could be in the form of new solar projects, which would be more productive to income in those timeframe.","Thomas A. Fanning","And let me add a little bit about on that. So we have often talked about kind of how we put a risk premium on packed advantage investing. It is clear that if we invest in solar projects, we get a big pop to ITC. Those pops are not sustainable. And so in order to provide a growth trajectory, you got to continue to add, add, add and it also adds to your risk of being able to recognize economic value of those tax benefit.","For example, if you had a hurricane, you would spend all the hurricane expenses in the current period and it puts out the economic consequence of the tax credit. What we see in 16 for example is kind of the aggregate effect of not so much tax oriented investing, but returns kind of base load investing at Southern Power, which in the very near term with the little dilute in other words, you don\u2019t earn big return, it\u2019s kind of AFUDC, the return tend to be more of the sustainable matter that we like. So, I think that shape it. The times of investment we are assuming for Southern Power is a big deal.","And then I guess the last kind of point would be that earned ROE is based on average invested capital not year-end. So, you got to account for deltas in going from one year at 4.9 and another year at 3.6, you need to average the consequences. So, won\u2019t have that kind of year-to-year discreet impact.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just the commentary that you made on the right side about the long-term growth drivers.","Art P. Beattie","Yes.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Is that kind of highlight that, my sense in the last call was that growth was potentially growing slow in 16 and 17 and then maybe get better along long-term, are you trying to say or do you trying to understand that look, it is status quo is set to flow, but these other things that could pop up, that could kind of get us back up again?","Art P. Beattie","Yes I think.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","More into the 3% to 4%?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Steve I think that worthy of a little bit of commentary here. Let me kind of illustrate some of the thinking. It is kind of a business as usual take that would say, look 14 is 5, 4 to 5, 15, 16 is 3 to 4 and we will review that three year period. And then we said, based on these assumptions which we believe will come true new generation requirements and in fact the latest thinking is those generation could potentially accelerate.","Remember retiring a bunch of capacity in 15 and 16, so we\u2019re looking at the adequacy of that. Environmental expenditures, Southern Power this whole notion of, are we overcapitalized during this period where we have very little construction risks and one of the charts we showed was a debt chart that shows our debt requirements from new money is very minimal.","So we\u2019re in this cash flow position we talked about before. So the base case is just we foreshadowed which was unusual for us at the last call and we\u2019re showing it now in a lot more detail of a shaping of the earnings per share growth that is, 4 to 5, 3 to 4, 3 to 4 and then beyond 16 we expect it to reaccelerate based on our host of unknown.","There are other things we could along the way that would improve the earnings per share growth rate, but recall as long as I\u2019ve been around here we\u2019ve been a big EVA shop. And by that I mean, we think we create value by the joint function of risk and return and we are exceedingly disciplined in how we evaluate risk. So, for us to accelerate the growth and earnings per share beyond this kind of business as usual day we would be very careful in looking at what happened to our risk profile along the way.","So, there is a host of issue out there. Business as usual depending on how the unknown actually occur, 17, 18 is one of the reacceleration long-term. There are things along the way we have ongoing discussions with the Board, we talk about it and argue with each other all the time, at the other alternative that are available to us during this period. But what we\u2019re showing you right now is our best guess as to a business as usual evaluation.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Thomas A. Fanning","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hi Greg.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Good afternoon guys. Couple of questions. Just with the follow-up to Steve\u2019s question is, if one of the \u2013 one of the factors perhaps affecting the growth rate seems slower than the rate of capital growth, contracts or hedges that you have at Southern Power that are rolling off get our headwinds and sort of our net against what would otherwise be normal growth in rate base earnings in the core businesses or is that not something that\u2019s a factor?","Art P. Beattie","Not much of a factor. Southern Power isn\u2019t throwing at that much. You need to look at just kind of just averaging effect that we talked about. If you take average ROE and therefore the generation of earnings per share it tends to moderate with discrete year-to-year differences in CapEx. That\u2019s where I thought Steve was telling.","So, what you see is just kind of a moderation effect. I wouldn\u2019t attach and then when you add on what\u2019s going on with cash has gone with Southern Power and a variety of other factors. That was causing kind of a delta. Don\u2019t expect in any single year a change in invested capital you got to average it across the couple of years anyway.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Understood.","Art P. Beattie","We don\u2019t expect 490 to equal 49 and 360 to equal 36.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Got it. Two more questions. One is that the amount of Southern Power CapEx that you\u2019ve assumed you\u2019re going to spend over the next three years is significantly a lot worth than the placeholder you have for the\u2026","Art P. Beattie","Yes.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","So last three year rolling period?","Art P. Beattie","That\u2019s right.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","What\u2019s cause you to downsize that? You talked about solar and you talked about baseload. Can you extrapolate a little bit more on what you see as opportunities there and what are the milestones we should look for to get comfortable, but that capital can be deployed at a good IRR?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, okay, so great stuff and actually I got to give you two of those. That about two years ago, you called it circumstances slowing invested capital growth and therefore what happened to earnings per share, like I said, about two years ago, you raised this issue and what we said is, we are working on it.","On one hand, if you think about a normal kind of investment in different portfolio horizon, all we have done is, moved down the growth curve down the risk curve. Our value creation we think is pretty consistent.","Now, what we have in there for Southern Power is based on a reasonable look and certainly part of that look involve the Southeast United States being in a capacity over-supply situation through the rest of this decade.","As you get into the 2020s, you need to have start building into the late part of this decade in order to make sure you have capacity in place. What we are watching right now is kind of a couple of factors and these polar vortex issues are pretty instructive.","If you look around the United States, the United States did fine during these periods of significant load increases, but I think it illustrates the fact that along with the affect of [indiscernible] and the retirement of a lot of capacity is mainly that value of capacity is higher than what we think it is now i.e. the equilibrium point maybe closer then otherwise we suggest. So that\u2019s kind of thing one.","Then two; we\u2019ve also said that Southern Power has turned down business outside the Southeast. And so therefore we\u2019ve been looking closer at other opportunities; Texas, MISO, maybe certain other parts of the United States. We are continuing that. In terms of creating placeholders for those opportunities, my sense is, we have been reasonably conservative.","So, you should just know that Southern Power has a great deal of interest from us and every meeting that we are in there with those, we remind that if they can hit IRR requirements that they have all the capital they need to grow. Capital is not a constraint here and so we are pushing them as hard as we should. In our external kind of presentation, I think we are being reasonably conservative. Said in other way, there maybe upsides, I just don\u2019t want to count on.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Thanks Tom. I taken up a lot of time. I\u2019ll circle back at the end of the queue. Take care.","","Thomas A. Fanning","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital. Please proceed with the question.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","Hey Tom, hey Art, how are you?","Thomas A. Fanning","Hi Jim. Pleased [ph], okay.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","Pleased, okay, glad to slow down there. Couple of questions; I am confused on the bridge between 2013 and 2014, was weather like $0.14 below normal for 13 on a weather normalized basis, so what am I missing there?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, 2013 was down $0.14 below normal.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","Okay.","Art P. Beattie","And most of that was in the summer.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","What you say is what, $0.12?","Art P. Beattie","I didn\u2019t follow your question.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","So the question is, if you were $2.64 on your adjusted base and you are adding back to $0.14, that would take you closer to the $2.78 range, why am I looking at a $2.72 to $2.80 range?","Art P. Beattie","What we have done is normalize the result for our O&M spending\u2026","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","Okay.","","Art P. Beattie","Which really drove it back and when you do year-over-year versus against our plan, you get different numbers. But that\u2019s when we look at our plan, we were down $0.14 on weather, we were probably down about $0.06 on economic growth and offset that basically with our cost control.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","One of the things just speaking about on second question is, deferred taxes in the absence of bonus depreciation; can you give us some guidance as to how you think that line item on the cash flow statement is going to look going forward?","Art P. Beattie","","Well, we still have some bonus in 2013 probably in the $400 million range, is it higher $680 million while I was talking about 2013, 2013 was probably end up for \u2013 close to $500 million, $550 million. 2014 is expected to be $680 million and then beyond that there is not anymore.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","Now that we go\u2026","Art P. Beattie","","Go back to a more normalized wages.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","","And then I guess the last question, maybe this is for you Tom, is you\u2019ve got a little bit of dividend payout ratio creep going on. When you get to that 2019, 2020 range, what kind of payout ratio are you thinking about?","","Thomas A. Fanning","","So it depends on a host of unknowns, but we think it\u2019s south of 75% would be my guess, you\u2019d be in that neighborhood, depends like how what you do, what we\u2019ve indicated here is that with the ranges we are showing you based on how the next three year period goes, I think you are in a 73% to 77% range that\u2019s the way the math works.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","","All right.","","Thomas A. Fanning","","To the extent and remember as you add $0.07 a year, your growth rate is actually dwindling a bit maybe from 3.5% to 3%. So as earnings per share grows again and we think we reaccelerate beyond the 3% to 4% to beyond 4% our payout ratio goes down, it just depends on what year you want to pick, but I would feel reasonably comfortable saying core post of assumptions we\u2019re south of 75%.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","Okay, so then that would include all the benefit from Kemper coming online and then Vogtle coming online which should be a big rate base there, right in the last presentation?","","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, we are adding the rate base with CWIP remember.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","Right.","Art P. Beattie","It\u2019s a big cash flow in fact, it was a big deal, yes.","Jim D. von Riesemann \u2013 CRT Capital Group LLC","I understand the math, thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, sir.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hi, good afternoon.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","","Good afternoon. A couple of clarification, Tom just to go into a little bit more insight into your outlook through 2016, and firstly, for 2014 you had mentioned you guys are budgeting 0.7% load growth. Are you keeping that constant for 2015 and 2016 as well or what\u2019s embedded as far as load growth is concerned in those years?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, we are doing GP.","Art P. Beattie","GDP.","Thomas A. Fanning","GDP growth to 2.5% to 3% kind of over that timeframe and you should use your 50% kind of ratio in round numbers.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, these.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","So, some pickup.","Art P. Beattie","There will be some pickup in 2015, we think just north of the 1% level and then maybe a little stronger than that in 2016.","Thomas A. Fanning","And let me just add one more thing, if you look at the momentum in the second half which we called and then you see what happened in the fourth quarter, the numbers don\u2019t actually drive, in other words the momentum looks stronger than what we are projecting. Here again, we try to be conservative in our estimates, we are off to a good start. The other thing you look forward to is the kind of headlights that are provided by our economic development.","We think that if we had to look at our backlog on a number of different factors, we think we are kind of up 20% on our backlog, in other words we are seeing lots of good things coming into the southeast. One interesting thing you may find is onshore. We are seeing more foreign companies consolidating or adding new facilities in the southeast. We think that\u2019s good labor force, it\u2019s gains and efficiency, a modern production facility, and frankly cheap energy relative to other places around the world. ","I\u2019ve been saying for sometime around the United States, if we continue on the right kind of national energy policy, we can provide America with unassailable advantage in manufacturing, growing jobs, growing personal incomes. I think we are starting to see some of that.","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Ali let me add to that a little bit, we\u2019ve talked about where the normal sales growth last year being 0.4% but we really believe that with all the rainfalls, we don\u2019t normalize for rainfalls, it certainly had an affect on residential sales because the number of days above 100 or above 90 degrees last year was about one day in the third quarter, we normally have more than 100. So you\u2019ve got this weather normalization effect. ","We think we\u2019ve understated real growth here. When I look at residential class, we added 27,000 new customers last year, about 3,000 more than we thought. On the commercial side of the house, we added 3,000 new commercial customers. We are beginning to see the growth in those sectors as well which is the connecting point between industrial growth, residential growth and then following that commercial growth.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Got it, got it. And Art, second question to you and you alluded to that a bit, but off the O&M base that you reported this year. How should we again be thinking about O&M growth, I know there is normalization to be done as well, but can you just remind us how we should think about O&M growth off this 2013 base?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, it\u2019s a good question Ali. In 2014, we estimate that O&M will grow roughly 9% or maybe $300 million or so, about a third of that O&M is for environmental. The rest will be a return to what we call normal operating levels that are supported by the recent rate cases both in Gulf and in Georgia. Growth for 2015 and 2016, we think averages about 3.5% a year, 2.5% of that would be kind of normal O&M growth and then in 2015, you will have to add about another 1% for operations of Kemper County. And so that kind of paints the picture for you.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Absolutely. And last question just to clarify. In your financing plans, you\u2019ve assumed the DOE loan guarantee comes through and you are drawing down on that et cetera. So I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re obviously extremely confident of getting it. But for whatever reason, if that doesn\u2019t come through and maybe that\u2019s 1% or 2% and if that doesn\u2019t happen, does that get replaced by additional debt or would more equity come into the picture in that scenario?","Thomas A. Fanning","No, it would be pure debt. Yes, we would go to the capital markets for the debt. Go ahead. ","","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you.","Art P. Beattie","Yes sir. ","Thomas A. Fanning ","Hey you know what I just feel compelled to throw one more statistic out because it\u2019s along the lines of this questions about growth and everything else. We talked that there is a lot of the fed right now. One of the triggers in the kind of tapering decision that\u2019s going on today is what\u2019s going on with the long-term unemployment rate. Let\u2019s recall that that rate is influenced probably too rosy if you will, by the fact that more and more people are leaving the workforce and it includes people that are moving from partnering from full time to part time. I think a real instruct is kind of statistic that we should be watching now is personal income growth.","We call also there is in this theory that energy efficiency is driving down electricity sales. We haven\u2019t seen that as much of a factor. What we do see as a factor are things like the cost and electricity and personal income growth. And the personal income growth is flat that will have more of a damping effect on sales. So remember to keep all this into account as we come up with our forward forecast.","Thank you. Operator, take the next question.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Hey Mike.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey Tom. Hey Tom and Art, thank you for taking my questions. When you \u2013embedded within your guidance, how should we think about which of your businesses, which of your regulated operating companies are earning their authorized levels and which ones might either be under earning or given what\u2019s in your state-by-state demand forecast potentially doing better than what the authorized is?","Thomas A. Fanning","We pretty much put the challenge on each of our companies to earn at the upper levels of their range. Remember what we got to do is, you compare us against almost anybody in the United States, we do a darn good job of earning our authorized returns company-by-company that\u2019s kind of what you see.","Now there is always a host of factors there in terms of your ability to kind of think about weather, economic growth, O&M levels et cetera. But if you go back and look at history, we challenge folks to get right at the top.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And I hate to do this, and I want to stay in more the near-term meaning 2014 or 2015 because I don\u2019t know the world will change 572 times especially now and 2020, so forecasting out that hard, really hard. But your demand forecast, one interesting thing is you had really strong industrial demand this year I mean, up 4.5% a real positive kind of tailwind and yet in your 2014 guidance, you\u2019re basically saying that\u2019s going to slow a decent chunk. What\u2019s the driver of the slowing there?","Art P. Beattie","So Michael, this is so much fun. We\u2019d beat each other to death on coming up with these estimates. And I tried to allude to this earlier, when you look at the momentum on the second half 3.6% to the second half, 4.8% in the fourth quarter, it looks as if we are like, all I can tell you is we have challenged each other in very significant ways and coming up with this we do bottoms up, we do tops down, we bound to get better economists. Our estimates are a little bit lower than what the fed would say right now. Let\u2019s just say it is reasonable and conservative and we hope there is upside.","Thomas A. Fanning","And one other thing I\u2019d add to that Michael is, as we get a lot of input from our customers and some of our very largest customers rotate productions around the country at various facilities, some of it driven by price, some of it driven by just location of the need or whatever material they\u2019re producing. So, we\u2019re trying to make judgments around those kind of issues as well as we prepare forecast in a reasonable bound of expectation.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","And finally, just real quick on Vogtle, can you I know it\u2019s embedded within the new generation forecast within your capital spending views or outlook, can you just give us some guidance in term or reiterate kind of what the CapEx on Vogtle for at this three-year cycle is likely to be?","Art P. Beattie","Well, hey Michael, if I could just ask to your patience there, we\u2019re going to file VCM I guess 9 and 10 in February. And we\u2019re going to give a great deal of illumination around those statistics when we do that. If you want more general stuff, we can give you that I\u2019m sure, but we\u2019re getting ready to get a lot of detail on that.","Michael J. Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.

Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors, LLC","I\u2019m all right, where did you guys sleep last night?","Thomas A. Fanning","Georgia Power has a condo that\u2019s where me and Art slept. We had people in offices, we had people across the street here at a hotel and Art did file in trusted funds going over the [indiscernible].","Andy S. Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors, LLC","Okay, I\u2019m sorry to hear that Art.","Art P. Beattie","Thank you, Tom.","Andy S. Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors, LLC","Actually, all my questions were answered. I just have one to say that the housekeeping thing. The guidance you gave, 2014, 2015, 2016 is that basic or diluted?","Art P. Beattie","Basic sometimes.","Andy S. Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors, LLC","Okay, and as well about a $0.03 difference. Is that right?","Art P. Beattie","Less than $0.01.","Andy S. Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors, LLC","Less than $0.01. Okay, thank you.","Art P. Beattie","","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please proceed with your question.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","Good afternoon guys.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey Kit.","Art P. Beattie","Hey Kit.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","So, this is a little bit of follow-up to Andy\u2019s question as well again sort of housekeeping but, Art can you just walk through how the dilution adjustment works that so for taken the actual ongoing earnings from 2014, then we subtract $0.07 for future equity issuances, is that what we\u2019re doing there?","Art P. Beattie","Well, that\u2019s what we have in our guidance.","Thomas A. Fanning","Correct.","Art P. Beattie","We\u2019re adjusting to that and we certainly have already reflected that in our forward-looking stuff. But the math around the fully diluted it assumes certain stock option exercises and the shares that would be issued in association with that. and that number can likely move in the future as you move forward. So it\u2019s kind of hard to give you like what we got right now is less than a $0.01 but that could change depending on the number of options that are outstanding.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, just to make sure, the way we got the question before, the way we answered the question was dilution associated with the stock options and other kind of contingent equity that that's out there. There was the other question about the 10% right, and that was associated with equity underlying commitment to maintain natural integrity with Kemper, right, so.","Art P. Beattie","That was clear information.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","So when this \u2013 I guess what I\u2019m asking is, so if when we\u2019re looking at what you actually report say in 2014, is that going to be the guidance is going to be in a range of 272 to 280 less some part of the $0.07 or?","Art P. Beattie","That $0.07 is completely separate that I was trying to illustrate.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","All right ","Thomas A. Fanning","[indiscernible] is separate.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","Okay.","Art P. Beattie","The other dilutionary time as it really associated with the exercise of option.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","Right okay.","Art P. Beattie","So that\u2019s on a big.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","All right, so we\u2019re looking for 270 to 280 and then these other numbers for 15 and 16 that you get out here.","Art P. Beattie","You got it.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","Okay. One last item on Kemper. So, what\u2019s the schedule for upcoming testing and milestones that we should be keeping an eye on.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, the next I think we mentioned in the script a little bit the first fire to the combustion turbine. I\u2019m sorry misspoke. It\u2019s really the first gasifier heat up, which we expect to be sometime in the second quarter and then beyond that it will be the delivery of reliable syngas the each of the combined cycles. And those should be achieve sometime late summer early fall.","Art P. Beattie","The other thing I just want to point out to here just to remind everybody if we had perfect foresight the cost increases we had on Kemper were really kind of entered into the day we send it in to a fixed price agreement with only 10% engineering down that was kind of 2009 and 2010.","The construction of the plant is actually gone pretty darn well and in fact and this latest reporting period we think we are on budget on schedule on construction. And with respect of the additional $40 million, that really is with our best judgment which we could have done nothing and wait until later period with more certainty, but in all of our collective wisdom and we argued about this a lot. We decided that it was prudent to add $40 million to the contingency around cost expected around start-up. So, construction is going great. We will know more about start-up as we get into the June and beyond timeframe.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","Okay. Okay thank you very much","Art P. Beattie","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey Dan.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hi guys. Hey just, on with your power demand looking pretty and mostly high so far this quarter. I was kind of wondering what the fleet dispatch has been and how the plants have been performing and with the running gas you guys see a lot more coal burn coming this year to see this time we calibrate the fleet a little bit.","Thomas A. Fanning","Fascinating stuff. So, let me give you the first good answer is, the systems running great. We are very happy with our reliability. In fact I think we noted our wires reliability the best in history. So, that\u2019s great. The thing that interesting is, is there a change in equilibrium point. We've been saying that may have pushed half at least in the Southeast nearly 2020.","With all these spikes associated with the polar vortex I mean we actually we\u2019re loaded up pretty well. All of our unit that could run are running. So, if it\u2019s a gas units perhaps there is an acceleration of the value of capacity at least in the Southeast.","The other thing is fascinating about this I commented on a bit in both CNBC and Bloomberg this morning. There this whole motion of that\u2019s a gas in the United States, frankly it\u2019s been a big story at Southern Company. We now are the second or third largest gas consumer in the United States. We have made a big ship the way from coal to gas.","You all must heard and I have written and spoken about 5.3 cautious about natural gas. The polar vortex is called that at least point number 2 is that to be true that is the need for infrastructure. The new gas is in a place it is definitely old gas. And all of a sudden we find and need to build more pipes, to make sure the critical service provider to have FT farm transportation in those pipes and we got to make sure we add adequate storage.","Now we have secured all of the FT we need for our business. And we have seen prices 450 per million Btu and I guess I spiked up a little bit. If I could just toss some before we get on the call maybe they are in the high 4s to 5s and it\u2019s been since 2010 since we hit numbers like that. In fact some people were saying that we wouldn\u2019t hit $5 dollars again for the rest of our life time. Okay, if you live at the end of the 5s particularly you folks in the Northeast if you don\u2019t have sufficient infrastructure, if you don\u2019t have AFT, if you don\u2019t have sufficient storage, we\u2019ve seen a blow out in some of those prices up to a $130 per million Btu.","One of the suggestions is that the beta of the energy supply to the United States is increasing as a result of the push to gas. We\u2019ve been saying that. It\u2019s true. So, one of the things you got to think about is, what is the infrastructure, what is the availability of AFT to assets all over the U.S. and how do we think about storage in this new environment. How do we think about industrial capacity in this new environment, big deal. Overall the system is performing great. At least for Southern reliability looks good for the years to come. The only question with us is, what happens to the equilibrium point.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","The dispatch on the non-PRB coal plants is again been pretty low for a while now. At that 455 oil gas drum reviewed to see those plants running a bit more this summer just with being helpful of gas inventories down in the region.","Thomas A. Fanning","So if you see gas, so if you see gas in the 5 to 6 range you are going to start running probably your Illinois Basin plant and then your Central App plants after that, but that\u2019s kind of the range. PRB gas in the 3 to 4, Central App and Illinois Basin 5 to 6 with Illinois Basin being ahead of that.","The other fact I just kept coal prices constant. We think coal prices come down a bit. The other impact that hit us last year was the abundance of Hydro. So, interesting stuff. All this is a little bit influx recall again Southern is uniquely positioned and then we had huge optionality among and between gas and coal. We can swing gas from I think it\u2019s 35% of energy to 55% of energy and we can swing coal 25% to 45%. So we will be able to deliver the best package we think of energy to our customers based on our diverse portfolio.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And I guess with another question moving back and looked at the fourth quarter presentation from last year and the CapEx numbers you guys have for 2014 and 2015 this year are higher than what\u2019s you guys had a year ago and the growth rate was kind of in the 4% to 6% range and so to the numbers now? Is there some deterioration in earned ROEs or what bridges that gap because I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know that I saw all of that step down if I put all those numbers into the model?","Art P. Beattie","Yeah, Dan this is Art. This is probably Kemper. We have written off estimated probable losses, but we are still having to invest that capital. So, that showing up in the CapEx numbers in 2014.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","So, that\u2019s not happened in the $0.07 recalibration? So these are the base line or was in the growth would be from there?","Art P. Beattie","It is in the $0.07 recalibration, but it also in the CapEx.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay. I will follow-up [indiscernible]. Thank you guys.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Good afternoon Jonathan. Jonathan?","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Sorry it mute buttoned. Can you hear me now?","Thomas A. Fanning","Turn down your radio Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","CA20 I think you knocked that, you\u2019re hoping to get that in place in February before you have been saying Q4, is there enough legal in the schedule to mean that doesn\u2019t matter very much or?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, Jonathan we tried to be \u2013 let me take catching with that just a little we tried to be very careful in that we want to get assembly by yearend and we hit it by \u2013 we missed it by like 5 days or whatever it was. So, we assembled by year end in our view. That was much more important. Us moving in into the whole we\u2019ve got plenty of flat time around that. That you should not consider moving that as critical path.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So, what are the sort of the next critical path items we should be watching that you are going to sort of point us to?","Art P. Beattie","Jonathan, if you look the slide there is that diagram we showed you that CA01 Module that goes inside that containment vessel. That would probably the next item on the critical path list, but remember that these things as we move in and out of these things, kind of change places in critical path, but that is the next item, big item on critical path.","Art P. Beattie","And that\u2019s kind of a third quarter event.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, so most of this sort of progress to this picture on the slide is more backend of the year?","Art P. Beattie","Well, it\u2019s progress throughout the year, but CaO-1 is in the\u2026.","Thomas A. Fanning","In terms of placement in there, so if you kind of look at that picture, you see CaO-1 is a great big thing and it\u2019s got lots of panels and it\u2019s kind of complex walls and all that. That will be going on in the module assembly building, so that the all sorts of progress throughout the year, just as there was on CA20.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning","And we believe we will be able to hit it. The placing of it is, almost less important than the assembly of it.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you for the update and then on with this kind of period I guess, either more conservative outlook or flatter growth, does it change your calculus and interest level in M&A at all. Can you just talk to your latest thoughts there?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, sure. And remember again, we are very kind of analytical in terms of how we think about value creation. Value is a function of risk and return and I grew up in a period where we decided the growth was the end-all to end-all and we chased growth, and really I don\u2019t think did an effective job of evaluating risk. If you grow risk faster than you grow growth, then you destroy value.","What you\u2019ve seen with Southern Company and especially we talked last year about getting all of this regulatory wood chopping behind us, we\u2019ve done that I think in an exemplary manner in 2013. So here is the deal. As that financial pressure associated with the CapEx plans start to go away, our risk starts to go down. All we are doing is, moving along the risk return curve. We think our value creation aspects are terrific through this period. ","Now, we always want to test a business as usual case and that's where I kind of got a long-winded earlier in the call. We can look at more opportunities at Southern Power. We can evaluate other opportunities. We might have to build new generation to build-out our environmental program requirement. We can look at other opportunities as we are essentially down to do as a fiduciary including M&A, but remember what we say about M&A; in my opinion, the whole work around mergers and acquisitions is a how, not a what. The what, is what it results for us in terms of the portfolio outcomes on risk and return. The how could be finding assets, building assets or buying corporate entities. ","So I don\u2019t view M&A as a what, I view it as a how. It is a means to achieve something else. We are going to be very disciplined as we always have been about looking at what happens to the total value creation profile at Southern, the base case. And in fact, we are showing you a lot more clarity in this call than any time in my memory. The reason for that is, we have a great deal of confidence in it. Can we improve it? We are going to work like crazy to see if we can, but we will not chase growth at the expense of increasing risk so that it destroys value ultimately.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you Tom. Can I one another quick thing\u2026","Thomas A. Fanning","Sure.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Certainly if I have to\u2026","","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I think this is a little basic now, but the last thing I remember you giving a range of like $175 million to $190 million of earnings out of Southern Power.","Art P. Beattie","That\u2019s right.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Is that still a good number for this year?","Art P. Beattie","Gone down a little bit for a variety of reasons. We would say kind of over this timeframe, $145 million to $175 million, and you say well, what happened there? Well, a couple of moving pieces; one is that the energy margins have essentially gone down with the rising gas prices. Interestingly for us anyway, gas prices have almost tripled, remember I said it wasn\u2019t volatile. Well, it\u2019s gone from I don\u2019t know $1.85 per million Btu at one time to now there is kind of $4.50 to $5 per million Btu. I don\u2019t know where it sustains after the polar vortex withdraws.","So gas prices have gone up, largely our business at Southern Power is largely gas fired and so therefore as gas prices go up, coal price has come down, the pool interchange rate changes and our margins decrease a bit, number one.","Number two, the pace of the economy has slowed based on prior projection. Now, you look at the evidence in fourth quarter of 2013, you can say, boy that looks awfully foolish, you look at our economic development stop that looks awfully foolish. The numbers we\u2019re showing you I think are reasonably conservative and prudent. So what\u2019s the potential for economic growth beyond what we see? I don\u2019t know.","The third I guess would be just kind of what the opportunity for Southern Power to deploy more assets and will they be tax-oriented assets like solar to give you the big non-sustainable though pops and investment tax credit and net income or will they be of the nature that give you more of the sustainable earnings picture of kind of baseload generation normally associated with natural gas. It\u2019s all those factors.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Is that exactly the same as the outlook, the earnings projections you\u2019ve given us for 2014 through 2016 assume something flattish within that lower range that you just spoke there?","Art P. Beattie","$145 million to $175 million is the decent range.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Through the whole period?","Art P. Beattie","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Things of kind of potential upside?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, and lots of uncertainty around that.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","All right, thank you.","Art P. Beattie","Yes sir, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell of Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions","Anthony C. Crowdell \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Hi, good afternoon, Tom.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey.","Anthony C. Crowdell \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Just, hopefully two quick ones; one is, just housekeeping really, the dilution from Kemper you have minus $0.07, just how do you calculate that and is there a potential for anymore equity in 2014 I guess maybe depending upon write-offs of Kemper?","Art P. Beattie","Well, we certainly are very confident in the cost estimates that we put out, but there are risks as we move through startup and as we finish construction and we have outlined those pretty clearly. But when we think about the $0.07, we\u2019re issuing about $1.3 billion in total equity, that\u2019s really a little bit more than what we need for Kemper and what we\u2019re really targeting here is, a common equity ratio somewhere in the neighborhood of 43.5%, 44%. ","So we got a little bit cushion there, but again this is the commitment we made to catch the whole around the write-offs, so we do have a little cushion as we move forward in time and that\u2019s what the $0.07 reflects.","Thomas A. Fanning","There are other discussions we\u2019re kind of in now that to my memory, we haven\u2019t been in decades I don\u2019t know, but when you think about it we did picking up our equity ratio in anticipation are a really ambitious construction program that now appears to be kind of finishing up. When you look at our new debt requirements they\u2019re really modest. ","So you have all these kind of interesting questions about how do you think about new equity over time. On prior calls, I\u2019ve talked about our cash flow posture during some years that could cause us to repurchase the equity. It seemed to us it would make more sense not to issue and then not to have to repurchase than issuing and repurchasing overtime.","So there is all kinds of shaping about what we\u2019re going to do about new sales of equity, are we overcapitalized for this exceedingly low business risk environment we appeared to be moving into and then you have the wildcard of Southern Power and what else maybe there in terms of any scale of purchases. And let me remind you all, if we have the opportunities to invest in value creating ways with Southern Power we will do it and we will do it even beyond the placeholders if those opportunities arise.","Anthony C. Crowdell \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Just trying to jump in lastly, when you talk about maybe post 2016 and you want to I think your term using like reaccelerate growth. I mean, is that target of what you set out maybe two or three years ago of 5% to 7%, or is that target 4% to 6% I mean what is management shooting for this reacceleration?","Thomas A. Fanning","We\u2019ve really argued about what to say about this one. And that you\u2019re dealing with a conservative company, so I hope you\u2019ll accept this one. All we want to say is reaccelerate beyond 4%, don\u2019t know what the number is going to be, let\u2019s see when we get there, there is a host of variables involved. We think it will be better than what we see in 2015 and 2016.","Anthony C. Crowdell \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Great, thank you very much for you time.","Thomas A.

Fanning","","It\u2019s really beyond that.","Thomas A. Fanning","We heard that well, Art did one today, he looks like he was trying to upper source it, to be honest with you. So what we are looking for in is the amount of share.","Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc","Yes.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hang on just a second. The average number of shares for 2014 is almost 900 million shares. The average number of shares in 2014 is about 900 million.","Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc","And you said, no new equity at all in 2015 and 2016 including drifts in employee type programs, is that correct?","Thomas A. Fanning","That\u2019s correct, based on all these assumptions in Southern Power and everything else. That\u2019s right.","","Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc","And is that kind of linked with your view that you are going to be overcapitalized for awhile or in a while?","Thomas A. Fanning","The over capitalized statements and remember what we always want to do with that is to preserve our financial integrity and bond ratings. Really it goes to kind of how new investment opportunities develop and kind of the post 2016 timeframe. When we finish Vogtle, certainly as we get to the end of Vogtle, this whole profile changes completely. ","Our view is that layering up of equity adding in to the big construction program really and recall in 2008 these guys remind me we were about 40.5% equity ratio and in 2013, we\u2019re 44%. Well, that was heading in to as we\u2019ve build up the equity ratio during this contractor period now we are getting better.","We have not reflected in any earnings per share estimates we are giving you. We are giving you business as usual. We have not reflected any de-layering of the equity ratio in any of our estimates, so that would represent upside, but recall, we want to make sure that we are able to preserve our financial integrity position during this timeframe.","Paul T. Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc","Understood, thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes sir, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey Michael.","","Michael Weinstein \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Hey Tom, how are you doing? I apologize, if this is already asked before, but just wanted to confirm about that the place holder CapEx you guys have for Southern Power 1.4, how much of that is solar? Can you break out little bit more like how much of is thermal quantified, is that all in Georgia?","Art P. Beattie","We were not that fine about it. So we don\u2019t have a breakout for you. Listen, we\u2019ve been chasing lots of different projects I can tell you that we\u2019ve been chasing some that are thermal and we\u2019ve been looking at some that are solar and it seems like you can do as much as you want to all over the place the real challenge for us is what makes sense in the portfolio and what is at the end of the day the best value recreating strategy for shareholders, but we can\u2019t give you a breakout in place holders.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Have you guys talked at all about the prudence review at Kemper that I\u2019m seeing that they may comment on?","Art P. Beattie","","No we haven\u2019t, but we expect that to occur about June later in May or June.","Thomas A. Fanning","May of 2014 based on spending full March of 2013. And Mississippi Power has filed a number of documents related to that I believe in December of last year. ","Art P. Beattie","","And we certainly don\u2019t want to front run that process. We don\u2019t want to front run the regulator. I mean I can tell you my opinion when I look at kind of how the construction has unfolded I think these guys have done a terrific job.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","And you said before that the delay of CA20 is really now a big deal, right to see moving up a bit on side.","Thomas A. Fanning ","What you got to understand is one of the way that we mitigated some of the problems in the facility that CBI has in Louisiana. Look to get product out of there, put it on site and essentially you have a CBI facility onsite now that holds those pieces of equipment and pieces of metal and then what we do is we have an army of people onsite both Southern and CBI last thing there whatever we need in order to complete the nuclear quality documentation before we put those panels up on the CA20 facility. ","So the real timing factor was to get it assembled. Now that we got it assembled, there is lots of work around and things we can do that take frankly the setting of CA20 in the nuclear island away from the critical path and that activity is not critical path. So we are focused now on assembly of CaO-1. ","Michael Weinstein \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","And in fact, on that subject critical path means fairing out Lake Charles, the assembly facility, right so. Are you guys happy with the way the things have improved there or?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, we said this a million times. Look, in any project at this magnitude, there are always challenges to get measure of success is not that you have challenges that\u2019s how you work around them and I think especially and Philip Asherman CBI cohort that come into play here since they took over Shaw. ","The performance, the responsiveness, the constructive attitude has just really gotten better. And so, we are not depending now solely on the Louisiana facility. We are moving the fabrication to different points in the United States, maybe shipyards in Orleans, even couple of facilities, couple of the CA20 modules and IHI in Japan. ","So what we are doing is, we look for what is practical, what is reasonable from an economic and timing standpoint and we find the best solution and that's what we have done.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Just one last question, you said there were disagreements when you were talking on the economic roundtable and trying to figure out what the economic growth rate should be and one should be assuming and cannot have conservative numbers, I\u2019m just wondering what kind of disagreements that you have, what were the biggest disagreements over there?","Thomas A. Fanning ","I think the economic roundtable did really didn\u2019t have any disagreements there. They were different numbers. I think the lowest number of that was out of the group was like 2.25%. The tallest number was around 3%. So we are right in the heart of that range.","Art P. Beattie ","I think he is referring to the disagreements we had, I mean certainly.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","You made it clear. I made it sound like it was a very tough and arduous process just wondering what it was.","Art P. Beattie","Well it always is. I mean you wouldn\u2019t believe that much we prepared for these calls to get the right stuff. Ultimately, when we give you stuff, when you give an estimated, it\u2019s everybody\u2019s collective wisdom, their best judgment and it\u2019s not through a good certify. ","I mean I\u2019ll just tell you if I look at the numbers sometimes and I go where did you grew 3.6 in the second half, 4.8 in the fourth quarter and you are projecting what, 1.1 for the year. Why is that and we go through a giant fight? I mean we just do. What we are providing you is our best judgment I think. We are conservative. We don\u2019t try and push the numbers in order to achieve a result.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","All right, well, thank you very much.","","Art P. Beattie","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning ","Hello Mark.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Research","Hey good afternoon guys.","Thomas A. Fanning ","Good afternoon.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Research","Yes, I have lot of questions on some of the specifics and kind of long-term plan, but just curious maybe to shift to the end of the call here towards some of the policy issues that we are maybe facing over the next couple of years.","There has been a lot of, I wouldn\u2019t want to say controversy, but just kind of discussion around the numbers that the EPA has used to justify, the cost analysis that they present with the new source with the carbon, the proposed stuff that went in January, but I\u2019m wondering one of your projects obviously and Kemper is one of the benchmarks that they use, but obviously with the new engineering and some of the changes in the projects since you imitated, I\u2019m just wondering like how do you think that those estimates that they use and the justification based on those, does that really turn into a strongly defensible rule because of course this is going to get challenged and just some thoughts around that I guess?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, rather than give you a legal opinion at this point, I\u2019ll just talk about the suitability of using \u200ePlant Ratcliffe in Kemper County. I met with Gina McCarthy and her whole staff along with some other CEOs in the industry, and I told this to her, I said it on TV. The characteristics of Kemper County are such that they are reasonably unique to that site, in other words the [indiscernible], it\u2019s our specific technology, it is the ability in an economic way to do an enhanced oil recovery.","When you set a standard, you should use a set of circumstances that are applicable to a broad range of the United States. We don\u2019t believe that, that is those conditions as unique as they maybe there are applicable in a broad sense. So with that argument first, the second one would go to just kind of, \u201cIs it commercial? Is it adequately demonstrated?\u201d and I would argue it\u2019s hard to find out, why you would believe that it is commercial and demonstrable in a broad sense.","The Southern Company is probably the leader right now in the United States and looking at carbon capture technology. Not only are we doing it on a pre-combustion basis at Kemper County, we are doing it, have done on that successful test, post combustion at Plant Barry and we\u2019ve had a very good outcome there. I tend to believe the pre-combustion when you have a very concentrated set of gases leading along a process, the more efficient way to do it than on a post combustion where all the gases are diffused, but still are we going to be able to deploy that technology broadly and in a commercial way across the United States. I think those are the hearts of the question.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Great, appreciated.","Thomas A. Fanning","","You bet.","","Operator","","Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP Cap. Please proceed with your question.","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US, Inc.","","Hi, good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning","Vedu, how are you?","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US, Inc.","I\u2019m doing well, thank you. When you think about the reacceleration possibilities 2016, you referenced very specifically the fact that the balance sheet could be over equitized following the, mostly the completion of Vogtle. Is it the whole reacceleration simply tied to letting the equity ratio move back down to close to 2008 levels that you mentioned or is there something beyond just the retweaking of the capital structure that would allow for a higher growth rate definitely?","Thomas A. Fanning","","Heavens, I would argue that\u2019s almost last in the list of potentials. We know that we are going to have new generations. We know that their going to be associated with environmental CapEx. We are watching very closely as with the data we provided to you today what\u2019s going to happen with the economy and recall there is a set of generation that\u2019s retiring as a result of the EPA's MATS rule or what\u2019s now called MATS.","The confluence of those factors may have some sense as to what happens to the equilibrium point of supply and demand in the next few years. All of those factors are the primary factors. In other words, you will see this reacceleration of CapEx. That\u2019s the primary factor. Frankly, this thinking about our capitalization really I think has kind of followed behind the primary facts. We\u2019ll just see how all that goes. Those were kind of interdependent right. In other words, as you accelerate CapEx you may need more equity. So the capitalization discussion is a temporal issue.","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","","Good afternoon guys.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hi, Paul.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","How you are doing?","Thomas A. Fanning","Dynamite, I hope you are well.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","I\u2019m managing. Just want to check a few quick things 2.5% to 3%. That\u2019s a national GDP figure right now, some regional number. Is that correct?","Art P. Beattie","That\u2019s correct.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Okay, now when we look at the 0.7% growth in 2014, I think Ali was asking about this but I just want to make I understand it, that seems a lot less than 0.5% of GDP. So what\u2019s going on there, and I think you guys then see it going back up. If you could just refresh \u2013just sort of help me out there with what that is?","Art P. Beattie","Well, I think it goes down to what Tom mentioned a few moments ago is we try to put out a incredible forecast that we can rely on the sticking to a specific ratio to GDP is influenced by a lot of factors, a lot in the industrial side. I said before we get a lot of input from our customers, our large customers as to what their outlooks are for the coming year and so we have to factor those things in. These are more known quantum force than just drawing a line on a curve and trying to make an estimate.","We have not seen great growth in residential and commercial over the last four years. So we are very cognizant of the fact that that\u2019s true and then we are trying to make a measured approach towards getting the economy back to full measure and we think that once that occurs then you are going to have more cylinders working around that ratio of 50% to GDP.","Thomas A. Fanning","And we are covering some territories we heard before, but maybe in a more concise way. I agree with you the industrial numbers look clear that you draw from this big clear to growth that\u2019s something that\u2019s more moderate, but that\u2019s what we are projecting.","The other one to keep your eye on is just this whole residential sector. I think the effect you are seeing now are personal income growth has been relatively flat. The growth in job doesn\u2019t been necessarily a manufacturing. Good news for manufacturing is that more efficient i.e. less people as input to the output they produce therefore, they are going to be more sustainable in the long run. But the manufacturing jobs are ones that are higher paying therefore the increase in jobs in Southeast had been more service industry.","There is a shift as a result of lot of external factors including the Affordable Care Act to move people or at least to inhibit companies from adding full time employees shifting rather to part time employees. So, even though they\u2019re candid in the workforce they are earning less and then there are people leaving the workforce. So, that you get all that kind of thing going on.","The other thing is perhaps a consequence of the housing problem. At one time, 70% of our residential sales came out of single family housing. Now it looks like perhaps it\u2019s a function of personal income growth, perhaps it\u2019s a function of bank tightening lending requirements. That 70% maybe more like 62% with the delta showing an increase in multifamily. So, it\u2019s all those factors.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Okay. For some reason we don\u2019t see sales growth \u2013 could give us a update for what\u2019s the sensitivity is around sales growth. So, if we don\u2019t get I guess you guys are saying 1% to 1.5% I think you guys were talking about if you get let\u2019s say, just if you get a rule of thumb for every 50 basis point of sales growth, how should we think about that in terms of earnings or can you guys do other things and how dependent are you on sales growth I guess in terms of meeting your longer term EPS forecast that you have?","Thomas A. Fanning","I know that Art gave you the juristic. I\u2019ll give you the other answer. Look, over the past few years we\u2019ve lost $500 million in revenue as associated with weather or slower than expected economic growth and we made that all up with O&M. In 2013, those numbers were just under $300 million loss revenues reduced expense. And at the same time, we had reduced expense. We had some of the best of liability and customer satisfaction we\u2019ve ever had. Art?","Art P. Beattie","Yeah, Paul the juristic on say a 1% change in retail sales equal across all classes is about $82 million pretax and we talk about cost control or cost flexibility and that would represent less than 2% of non-fuel O&M. So that goes towards some of the mitigations we have around the sensitivity on sales.","Thomas A. Fanning","And I can\u2019t stress it enough and I got to think the thousand of employees that make thousands of good decisions every day. The folks at Southern Company know how to run the utility business in an optimal way and have reliability and serve customers and be safe and did a heck of a job of it. We are able to demonstrate year end and year out if we can meet the needs of shareholders and deliver earnings targets part of that litany I gave you in the script and do it exceedingly well and run the business well.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Okay. So if I hear you correctly if I understand correctly, if the sales growth doesn\u2019t \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t work out as well you guys store other levers that you can use.","","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","That\u2019s you believe in terms of making these numbers. And because I mean, just in general now we are seeing \u2013 we are seeing a fall off in a lot of areas around the country. ","","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","So, we are just trying to figure it out.","Thomas A. Fanning","We see the same thing. I sit on the flat board and I see all the stuff too, but you know what these results in the Southeast are awfully gratifying in the fourth quarter.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","","Okay I appreciate the help. Thanks a lot and have a good day.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes sir, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question is from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group, a follow-up question. Please proceed sir.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","They have answered all the questions. I\u2019m good, thanks.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thanks Greg.","","Operator","Thank you. With our final question, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning","","Yes, just very briefly. Number one, let me thank you of all for staying with this on this rather lengthy call, but it\u2019s an important one. This is a little bit of an inflection point in our growth rate, in our risk profound, and variety of other things. ","Interestingly, when you look at regulatory work that we had to accomplish last year, when you look at the major projects that were in front of us, my sense is absent what happened at Kemper County, this complete deserves an applause. I think that they have come through those regulatory processes, terrific; their progress on Vogtle is terrific and I think we\u2019re positioned well for years to come. It will be fascinating to see how we continue to deliver value to shareholders.

Fanning","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. 2013 has been a very active year for Southern Company with major progress on construction projects, a robust regulatory calendar and unexpected challenges in the form of consistently unseasonable weather. Let\u2019s begin on the regulatory front, where we continue to see constructive processes and outcomes in all four states in which we operate. An extensive review of Alabama Power\u2019s RSE rate mechanism was concluded in August. Following three public hearings, the Commission chose to change the way RSE is measured beginning in 2014 to a weighted cost of equity range that appropriately takes into account Alabama Power\u2019s equity ratio.","In so doing, they concluded that Alabama Power\u2019s overall return on capital was fair and reasonable. The Commission also approved two regulatory orders that will enable Alabama Power to avoid any increases to RSE in 2014, thereby keeping rates stable for customers. Earlier this month, Georgia Power presented its proposed three-year rate plan to the Georgia Public Service Commission. That proposal includes a one-time rate increase of $482 million that would become effective January 1, 2014. The PSC staff and other interveners have filed their testimony and the next round of hearings will be held next week.","Georgia Power will file its rebuttal testimony by November 15, with rebuttal hearing scheduled to begin November 25. A final decision on the Georgia rate case is expected on December 17. Recall that Georgia Power has operated under a series of three-year rate plans since 1995. These plans have all been the result of negotiation and compromise between Georgia Power, the Commission staff and other parties, as approved by the Commission and agreed to by the company.","The Georgia Commission has a long history of constructive regulation and we fully expect that the outcome of this case will reflect a continuation of that record. In other Georgia regulatory news, the eighth Vogtle Construction Monitoring report was approved by the Georgia PSC by a unanimous five to zero vote. This latest regulatory approval means that a total of $2.2 billion in construction costs has now been verified and approved by the Commission.","Meanwhile, testimony continues to be filed as a part of the Georgia \u2013 as a part of the Gulf Power rate case. As a reminder, Gulf\u2019s request is for a $74 million base rate increase that would become effective in April of 2014, as well as an additional $16 million that would become effective in July of 2015. We expect hearing to conclude in December with a decision in the first quarter of 2014.","Finally, Mississippi Power expects to file an update to the seven-year rate plan to the Kemper County project later this year, reflecting assumptions consistent with the fourth quarter 2014 in-service date. We anticipate that the hearings on the rate plan will now occur in the first quarter of 2014. The prudence review scheduled for the Kemper project has also been updated. By mid December, Mississippi Power will file information supporting the prudence of its procedures and controls over the costs that are currently under review. Hearings on those costs are expected to begin in May.","As a reminder, this will be the first of two prudence processes. This initial process will address costs incurred through March 2013, while the second will address all subsequent costs through the completion of the project. We believe this schedule will allow sufficient time for Mississippi\u2019s new Public Service Commissioner, Stephen Renfroe, to become fully informed on the issues involved. As a reminder, Commissioner Renfroe was appointed by the Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant to fulfill the remaining term of Leonard Bentz, who resigned from the Commission in August.","Finally, I\u2019d like to give you an update on our Vogtle and Kemper County projects. First, plant Vogtle, work continues to progress well at Vogtle 3 and 4, as evidenced by dramatic changes across the entire construction site. The project management team from Westinghouse, CB&I and Southern Nuclear is aligned and working hard to the next major milestone, which include final assembly of the Unit 3 nuclear island auxiliary building also know as CA20 and the pouring of the first nuclear concrete in the Unit 4 nuclear island.","Assembly of the CA20 module for Unit 3 nuclear island is scheduled to be completed in December. Our contractors are diligently progressing through sub-module inspections and remediation in order to meet this date. Meanwhile, the first nuclear concrete for Unit 4 is scheduled for mid November. Most of the rebar work is complete and the final inspections and prep work are now taking place for the pour, which took 41 hours to complete at Unit 3.","In September, the conditional commitment for the Vogtle 3 and 4 DOE loan was extended to December 31. As of today, we\u2019ve settled on most major terms and conditions and final reviews are underway at the appropriate government agencies. While there is no assurance of a definitive agreement, constructive dialogue with DOE leaves us very optimistic about capturing the value of these loans for customers.","The past Friday, we submitted our initial filing with the Internal Revenue Service to secure our allocation of nuclear production tax credits for Vogtle Unit 3. These credits were authorized under The Energy Policy Act of 2005. We expect to submit an application to secure the Unit 4 allocation of credit after the Unit 4 basemat concrete is poured. The basemat is expected to be the final construction step necessary to lock in these important savings for Georgia Power customers, which could total as much as $1 billion for both units over the first eight years of operation.","Now for an update on the Kemper County project, earlier this month, we announced that we did not expect to meet the original May 2014 in-service date for the Kemper project largely as a result of lower than expected production rates and delays from wet weather. After recalibrating our assumptions on the rate of pipe installation, we have revised the in-service date to the fourth quarter of 2014. In conjunction with the schedule change, we have recorded an additional pre-tax estimated loss of $150 million.","As a reminder, we estimated the incremental cost for a delay to be approximately $15 million to $25 million per month. Our new estimate is consistent with that projection and also retains a $100 million contingency. Tremendous progress continues to be made at the site. We are now nearly halfway complete with pipe installation, have fired both combustion turbines and have synced the entire two-on-one combined cycle to the grid. Our project teams at both Kemper and Vogtle continue to work diligently to complete the state-of-the-art facilities, both of which will deliver outstanding values to our customers for decades to come.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview.","Art P. Beattie","","Thanks, Tom. For the third quarter of 2013, we earned $0.97 per share, compared to $1.11 per share in the third quarter of 2012, a decrease of $0.14 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we earned $1.41 per share, compared to $2.26 per share for the same period in 2012, a decrease of $0.85 per share. Our results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, include after-tax charges of $93 million or $0.11 per share and $704 million or $0.81 per share respectively, related to the increased cost estimates for construction of the Kemper project.","As previously communicated, Mississippi Power will not seek recovery of estimated cost to complete the facility above the $2.88 billion cost cap net of DOE grants and exceptions to the cost cap. Year-to-date, 2013 results also include an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease investment recorded in the first quarter of 2013.","Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 include $21 million or $0.02 per share of insurance recovery related to the March 2009 litigation settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery, LLC. Excluding these extraordinary items, earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 were $1.08 and $2.24 per share respectively, compared with $1.11 and $2.24 per share respectively during 2012.","Excluding the effects of Kemper County, the primary driver for our third quarter results was milder than expected weather, resulting in a decrease of $0.07 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Weather was actually $0.10 below normal, compared with $0.035 per share below normal for the same period a year ago. In terms of cooling degree days, the third quarter of 2013 was one of the mildest in the past 20 years. For instance, in metro Atlanta, where we would normally expect to see more than 100 hours of summer temperatures above 90 degrees, we saw only one such hour. In August, also in metro Atlanta, we experienced four straight days with average temperatures of 67 degrees, but even that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.","Rainfall during the quarter across the entire Southern Company territory was at its highest level since 1916. The significance of this anomaly cannot be overstated. When rainfall is that heavy, the typical heat buildup fails to occur. Without this buildup, the temperature momentum that usually results in sustained electric demand for cooling never materializes. This factor greatly affects our earnings \u2013 greatly affected our earnings during the third quarter of 2013.","It\u2019s significant to note that weather affected not only our retail sales, but also energy sales to wholesale customers. We were able to offset the total effect of weather somewhat by reducing non-fuel O&M spending compared to our plan. A more detailed summary of our quarter-over-quarter drivers is included in the slide deck.","Turning now to a discussion of our retail sales and economic outlook for the remainder of the year. GDP growth in the Southeast and the nation as a whole, remained slower than expected, at 1.5% to 2% year-to-date growth. However, in terms of jobs growth year-to-date, the region is just slightly ahead of the nation at about 1.7%. Industrial sales growth during the third quarter of 2013 was relatively strong at 2.6%. We continued to see emerging growth in housing-related sectors such as lumber, up 9%; stone, clay, and glass up, 7%; and textiles, up 6%. We also saw increased strength in paper, up 11%; petroleum up, 11%; and primary metals, up 8%. Exports have begun expanding again after a stalling in the first quarter.","Weather normal residential sales were relatively flat for the quarter, although, customer growth is slightly ahead of the same period in 2012. As expected, residential sales growth continues to lag behind our customer growth. The commercial market continues to show signs of improvement as evidenced by a decline in office vacancy levels, which have fallen nearly 10% from their peak. Elsewhere, our economic development pipeline remains active and productive, as the Southeast remains a great place to do business.","Currently, our traditional operating companies are supporting some 350 potential projects representing more than 40,000 jobs and $15 billion in capital investments. Meanwhile, recent announcements are adding nearly 7,600 new jobs in our territory, included among these are Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia; corporate manufacturer, Shaw Industries, auto parts manufacturer, Hyundai-Daimos, vinyl tile manufacturer, Mannington Mills; wood pellet manufacturer, Green Circle Bio Energy and medical software developer, iSirona.","Now at this point, I\u2019d like to share our earnings estimate for the fourth quarter of 2013, which will be $0.44 per share. This implies annual results at the bottom end of our guidance range.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thanks, Art. There has been a lot of interest recently in the emergence of a changing trajectory in long-term earnings per share growth to our industry, we\u2019ve noted that many of you are writing about that now. It has been our practice for the last decade or so, we will provide updated guidance range for 2014 and an updated long-term growth rate during our fourth quarter earnings call in January.","It\u2019s been an awfully busy year with a lot of important regulatory outcomes either pending or complete in all of our jurisdictions. For example, we expect the Georgia Power rate case to conclude in December. So there is still a lot of important information to be factored into our long-term EPS growth. That builds an interesting question, what do we think will remain the same and what do we think will change? While we don\u2019t yet have the specifics, we can talk directionally.","First, what do we expect to remain the same? Dividend policy, based on what we see today, we believe our dividend growth trajectory will remain consistent with the dividend increases of the past six years. Now dividends are ambiguously the purview of our board what we are confident in our ability to continue deliver those returns to our shareholders. Second, what is likely to change? The shape of our EPS growth, compared to the past 10 years, our EPS growth will likely slow a bit during the middle of the current decade, but will likely increase again, by the end of the decade.","Why? Well, as you know, Southern Company has been investing capital at a very healthy rate for many years now, supporting major projects, like our McDonough Gas Units, Plant Vogtle, Kemper County, our environmental spend and growth at Southern Power.","In fact, our CapEx as a percentage of our invested capital base has averaged about 8% over this timeframe. As we work through our annual update to the financial plan, this percentage is projected to become smaller through the middle of this decade, associated with this reduced CapEx and growth of invested capital is the fact that our cash flow metrics are expected to improve dramatically.","In fact, within the next three-year period, our equity need could be eliminated or go negative in order to preserve our target equity ratio. And by the end of the decade, our growth in CapEx is expected to resume with the advent of more environmental spending and the commitment of our next phase of generating capacity for our traditional operating companies and Southern Power.","As always, our objective is to provide superior risk adjusted returns to our investors by delivering on our commitment to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity to our customers. Our regulatory jurisdictions continue to prove constructive and we believe the Southeast is poised to lead the nation\u2019s emerging economic recovery and we are prepared to support and take part in that resurgence.","We are now ready to take your questions. So operator we\u2019ll now take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, Steve.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Hey, Tom and Art. Just first when you do get to kind of more specific guidance next year, this 268 that you\u2019re now guiding to this year, will you like normalize that for the weather as a base or is that kind of assuming you get there that kind of the base we should think about?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes. we always give weather normal projection.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. Second question is on Vogtle, can you give us an update on the modules this year, Lake Charles et cetera, is that likely to stay on schedule to be resolved by the end of the year?","Thomas A. Fanning","So the kind of primary focus is on the CA 20 that we\u2019ve referenced. I think the important thing to note is that all of the material associated with CA 20 is currently onsite. Construction is progressing in an acceptable manner and like we said, we\u2019re projecting the assembly of CA 20 would be done by year-end. That\u2019s kind of most important, that actually forms a support mechanism for other modules, for example CaO-1 that will occur later in 2014.","Art P. Beattie","To just clarify that, that didn\u2019t mean that the issue with the modules are essentially resolved in terms of it being kind of, any kind of a critical path issue in terms of current schedule for the project?","Thomas A. Fanning","So we \u2013 listen, I think we said there\u2019s a lot in the past, there are always issues, right. And so what we\u2019re always doing is, working through the issues. So is it resolved? No. Do we have acceptable workaround for every issue that we see right now? Yes. When we talk about critical path, we fight among ourselves here about that, because there maybe \u2013 for the remaining integrated schedule, there maybe something like 20 to 30 critical path items. And if you are a week late on one, it doesn\u2019t mean that you are a week late on the end of the schedule. We believe that in our evaluation of our other critical path items, we actually have improvements in the schedule. We believe right now, the sum total of critical path progress keeps us on schedule.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","","Okay. And then, one other question just on Kemper, in the last two updates, I think you\u2019ve given some \u2013 you\u2019ve obviously had these write-offs. but I think in some of the higher costs you\u2019ve been able to kind of defer for recovery. Could you kind of highlight what that number is and why is that piece able to be deferred for recovery versus the others have to be kind of countered in the cost cap?","Art P. Beattie","","Yes. Steve, if we look at the project cost that we expect recovering on, it would be the basic $2.4 billion plant cost that we initially certified to, the cost of the man, which is about $250 million, the cost of the pipeline, which is roughly $115 million and then there are some other regulatory assets that we\u2019re on Mississippi Power\u2019s books that are scheduled to be recovered as well, that\u2019s about $190 million. And that\u2019s when we look at what would be within Mississippi\u2019s Power earnings rate base, that\u2019s what we look at. The other pieces of it would be AFUDC, which is roughly $425 million and then the difference between 2.4 and the 2.88 cap will also become part of the securitization package, that totals about $480 million. Those are the pieces that make up what we\u2019re looking at, at this point, other than the write-off amounts.","Steve I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with you question.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Hey Julien. how are you doing?","Art P. Beattie","Hey good afternoon.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Hey, not to bad. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning","Good.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. So just turning to the CBI and I suppose the issue of CBI and litigation and settlement what have you \u2013 how do you see that progressing here? I mean it seems like you\u2019ve got some progress, there\u2019s still some other issues out there. ultimately, how do you feel about that getting resolved and what timeline? And then beyond that given I suppose some slippage in settlement, some slippage in schedule and module 20 what have you, is there a potential to go back to CBI for more perspectively?","Thomas A. Fanning","So let me give you kind of a broad comment. In the middle of negotiations or whatever, you never want to give kind of give specific advice. Let me give you some very clear though, I think general guidance there. As Chicago Bridge & Iron acquired Shaw, we had a change in leadership. Philip Asherman is the CEO of CB&I. We have found a relationship between us and the consortium, particularly with CB&I and Philip Asherman to be excellent. Danny Roderick now leads Westinghouse; likewise the relationship there is excellent.","There are issues that are within the purview of the consortium, how cost gets shared among and between Toshiba Westinghouse and CB&I that we\u2019re not party to, that certainly do factor into the resolution of the commercial dispute. So between the company and the consortium, I would argue the tone has turned a lot more positive and certainly I think the progress of the litigation is expectable. So while I can\u2019t offer you very much specific than that, I would say the general tenor should be positive. What else do you want to cover there?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","We can leave it there if you want.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Okay. That\u2019s fine.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thank you and state your column in.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. Just to clarify, Tom, on these modules, last \u2013 I think the last update was some of them were still in Lake Charles. You are saying today, they are all physically in Georgia at the site.","Thomas A. Fanning","The A-20 is all there.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And but there are still some documentation and other issues you got to tie up?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes. They call them remediation, but essentially whenever you find like a small defect or whatever, what you do is fix it on-site and we just felt there was a much more efficient time effective process to get them onsite, fix the documentation, get them ready to go.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","My understanding was the NRC had to sort of sign off from them being moved and that would be a sign that they were resolved that?","","Thomas A. Fanning","","That\u2019s right.","Art P. Beattie","Well that they have \u2013 yeah, they\u2019ve been moved to site, but they haven\u2019t been accepted by us and from a quality perspective. Those elements that are still being remediated, are still being remediated under CBI\u2019s oversight.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","So it does have a\u2026","Thomas A. Fanning","","Yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Aside from this sort of logistical help I guess it will be, there will be that sooner, when you do resolve those issues and issue that needs to be still unresolved?","Thomas A. Fanning","","That\u2019s right.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning","We\u2019re actually feeling really bullish about that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Sorry","Thomas A. Fanning","I think we\u2019re feeling really bullish about\u2026","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","About getting, okay\u2026","Thomas A. Fanning","","CA20","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Rather than having resolving it down in the south and then you go to get them off that?","Thomas A. Fanning","","That\u2019s right.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Later, okay. and then on the Kemper, can you just what \u2013 I think when you originally announced this earlier in the month you said that it was really \u2013 this was really weather there will have some other issues. So the way you talked about is in the 8-K last night, it sounded like might be more productivity and then the weather was a sub-factor, is that\u2026","Thomas A. Fanning","Weather is a factor.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Is that\u2026","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes. Let\u2019s kind of go through that a little bit. early on, when we talked about, we did see weather being kind of the major thing. And I remember right out of the gate, we had some ambitious targets and right out of gate, we hit out targets and that \u2013 that\u2019s the tone you were getting from them.","As we progress on installing the pipe particularly, it\u2019s almost hard to imagine unless you\u2019ve been there, I know some of you have been to the site and you\u2019ll now what I\u2019m talking about a) there is a lot of pipe, b) there is different kinds of pipe, wide bore pipe, there is small bore pipe, some of the pipe is outside the physical structure of the gasifier island and the gas annealing system. Some of it is in constraint spaces inside the structure.","Obviously, what we have found is the production levels that we saw earlier we\u2019re not able to be sustained, because a lot of the work ended up being detailed work inside the structure. we just did maintain the kind of productivity that we wanted to see, further \u2013 and we kind of alluded to this, we are now with over two shifts of 2,000 craft people per day working on this issue.","And to some extent, there is a saturation at the site, we don\u2019t think it productive to add more people and add more shift and everything else. We\u2019re kind of where we want to be here and part of changing the schedule; I suppose that we could have done more and try to keep May. But we felt that for the overall health of the project, it was important for us to take this new schedule, put people to work in a more efficient manner and get the work done.","So it\u2019s kind of all that combination and when we say, weather and rainfall and all that, I remember we were down there one day; we go to visit the site, a good bit as you can imagine. It\u2019s not just rainfall, sometimes, it\u2019s fog. And in fact you can imagine, big cranes working and manipulating some of the material on the site. if you can\u2019t see the top of the crane, you can\u2019t work.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Right.","Thomas A. Fanning","","And so fog ended up being an issue.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, Tom. Thank you. And then on \u2013 just on the growth topic, you talked about the sort of mid decade slowdown shift of all of a cash generative mode. To the Steve\u2019s question on weather and guidance, we\u2019ll see a weather headwind year-to-date?","Art P. Beattie","","Year-to-date, it\u2019s $0.14, against normal.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","So would you anticipate talking about growth off of $268 number plus that $0.14, wouldn\u2019t it be more explicit?","Art P. Beattie","","Yes. The thing you have to normalize, as well as O&M. So it\u2019s not just the one-sided equation.","Art P. Beattie","","That\u2019s right, yeah.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","That\u2019s fine.","Art P. Beattie","","So we\u2019ll decide where that ought to be and when we talk to you in January.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Let\u2019s do the dumb math a little bit, real quick. Jonathan, I think it might be helpful. If you add together less than expected sales and lots of sales through the weather, we\u2019re in $418 million range for the year, somewhere around there.","Art P. Beattie","Two years.","Thomas A. Fanning","For two \u2013 for two years.","Art P. Beattie","Yes, yes.","Thomas A. Fanning","And O&M is down a similar number over something like two to three years. So we have moved O&M and weather in concert to the extent we can. At some point, one of the issues that we face is \u2013 and Art loves to keep reminding me of this that something like if the past 25 months, we have had below normal weather or milder weather, 22 of the last 25.","Art P. Beattie","Right.","Thomas A. Fanning","And therefore, I suppose we could just continue to take O&M out of business and I guess we could do that. However, that doesn\u2019t really serve our responsibility of clean, safe, reliable, affordable energy to our customers. So we have to balance that whole equation. So look, we do to weather normal projections, we will do that. We need to restore some O&M to get back to other normal activities.","Let me just \u2013 I\u2019m dying to do it; I always love to do this lagniappe in this call. You all on the call are familiar with heating degree days and cooling degree days. You\u2019re not going to believe the profile this year of Southern Company. If you look at the cooling degree days and heating degree days, for the month of January, February, March, June, July, August they were all about the same number. it is astounding the kind of year we\u2019ve had.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Well that is \u2013 so Tom, thanks for all that color and thus you maybe, it\u2019s pinning you down too far, but on the growth outlook obviously, you have this four to six currently and five is sort of the midpoint. Do you still see five as being part of the range, as you think about it out of the decade?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes man, we\u2019ll update everybody. We\u2019ll update everybody in January. What we were able to say here, because I know everybody is going to want another specifics, we\u2019re just not ready to do specifics, we\u2019ll do that January as we have for the past decade. But what we could say, in all the uncertainties, even now in our financial projections, we do have a \u2013 what appeared to be a dominant solution. The dominant solution basically says, sort of rate of growth of dividends, we think will be consistent with the past, putting in place all of the caveats about purview of the board and everything else.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Okay. That\u2019s good, thank you, Tom.","Thomas A. Fanning","You bet, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hello, Shar.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","How are you guys.","Thomas A. Fanning","Good.","Art P. Beattie","Superb.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Just a question on your cash flow profile, I think you\u2019ve kind of hinted that you should see a potential improvement in that outlook over the near-term. could that potentially eliminate any equity needs in 2015 at the earliest?","Art P. Beattie","Yes. I think when you look at our equity needs, we\u2019ve outlined the need for equity a little bit more this year, total of about $700 million for the year and $600 million next year. 2015 is still kind of a toss-up, but as to whether or not we\u2019ll need any is a function of obviously tax policy, with bonus depreciation that we qualify for all of that kind of stuff. but we may not need any equity, additional equity in 2015.","Thomas A. Fanning","In fact, the net of 2015 and 2016 could be zero. If you sell some in 2015, you could have a negative in 2016.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, perfect. And then just one real top level question to the extent that you can answer it, I think you mentioned maybe in the prepared remarks that some of the growth that you see could be back-end loaded, and you typically issue your guidance, CAGR; it\u2019s usually more of a long-term picture. Can you at least directionally mention whether the growth in the outer years can offset a potential slowdown in the interim?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, the way you should think about that is that \u2013 what we try to say is, I\u2019m going back to John Chiles, that old stuff. Those of you that aren\u2019t old enough to know John Chiles, you ought to read his book. He is old guy on Wall Street, but your earnings per share growth rate for net growth and dividends per share at or above the rate of inflation, but we\u2019ve been able to do with this tremendous growth period that we\u2019ve had is increase our dividend. I guess, it\u2019s the past six years in a row at $0.07 a year and what we\u2019re saying here is by almost any measure we\u2019re looking at, we can maintain that kind of trajectory assuming that the Board agrees and everything else, but that\u2019s what we think. So you should think about earnings per share growth and dividend per share growth together and by saying, I think, we can keep that $0.07 trajectory going, I think, let\u2019s say that whatever happens in the near-term is benefited in the longer term.","Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay. Thank you so much.","Thomas A. Fanning","You bet.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Good afternoon, guys. Hey just industrial kind of showed nice up-tick in the quarter from what we\u2019ve seen of late, can you just may be give a little more color on to much where the breakdown of performance has been, but when you talk to all of your customers, what their expectations are in the year-end and for next year from a planning perspective?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, again, it\u2019s going to vary depending on the industry you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019d say auto transportation is going to continue to expand and I believe all of our manufacturers are operating two shifts five days a week, some more. We expect that certainly to continue. Primary metals has been kind of up and down depending on what the metal is being produced for. Obviously, automotive metal has been \u2013 demand has been pretty high, but construction materials and other steel related products has been \u2013 that might be elated towards the export market has been kind of spotty as well.","Our chemical numbers year-over-year looked down and that is because one of our bigger chemical companies closed one of their processes here in Georgia and so yield at the end of this year that will be removed from the process. So you should see a continuation of pretty strong performance in the chemical side. And again, housing-related stuff is really off a pretty low base. So \u2013 but we\u2019re pleased to see that they are improving. I think, Dan, it\u2019s probably a mixed bag and it\u2019s a little too soon for me to comment at this point, but we don\u2019t see a wholesale slowdown in the industrials sector.","Art P. Beattie","","Well, let me give you just a little more [indiscernible] here. The residential and kind of housing numbers are pretty interesting. We used to get about 70% of sales from single family home and with the economic recoveries and the pullback in the housing level, now with recovery, the number looks like 62% instead of 70%. So we're seeing more people come in. One of the other questions that we've all had as an industry, I know we've had a lot of fun talking about on these calls, has been the whole kind of consumption pattern of residential customers. One of the other issues that we \u2013 when you peel the onion on the numbers, we've seen more customers come in, there are houses with meters, but nobody's living there. There are people now trying to sell them again, where they didn't before. So you've got to factor all that stuff into account. So we actually think the trend here is positive.","Let me give you just a couple more things to keep your eye on. Domestic energy prices, particularly, good old Southern Company energy prices remain awfully strong relative to averages and I think that gives us the basis to compete well and gives us, I think, some good gunpowder, if you will, for companies to conveniently locate in our area. Another thing, exports, significant part of our industrial production goes to the export market as the worldwide markets continue to improve. We'll do it. One more and then I'll turn it over, but pipeline is interesting. Pipeline shows up as an industrial customer. Most time industrial customers are not sensitive to weather. In this case, pipelines were sensitive to weather. And in fact, I think it was our worst performing segment, but we think it was all weather related. So if you get more normal weather, more normal throughput, better performance.","Daniel L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Got it. That was interesting on the house flipping front. I guess, switching gears on Kemper and kind of these prudence reviews, can you just share where really was going to be a conversation and how that's at play relative to the $2.88 billion cap you guys already agreed on?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, I'll give my shot at it. Art, give yours. I mean, who knows, number one, I mean, we've got to have the prudence review and we're giving them all the documentation and everything else. Certainly, we are disappointed with the additional charges that we've recognized and what we believe will be a future loss. It would be amazing to me for somebody to come up with an argument that for at least the first $2.88 billion that we are in prudent, knowing that we are writing off now on a pre-tax basis over $1 billion. I would find that a very tough argument to make.","Art P. Beattie","I think it's also important to note that under Mississippi Law, as I understand it, that an assumption of prudence has to be made and that there has to be proof of imprudence when you go through the whole process. So it's something that's been clarified here as of late.","Thomas A. Fanning","And I'll just tell you some, I mean, we believe the problem at Kemper was essentially at the time that we made a fixed price commitment with 10% engineering done at 6.7% contingency. In other words, the problem has been more and more a lack of engineering that was completed, rather than construction. By all accounts, the construction of Kemper has gone very well.","Daniel L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Got it. And I guess just last one, Tom. I know you guys can talk to this next quarter, but when we think about the acceleration of growth, just kind of big bucket wise, is that going to be driven by infrastructure replacement, is that going to be driven by reacceleration in power demand or what do you think are the things in the horizon that\u2019s going to facilitate a higher rate of growth?","Thomas A. Fanning","Sure, it's higher rate of growth compared to kind of the 2016, 2017 timeframe. It's going to be more like this, I think, when you look at the integrated resource plans across the system, kind of the next timeframe of new generation will be in the early 20s. So let's just say 2023. So getting ready for that, starting construction, all that, will be one. That's for our retail operating companies, further. Southern Power, the Southern Power people work really hard to produce results. When I think about Southern Power this year; last year, they made something like, I don't know, $175 million and we've given them a stretch goal to improve that this year.","We think they've lost pre-tax something like $40 million on energy margins this year, just because the capacity factors of their equipment is lower, gas prices have gone up something like 80% off their lows, coal prices have come down a bit, especially as we shifted to western coal in the aggregate. So the other thing is we keep pushing Southern Power to go evaluate deals and go buy things that fit our business model. I can tell you, there is a lot out there for sale, but we are very disciplined and we have not pulled the trigger very much absent the solar deals we've announced on striking new deals. So we want to clear that inventory out of the way and accelerate Southern Power's own growth plan. We've also told you in prior calls that we're looking elsewhere, so Texas, MISO, PJM West, a variety of other things, where we might be able to find some more fertile ground. That also is a function of our reserve margins in the Southeast.","The other thing I would just mention is environmental spend; particularly ash, water, what else is down the road. The new rules that we're looking at, particularly, for ash and water, are bigger in nominal dollars than our incremental MATS costs. So we think that as we find the firm dates in which we have to comply effluent standard 316(b), CCB, Coal Combustion Byproducts, et cetera, we think those numbers will emerge at the kind of back end of the decade. So we'll be spending money there. Those are kind of the big buckets; new generation, Southern Power, environmental spend.","Daniel L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for that. I appreciate it.","Thomas A. Fanning","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hello, Greg. Greg? Don't tell me\u2026","Operator","Mr. Gordon, your line is open.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Sorry about that. I was on mute. Sorry I'm late. I was \u2013 I just hopped off another call.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, sure.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Just a follow-up on that line of conversation on the \u2013 I take it you said earlier in the call that you would see sort of a dip in growth in sort of the 2016, 2017 timeframe and then accelerate back up in the back half of the decade and I just heard the answer to the last question, which put some more bones around that. If I look at Slide 14 of your slide deck, it gives us 2013, 2014, 2015 CapEx by segment. So is \u2013 what you're \u2013 is what you're telling us that your new generation and environmental compliance spending will see a dip in 2016, 2017, and then reaccelerate later in the decade, but that T&D, maintenance, [indiscernible] general, the other things are sort of steady as it goes? Is that the right\u2026","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","\u2026way to think about it?","Thomas A. Fanning","That's a good way to think about it.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","And at Southern Power, you \u2013 Southern Power you think will also dip or you think you'll be able to find opportunities to spend there?","Thomas A. Fanning","We hope we'll find opportunities. By definition, we're a big EVA company and if we can find things that fit our business profile, we're not going to change long-term bilateral contracts, no field risk, creditworthy counterparties; we're going to keep the course there.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","Right.","Thomas A. Fanning","If we can find more deals, we'll do them. Gee whiz, we'll do them next year and the year after. The thing is, like I said, there is a lot for sale, it's just kind of junk in my view.

We said before, tax-advantaged investing to us requires a risk premium.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group Inc.","","Right. So \u2013 and that $2.4 billion over 2013, 2014, 2015, has always been to some degree, a place holder for opportunities, right?","Thomas A.

Hope you're well?","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","I am. Thank you.

There's a mine, there's a pipe and there's a plant. And what I said before was, we're already not charging Mississippi customers above $2.88 billion. That's what gives rise to these expected losses that we've been booking. In terms of inside of $2.88 billion, that's subject to kind of the company and the PSC to decide. My only point was given the cost above $2.88 billion that we've taken for our own account, I would find that to be a tough argument, but let the process go and we'll see.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then with this latest Kemper charge, how is that going to impact your equity needs into 2014 and 2015?","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Paul, we don't expect that they'll change from what we outlined on the last call. $700million this year, $600 million next and then 2015 will be dependent on other Southern Power projects or whatever, but right now, we may not see any need in 2015 or 2016, but we're still maintaining a target 44% equity ratio.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then it sounds like you \u2013 subject to the purview of the board, but you see $0.07 dividend hikes, is that the way to look at it or is it a percentage increase we should think about.","","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, I'm referring to is a $0.07 per share that we've been doing now for six years in a row. And all I am saying with that is you got to put the all right caveats there right. I can't sit here and guarantee everything for you. That is subject and is the purview of the Board, but I can say that based on every projection I've seen, we still need to work through all the he details, we have a lot of regulatory uncertainty still with Georgia and others. It looks like to me a dominant solution. I feel reasonably confident in saying that we can sustain that.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","But Tom, you sounded pretty optimistic about a Georgia settlement in your commentary. Did I interpret that properly?","Thomas A. Fanning","We've been treated constructively in this three-year process since 1995. I know there's been lots of questions before by people outside Georgia asking the Commission how will they rule, et cetera, et cetera, and I know that there's been a consistent theme of why should I hurt this company. Georgia continues to provide some of the best customer satisfaction, that's the middle \u2013 the center of our business model. We call it circle of life, but it in fact works. If we deliver reliability, low prices and the best customer service that translates into customer value. Our four companies among the national companies we follow are the top four in terms of customer value in the United States. So we see all of the fundamentals in place to continue a constructive relationship with the Commission. Outside of that, I have no color on how that will go. I just think we'll be treated fairly as we have in the past.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Are you going to do your triennial Investor Day in 2014?","Thomas A. Fanning","We are still considering that. As of this point, we haven't made any commitments.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hello, Ali.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hey, Tom, good afternoon.","Thomas A. Fanning","Good afternoon.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","I just wanted to clarify one or two things. One is to be clear, the fact that you will end at the low end of your guidance range for this year, are you attributing that all to weather or were there some other factors we should be thinking about as well?","Thomas A. Fanning","Vast majority of it is weather. If it was just economic growth, we could make that up easily. It's mostly weather. This is \u2013 we've never had a third quarter in our history we think that mattered $0.10 in weather.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And then year-to-date weather normalized growth, load growth has been pretty much flat or 0.1% down, can you remind us normalized, what do you see normalized load growth 2014 and beyond, how should we be thinking about that?","Thomas A. Fanning","","Well, and Ali, don't think of it year-to-date flat, all that. Think of it as we suggested. The profile of growth this year has been almost exactly what we thought it would be, except it has been a bit attenuated, right. So the first six months we thought would be flat. Well, in fact, it was flat, maybe slightly negative and you can fool around the edges on that. The last three months has been a little positive, plus 1% weather normal. We hoped it was going to be a little better than that, but that's because GDP is down. It's fascinating. We look at all sorts of things like all the fundamentals that we give you guys every quarter on the bottoms-up evaluations of the economy.","The other thing that like the Fed looks at too is this uncertainty index and the absolute level of this uncertainty index that's put out by some people coming out of the University of Chicago, shows that the nominal level of uncertainty is just about double what we've seen in history and importantly, the volatility of uncertainty is enormous compared to prior history. And so what we see now is not only a challenged economy, showing a recovery, although a bit feeble, we now have introduced event risk and when we see fiscal policy fail to resolve the issues of the day, we see all sorts of effects in the economy as a result.","People withholding spending and actually saving more money, not all a bad thing. We're seeing companies hold back a bit on capital expansion. We're seeing companies hold back a bit on employment. You know, we've got to get out of this logjam in Washington in order for the full potential of the economy to achieve it numbers. Down the road, we continue to see recovery. We see all the data. I think the only one Art didn\u2019t mention is the commercial recovery. We continue to see good, what you call them, [indiscernible] or whatever there, and typically that\u2019s our lagging indicator.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","And just, Tom, to be clear, I mean, as you look forward, remind us, I mean, you see sort of normalized growth what in the 1% to 2% range annually or..?","Thomas A. Fanning","1.3%.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","1.3%, okay. And then, Art, year-to-date, can you remind us how much equity actually has been issued?","Art P. Beattie","Can you hold on a second? It\u2019s about $500 million year-to-date. We need about $200 million more to get to our target. I think there is an appendix slide on the website, Ali that could give you that number as well.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it.","Art P. Beattie","One of things about weather normal, and I know I\u2019ve always said this is that it\u2019s more of an art than a science, but weather this year has been so abnormal that when we do and I know our load forecast folks shoot arrows at me when I say this, but when our models try to normalize it is using modeling from normal weather years. So when you take an abnormal year like this and try to figure out the weather impact, we don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting reliable numbers, but \u2013 so we think our growth could actually be a bit better than what we\u2019re reflecting.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah, and let me give you \u2013 I couldn\u2019t agree more with, Art, here is one more. Normally, when you think about weather adjustments, you got the temperature. It is clear that the rainfall has had a significant wet blanket on economic activity. People are going out less, spending less. We\u2019ve laughingly used in the past the traffic over the Pensacola Beach Bridge and beer sales out of the Walmart, people just didn\u2019t spend as much money. Shopping is down. So\u2026","Art P. Beattie","That comes from the Fed","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes. So there is a rainfall effect here, which is interesting, but we don\u2019t capture that.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Understood. Thanks a lot.","Thomas A. Fanning","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey Michael.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey Tom, hey Art. Just one or two questions on CapEx, I\u2019m just looking at the slide in the appendix from this quarter slide deck and last quarter slide deck. I want to make sure I understand what\u2019s happening here, it looks like you moved CapEx up and into 2013 at Mississippi Power, but then you backed down the back-end numbers there and them at Alabama Power it look like you raised the back-end numbers, but lowered 2013. I just want to make sure I understand the drivers there and then I want to follow-up on Southern Power.","Art P. Beattie","Yes, Michael I\u2019m going to have to get back to you on that, I don\u2019t have that detail, but we will be certainly glad to get you that information.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Also Southern Power, you had earmarked about $900 million of CapEx for 2013, we are basically at Halloween I just didn\u2019t know kind of where are you in that run rate and is that a number that\u2019s likely to come down and be a source of cash to the holding company in the next \u2013 as you kind of have to fund and burn, fund some of Vogtle.","Art P. Beattie","Yeah, we are about half of that at this point, somewhere around the 450 number is my recollection anyway.","Thomas A. Fanning","We thought there would be more gas deals around when we looked at another biomass deal we looked at other stuff and we just had them like what we are seeing.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Tom, you\u2019ve made some comments about Kemper County and kind of that the engineering versus construction processes. Given the fact that its an innovative technology, if you were sitting down a year or two, three years from now with some your peers and had to give them \u2013 give like a lessons learned or if I had to do over what would I do differently type. What else, are there other things you would have done significantly different and I\u2019m just really trying to think about this kind of longer term next 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, there is other companies in the industry have to do things that are technologically different than what they have traditionally done.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, let me give you a quick simple and that is, it would be do more front end engineering.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning","So that would be it, the other thing is we are seeing lots of potentials outside the United States, and here let me give you kind of two factors. We continue to innovate around TRIG that\u2019s the brand name of our technology and in fact there is this other technology we are working on, it\u2019s just a natural evolution at TRIG where we might capture as much as 100% of the CO2. Now we are far from being ready for prime time there, but the linkage of CO2 not as a way for something a value particularly with enhanced oil recovery, they have some potential. And so we are continuing to work on it. So look, we are very proud of TRIG we made a mistake on the engineering. We agreed to price cap without having done fully our homework on the deal and we planned to work. But I think down the road we\u2019ll find ways we think to the capital cost down and make the things economic.","The other thing people talk about and what we\u2019ll do is how can you do Vogtle? How you can Kemper with oil and gas prices well we have made probably the biggest shift in the industry from coal to gas. Southern Company is now the third largest consumers of natural gas in United States. Everybody knows I\u2019m bullish on natural gas but we cannot put all our eggs in that basket. We must find innovative solutions to go forward okay.","Final point, we are now engaged in some discussion around the world China, Pakistan, Indonesia, Australia, Poland. I\u2019ll be in Washington on November 7 \u2013 6, 7 with Secretary and other energy Secretaries from International companies talking about the applicability of TRIG or any improvements to TRIG that we make down the road. And think about it why it would it might make sense there rather than hear? Well, because they may not have advantages of natural gas industry that\u2019s been created through fracking and so if they don\u2019t places like China, Indonesia, Australia, Poland at all may have near-term uses for this kind of technology.","So look, I guess to summarize quickly do more homework upfront understand the risk of a price cap it would be we are going to continue to innovate and we are very proud of this technology we think it\u2019s got great promise in the future we are continuing to work on it.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated.","Thomas A. Fanning","","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Julia?","Art P. Beattie","","Julian?","Operator","Sir, your line is open.","","Thomas A. Fanning","Operator you can go to the next question.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Kit, how are you?","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","Tom, how you\u2019re doing? Hi, Art?","Thomas A. Fanning","","Dynamite. Good to hear from you.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","Just a couple of kind of incremental bits of information when to go with that growth rate in sales, what\u2019s your assumption about the kind of longer term five, seven years growth rate in O&M as you go forward.","Art P. Beattie","Well, yeah Kit this is Art. You look at O&M and we have a hard time defining normal in O&M these days. As we look back in time and we just look at our operating company O&M levels over the last four years and if you normalize it for things like the Daniel lease at Mississippi, we\u2019ve been relatively flat a non fuel O&M since 2010.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","And how many assets have you added.","Art P. Beattie","And we have added over the $7 billion of plant and service during that time, including Unit 2 in Georgia around the McDonough, 2500 megawatts of natural gas units, we\u2019ve added scrubbers and SCRs around the system. All of these assets require O&M. So we\u2019ve been able to absorb that around the weather and economic impacts that we have suffered through for the last two years.","Thomas A. Fanning","So let me just say it differently. So assuming, accounting for increases in assets, increasing the inflation, we\u2019ve actually had declining real O&M level.","Art P. Beattie","That\u2019s correct.","Thomas A. Fanning","Over four years.","Art P. Beattie","Now you asked a question well what did we plan. How do we plan from there? I would take, this is kind of just a slingshot over the back here, but take a couple of hundred million, maybe $250 and added it to our current, maybe our current 12 months ended numbers and add 3.5% to it a year and that would give you a normal process or expectation around O&M.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","3%?","Art P. Beattie","Yes.","Thomas A. Fanning","That's reasonable Yeah.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","And then one other item related to the discussion of the feature and things you don\u2019t want to be pinned down on some, but obviously just doing the arithmetic if your growth rate in EPS is likely to slow some and yet you keep up the rate of growth of the dividend and the payout ratio increases. What level of payout ratio are you comfortable with?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes right, so that\u2019s the obvious math right. And remember we said that EPS has a shape now, so we have a trajectory that you are going to be flattened a bit and then revamp. So remember where the payout ratio would rise in the time of flattening, you\u2019re going to be much more cash flow positive. So from a credit metrics, cash flow covers or dividend or however, you want to think about that, we can sustain a higher payout ratio. So we wouldn\u2019t be afraid at all going above 75, I don\u2019t see any scenario right now credibly that would get us north of 80, but I think we could be in the 75 and north range. But I think that would be fine for us to I think longer term we would work it back down. It\u2019s more important for us to have regular predictable sustainable increases in the dividend policy we understand how important that is to investors and I feel confident that we are going to able to sustain that assuming the broad goes along with that.","Art P. Beattie","Right.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","Thank you.","Art P. Beattie","Hey Kit.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Partners LP","Yes sir.","Art P. Beattie","As our comment, O&M comment. That may not be level across all our operating companies, you may see company increasing if their \u2013 for example Georgia Power putting the Vogtle 3 and 4 into service, you are going to see some elevated levels of O&M around the those assets.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financial","And McDonough.","Art P. Beattie","Yes. So those numbers may not work by an operating company standard.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financial","Right. Fair enough. But if you bring them all up to consolidate them at the Southern level that should be the \u2013 sort of rough approximation.","Art P. Beattie","Yes. Yes.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Financial","Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, Mark.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Research","Hey, good afternoon everyone. It\u2019s been a long call, so I won\u2019t pepper you too much. I just have a quick question on something \u2013 the NRC staff release last week. They were talking about greater coordination of safety or severe accident management guidelines, now it might be a very small item given the size of Southern, but I\u2019m just curious if you think that there is something in there that might meaningfully impact cash operating cost for nuclear.","Thomas A. Fanning","No. We meet all the time on this stuff. You wouldn\u2019t believe \u2013 I guess the between me and Mark Crosswhite our COO board members we go to NSRB Nuclear Safety Review Board where we go to each of our plants and evaluate all the details of the operations of the unit. Our OPCo CEO of Macquarie and Paul Bowers of Georgia, Macquarie and Alabama go these meetings. We have board meetings at Southern Nuclear, we meet all of time on these issues, as well at our management council meetings we evaluate kind of budget to actual performance and projections of all our business units including nuclear. While these are important issues that you are kind of highlighting here, we don\u2019t think is a significant budget issue and we\u2019ll be able to work through anything coming our way here. This is not one of the issues that\u2019s going to be a driver to an investor\u2019s decision in a material way.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Research","Okay. I think it\u2019s seems that its still something that\u2019s up in the air and there seems there might even be some internal disagreement, but do you have any feel for what if any \u2013 whether it\u2019s a small item or not what if any real changes might be brought about by any such I guess coordination of SAMG.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, Mark you know what I would rather do here, I would rather gets you on a phone with some of our nuclear guys and talk about that, just talking about that in isolation really doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Remember we had the whole post Fukushima things and we are going to do hydrogen venting and a whole lot of other issues. I can just tell you looking at the budgets of our nuclear business they do grow, but its nothing that\u2019s going to way down our ability to deliver financial results if you want a lot of detail I can put you with the right people.","Mark Barnett \u2013 Morningstar Research","Thanks and I\u2019ll do that.

Fanning","Hey, Mitchell.","Mitchell Moss \u2013 Lord Abbett & Co.","","Hey, guys. Two quick questions. One, I noticed on the September versus October status reports that you just put out there was a point about the process piping installation and it looks like the number went down by a percent. I wanted to make sure I understand what went on there and how you know I guess is there a problem or on the construction end or what happened?","Thomas A. Fanning","Okay, yes hi, Mitchell. We are going to probably want to get back to you on that by only sense could be that is kind of production and weather related as I described earlier on the call, but we\u2019ll get you the specifics on that, you\u2019re looking at a specific I think regulatory report, probably what you are looking at.","Mitchell Moss \u2013 Lord Abbett & Co.","Yes.","Thomas A. Fanning","We\u2019ll get back to you, call us back later and we\u2019ll figure that out for you.","Mitchell Moss \u2013 Lord Abbett & Co.","That\u2019s okay and then on the upcoming milestones, there was previously you had said that this steam turbine synchronization was going to be at the end of October, so\u2026","Thomas A. Fanning","We are synchronized","Mitchell Moss \u2013 Lord Abbett & Co.","You synchronized.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Mitchell Moss \u2013 Lord Abbett & Co.","Okay so that\u2019s being completed. So it looks like there weren\u2019t any other 90 day milestones coming up or at least listed so are there \u2013 what should be paying attention to you know in your significant benchmarks.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, Mitchell I think one thing we\u2019ve mentioned in the past was with first gasifier heat up and that was originally schedule I think December, now it looks like mid to late second quarter.","","Mitchell Moss \u2013 Lord Abbett & Co.","Okay, so that\u2019s a next major milestone that we should be paying attention for?","Art P. Beattie","That\u2019s correct.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, finish the piping [indiscernible] going. So going so far, it\u2019s been going very well we\u2019re 60% through start up something like that 50%.","Art P. Beattie","Right.","Thomas A. Fanning","And it\u2019s going well.","Art P.

Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors LLC","Okay. Just one thing I was confused that they came up earlier in the call, maybe, I just wasn\u2019t aware of it. But just on Mississippi on the $2.88 billion, did you say there is going to be a prudence review around that, I thought that was on the Southern [ph] Stone?","Thomas A. Fanning","Well, no. there has always been a prudence review associated with the project. I guess as we outlined in our opening remarks, there is going to be one kind of in the spring of 2014 that will cover, I think through 2013. And then we\u2019ll \u2013 through the March of 2013 and then expenditures beyond March of 2013 to in-service we\u2019ll have another prudence review on that, that\u2019s always been the case.","Andy S. Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors LLC","Okay, I apologize.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, no problem.","Andy S. Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors LLC","I thought the 2.88 is kind of guaranteed and there was no risk to losing that, but I guess that was wrong on that?","Thomas A. Fanning","I suspect that\u2019s probably isn\u2019t true for anything in the utility industry.","Andy S. Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors LLC","Fair enough. and then just the last question on Southern Power.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Andy S. Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors LLC","Anything that you end up doing whether it\u2019s down in Texas or outside of your Southern footprint would be contracted right we\u2019re not talking any of merchant type?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yeah. I said that before, we don\u2019t believe in the merchant model, we think it doesn\u2019t serve customer\u2019s interest in the long run and our business model, remember is long-term bilaterals, creditworthy counterparties, no transmission or fuel risk, things like that. We\u2019re going to stay on that case. that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t done a lot of deal, like I said, there is s lots of stuff for sale and we kick every tire we see, but we are very disciplined in what we\u2019re doing. So the lack of selling and buying projects of Southern Power is not because they aren\u2019t out there, because we don\u2019t like what we see.","Andy S. Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors LLC","Great, okay. I\u2019ll see you guys in a week. Thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning","Certainly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, Ashar.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium Asset Management LP","Hi, good afternoon, Tom. I had two questions, one is factual question going to page eight of the earnings package and this shows the financial overview of earnings as reported by each subsidiary for year-to-date as well as quarter-to-date. And I\u2019m focusing on Mississippi Power, just wanted to make sure I\u2019m doing my numbers correctly. Year-to-date, the net income is a $115 million and had back nearly $48 million write off, so it\u2019s a $163 million. I guess, prior to the write off 2012 year-to-date and then if I take the 2013 year-to-date, I\u2019m adding $704 million to the negative $490 million, I get to $214 million. So am I correct Mississippi Power\u2019s earnings are up year-to-date about $50 million versus I guess, everyone else is like flat or down, but am I correct in my interpretation that there\u2019s a $50 million improvement in Mississippi Power earnings year-to-date?","Art P. Beattie","Yeah, I believe you are. It\u2019s mostly AFUDC once you net out all the ex-items that you mentioned.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium Asset Management LP","","Okay. Okay. And then, Tom, I just wanted to get, as we \u2013 as you have kind of mentioned strategically you are at looking into the next kind of decade in terms of growth and all that, one thing \u2013 when you were the CFO in your CFO role in the latter past \u2013 in the latter half of the last decade, one thing which was very clear about Southern was and you propagated and you, I guess, you guys still do was risk adjusted returns being very, very superior. What I\u2019m trying to understand is that as you guys were kind of like planning for this decade, where did the miss come that, whey did, I mean, it seems like what\u2019s hurting is that you started two highly risky projects at the same time. So I\u2019m just trying to see what would happen \u2013 did the management review that in terms of what you guys were and taking on such two risky projects all at the same time as to why that didn\u2019t come into the mind, because now we are suffering from that risk adjusted \u2013 we have become a much more riskier company as the implementation is going through. So I just wanted to understand, did those things come into mind or what drove the decisions to pursue two projects simultaneously at the same time?","","Thomas A. Fanning","","There are days I ask myself I suppose, gee whiz, you have to put yourself in the contest of the time in which decisions were made. I think management at that time felt that there was pretty robust growth. A lot of the planning and all that occurred before the downturn in the economy and we were seeing pretty robust growth and so we have always felt about the broad portfolio, we felt that the nuclear program, which is actually going exceedingly well had the right supports in place to make it effective. And so my sense is around Vogtle 3 and 4 it\u2019s a terrific project, its going along terrifically, we\u2019ve had terrific support, support by the Governor, the PSC, the Legislature of the General Assembly in Georgia, the Administration in Washington, Congress, both was going great.","The only kind of black cloud here is Kemper and I have said many times that while we are very proud of the technology that we developed along with our partner KBR, remember originally Kemper that technology was going to get built in Orlando, but it was going to get built without CCS, when we moved it to Mississippi we combined CCS with enhanced oil recovery. And we made a strategic mistake back then, we committed to do the deal with a price cap without enough engineering being done, that would be my sense of it.","Recall also the state of Mississippi within an interesting position where failing to do Kemper County would have subjected them about, I forgot what the number would be 70% to 90% of gas for their electricity generation and from a public policy standpoint I think the regulator of Mississippi didn\u2019t want to have that much volatility of energy production tied up in that fuel resource. There was a host of issues, but if you think going forward how well Vogtle was going, we definitely would take in our shots on Kemper. I think when you consider all of the efforts in Alabama, all of the other efforts in Georgia outside of Vogtle, all of what is going on at Gulf and really the work in Mississippi outside of Kemper.","Southern is and Southern was. We continue to deliver value to customers everyday, products and reliability customer service. And I think if you want that underscore it is a notion that our customer value numbers had been terrific for a long time, we are the top four among the companies we survey. I don\u2019t think Southern \u2013 I think Southern is going to be fine in the long run; its just getting through Kemper is the issue.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium Asset Management LP","","Okay thank you.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.

Fanning","Hey Dan.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So just a couple here, you mentioned I think on Vogtle how you are in the final phase potentially these DOE loan guarantees.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","","And I was just curious, you also mentioned in your appendix on financing needs that could be up to $2.5 billion I think. So would that tend to mitigate the needs for Georgia Power to enter the public debt markets?","Thomas A. Fanning","Absolutely.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","And remember that timeframe.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay.","Thomas A. Fanning","You got it. You got it exactly right.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","And then on \u2013 I\u2019m trying to understand on from Mississippi Power given the billion plus of write-offs obviously that would have a big impact I would imagine on the equity and the capital structure. How do you account for that in the right making process given that your shareholders are taking the brunt of those write-offs, would you use like an imputed capital structure, how do \u2013 for rate marking purposes how would your capital structure, the equity in your capital structure being?","Thomas A. Fanning","The equity is \u2013 the equity here has already taken place and we will replace the equity as we commence the additional capital that we\u2019re investing in Kemper. So the additional $1.1 billion will be financed with a portion of equity from Southern and it will help restore by the end of 2014, their equity ratio to about a 50% or so level.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So you won\u2019t try to do on the impeded capital structure, you\u2019ll just use whatever happens to be with that hit that was basically taken by the shareholders for coming up with a cost of capital per rate making you are saying.","Thomas A. Fanning","That\u2019s correct.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, that\u2019s all I was wondering. Thanks.","Thomas A. Fanning","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey, Vedula.","Art P. Beattie","Hey, good afternoon.","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US, Inc.","How are you?","Thomas A. Fanning","Good, how are you?","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US, Inc.","I\u2019m okay. You were talking a bit about the back-end of the decade and particularly in terms of place holders and CapEx the churn in cash flow. I\u2019m wondering can you kind of maybe range off maybe over like the five year period 2016 through 2020 or whatever you feel like you can. What type of cash flow flexibility you think you are going to have over and above maintenance CapEx and everything like that and that might be available because it seems like that you have a chance depending that this might be a period of time that would kind of look somewhat similar to periods of mid 90s after you just completed Vogtle.","Art P. Beattie","Yes, hey Vedula I appreciate your interest in that kind of number, we\u2019ll give you more updates in January. We\u2019re just not prepared to go there right now.","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP US, Inc.","","All right. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Fanning","","Sure, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your questions.","Thomas A. Fanning","Hey Paul.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Hi, how is it going?","Thomas A. Fanning","Dynamite. How are you?","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Well you know managing. Just wanted to sort of follow-up on Kemper, just I know that there is always a disclaimer and everything, but there was this discussion there about some uncertainties associated with what could happen with future expenses costs overruns what have you. Can you give just any sort of flavor as to how you feel about that now with the latest update that you have given us?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, the numbers we\u2019ve given you are based on everything, every piece of information that we know right now. Essentially the information we\u2019ve given you is consistent with the information that we\u2019ve suggested in the past, that any schedule change is worth about $15 million to $25 million, if you just want to do\u2014I always love kind of dumb math, simple math. $15 million to $20 million a month if you go six-month times $25 million to the $150 million and we\u2019ve retained in light of that $100 million of contingencies. That\u2019s how you get to where we are. Of the $150 million there\u2019s still $100 million of contingency in there.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Okay, but I mean in terms of just qualitatively speaking, one would think as time goes on and as you guys sort of reach certain milestones of what have you, that\u2019s the uncertainty level would go down.","Thomas A. Fanning","So I see, I see.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Do you see them sort of staying I mean or\u2026","Thomas A. Fanning","Sure.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Sometimes maybe not, maybe like you uncover something there, well actually it\u2019s not that\u2019s what I\u2019m tying to get feel for?","Thomas A. Fanning","I\u2019m sorry, yes; I see what you are saying. Yes the risk should start converging. So clearly now the risks are moving away from construction, because we\u2019re converging on the completion of construction and the risks are shifting more to start-up risks. And as we have said on the prior calls, I know, several calls the big start-up risk goes to I think the integration of the implementation and control environment at Kemper. Recall, we have an electricity island, we had a gasification, we have a gas handling system. And so that\u2019s kind of what big risk I think and start-up will involve. Now we are doing everything prudent in our power to anticipate that environment, we model; we already have teams in teams in place to assess it. But that\u2019s probably is how the risk moves. So clearly construction risk is converging maybe you got a start-up risk.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Okay. And then in terms of sales growth and EPS growth and I know that you are not going to give us really anything until January, if I understand you guys correctly, you\u2019re giving sort of this qualitatively how it may flow through in the next couple of years, just from a very general kind of concept as appose to the specifics. I assume that\u2019s correct, I mean, there\u2019s no way of \u2013 I\u2019m not going to be able to get out of your sort of any relative numbers. Is that correct?","Thomas A. Fanning","","That\u2019s correct.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Okay I just wanted to check. So your potential that you might actually also reassess the long-term sales growth at that point in time or is that sort of a separate issue? It\u2019s more of a CapEx issue you guys are looking at that or in terms of the O&M. Things other than sales growth that will be making sort of the sort of the determination as to what you guys will be providing us in January?","Art P. Beattie","","We do the whole thing Paul, we started with the low forecast and then we put every piece together after that. So that the annual cost as we go through.","Thomas A. Fanning","But it\u2019s all the package.","Art P. Beattie","Yes.","Thomas A. Fanning","It\u2019s altogether.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","So it\u2019s all of that, so is everything is really actually reviewed.","Art P. Beattie","Yes.","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes, I\u2019m sure, I\u2019m sure.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Okay. So we\u2019ll see what happens, okay. Thanks so much, all my other questions have been asked.","Thomas A. Fanning","Thank you.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates, LLC","Take care guys.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?","Thomas A. Fanning","Yes. I just want to say, thank you so much for your attendance on the call. We went over a lot of interesting territory. It\u2019s a little unusual for us to talk about kind of longer term performance. But since it\u2019s been such an interesting topic that many of your are writing about we felt that it was a good things to kind of highlight. We continue to work hard and making Kemper as successfully as it can be. We feel confident in our ability to execute there. Everything else at Southern is going well. When you look at Alabama, Georgia Gulf, the rest of the Mississippi when you look at our fundamentals Southern is performing as well as it ever had. We got to get Kemper build and operational and we\u2019ll be in great shape. We thank you so much for your attendance this afternoon and look forward to talking with you soon in Florida. Take care.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings call. You may now disconnect."]}}
