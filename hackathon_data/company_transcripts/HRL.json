Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Jana Haynes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jana L. Haynes","","Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods' conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6.30 A.M. Eastern Time. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our Web-site at www.hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.","On our call today is Jeff Ettinger, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jody Feragen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jeff will provide a review of the operating results for the quarter and the year along with our guidance for fiscal 2015. Then Jody will provide detailed financial results for the quarter and the year. The line will be open for questions following Jody's remarks.","As a courtesy to other analysts, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If you have additional queries, you are welcome to get back into the queue. An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 11.30 A.M. Central Time today, November 25, 2014. The dial-in number is 888-203-1112 and the access code is 9752232. It will also be posted to our Web-site and archived for one year.","Before we get started with the results of the quarter and the year, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the statements we will be making.","Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the Company are fluctuations in costs and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products. Please refer to pages 31 through 37 in the Company's 10-Q for the quarter ended July 27, 2014, which was filed on September 5,2014, for more details. It can be accessed on our Web-site.","Additionally, please note the Company uses non-GAAP results to provide investors with a better understanding of the Company's operating performance, by excluding the impact of certain non-recurring items affecting comparability. Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate Web-site.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Thank you, Jana, and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report a strong finish to fiscal 2014. Earnings in the fourth quarter were a record $0.63 per share, up 9% from a year ago, on sales of $2.5 billion, also a 9% increase. For the full year, the Company earned a record $2.23 per share, representing a 14% increase over last year. We also achieved record sales of $9.3 billion, an increase of 6%.","I will now take you through each segment. In addition to discussing segment results, I will also provide an operating profit margin guidance range for each segment, which is our estimate of margin potential over the next few years given our current business structure, product mix and typical market volatility.","Grocery Products segment profit was down 21% in the fourth quarter with sales down 3%. High meat input costs and related pricing actions hampered the growth of some of our brands, including Hormel chili and Hormel Compleats microwave meals. On the positive side, HORMEL bacon toppings, WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips and HERDEZ authentic Mexican foods grew during the quarter. For the year, segment profit was down 9% and sales were up 3%.","We continue to support our iconic brands. This year we increased our Grocery Products' advertising spend by over 20%. At the end of September, we kicked off a national SKIPPY peanut butter advertising campaign after many years off air. Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2015, we will integrate Fresherized Foods, the maker of WHOLLY GUACAMOLE, into our sales and distribution systems to give this brand the full benefit of our consumer products sales force capabilities.","Going forward, we will report 100% of the estimated $200 million in sales in our Grocery Products segment revenue. We will continue to report only 50% of the Fresherized Foods earnings, net of tax, in the equity and earnings line of the Grocery Products segment.","Taking into account the addition of WHOLLY GUACAMOLE sales to our Grocery Products segment revenue, along with the similar integration of our other MegaMex Foods joint venture businesses in recent years, we expect Grocery Products segment operating margins to be within a range of 12% to 14% going forward.","Refrigerated Foods' fourth quarter operating profit increased 10%, with sales up 9%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was up a robust 45% and sales increased 9%. Pork operating margins were a significant driver to the higher results this quarter. The Refrigerated Foods team showed impressive leadership by managing through especially volatile market conditions this past year and achieving excellent business results in the face of tight raw material supplies.","Our Foodservice Group continues to deliver growth in our Refrigerated Foods segment with innovative solutions for Foodservice operators. These include products such as our HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats and HORMEL Bacon 1 Fully Cooked Bacon, along with continued growth of HORMEL fully cooked sausages.","On the retail side of the business, the reformulation and packaging updates of our HORMEL side dishes introduced just under a year ago have led to restored sales growth. HORMEL BLACK LABEL bacon and HORMEL party trays also delivered sales gains this quarter.","Effective at the end of fiscal 2014, we dissolved our Precept Foods partnership by mutual decision with Cargill Meat Solutions. Sales of $115 million were associated with this business, but we do not anticipate a material impact to segment profit as a result of this change. Given our current product mix and taking commodity volatility risk into account, we expect Refrigerated Foods operating profit margins to be within a 5% to 8% range over the next few years.","Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to build momentum delivering increased segment profit of 45% on a sales increase of 11% during the quarter. For the full year, operating profit was up 23% and sales increased 4%. Results at Jennie-O Turkey Store in the quarter were driven by continued growth in value-added sales, along with high commodity turkey prices. JENNIE-O lean ground turkey and JENNIE-O turkey bacon led sales growth this quarter.","We increased our Jennie-O Turkey Store advertising spend this year with a Make The Switch campaign that started early in fiscal 2014, featuring ground turkey tacos. We plan to continue this advertising campaign in new U.S. markets early in fiscal 2015. We expect Jennie-O Turkey Store segment operating profit margin to be within the 13% to 17% range going forward.","Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 14% and a sales increase of 31%. Excluding sales of CytoSport products, sales were down 4%. Full year results for Specialty Foods showed operating profit down 20% with sales down 3%. Full year sales excluding CytoSport were down 11%.","We are pleased with our team's initial integration of the CytoSport business as we have started to leverage Hormel Foods strength in operating efficiencies, food, drug and mass marketing capabilities, and purchasing synergies to maximize the potential of this business. Excluding deal related costs and acquisition adjustments, CytoSport performed in line with our expectation this past quarter. We expect Specialty Foods segment operating profit margins to be within a range of 8% to 11% going forward.","International & Other's fourth quarter operating profit increased 3%, with sales up 13%. Higher meat input costs pressured International segment margins during the quarter. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was up 19% and sales also increased by 19%. Our International team continues to do an excellent job expanding our business in China.","To support that growth, we are announcing the construction of a new Refrigerated Foods plant in China, slated to open in the back half of fiscal 2016. This facility will produce pepperoni, bacon, ham and other refrigerated meat items sold in the foodservice and retail channels within China. Our expectation for International segment operating profit margins is a range of 14% to 17% over the next few years.","From a total Company perspective, we anticipate operating profit margins in the 9% to 12% range, given our current business structure, product mix and typical market volatility.","Moving into fiscal 2015, we expect to exceed our stated 5% sales and 10% earnings growth goals. We look for pork commodity prices and pork operating margins to normalize as the year progresses. We anticipate commodity pork prices will exhibit some volatility in fiscal 2015 with PEDV still lingering in domestic herds but not to the degree experienced in fiscal 2014.","Lower meat protein prices will eventually provide input cost relief for our Grocery Products segment but will lead to challenging comparisons for our Refrigerated Foods segment. We plan to increase pork production by 1% to 2% over fiscal 2014 numbers.","Lower corn prices should benefit Jennie-O Turkey Store throughout next year, offset to some degree by stubbornly high soymeal cost. We expect commodity turkey prices to normalize as fiscal 2015 progresses, down from the extremely high prices experienced in 2014. We plan to increase turkey production modestly in fiscal 2015 to support our value-added businesses, on the heels of no increase to our production level last year.","In our Specialty Foods segment, we continue to expect the CytoSport business to deliver earnings accretion of $0.05 per share in 2015, as disclosed in our acquisition call earlier this summer. We look for our China business, along with our exports of SKIPPY peanut butter and pork products, to drive growth in the International segment in fiscal 2015.","We will continue building our brands in 2015 with a double-digit increase in our advertising support over the prior year. We will focus advertising dollars on our Jennie-O Make The Switch campaign, REV snack wraps, our SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter and MUSCLE MILK protein rich products.","Late yesterday we informed our team that we will cease operations at our Grocery Products manufacturing facility in Stockton, California effective the end of February 2015. This was a difficult decision but a necessary step given available capacity and other more modern dry grocery facilities in the Company.","We are also considering a potential exit from operations in Vietnam early in fiscal 2015, which have been part of a larger joint venture in the region. This business which includes hog production, feed mill and a processed meats facility, all located in Vietnam, has not delivered the results we expect from our international investments.","As a result of the closure of the Stockton facility and the potential exit from the Vietnam business, we expect nonrecurring expenses of $0.04 to $0.06 per share to impact our profits in the first half of fiscal 2015. We are providing details about these anticipated nonrecurring items to allow better visibility of our long-term operating performance expectation.","After taking all of these significant factors into account, we have established our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP adjusted earnings guidance range at $2.45 to $2.55 per share, excluding the expected nonrecurring charges. Our balanced model continues to benefit our performance, as evidenced by our track record of increased earnings in 27 of the last 30 years. We believe our strong brands in niche categories and our focus on innovation position us to continue to drive superior growth and shareholder value.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Net earnings for fiscal 2014 fourth quarter totaled $171.3 million or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $157.3 million or $0.58 per share a year ago. Net earnings for the 12 months of fiscal 2014 totaled $602.7 million or $2.23 per share, compared to net earnings of $526.2 million or $1.95 per share a year ago.","Dollar sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.5 billion compared to $2.3 billion last year, a 9% increase. For the full year, dollar sales were $9.3 billion, a 6% increase from last year. Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.34 billion pounds, up 3% from fiscal 2013. For the full year, volume was 5 billion pounds, up 1% over last year.","When we announced the acquisition of CytoSport, we indicated that the acquisition would have a neutral impact on fiscal 2014 earnings, net of transaction costs. Besides the expected transaction costs of $4.8 million, we incurred the fair value inventory adjustment of $4.5 million, which negatively impacted the results of our Specialty Foods segment. The inventory adjustment was not included in our original guidance. As previously stated, we expect CytoSport to contribute approximately $0.05 per share to our fiscal 2015 results.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 6.5% of sales, compared to 6.3% last year. For the full year, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7% of sales compared to 7.2% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.5% and 7.8% of sales for fiscal 2015. The growth over fiscal 2014 will come as a result of plans for the increased advertising Jeff alluded to, including the marketing associated with CytoSport.","Advertising expense for the fourth quarter was $22.4 million compared to $16.6 million last year. The increase over the prior year was primarily associated with advertising for CytoSport products in the Specialty Foods segment and the national advertising campaign for HORMEL REV Wraps.","Equity in earnings of affiliates was $5.7 million in the fourth quarter versus $2.1 million last year. The increase is largely the result of improved earnings at our MegaMex joint venture. Interest and investment income was $0.8 million for the fourth quarter compared to $2.5 million last year. Year-to-date interest and investment income was $3.2 million compared to $5 million the year ago.","Interest expense for the quarter was $3.4 million compared to $3.1 million last year. Year-to-date interest expense was $12.7 million, up from $12.5 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2015.","Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 34.1% versus 33.9% in fiscal 2013. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 34.3% compared to 33.6% last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 34.5%.","The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 263.6 million and 263.8 million shares respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 269.8 million and 270.2 million shares respectively.","We repurchased 666,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, spending $30.9 million. For the full year, we spent $58.9 million purchasing 1.3 million shares. We have 8.2 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.","Total debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. During the fourth quarter, we repaid our line of credit used to fund the CytoSport acquisition.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $47.3 million, compared to $38 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $159.1 million compared with $106.8 million last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $180 million to $200 million.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.9 million, compared to $31.9 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $130 million compared to $125 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015.","We announced a $0.20 per share increase to the annual dividend, making the new dividend $1. This represents a 25% increase, after an 18% increase last year and marks the 49th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I will go first to Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Ken Zaslow","Can we just talk about the guidance for a second? I was just surprised by the muted tone of it. I guess when I think about it, if I strip out the CytoSport and I strip out some of the weather and issues that you happened to have last year, which I thought was going to recur, it seems like the internal growth is about mid-single digits. First of all I guess my question is, did I do my math right, and then second, does that strike you as the right balance, are you conservative on that, how do you think about that in terms of the internal growth, that's how I look at it?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Let me walk you through our thinking in terms of the guidance range that we've established for 2015. Starting with Refrigerated Foods, as we talked about earlier in the call, we do expect processing margins to not be as favorable as they were in 2014. Notwithstanding this, Refrigerated Foods we would expect to still grow modestly due to their value-added sales momentum in foodservice and with their retail brands and due to improved general efficiency, but it will be fairly modest growth in 2015 at a segment profit operating level.","This more favorable cost environment should help Grocery Products, so we do expect Grocery Products to rebound to more normal growth rates, plus the fact that they will no longer have the earn-out as part of Fresherized Foods in their costs. The favorable cost will also help International. We expect International to achieve its fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth. For both Grocery Products and International, there are certain lingering high costs in the inventory that will continue to sort of dampen their results in their opening quarter of the year, but as the year goes on we'll be working through that inventory.","Clearly Jennie-O Turkey Store, our expectation is to have another good year. They are in a more favorable grain environment, plus they have great value-added momentum, and this should move them towards the top of the operating profit range that we just articulated. That being said, there are some mitigating factors for Jennie-O Turkey Store. The grain benefit is partially offset by hedges. We've talked before about our hedge philosophy. The soymeal side of the grain formulas has remained stubbornly high. And we do have certain grain based contracts with foodservice customers within that segment.","Secondly, we expect the turkey commodity meat markets, which have been at an all-time high, to not be quite as favorable in 2015. And then third, we have approved an enhanced advertising budget for Jennie-O Turkey Store, the Make The Switch campaign has driven good results, and so we're going to be investing further there. In fact, overall advertising spending, as we talked about, was up double digits in 2014 for the whole Company and should be again in 2015.","For Specialty Foods, by the fourth quarter that the unit had recovered from the year-over-year SPLENDA change in business operations, their results were actually up modestly in Q4, if you don't count CytoSport at all. And so we expect again modest growth of the overall Specialty portfolio in 2015, plus they should attain the $0.05 a share benefit from the acquisition of CytoSport.","So for us, this adds up to a range of $2.45 to $2.55, exclusive of the nonrecurring events. The midpoint of this range is a 12% increase over the year we just completed, on top of the 14% increase we generated in 2014. So that's our thinking at least in terms of providing this kind of guidance range.","Ken Zaslow","That's great. And then just a follow-up, is the cost savings, is there a greater initiative at Hormel to focus on cost savings? I know obviously one facility you're closing down, you're thinking about the Vietnam, is there something that you're doing more broadly that we should be thinking about, maybe internal actions, and does it have to do with the retail environment, or these are just one-offs that I shouldn't read anything into it?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I guess I wouldn't read anything into it. I mean the timing on those types of decisions, I mean we've had the investment with our partner in Southeast Asia in the Vietnam operations for several years, and kind of given that we think a good try there but really feel we'd be better off focusing our attention elsewhere. In terms of the Stockton plant decision, I mean it's an older facility. We really had to kind of make a determination, do we pour more money into that facility or could we utilize the capacities we have available in more modern grocery facilities elsewhere in the U.S., and so we made that difficult decision for that reason.","Ken Zaslow","Great, I appreciate it.","Operator","We'll go next to Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc.","Farha Aslam","I noticed you had a considerable step-up in your CapEx expectations for 2015. Is there something incremental that you're investing in for next year?","Jody H. Feragen","Sure, Farha, this is Jody. Jeff talked about the new SPAM production facility that we're going to be \u2013 Refrigerated Foods production facility that we are building in China. So a portion of that plant will impact 2015. We had started the construction of additional SPAM lines domestically that will flow over into 2015 as well. And then we have several other initiatives that we're looking at to expand capacities for some of our product lines that are running at tighter capacities. So, yes, it is a step-up and then we have just the general repair and maintenance type CapEx that comes with operating many facilities across the country.","Farha Aslam","Right. And then in terms of capital allocation overall, it looks like you have a net debt-free balance sheet. Could you share with us your uses of cash and kind of your priorities in terms of how you look to deploy that capital going into next year?","Jody H. Feragen","We certainly took a good step forward with the 25% increase in the dividend that we made this year. So that's obviously something, a legacy that we are extremely proud of and would look to continue to do that going forward. We've made several acquisitions, SKIPPY in 2013 and then more recently the CytoSport acquisition in 2014. So we'll continue to look for opportunities there that fit with our strategies of brands that are number one or number two in the marketplace, transactions that can be accretive both from a margin perspective as well as overall profit, certainly looking for things that provide us the global footprint, and then more recently trying to look at things that fit more into a health and wellness type portfolio appealing to younger consumers addressing the snack area as well as our ability to add innovation to anything that we would purchase.","Farha Aslam","And then share repurchase?","Jody H. Feragen","You know that's probably a little more opportunistic. We did do some this year and I would expect that we'll take a look at doing that a little bit in 2015 as well.","Farha Aslam","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Larson with Janney Capital Markets.","Eric Larson","Thank you and happy Thanksgiving to everybody. I'd like to drill down just a little bit more on the cut-out margin. I think it's reasonable to assume that the cut-out margin would normalize a little bit more next year, but demand has remained I think a lot stronger than what we would have all expected. Now I think there can be a lot more competition from chicken next year as well, but can you \u2013 exports for pork have been particularly strong, can you try to put some of the demand context into that how you're looking at that cut-out margin?","Jody H. Feragen","Sure, I'll give the wheel here. We certainly have seen some volatility in those operating margins in the first part of our fiscal year in November here, so they've been a little bit all over the board, certainly lower than they were last year at this time from that perspective. We do expect to see hog numbers increase 3% to 3.5%, we're not taking our harvest up that high, but that should provide lots of availability. The demand seems to be the equation that we'll see what happens with that. We would expect the cut-outs to come off the historical highs that they have been and we've seen some of that come already. So our balance is that they're going to go back more to a normalized range, maybe not as low as the five-year average, and that's what we've used in our assumptions.","Eric Larson","Okay, alright. And then just one follow-up question on Jennie-O, obviously your ad campaigns have been very successful for your value-added products and you're going to bump up your advertising next year. Is part of that reflecting the fact that you might have easier fuel comps and fuel comparisons this upcoming winter, I mean Lord knows what that will be, but is part of the thinking that you'll just reinvest some of the positive variance in some of your operating costs in that division?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I mean we do pulse the advertising somewhat based on macro conditions, but clearly the Jennie-O brand has benefited from being on-air and from emphasizing this sort of Make The Switch theme, and the most recent version has been the taco campaign, but we had a burger campaign and a bacon campaign in prior years as well. Their plans right now are to kind of roll into some new markets with that advertising to support some product placements that we've been able to attain through our sales organization. And so, we'll definitely be on-air early in the year and we may complement that with more of a fall campaign as well.","Eric Larson","Okay, thank you. I'll pass it on.","Operator","We'll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","I want to spend a little time in Grocery, if we could, and talk about the volume outlook there. I think they were down 5% in the quarter and it's been really challenged for most of the year, and help us think about some of the product categories, I know there's been a big focus on Compleats over the course of the year to right that, but maybe a bit of context in terms of the categories where that have struggled this year and some of the actions that you're taking or anticipating can drive an improvement in 2015?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I mean on the positive side, as we talked about, I mean bacon business had a fantastic year. We have two brands within the Mexican portfolio that are really on a roll in terms of double-digit growth, the HERDEZ brand and WHOLLY, and now the WHOLLY sales in 2014 were not being reflected in our results. So that would have changed the year-over-year results had we had those in there, and starting in 2015 we will have that.","Our franchises, our iconic brands of SPAM and SKIPPY, had fairly flat Q4 results but both have what we hope are good solid marketing campaigns going forward and we expect growth out of both of those brands in 2015. The areas where we have struggled a little bit more have been some of the other traditional canned meat items, the Dinty Moore and the Hormel chilli items. And then we kind of continue to have coming up and down experience with our microwave meals, we are going to market with a little bit different tactics within that category in terms of tiered pricing and new offerings and we'll see if that works. That's our game-plan going into 2015.","Adam Samuelson","Okay, that's helpful. Maybe that rolls into my follow-up on the 5% plus sales growth target, I would imagine in spite of 3% growth from CytoSport, if that layers in, I think you're consolidating some different parts of the business that you haven't in the past, but I would imagine that the commodity price environment in pork and refrigerated as well as in turkey would be a little bit of a headwind, and so I guess I'm surprised that \u2013 am I thinking about it right that the 5% is really about acquisitions and some of the kind of consolidating different businesses as opposed to underlying with offsetting price declines and more flattish volume environment across the portfolio?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Pricing is always a wildcard. I mean our long-term revenue goal is a 5% goal. We actually expect to exceed that here in 2015, in part because of the WHOLLY brand coming onto Grocery sales. And so in general, I mean if you look at our long-term track record, we have actually exceeded the 5% over the last five years, but that is definitely with some assistance from acquisitions such as SKIPPY and the MUSCLE MILK acquisition.","So in general, clearly when I look at the grocery store environment, I think our perimeter based items, we do expect to be able to grow at that kind of a 5% clip. Center of the store, maybe not quite that robust, but we have had investments in acquisitions such as SKIPPY that have added to that portfolio and we think Mexican can definitely grow at that pace. Our Foodservice Group has done a nice job with that as well.","So our target kind of not counting acquisitions is certainly in the 3% to 4% range, and then we've been able to round that up by virtue of finding the right prospects periodically.","Adam Samuelson","Alright, that's very helpful. I'll pass it along.","Operator","We'll go next to Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler","I wanted to ask you about the normalized ranges that you provided this morning. It looks as if you've taken down the Grocery Products normalized margin by about 200 basis points, but you've improved your JOTS margin by 200 basis points. So my question is really in the Grocery Products segment, how much of the margin reduction is due to the fact that you'll be rolling in sort of 100% of the Fresherized Foods and what percentage is just due to your ongoing outlook for whatever tighter protein markets which impacts that margin or slower growth coming from the center of the store, is there any way to quantify for us what's going on with your outlook on the Grocery Products margins?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I can tell you for 2015, our expectation is that the net margin will be kind of equivalent to what you saw in 2014. So what you have there is the watering down effect of a lot of the Fresherized sales coming in with only half margin being reported, but an expected improvement in terms of \u2013 we said we had some very difficult operating cost challenges during 2014 and we don't expect those to recur. So altogether, those two factors should cancel each other out.","I guess I would also point out that if you take away MegaMex, so I mean you've got a great growing business with great consumer franchises but franchises that were accounting 100% of the sales and only half of the earnings and the after-tax of that in some cases, the core Grocery Products portfolio not counting MegaMex is still, we still look to be in the high teens in terms of their operating delivery. So we really don't feel we've seen a denigration in the portfolio, we just are seeing the impact of MegaMex rolling through there in terms of that range we just provided.","Jody H. Feragen","And I would add that MegaMex generally is growing at a little faster clip than our corp portfolio is.","Diane Geissler","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then I wanted to ask about the new plant in China. I think you said, peanut, bacon, ham, pepperoni, whatever, I'm assuming that's going to be under a branded, like Hormel brand, and I guess if you could just few more details about what your strategy will be in China, do you expect to open retail outlets, do you have partners there who will be providing the sourcing materials, I mean can you just give us a little bit more clarity on what your plans are when that plant opens in 2016?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. So right now we have three plants in China. One of them is a SKIPPY peanut butter plant, exclusively for that production, and so that one we won't count that right now but our team definitely operates that in terms of the G&A efficiencies of the total operation and it's a great sales vehicle for us in that and other markets.","We then have two other facilities that we've operated for more than a dozen years, one in Beijing and one in Shanghai, that produce these similar refrigerated based items. Our team has done a very nice job growing that business over time, I mean that's many times a 20% plus growth trajectory, and so as we project forward with the kind of business we have, we needed new plant capacity and so the team has been working on identifying kind of where that should be and how that would roll together.","And so that production in terms of the sourcing for the last several years, we buy meat from approved suppliers within the Chinese market, we don't raise hogs ourselves and we're not a basic slaughter in that market, but we're confident that we have sufficient meat suppliers to meet these growth needs that will go ultimately into that new plant.","Operator","We'll go next to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank.","Mario Contreras","You had mentioned PEDV briefly. I just wanted to maybe get a little bit more of your thoughts on what you've seen so far now that we're getting into the kind of early months of the core winter weather, and then how do you anticipate potential impact on profitability if prevalence is greater or less than maybe what you're expecting?","Jody H. Feragen","This is Jody. That certainly could be a wildcard. What we have seen in the industry is, it slowed down during the summer months as one would expect, as the weather seems to be more conducive in the winter when it's cold and damp, but we've also seen a lot of the producers really increase their bio security and I think that will have a positive impact on any further spread of the disease. So our assumption is that hog production should grow in the 3% to 3.5% for the industry as a whole and that assumes that there is a lot less impact than there was last year on PED.","Mario Contreras","Okay. And then one additional question, if I could, on the International segment, I believe you had indicated your volume was up 6%, but if I back out the benefit from SKIPPY China and CytoSport, is it fair to say that core volume was down, am I thinking about that right for that business?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I wouldn't want to do the math on the fly. I mean certainly it was flattish. It wasn't the best quarter either for SPAM in terms of we had high inputs and then some cases then had some deferred shipments to some of our export markets, and we had an uneven quarter in terms of SKIPPY, we have a couple of markets where it's going great but a couple of others where it receded somewhat. But overall, I mean they saw a double-digit growth on a full year basis for International last year and we expect a strong growth heading into 2015.","Mario Contreras","Okay, so I guess it sounds like maybe you view that as more of sort of a one-off weak quarter with some timing issues but strong when we look into 2015?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, with the other caveat that I mentioned earlier that from a margin standpoint International still will be kind of \u2013 SPAM is a major product line for example on the inventory carrying cost that they have from the spike in raw materials this summer will still impact them certainly through Q1, but after that they should be in better condition.","Mario Contreras","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale","Good morning and happy Thanksgiving. So first question is on SG&A, you mentioned you expect an increase next year. Can you address where you ended up this year? I believe came in a little bit less than what you were expecting. So is part of next year's increase a timing shift and if you can just give us a sense as to why this year's SG&A to sales came in lower than what you were expecting? That's my first question.","Jody H. Feragen","So, part of the driver for 2014 SG&A being somewhat lower was the timing of some compensation accruals we had last year but we didn't have this year. As far as 2015, the majority of that increase is really being driven by the increased advertising campaigns.","Akshay S. Jagdale","Okay. And then with your long-term guidance on margins, very helpful, what timeframe should we be thinking of that margin outlook to be? And you've made a lot of portfolio changes, Jeff, so in general where are your portfolios today versus where it was five years ago? I mean do you feel generally better about expanding margins longer-term as a whole or you feel better about the growth prospects, organic growth prospects of this portfolio?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I guess we're probably putting these ranges out as reasonable over the next three to four years. I mean things can change, both in macro conditions and in our businesses, so we would want to keep an eye on those and update those as those things make modifications.","In terms of your other question, I mean we certainly hope we've improved the portfolio over time, that's been the goal. I think it depends on which segment we're talking about as to whether the expansion of margins versus growth is the bigger area of emphasis. So clearly within Refrigerated Foods, that team understands very clearly that their mission is to expand margins. They had a very nice year this year in terms of moving upward and expect to hold that in 2015 and grow from there. In other areas such as Jennie-O Turkey Store or International, I think those are excellent growth opportunities. So the bigger those two pieces can become of our overall portfolio, the better off we'll be in the aggregate.","When we announced the CytoSport acquisition, we conceded that at least on an onboarding basis, it was kind of even with Specialty Foods' margins, but we do think that as we get our hands around that business and drive efficiency and growth going forward that that can start migrating those margins up, and so that was why that range has an upside to it that's above where they are at today. So it kind of depends on the area of the business.","Akshay S. Jagdale","That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert B. Moskow","Just a few kind of odds and ends questions. On Jennie-O, you said that you expected commodity turkey prices to be a little lower. Can you give me some of the drivers behind that? I thought supplies have been tightened quite a bit. Do you expect supplies to increase? Secondly, I think your competitor in peanut butter is taking a price cut. Are you going to do the same? And then lastly, I'm planning to visit your offices in January, any wardrobe recommendations for visiting Minnesota in January?","Jody H. Feragen","Boots and a long coat.","Robert B. Moskow","Alright, thank you for that.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","[Once you reach] [ph], we'll have you well taken care of. The roads are a different story.","Robert B. Moskow","No golf outing this year in January?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","We'll find you a simulator somewhere. I don't know, that would be a [better idea] [ph]. So let's start with Jennie-O. We have seen increases in egg sets and poult placements recently. We had a flat year in 2014 in terms of total pounds brought into the system, yet our value-added businesses keep growing, and so we will be increasing our supplies somewhat going forward.","The market also seemed like it kind of got an early jump last year when a number of entities had issues with propane and winter weather and so forth and the meat supplies tightened quite a bit. So we are expecting a more normal situation there. We have taken steps to get our hands on more of the propane ourselves so that we're not quite as much at mercy of the marketplace for that, and I don't know what others have done. But overall, I mean they were at very high levels this year and our best outlook is that it will still be strong levels next year but not at what we've benefited from this year.","In terms of the peanut butter equation, going into this fall and going into our fiscal year for 2015, we had not been looking at taking further price decreases. The crops certainly have been more favorable lately and there was an overall decline in costs, but relatively speaking that decline has not accelerated in recent months, it pretty much was already priced into the crop. But when the leading share player made their announcement as to their strategy going forward, we huddled our group and really thought about, okay, what's our reaction going to be to this?","We're still pretty early on in the ownership of this brand, we recognize that we're at kind of almost a 2-to-1 deficit when you look at market share in the U.S., and so we thought \u2013 and we're not really asserting that SKIPPY is a premium peanut butter product, it's a mainstream product, and so our assessment was, when the market leader has modified the price and that we want to in essence stay competitive with that price, and so we will be executing a price decrease in the marketplace. We think that this should allow fewer promotional dollars to be spent in the category because the bases are lower, so the feature that needs to come off with that doesn't need to be as deep, and so that will be our execution strategy going forward.","Robert B. Moskow","Got it. So [indiscernible], yes, but the price cut, so that didn't really affect your profit outlook for fiscal 2015 for SKIPPY, you think that the promo adjustment will kind of balance it out?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I guess I don't want to give you a one line item like that. I mean in the aggregate of our Grocery, what we expect for Grocery Products, what we're spending our ad dollars on, et cetera, we're comfortable with the returns that SKIPPY will deliver in terms of the overall growth we're expecting for grocery in fiscal 2015.","Robert B. Moskow","Yes, okay. Alright, have a great holiday.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay, we will conclude our call. I am pleased with the opportunity to announce another record performance this year. This has been the result of the hard work and dedication of the really talented team here at Hormel Foods and we're looking forward to an even stronger fiscal 2015. So on behalf of our team, I want to wish you all happy Thanksgiving and thank you for joining us today on the call.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the company are fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and outbreaks of disease among livestock and poultry flocks.

Discussion of non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jana, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced record third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share, up 10% over last year with four of our five segments registering gains this quarter. We generated sales of $2.2 billion, a decrease of 4% versus last year on a 3% volume increase. Sales were lower due to turkey supply shortages in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and price deflation in the pork markets, primarily impacting sales within our Refrigerated Foods and International segments.","To illustrate the dramatic change in pork markets, the average USDA pork cutoff price in July of 2014 was $133 compared to $83 in July of 2015, almost a 40% decrease. While across the company our team is generally focused on our goal of 5% top line growth, in this particular market scenario, volume growth may be the more appropriate metric by which to gauge results.","I will now take you through each segment. Refrigerated Foods finalized the purchase of Applegate near the end of the third quarter on July 13, 2015. I am pleased to welcome the Applegate team to Hormel Foods. Refrigerated Foods grew operating profit 9% inclusive of incurring $8.6 million in transaction cost related to the acquisition of Applegate. Results were driven by lower pork input cost and strong performance by our value-added retail and food-service businesses.","Refrigerated Foods sales were down 11% this quarter despite a 2% volume increase. As I mentioned earlier, lower sales were primarily due to pricing decreases on items such as bacon, driven by the declining pork market values. We enjoyed strong sales growth of many of our value-added items during the quarter, including retail sales of Hormel pepperoni, and Hormel Gatherings party trays, and foodservice sales of Hormel Natural Choice deli meats and Hormel Fire Braised meats.","Grocery Products delivered an excellent segment profit increase of 57% on an 8% sales increase. Segment results were driven by favorable raw material cost, and increased sales of SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL chili, and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE refrigerated dips. WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis in a single-serve container have been a key driver to the brand's growth this past year. They squarely meet consumer's desires for portable, better-for-use snacking options. Grocery Products continues to build brand equity and drive sales with marketing support for key items.","Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit decreased 45% and sales decreased 12%. Results were impacted by high pathogen avian influenza, as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales. We have now repopulated approximately two-thirds of the farms' previously impacted and we expect to complete the repopulation process during the fourth quarter.","While we have been able to purchase some turkey meat from other suppliers to partially offset flock losses, Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to estimate approximately 15% lower sales in the fourth quarter versus last year, similar to the sales impact in the third quarter. Our team continues to work closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control future outbreaks.","Our Specialty Foods segment reported a robust operating profit increase of 79%. Improvements to the cost structure in the CytoSport and Century Foods operations, along with stronger performance in our Specialty Products business benefited results this quarter. Specialty Foods segment sales increased 31%, largely driven by the recently acquired CytoSport business.","The CytoSport team has achieved additional distribution of MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products with big gains coming from one of our more recent product introductions, MUSCLE MILK PRO SERIES. Innovation is a top priority for our CytoSport business, and we look forward to the launch of some great new items currently in the pipeline for our MUSCLE MILK brand.","International & Other segment profit increased 3%, while sales declined 6%. Higher royalties on sales of our SPAM family of products, strong performance by our China businesses, and increased sales of SKIPPY peanut butter drove the profit gains. However, sales and margins were hampered by significantly lower pork exports due to soft demand in key markets in East Asia.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Refrigerated Foods to benefit from value-added sales increases and lower input costs. We look for Grocery Products to deliver another quarter of strong segment profit growth, with favorable raw material cost and volume growth in key categories. Jennie-O Turkey Store will continue to be significantly challenged due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain. However, we do anticipate modest margin improvement as compared to third quarter results.","Specialty Foods should finish the year well based on the fast-paced growth and improved cost structure of our recently acquired MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products. And we expect our International segment to continue to face headwinds in the pork export markets over the near term, partially offset with anticipated gains from our China businesses.","Given the strong results through three quarters, along with our positive outlook for Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Specialty Foods as we close the year, and better visibility of the impact of avian influenza on Jennie-O Turkey Store in the near term, we are raising our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP earnings guidance range from $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up to $2.57 to $2.63 per share.","I am proud of our experienced team as we have demonstrated our ability to navigate an unprecedented raw material supply challenge and still be on track to deliver another double-digit increase in earnings in fiscal 2015.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $146.9 million or $0.54 per share, compared to $138 million or $0.51 per share a year ago. Excluding the impact of Applegate-related transaction cost of $8.6 million, non-GAAP earnings were $0.56 per share.","Consistent with our guidance, given on the announcement of the deal, we expect the Applegate acquisition to be net neutral to fiscal 2015 earnings. The bulk of deal-related expenses have been booked in the third quarter. The non-GAAP adjusted earnings guidance Jeff provided of $2.57 to $2.63 per share for fiscal 2015 assumes this neutral impact on a full year basis for the Applegate acquisition.","Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $2.19 billion compared to $2.28 billion last year, a 4% decrease. Sales, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate, and MegaMex products that were not included in last year's results, were down 10%. Lower pork prices, lower turkey supply, and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture were the primary drivers of sales declines compared to last year.","Volume for the third quarter was 1.21 billion pounds, increasing 3% from the same period last year. Tonnage was down 2%, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate, and MegaMex products not included in last year's results.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 8.4% of sales, up from 6.7% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher compared to last year due to increased advertising expense, the Applegate deal cost, and employee-related expenses. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8% of sales.","Advertising expenses for the quarter were $34 million compared to $21 million last year. The increase was due mostly to advertising expense at CytoSport for the Muscle Milk brand which was acquired last August, as well as increased Hormel Brands support in the Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products segment compared to last year.","Equity and earnings of affiliates was $6.4 million in the third quarter versus $3.5 million last year. The increase is largely the result of prior-year incentive expenses related to the Fresherized Foods business not repeated this year, as well as savings associated with the exit from the international joint venture businesses announced in the first quarter of this year.","Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.6% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34.5% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 264.3 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 270.6 million.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.3 million versus $33.5 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2015. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. The Applegate acquisition was funded in July with cash and $350 million of short-term debt. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $41.8 million, up from $34.8 million last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $155 million to $165 million.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Levi?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Farha Aslam with Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Congratulations on a good quarter.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","I have questions regarding two of your smaller businesses. The first one's on Specialty. How has the restructuring of the supply chain benefited you? And how sustainable do you anticipate those Specialty margins to be? They were pretty strong this current quarter.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","When we announced the Muscle Milk deal, we mentioned how one of the benefits we saw was that we did have familiarity and experience within the segment with our Century Foods operation. They're a manufacturer on the powdered side of that business. We have taken the opportunity to combine the previous manufacturing capabilities in Benicia with the Sparta, Wisconsin-based Century operation. And you're seeing some of the benefit of that already being reflected in the Q3 results.","Another key area of gains has just been the general management of the business in terms of organizing the sales and marketing structures and so forth and then a lot of top line benefit. I mean, the business is growing very nicely. We've been able to gain distribution in the food, drug, and mass channel. We've been able to rejuvenate the portfolio in the Specialty channel. We continue to enjoy an excellent relationship with Pepsi in terms of distribution into the convenience channel and also parts of the food, drug and mass.","The Muscle Milk franchise, on a Nielsen basis, the ready-to-drink items grew in the high single-digit levels and the powdered items grew double-digit. And so that's all contributing to very solid results, and I do believe this new level of performance for Specialty Foods should be repeatable in Q4.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then on International, you were quite positive about your Chinese business. With all that's going on in China, could you just share with us your reasons for being positive, especially given the more constrained pork supplies in China, and then your outlook for that division as it relates to exports of U.S. pork?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I mean, we're really happy with the performance of the China group. I mean, you look back even four years ago, that business was not making money, or maybe barely making money. And this year, it's going to be a solidly double-digit returning entity. We provide niche products in that market, particularly to the foodservice channel. Obviously, SKIPPY would be another retail-based item. And so to us, at least so far the macro level things going on with their currency and their stock market and so forth, we really have not seen any detrimental impact to our sales capabilities or our margins on that business.","In terms of exports, it was a more challenging quarter for International. We've had some port issues. Obviously, there was the U.S. port issues earlier in the year, that was less of an effect in Q3. We continue to have Philippine-based port issues, though, that did impact Q3 results. We've seen a little bit of a turndown in demand in some of the key Asian markets, particularly Korea and China that we sell some of our products to. So that was a more challenging area.","I mean, typically, for the last four years, you've seen International deliver top line and bottom line double-digit growth, and we clearly haven't done that the last couple of quarters. So we need to turn that around. But notwithstanding that, I mean, China is growing double-digits, SKIPPY is growing double-digits. So we're very high on what International should be able to achieve overall.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you for the added color.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for the question. I guess, a couple questions. One is that I definitely understand the declining export environment into China. And, I guess, my concern had been that it might lead to excess supplies domestically. And certainly you're already seeing the price of cuts of pork falling quite a bit. Jeff, is there any concern that the declining values could lead to more, I guess, price competition for bacon and for cold cuts, and then threaten the spreads that you're getting on the value-added side, and then perhaps even the packing spreads as well?","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","So Jeff's pointing at me, Rob.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","She's our resident expert.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Yes. I do agree. Hog supplies are up and prices are low, which have been a benefit to our value-added franchises, and we do have some items that are considered more supply chain such as bacon and ham that will move with pricing, but we've been able to maintain a nice margin profile. And then we have a lot of our portfolio that just doesn't move quite as rapidly with changes in market conditions such as the items Jeff called out being pepperoni and the party tray business. We're fully expecting hog supplies to continue to increase for the balance of the year.","Exports will remain a wild card, if you will. I think the USDA is calling for them to be up over 4% for the year when they're down 4% through June. So we'll see if that happens or not. Pork operating margins have been lower than last year. We saw extremely high results last year in our third quarter. We're expecting them to be, say, neutral to our results for the fourth quarter. So that's kind of my take on the pork markets. Hopefully I answered all your questions.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. I mean, to the degree that it's possible. I guess as you look at fiscal 2016, is it fair to say that you could still have a very, very strong year in Refrigerated just because of the value-added pricing powers there or is it kind of a year where you're like, well, maybe it's kind of more of a normalized year? Because your margins are well above your normalized levels and that was just my thinking about 2016.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","So, right now we are just in the beginning of putting together our assumptions and market conditions for our 2016 planning process. So, I really can't even comment on what we're thinking at this point in time. We do continue to believe that our value-added franchises should continue to grow as well as provide nice margin results. So, we'll give you an update on 2016 on our next call.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Diane.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","So, I wanted to ask about Applegate, which I appreciate you've owned for about 30 days. But you did give some commentary on your expectations for fiscal 2015 I think net neutral to EPS this year. As you make your way through the transition process of bringing that on to your books, et cetera, is there anything that you've seen would makes you more excited or less excited?","And then, Jody, I wanted to ask on the debt that you took on for that. I think you said short-term, so I think there's a bit contingent of us on the Street that's looking for you guys to really kind of lever up your balance sheet. But to me, it sounds like you've taken on some short-term debt to fund that and you probably will pay that off with cash flow in the next 12 months. Is that how we should be thinking about that? I'm just trying to model your interest heading into 2016.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll take the first part. We're still very excited about Applegate. As you point out, I mean, it's been a month, counting today, and if you really look at the quarterly results, I mean, you're talking barely even a couple of weeks of results. However, if you just look at the general business trends, they're still rocking along at double-digit growth rates and we're very excited about the ability of that franchise to connect with consumers.","A lot of activity has been going on in terms of getting the teams to meet each other and seeing if there are opportunities to take advantage of each other's capabilities. But we're still very high on what Applegate should be able to deliver for us in Q4 and beyond.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","So, as far as the debt, you are correct. We are expecting to have any outstanding amounts repaid in 2016, I would say mid-year, which leaves us with a very good balance sheet capable of taking on other opportunities and we continue to look for strategic investments, whether it's internally or externally through acquisitions.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Great. And then, just a quick question on JOTS and AI. I mean, you're repopulating. It sounds like you'd be fully repopulated by the end of the fourth quarter. Is there less risk during this upcoming migration? Because the wild birds are going from the northern tier to the southern tier or do you \u2013 are you at all concerned that there's going to be sort of another kind of flurry of AI activity that would put those newly repopulated birds at risk for contagion again. I'm just trying to \u2013 sounds like you're filling up the barns and there's a little bit of risk associated with that. I mean, what are you feeling about that?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think your last line just summed it up very well. We are filling up the barns but there clearly is at least a little bit of risk associated with that. We've heard a similar theory as to perhaps birds go south faster than they come north and they may not linger as long in the areas, and so that might be a positive factor. But I mean, at this point, it's just such a wild card. I mean, this was an unprecedented incident already. We're trying to learn from it, the government's trying to learn from it. It could hit other parts of the country, it could hit another time of the year, it could go away, it could come back in a smaller manner.","And so, we're trying to be ready for any contingency. And the best I can tell you right now is we haven't had a system outbreak since early June and that frankly even if something did hit this fall, it won't affect 2015 results. Because I mean, you just wouldn't see the loss of bird flow that quickly. But by the time we're talking again in November, we should have a much better sense of whether something seems to be occurring on a fall basis this year or not and what potential impact that might have. Even if nothing occurs, however, and as we indicated the last call, I mean with the 22-week lifespan and with egg shortages and so forth, I mean, we're expecting volume struggles even in the first half of next year until we cycle through this.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you for the additional color.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. This is Jason filling in for Adam.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jason.","Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, Grocery volumes were flat year-over-year in 3Q after falling 3% to 5% for the prior four quarters? Do you think this is reflective of easy comps or some of the efforts that you've made to stabilize volumes in that segment?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we'd like to think the latter, but I mean, I would acknowledge there's some element of the former going on. The Grocery results continue to be \u2013 I mean, you really have to kind of read them carefully in the sense that one of the things we pull out is the Fresherized sales. But when you pull out sort of both years' worth of Fresherized sales, I mean, you're neglecting the fact that that's one of our fastest growing franchises. That's a double-digit gainer when you look at it on a apples-to-apples basis. So, we're excited about that.","We had double-digit gains from HORMEL chili this quarter. We had gains from Dinty Moore and Mary Kitchen hash. So it's all \u2013 a number of items doing quite well. SPAM was down slightly after last quarter being up 10%, so that franchise overall, I'm really quite content with where they're headed. So overall \u2013 and then SKIPPY had a good quarter which we're happy to see. Overall, I think that the trend for Grocery is positive. I'm happy to see the changes that have been made.","Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Patrick Chen - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. This is Patrick filling in for Ken.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Patrick.","Patrick Chen - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","You kind of touched on this earlier. Can you discuss or give a little bit more color on the pricing environment across some of your key categories, especially with the input prices declining? I guess is promotional and pricing activity picking up or which category you should see limited pricing?","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director","Sure. Obviously those items that are more supply-chain related, bacon and ham, would have it as well as any fresh items, our flavored fresh items, and small amount of commodity will move with the marketplace. We do have a large foodservice business. Some of those contracts have levers that react to marketplaces. But, I think the team has done a really nice job of looking at really stressing and selling the innovative items that we have in the marketplace and those have a tendency to not be as volatile to commodity price movements.","Patrick Chen - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. And just a quick follow-up. I guess, we were expecting your deli customers to switch from high-priced turkey breasts to hams. That hasn't really played out. Do you expect that to happen sometime soon over the next couple of months, next year? What are your thoughts on that? Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, it's not just a matter of the price. I mean, realistically, we have seen within both the Hormel deli group and the Jennie-O deli group, we've not been able to fill orders on a complete basis. We've been on an allocation to customers, an allocation internally. And so, clearly, we've made the effort to try to convert some of those sales into ham-based items, and we've seen some of that go on. But, overall, it's not just the price that's constraining our ability to service the deli with turkey right now.","Patrick Chen - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Mario.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just wanted to ask, first, in the Jennie-O Turkey segment, can you confirm how much, I guess, of the volume loss, how much of that was loss of your supply versus external purchases that sort of helped bridge the gap? And then I guess in addition to that, as far as the EBIT headwinds, how much of that was volume deleveraged versus, again, the higher cost of these external purchases?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, on the first question, I mean, I can give you \u2013 it's not exactly an apples-to-apples, but it'll give you directionally what we're talking about. I mean, the bird loss, if you will, ended the system near 20%. And then when you netted it out and there's some price differential here, I mean, it was a 12% sales drop. So, we were able to buy in some meat, mostly on the dark meat side during the quarter in order to try to mitigate that effect. And we're looking at similar levels for Q4 realistically.","In terms of the EBITDA drop, I mean, I really don't have a way of quantifying exactly what's what. I mean, there were some costs in the live production system that were reimbursed by the government. There were some costs that weren't. When you're that short in volume in your plants, that creates all sorts of overhead issues. When you literally don't have products to sell, I mean, you're losing that margin and that volume. So there were all those factors combined that moved us down from the kind of run rate Jennie-O had been operating at to what we thought we would hit and what we did hit this quarter.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I see. And then one follow-up, moving to the Refrigerated Foods segment. There has been some consolidation in the pork industry, a couple of your key competitors, looks like there's a pending consolidation going on there. Is there any impact on your strategy? I mean, how does \u2013 does that change the way that you fit into the industry? What are your thoughts on that?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think it really does. I mean, our philosophy when it comes to pork is we do want to control our own destiny and we have for years, so even years ago when Oscar Mayer and Sara Lee chose to get out of being vertical in hog processing and rely on others for their meat supply, we made the decision to stick with it. And frankly, as the industry consolidates, to me that decision is even more firm that we need to be able to control our own destiny. That being said, we've never tried to be one of the big players when it comes to pork slaughter. And so, we're still four, five, six, somewhere in that range, and I would expect us to stay there.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go to another question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Wow.

Hi, Akshay.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Sure he is. But, SKIPPY, just one point of question here. In the Nielsen data it did not show really much growth at all in SKIPPY, and you had said it had a really good quarter. So is there something that we're not seeing there, maybe some alternative products that are doing well on test or channels that are not being measured?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I probably should let Jana follow up with you rather than speculate on that. I just know in terms of our shipment data domestically, it was a solid quarter both for volume and net sales. Outside of the U.S. it was a double-digit gain, but that wouldn't be \u2013 being reflected in the data you're looking at. But why don't I let her give you some added color as to the match-up of Nielsen versus the shipments.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great.

Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking, and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making.

Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. Please note that during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as adjusted sales and volume.","I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.","Jim Snee","Thank you, Nathan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today we announced second quarter results of $0.39 per share, down 2.5% from last year. Sales for the quarter were down 5% on an 11% decrease in volume. Adjusted sales grew 2% while adjusted volume grew 1%. For the quarter, three of our five segments reported earnings growth. Refrigerated Foods, International, and Grocery Products grew earnings, while Specialty products earnings were down 16%.","We frequently talk about the intentional balance we've built into our business and this quarter demonstrates the value of our balance model. Even though we had double-digit declines in our very important business at Jennie-O Turkey Store and divested two profitable but non-strategic businesses, we delivered earnings within $0.01 of last year's results. We were able to do this through impressive results from our meat products, foodservice, grocery products and international teams. In addition, all of our teams proactively managed expenses.","Now I would like to talk through each of our segments. Jennie-O Turkey Store had another difficult quarter compared to last year with earnings down 29%. Sales were down 8% and volumes were down 6%. Segment profit margins declined from over 21% in the second quarter last year to 16% this year, similar to the first quarter.","Three main issues affected Jennie-O Turkey Store\u2019s profitability this quarter versus the same time last year: Declining turkey prices; increased competition; and increased expenses.","First, turkey prices such as breast meat have maintained their seven year lows and in some cases declined further since the first quarter as the industry continues to be in an oversupply situation. History suggests that turkey industry will balance supply and demand and market conditions will improve in the coming months. In turn, we have made additional adjustments to our production levels and would expect volumes slightly under 2014 levels.","The impact to our business continues as commodity sales pricing and whole bird pricing is much lower than last year. Lower turkey prices are also pressuring prices in Jennie-O Turkey Store\u2019s three sales divisions: retail, deli, and foodservice.","Second, increased competitive activity from other turkey suppliers and competing proteins such as beef continue to pressure Jennie-O\u2019s results.","Third, we incurred higher operating expenses primarily related to bird performance issues with both our conventional flocks and those raised without antibiotics. We continue to make investments into consumer trends such as our raised-without-antibiotics products.","Despite the market conditions and operating challenges, the Jennie-O Turkey Store team grew value added volumes 1% this quarter and also grew lean ground turkey tray pack volume by double digits. Recent twelve week scan data shows positive sales trends as the Jennie-O brand continues to outperform the category.","This week we announced plans to build a new production facility in Melrose, Minnesota primarily to process whole birds. This new facility will replace the current aged Melrose facility and is expected to cost over $130 million. While our emphasis at Jennie-O Turkey Store is on value added products, whole birds are an important part of the turkey supply chain. The new plant will increase operational efficiency through an improved layout and will also automate some of the most difficult production jobs. Construction begins this year and we expect the plant to be operational in early 2019.","Grocery Products operating profit was up 15%. Volume was up 2% and sales were up to 8%. The inclusion of Justin's specialty nut butters and brands such as Wholly Guacamole, SPAM and Herdez, all contributed to growth.","International operating profit increased 38% on volume growth of 17% and sales growth of 19%. Fresh pork exports and branded exports such as SPAM had excellent results this quarter. Our SKIPPY peanut butter business in China also performed well.","Refrigerated foods second quarter operating profit was flat with sales down 6% and volume down 14%. The decreases reflect the divestiture of the Farmer John business in January of this year. Excluding the divestiture, adjusted sales were up 5% and adjusted volume was up 1%. Growth continues to come from retail and foodservice value added products. In foodservice, items such as Hormel BACON 1 fully cooked bacon and Hormel pepperoni delivered excellent growth during the quarter. In our retail business, Hormel Black Label bacon, Hormel Natural Choice meats and Applegate bacon and dinner sausage delivered nice growth.","Specialty foods operating profit declined 16%. Sales declined 24% and volume declined 33%. Excluding the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands, adjusted volume was up 3% while adjusted sales were flat. Muscle Milk ready to drink protein beverages performed well, especially in the food, drug and mass channels. Our Muscle Milk powder business was softer this quarter which is in line with the category dynamics. In addition, our new Muscle Milk bars have been well received in the marketplace.","Given our current operating environment, we have made some short-term reductions to SG&A expenses. One such area is advertising. Advertising expense this quarter was $30 million compared to $49 million in 2016. This level of advertising is comparable to our fiscal 2015 spend. The majority of the advertising reductions came from the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. To maintain our advertising and promotional spend efficiency, some of these advertising dollars have shifted to in-store promotions but we still remain the price leader.","Looking to the balance of fiscal 2017, the only change to our outlook is for Jennie-O Turkey Store. We now expect percentage declines in earnings for Jennie-O Turkey Store to be in the high-teens for the second half of the year with the pressure not abating until the entire industry starts to reduce production levels.","For Refrigerated Foods, we expect growth in many of our retail brands, particularly Hormel Black Label bacon and Hormel Natural Choice meats. We expect growth in the foodservice channel to remain strong with growth coming from many of our brands such as Hormel Bacon 1 and Hormel Fire Braised meats.","We see continued sales and earnings growth from grocery products. Justin's specialty nut butters, Wholly Guacamole dips, Herdez sauces and SKIPPY peanut butter are all expected to be strong contributors to this growth.","The full year outlook for the International segment is for growth in line with their long-term goals of 10% top line and 15% bottom line. We expect strong exports of both branded and fresh pork products. Our new manufacturing facility in Joshing [ph], China will start producing products early in the third quarter and we also expect relief for China pork prices in the second half of the fiscal year which will improve the operating environment for our China retail meat business.","We look to specialty foods to deliver double-digit earnings growth in the second half of the year, driven by CytoSport and the Muscle Milk brand. As a reminder, we will annualize the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands early in the third quarter.","Based on our updated outlook for Jennie-O Turkey Store, we are maintaining our full year earnings per share guidance of $1.65 to $1.71, and expect earnings to be at the lower end of the range. At this time I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and additional key drivers for the remainder of 2017.","James Sheehan","Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. Volume for the second quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, an 11% decrease compared to last year. Sales for the second quarter were $2.2 billion, a 5% decrease. Excluding the acquisition of Justin's and the sale of Diamond Crystal and Farmer John, adjusted volume increased 1% and adjusted sales increased 2%.","Net earnings for the quarter were $211 million, down 2% compared to last year. General corporate expenses were lower in the second quarter primarily due to reduced employee related expenses and higher allocations to the business units. We expect general corporate expenses to be below last year for the remainder of the year.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32 million, unchanged from last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million for 2017. Equity in earnings for the quarter was $10 million, up 6% compared to last year. Strong results for MegaMex including the Herdez and Wholly Guacamole brands drove the increase.","Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.2% compared to 33.6% last year. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 33% and 33.5%. As a reminder, we experienced an unusually low tax rate in the third quarter of last year which was a result of international restructuring.","Cash flow from operations was $84 million, down from $130 million last year. The decrease was primarily related to changes in working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $39 million compared to $66 million last year. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $190 million this year. Projects include completion of our plant in China, the new plant in Melrose, capacity expansion for value added product lines, and ongoing investments for food and employee safety.","We paid our 355th consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 15, at the annual rate of $0.68 per share. We repurchased 547,000 shares of common stock, spending $19 million. We have 12 million shares remaining from the current authorization and will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises and based on the internal valuation of the stock.","Operating margins were 14.5%, a 40 basis point increase compared to last year. Four of our five segments increased operating margins. Input costs for the second quarter were mixed. Beef costs were slightly higher compared to last year. Barring any unforeseen weather events, we expect beef costs to trend below last year in the second half. Breast meat and other turkey commodity prices remained at seven year lows. Based on inventory and production levels, we do not expect material changes in prices until the industry starts to cut back production.","Hog prices in the second quarter were similar to last year. We expect to see some short-term volatility in the hog markets in the second half. Overall hog prices are expected to be higher than last year. Belly prices increased sharply in the first part of the quarter but are now comparable to last year. On average belly prices were approximately 10% higher than last year. We expect belly prices to be above last year as the industry continues to experience lower cold storage levels and high demand for bacon. 73% pork trim prices were 10% above last year. We expect trim markets to remain above last year for the second half.","Prices for 50% beef trim were over 20% higher for the quarter. We expect beef prices to remain high for the second half with a possible downward trend in our fourth quarter. The new hog harvest capacity is coming online. Two plants recently began production and two additional plants are expected to start production by late summer. The additional capacity represents an increase of about 6%. We believe hog supplies are positioned to closely match this increase as the USDA projects a 4% to 5% increase in the hog supply for 2017.","As we assess the long-term future of the hog industry, we see three areas of focus: export demand, domestic consumption, and total U.S. harvest capacity. Year-to-date export demand has been strong. The USDA expects exports to be up 10% in 2017. Domestic consumption also remained strong. For example, pork feature activity has increased significantly and pricing has been stable. Depending on the long term export and domestic consumption trends, we believe rationalization of less efficient harvest operations may need to occur. We remain confident we're well positioned to make the necessary adjustments in our business to address changes in pork capacity.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question and answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh ","Thanks for taking my question. So I want to discuss with Jennie-O Turkey Store segment in a little more detail. I was just curious when you look historically how long does it typically take for the industry to reduce production levels?","Jim Snee","Good morning Rupesh. What we've said is, I mean, we believe this cycle is a twelve to eighteen months cycle. We don't know, we can't predict exactly when others in the industry will make a production cut. I do think one of the things that we have to remember is that there still are improvements that can happen along the way in that 12 to 18 months in terms of commodity pricing, competitive activity. So I mean that's how we're looking about -- looking at it and thinking about it.","Rupesh Parikh ","And then my related follow-up question, as you look at \u2013 as we look at your guidance for the back half of the year, what do you assume for turkey prices, do you assume we've bottomed now or do you assume they continue to get worse?","Jim Snee","So from our perspective, I mean, we've built in the downside that we think can occur but from our perspective we believe that there could be some improvements in the back half of the year. But again as far as timing when that happens that's really hard to predict.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow ","Just continuing on the turkey side, just \u2013 two questions I have. One is the short term, and one is the longer term. So on the short term what prompted you to change -- I mean, I get to profitability but you guys totally reversed course on your volume side, it is my understanding. So how much was that just because, hey, look the environment is that bad that we're just going to cut so we\u2019re going to change that? And then my second question which is actually probably more important, is okay, so with seven year low turkey prices, 2017 will probably be your fourth best year ever in turkey still. So how does this change your longer term view of the turkey operation in terms of 2018 and 2019, does this change your margin structure, is this something that we should \u2013 there is a structural issue here, can you talk about that as well?","Jim Snee","Sure. Thanks, Ken. From our perspective the shorter term issue as we've looked at the business, starting with production, we have planned reductions for our fiscal year, some mid single digit reductions that really allow us to be a net buyer of breast meats. We did take further reductions in half one in response to the market conditions. You can say those are probably low single digits and that would put us for the full year slightly lower than 2014.","Beyond that for the short term, I don't know that I would say we've changed course. And what we have seen is continued low commodity prices and others in the industry have not cut back yet but we haven't seen a change in competitive activity, still very strong and this is unique to us but clearly we\u2019ve still seen some increased expenses in terms of bird performance, our investments that we're making which we believe are on trend with our WOA and of course the ongoing investment in biosecurity. So I mean that's the short term view.","From our perspective on the long term side, I mean there is nothing structurally wrong with this business, I mean, these changes are -- they are market based, they are not fundamental issues to the business. And we said this on our first quarter call is whether good or bad we've been here before and we have emerged stronger as an organization. So we feel really good with our ability to deliver long term growth in this business and it's still about being able to drive value added sales. So we've been very pleased with the growth in our lean ground turkey up double digit this quarter, scan data that shows we're outperforming the category. So lots of good positive trends that set us up really well for the long term.","Operator","We'll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson ","Maybe first at the corporate level, just trying to sense -- last quarter I think you talked to a full year outlook about 5% organic growth, for the year -- year to date you're running a little bit under 3, a bit around 2 for the quarter and you've got \u2013 you\u2019re lapping an extra week in your fiscal fourth quarter with the Jennie-O reductions that you have outlined for the back half, do you have an updated thought on the sales view and any color by business would be helpful?","Jim Snee","Sure Adam. Obviously the driver has been the jobs performance. As we go around the horn and we think about all of our businesses for the back half of the year, we believe our grocery product sales will stay in line with their long term growth goal of plus 3% and then plus the addition of the acquired Justin\u2019s business. Refrigerated Foods, on an adjusted basis, would be in the low single digit range. For JOTS we are calling continued decreases in that mid single digit range. Specialty foods group will be positive mid single digits and international will be on track to deliver their long term stated growth goal of 10% sales growth. So really aside from the JOTS business we feel really good about the other four segments.","Adam Samuelson ","And then I want to go back to some comments in the prepared remarks that you made about pork harvest capacity on the packing side, and maybe the industry actually needing to rationalize some capacity long term, and you even alluded to, you needed to re-evaluate -- you might need to reevaluate your own capacity there. Maybe elaborate on that view little bit and do you view your pork packing capacity is higher cost relative to the industry or do you see less of a need for that vertical integration in your own business? Maybe a little more thought on how the pork harvest capacity fits in with the Hormel strategy relative to some of the increases in industry capacity that\u2019s going on?","James Sheehan","Well we constantly review our capacity. We've recently sold Farmer John which obviously reduced our capacity in the harvest level. We make changes to our harvest capacity on a regular basis. We look at it on a daily basis, we increase and decrease our harvest levels. We harvest hogs to provide a supply of raw materials for our value added products. We do that because of the consistency of the products that we attain by harvesting the hogs themselves and honestly we do it on a very economic basis. We have -- we purchase hogs that are very focused to be used in value added products which sometimes are slightly different than what you might see in the open market. We do purchase bellys, trims and at times ribs in the open market, we've been successful with that in the past. So I guess the answer to your question is that we look at our harvest levels on a daily basis both short term and long term by looking at our harvest levels.","Operator","We'll go next to Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow ","Hi, this is a technical question on the cash flow in the quarter, if I'm not mistaken it was pretty far below last year. Can you give us some color on the factors driving that and what do you expect cash flow to look like this year?","James Sheehan","Certainly. In the quarter there are a couple of things that drove the change. There were tax payments, about $30 million in additional tax payment and that's really just a timing issue. It has to do with how we make our estimated federal income tax payments, we expect that that will come back to us in both the third and the fourth quarter. So that again is more of a timing issue. We also saw some variation in our workers -- in our accruals around some of our expenses, again more of a timing issue as to when they're paid during the year as opposed to the level of expense. We saw increases in dividends and share repurchase, that was about $25 million. But we also saw a lower CapEx expense. CapEx is supposed to come at about -- we expect it to come at about $190 million. That is the primary driver of what would change the CapEx, as we get later in the year we start to understand what projects are going to get completed in the year, what projects you're going to have investments in. So we don't see any significant change to our cash flow. We still see the company as having a very strong cash flow.","Robert Moskow ","And I just have a follow up, Jim and Jim. It just sounded a little inconsistent to hear the company talk about reducing Jennie-O production in the back half but then also talk about the renovation at Melrose, and $130 million of CapEx to build -- I know it's a further processing facility, so I guess it's different but do you view this as -- I don't know, how do I reconcile these two things? Is this a bet on 2019 being a much better year from a turkey perspective when you're fully operational? And then secondly the industry experts I talk to think that it's not going to be a 2018 recovery for turkey, it probably will be 2019 based on the fact that everyone seems to continue to increase production this year. Why are they increasing production even though results are that bad? And now that's a lot of questions but maybe you can help me out.","Jim Snee","It is. But we will try to get to all of them. I think first, starting with the facility, and so well what we've said here is we are replacing a very aged facility in Melrose. And it is more for whole birds and that is a very -- I guess that we are focused on the value added business, I mean that's our long term growth driver but whole birds are still an integral part of the business. And so this isn't a bet that we're making, I mean this is an investment to update the facility to modernize the facility, make it more efficient. So we do feel like it sets us up well for the future and I mean the other thing to consider is that there is a positive NPV and this is a replacement facility. As you think about the production side of the business, there's increased production because you\u2019ve had a lot of people who were uncertain about avian influenza. And so there was a chance throughout the year that you could have another outbreak, so you had people ramping up on production. As we move further in the year and we never say never but obviously it's less likely -- I think that's when you could see some production cuts.","The other thing that I would say, Rob, is that there will be improvements along the way. If you want to think about when does it get back to more normalized or historical levels entirely, that will be hard to predict, we've said twelve to eighteen months. But I do think the other piece to consider is that there will be improvements along the way as commodity prices improves you see some more rational competitive activity and we've seen what's happened in some beef markets already. So I think all of those things will impact it and for us it\u2019s the right long term on trend business to be in and there is nothing structurally wrong with the business. These are all market-based issues not fundamental issues.","Robert Moskow ","And one last question, you filed a shelf placement recently, can you tell us the rationale for that?","James Sheehan","That was just a routine extension of the debt. It was expired and we've reviewed it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.","Akshay Jagdale ","Good morning. I wanted to ask about the refrigerated foods. Thanks for the update on the capacity. So you mentioned 6% increase -- can you clarify if that's one shift for all four plants and when exactly you expect that sort of 6% increase to be effective, I guess because you mentioned a couple of plants have opened now, a couple are going to open later. Do you have a sense roughly as to when that 6% will be sort of effective? And I have a follow-up to that.","James Sheehan","Thank you, Akshay. 6% is for 2017 and I don't have any inside information about how those plants are operating or how fast they\u2019ll come up to speed. So there will be additional capacity that will come online in 2018 but the 6% addresses the capacity -- the stated capacity that will come online in 2016, so I can\u2019t provide any further information on the ramp up. The USDA is stating that there will be enough hogs to provide that production -- at that production level. It is part of the reason that we've told you -- we might see some short term volatility in the hog prices as \u2013 if the plants are delayed or if they start up faster than they thought that can create a very short term volatility in the market. We've seen that as some other plants have come online but again we see those as very short term and not real trends.","Akshay Jagdale ","So just so I understand your math, you\u2019re just saying the daily capacity of these plants is x, if you look at that relative to what the daily capacity was before it's a 6% increase, it's not \u2013 you\u2019re not doing any sort of weighted average calculation there because it\u2019s coming \u2013","Jim Snee","No, we are not; that is correct. And the information that we're using is the stated information from those groups building the plants.","Akshay Jagdale ","And so as it relates to that expansion we understand the difficulty of modelling any of that. But can you just help us understand your base case for 2017, is that hog prices set up for the rest of the year, remain flattish year over year, because they've moved up but they're somewhat still below year ago? So with the capacity coming online, what's your expectation for the next two quarters in terms of the hog prices at sort of flattish year over year or \u2013","Jim Snee","Slightly higher; we don't believe that the plants coming online will have any long term impact on the prices of hogs. Again we believe that there could be some short term volatility but that's going to be very short term based on daily or weekly needs of hogs.","Akshay Jagdale ","And just one last one on turkey and I know we had discussed this in private as well. But just overall the turkey business that you have is value added, right? And so there's a lot of conversation today and the last couple of quarters on commodity prices. I know there was \u2013 these three factors that are impacting the performance there. But I mean over time, because you're so value added, aren\u2019t you more -- shouldn't you be more and more insulated from commodity moves? Can you just address that sort of broader question? I mean I understand that quarter to quarter over six month period there can be some disconnects but one of the major issues you have is your cost of raising turkey is much higher and you have less pounds but the price itself long term you should be able to manage through that, right?","Jim Snee","Yes, I think, Akshay, in a nutshell what you're saying is correct. I mean over the long term -- I mean we are a value added business. Once again we demonstrate that in the face of a tough operating quarter by being able to deliver double digit growth for lean ground and positive scan data, and still a very very profitable business. But I mean that doesn't mean we're immune to market conditions and competitive activity. So you've got a situation where we've got competing proteins, we know the first half of the year what the market was like for beef. So there certainly is market pressure that comes into play but through it all I mean we remain the price leader in the categories where we compete. It's a very profitable business that\u2019s focused on long term value added growth and again these are short term market based issues, not structural or fundamental issues to the long term viability of the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens, Incorporated.","Farha Aslam ","So again on Jennie-O, my first kind of question is around there. We\u2019ve seen turnkey excess come down in the calendar first quarter of this year. Turkey excess were up 9% and here so far in the second calendar quarter we're down to flat. So the industry's cutting. How much do you think turkey excess need to go down for this recovery to happen and your twelve to eighteen months kind of target, when is the start date that we should use for that 12 to 18 months in your mind?","James Sheehan","So as we look at that whole placement, it looks like it's down 3% to 5%, so we expect it to be down I guess I should say 3% to 5%. If you look at the inventory levels that just came out -- the freezer inventories that just came out this week, freezer inventories of breast meat are up over 50% above last year. So there still needs to be some clearing through the market of this excess inventory.","Jim Snee","And I think in terms of the twelve to eighteen months, Farha, the bigger issue there and what I've said several times already is this idea that we will see improvements along the way both in the market and of course in our own business. And so we don't have today a starting line in terms of when the clock would set but for us it's more about the improvements that we know we'll see. And I think we've done the right things in terms of how we had planned reductions at the beginning of the year proactively managing our own business by taking further reductions in half one. So we're doing the right things to set ourselves up for improvements and clearly that could be accelerated by others in the industry doing the same.","Farha Aslam ","Yeah, clearly the industry is already responding. But then it looked your earnings for this year, they're essentially coming in plus or minus last to last year, when you look out into 2018, with all the puts and takes, do you anticipate earnings growth, do you anticipate being able to get back to your historical targeted algorithm of 5% top line growth and 10% EPS growth.","Jim Snee","In terms of specific guidance for 2018 it's obviously too early. As we think about our business just in real general terms, our business is solid. We've got market impacts -- market based impacts impacting Jennie-O but there's a solid foundation. This intentional balance that we've built throughout our portfolio has allowed us to offset some of the devastating impact to jobs. This is the what if scenario but if JOTS is flat with year ago our business is up double digit on the bottom line. So that doesn't do anything to the results but it just shows you how solid our business is and how strong that balance is. But I mean we do believe that we will get through this and we will be able to deliver our long term growth algorithm of 5% and 10%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Benjamin Theurer with Barclays.","Benjamin Theurer ","Just I have a follow-up question on your SG&A expenses. So you mentioned that basically there was a huge reduction in advertising from roughly $50 million last year to $30 million, so that's about $20 million. Taking a look at what you reported on SG&A, there is a decrease by about $30 million on a quarter over quarter but also on a year over year basis. So my question is I understand that you're likely to be a little more cautious on advertising especially on the Jennie-O side for the remainder of the year. But can we assume that more from the long run that that roughly 10 million savings is something recurring. Do you think there is an opportunity to service a bond and what's your expectation in terms of SG&A for the back half of the year. If you want to express it as a percentage of sales so more in absolute terms, it's just to get a little bit of a sense of how much more savings potential you might have on the U.S. side? Thank you.","James Sheehan","Thanks for the question. You're right, our SG&A is down $30 million year over year, 19% million of that is advertising. We also experienced lower employee related expenses including the loss of the expenses related to the businesses that have been sold. But we've made other cuts around employee related expenses. We're very tight, we're looking at any changes in inventory levels or in employee levels very closely. We've taken a very proactive approach to expense manage due to the market conditions.","We've focused on a great doctrines that will not harm long term growth, there are many examples of things that we've done that have managed expenses in this market condition. We've had sales meetings that that have been held on conference calls instead of the big meetings we've looked at how many people are going to conferences. We've reduced travel. Now those things are going to be needle movers but I think it's just the sense of attention to every expense that's going through the system and it's not only going on now but it's so that it's something that we use to play in to continue in the future. So we're very focused on expenses and I think this is a good time to refocus the staff about making sure that every dime is being spent wisely and efficiently.","Benjamin Theurer ","And the $19 million that was related to the advertising as of now but is that something towards the end of the year, i.e. 4Q into what\u2019s mostly a more strong quarter throughout the year, do you expect advertising to pick up by then again just to well map lose market share in the different segments or is that something you would try to maintain in terms of spending what we had 2Q the rest of the year.","Jim Snee","Benjamin, just to reiterate I mean the advertising reductions that we've made are short term reduction things. I mean we've been again very public and intentional about how we do support our brands and how important that is to us but in the short term reduction is the majority again have come from job. And not all of them have translated through to the bottom line some of the JOTS in particular shifted to trade to maintain on shelf competitiveness on shelf positions but remember even with that we're still the price leader. So we in these levels are comparable to 2015 and we have -- we have flax our advertising dollars before. For this, this has happened and we are committed to a long term growth and long term brand building. And just want to reiterate that we are absolutely committed to our brands and that the short term reduction is not putting them at risk.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Jones with The Vertical Group.","Heather Jones ","I hate to beat a dead horse but I have a question on Jennie-O. And was just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of the profitability pressure you experience right now is due to things like your liveability issues with NAE, et cetera because from what I understand most of the industry is still making money and I understand you all are if not to the best producer in the industry among the best, and your margins are still strong. So it doesn't seem like anyone's dire straits right now. So I was just wondering if you give us a sense of how much thanks like your operating expenses being higher and then once you regained some of the shelf space last turn AI, how much that could help your earnings as opposed to the industry cutting production.","Jim Snee","I think you're correct, I mean earnings are still there, and are still strong. We are a very proud -- Jennie-O it was still a very profitable business for us, without getting too specific probably just more along the order of magnitude in terms of what\u2019s having the greatest impact. The first one would be market conditions; second, would be pricing pressure; and then third would be our own increased expenses. So we are battling, it's a battle for us to maintain price competitiveness to maintain their shelf space but those are all the right fundamental things that were missed, these market conditions change that are going to set us up. We continue to make investments and are raised without antibiotics program, that is on trend with consumers and rather than make the cut this year we know that it's something that's going to set us up for the long term, so we will continue to invest in.","Heather Jones ","And going back to an earlier question on the refrigerated food side, so you guys are not sure that belly, trim and to a lesser extent rips. From my understanding the industry, your plants that you have remaining I believe it's two. They\u2019re pretty efficient plants and so they don't seem to be two of the candidates to be shuttered when you were mentioned less efficient facilities. However do you think -- would you ever entertain the idea of simply just stop moving to buying primals for your value added business as opposed to being in the hog slaughter part of the business?","Jim Snee","We harvest hogs as a source of raw materials for our value added business and so I mean we see great value and being able to harvest those hogs ourselves gives us a level of control as I said earlier. And so that that's a business that we plan to remain it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Larson with The Buckingham Research.","Eric Larson ","Good morning everyone and thanks for squeezing me in here. Jim, I want to go back to really the pork markets. And we all know all important the export markets are for keeping a favorable balance in the U.S. In the U.S. market particularly given the amount of pork that we've been seeing coming into the market the last few years. We're now -- looks like we are going to be negotiating now Mexico is a huge partner for us on pork products particularly ham so. I'm not really sure if it makes much difference. I mean Mexico\u2019s already moved to get corn from Argentina, Brazil, not much but they're moving. I am not sure makes much difference but I'm interested in your perspective in general and PCM \u2013 on the export markets in general and if NAFTA can have any kind of an impact on the dynamics of those export markets?","Jim Snee","Eric, NAFTA is certainly an interesting agreement. And the large driver of the whole agreement is agricultural products, I mean that's the benefit that the U.S. gets from those agreements with Mexico and Canada. So again I'm not going to make a prediction as to what that is going to look like in the future. But I have a hard time believing that it's going to go away entirely. I think we'll see some renegotiation but we'll still be able to benefit from those neighboring markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Andress with KeyBanc Capital Market.","Brett Andress ","I wanted to go back to turkey real quick. Could you comment a little bit more on the bird performance this quarter? I mean did it come in worse than you were expecting and maybe what's happening now here in May and I guess how long do you think it would take you to get these issues corrected?","James Sheehan","Thanks Brett. The turkey performance was about where we thought it would be and improved a little bit close to the end of the quarter so we're seeing some improvement in the performance. It's a slow process. And it takes time to determine what you need to do to improve the turkey performance, there's a bit of a learning curve here and I think that we think that we are getting close to turning the corner on us.","Brett Andress ","And last one on the driver of the grocery margin, I think it was close to a record for the second quarter. So I just want to understand some of the puts and takes, maybe how much was advertising, and maybe what were some of the largest input benefits or maybe some of the largest pressures because I think avocadoes are spiking reasonably and it seems like your expectations for beef and pork inputs are also up. So maybe you can kind of clarify \u2013 maybe some of the expectations going forward.","James Sheehan","In the second quarter I mean clearly we saw strong growth from SPAM, Wholly, Herdez, Guacamole and SKIPPY which are great margining businesses for us. Clearly we've had the inclusion of our Justin's business which has been great acquisition and of course we've talked about our recent innovations like Skippy Phoebe Bites and Herdez, as Wholly Guacamole, Salsa and those are all accretive innovations to the grocery products group.","In terms of advertising, I would tell you it's a small small portion that improvement. And then we did have some offsets. Well for the quarter show we had had a difficult quarter and a large part of that was just some promotional activity that that didn't play out the way that we thought. But remember I mean we're coming off a banner two thousand and sixteen for our Chile business so again we feel really good about where that is heading. And so for the back half of the year I mean we're thinking about GP as more of the same, so strong growth from SPAM, Wholly, AAM, Justin\u2019s continues to ramp up and then these are creative innovations are strong growth from stamp holy air to really good about portfolio to deliver long term stated goals for GP.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Scott with Mizuho.","Jeremy Scott ","I just want to get a sense of the retail and foodservice landscape, and how that's changing given the impact of labor costs? Clearly we've seen the growth in the retail perimeter and on-site preparation of the past 10 years in grocery and what that had done to the center of the story lines but given that it's a much more labor intensive process it seems like the natural progression would be to outsource more of those perimeter goods for now in others and you could be the preferred providers, I would assume that that would translate the foodservice as well. What\u2019s the opportunity here, what are you hearing from your customers with this business, what does that mean for the sustainability of refrigerated foods margins?","Jim Snee","Jeremy, that\u2019s a great question. I mean there certainly is a retail focus on that area of prepared food. It's not new focus, but I would tell you it feels like retailers are really starting to finally figure it out and sell for it and you're exactly right. I mean the business is more closely aligning with the traditional foodservice business. And that bodes really really well for us. I mean our ability to work with operators and so if you consider retail prepared foods and operator. Our ability to help them take out labor is second to none. I mean we're able to develop customized solutions to meet their needs in a variety of different ways that with ease of preparation taking out labor but still very very high quality products that consumers believe are prepared in the back of the house. So it is going to -- it's an area of focus for us because it's an area of focus for the retailers and sets up really well for how we run our foodservice business.","Jeremy Scott ","I guess in that same light, is a lot of regional specialty vendors that provide these goods to the retail perimeter. What\u2019s your take on \u2013 the M&A pipeline is consolidating maybe some of that opportunity.","Jim Snee","I don't -- I mean I don't want to speculate on that. I mean as we think about it certainly we've got our own criteria. We're looking for number one, number two brands, opportunity to become more global, accretive margins. So we've got our own criteria when we think about how we're going to approach the M&A market.","Operator","Next we have an additional question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow ","Just a follow up on party trays, normally that shows up in your prepared comments as demonstrating growth in the quarter. I certainly saw a lot of growth in the Nielsen data but you didn't mention it today. Have you lost any distribution on party trays?","Jim Snee","No Ken, or Rob I'm sorry. We actually -- party trays are doing well. I mean as you go across the entire meat products portfolio, we didn't get too specific with it but the growth in the IRI data was very strong across many many categories. So we just didn't list it there and party trays continued to do really well for us and we do all have only so much space in the press release but you're right, party trays are very important to our meat products business and continue to be doing really well.","End of Q&A","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. Sir, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Jim Snee","Well thank you all very much for your participation today. While we're proud of the results for many of our businesses we clearly understand that our mission is to deliver growth. Our team knows what needs to be done this year and is fighting to deliver our key results.

Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We're off to an excellent start to our fiscal year with adjusted net earnings up 22% from a year ago, on record first-quarter sales of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase over last year.","In terms of segment performance, Refrigerated Foods delivered a 19% increase in operating profit on a 1% sales increase. Our food service group achieved strong sales of branded items such as HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, HORMEL pizza toppings and MENUMASTER hams. Meat products grew retail sales of HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays, HORMEL pepperoni and Hormel Natural Choice lunch meat.","In addition to this value-added product growth, lower than anticipated hog prices were a nice tailwind for the segment during this quarter. The combination of lower feed cost, a more mild winter and a fairly quick rebound from the PED virus that plagued the industry over the past year is resulting in an increasing domestic hog supply. Pork remained an excellent relative value to consumers, and we continue to see solid demand from our customers.","While we drove growth in our value-added Refrigerated Foods businesses, our overall sales increase was only 1% and volume was down 3%. We reduced harvest levels by 2% compared to last year, as certain market conditions did not support volume increases for much of the quarter. Also, as we announced on our last call, we dissolved our Precept Foods joint venture, which resulted in lower sales and volumes this quarter.","Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered impressive growth this quarter, exceeding our expectations with segment profit up 56% and sales up 10% compared to last year. Results were driven by value-added sales and excellent execution throughout the segment, along with favorable commodity turkey prices and lower feed cost. Jennie-O lean ground turkey, rotisserie turkey and premium seasoned deli turkey led sales growth this quarter. We continue to support and build the Jennie-O brand though our Make the Switch media campaign which began running in new U.S. markets in January.","Grocery Products adjusted segment profit decreased 8% this quarter, with sales up 2%. High meat input costs and varied pricing actions in key categories hampered the growth of some of our brands. Products including SKIPPY peanut butter and Hormel chili were down this quarter. On the positive side, our SPAM family of products, Wholly Guacamole dips and Herdez salsas and sauces grew nicely during the quarter. Grocery Products is dedicated to strengthening our brand through advertising and merchandising support with campaigns running in the first half of the year for SKIPPY peanut butter, Hormel chili, and Hormel Compleats microwave meals.","Out Specialty Foods segment reported an operated profit decrease of 13% and a sales increase of 34%. Excluding sales of CytoSport products, sales were up 3%. The lower operating profit was primarily driven by reduced contract manufacturing business during the quarter, which offset the incremental CytoSport results. Specialty Foods achieved solid distribution gains from Muscle Milk protein nutrition products in the food, drug and mass channel over the past quarter.","International & Other adjusted segment profit increased 6%, with solid increases from both our retail and food service businesses in China, offset in part by lower results from SPAM exports due to high input costs and transportation challenges. First quarter sales for International were up 17%, benefiting from strong growth in China, increased SKIPPY peanut butter sales, and the addition of the SKIPPY China business.","Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal, we believe hog and grain costs will remain favorable. We expect the high turkey commodity prices, which have been beneficial over the last several months, to trend down as the year progresses. We anticipate sales of our value-added products in Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store will remain strong throughout the year.","Lower meat prices will provide input cost relief for some of our Grocery Products categories after we work through higher-cost inventories. Specialty Foods will maintain its focus on maximizing CytoSport synergies, gaining distribution, igniting innovation and building the Muscle Milk brand to drive segment growth. We continue to expect the CytoSport business to deliver the $0.05 per share earnings accretion we have previously guided.","We look for Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments to contribute to our growth goals in the back half of the fiscal year. We expect International to build on its growth trajectory in China with some challenges to its export business over the next few months, offsetting a portion of that growth.","Due to our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range, excluding the non-recurring charges, from $2.45 to $2.55 per share up to $2.50 to $2.60 per-share.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. On a GAAP basis net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $171.7 million, up 12% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.64, a 12% increase. Excluding non-recurring charges, non-GAAP adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $187.3 million, up 22% from net earnings of $153.3 million last year. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.69, up 21% compared to $0.57 per share a year ago.","The first quarter included pre-tax non-recurring charges of $10.5 million related to the Stockton, California, plant closure and $9.5 million for the exit of international joint venture businesses. Sales for the first quarter totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion for the same period last year, a 7% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, up 3% from fiscal 2014.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.5% of sales compared to 7.4% for the same period last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.5% and 7.8% of sales for fiscal 2015. Advertising expenses for the first quarter were $42.2 million compared to $36.1 million last year. The increase over the prior year was primarily associated with advertising for CytoSport products in the Specialty Foods segment.","Equity in earnings of affiliates was $1.7 million in the first quarter versus $4.7 million last year. Charges associated with the exit of international joint venture businesses totaling $9.5 million offset improved performance from our MegaMex Foods joint venture.","Interest and investment income was $1.1 million for the first quarter compared to $1.2 million last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.7% versus 34.4% in fiscal 2014. We expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35% for fiscal year 2015.","The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 263.7 million shares. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270.1 million shares. We did not repurchase shares during the first quarter. We have 8.2 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Total debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at $250 million.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $27.7 million compared to $37 million last year. For fiscal 2015 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $175 million to $190 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.8 million compared to $31.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Steve?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. This is Jason filling in for Adam. First off, congratulations on the great quarter.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jason.","Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And I was hoping you could talk a bit about whether 1Q is in line with your internal expectations. I guess I'm curious on whether the guidance increase was more a function of the 1Q beat or kind of a stronger-than-expected remainder of the year. And if the latter, can you talk a bit about what's changed from your original outlook given lower pork prices and higher commodity chicken? Thanks. Or on turkey?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Yes, really the guidance range increase is pretty much recognizing the beat for the first quarter. As we look at the remainder of the year, we had a robust growth plan already submitted for the year. We're still confident that we should be able to deliver against that plan. There are things that are trending more strongly and there are things that are more challenging, but all in we're comfortable that this new range reflects our best estimate of where we think the year should turn out.","Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Farha Aslam from Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning. Could you update us on your two acquisitions, the Hormel acquisition of SKIPPY as well as CytoSport? Are they performing in line with your expectations? Or do you think CytoSport's going to deliver that $0.05 accretion that you anticipated given that you're spending pretty heavily in the first quarter against that?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. SKIPPY has been a wonderful acquisition for the company. Even this current quarter where we experienced some down sales in the grocery part of it, the domestic U.S. part, we really feel that's a short-term reaction to kind of the pricing activity going on within the category and we're still very, very bullish on the item long-term. We've done a good job of gaining new distribution. We have our new ad campaign that we have confidence in going forward. We are looking to create innovative products, the first of which are the SKIPPY Singles items out in the marketplace. And even this quarter SKIPPY on a international basis enjoyed very good results and we're pleased with where that's heading.","CytoSport is also off to a good start. A lot of activity has gone on in these first few months of ownership. We've already seen some really significant sales achievements within the food, drug and mass channel that we frankly kind of knew that Hormel would be an advantage for us bringing that skill set to that brand. And we continue to bolster efforts in some of the other channels as well, the club and specialty channels. The team is hard at work at creating the right cost structure for that overall business. We're now running that business on a collaborative or combined basis with our previous Century Foods organization. That was a custom manufacturer within the sports nutrition world. And so we're definitely confident in the $0.05 accretion that we've called out for that business going forward.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. And then, as a follow-up, there's two businesses up for sale in the protein area. Can you just comment generally what you think about valuations and transactions in the food and protein space right now and Hormel's interest in M&A?","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Well, Farha, I'm not sure what two transactions you're talking about and we wouldn't comment on any specific businesses that are available. But still go back to the things that we're looking for in acquisitions and really to meet the platforms of global, certainly things that have an international component are very attractive. We've done some nice work in the snacking and on-the-go business. So meeting things that meet that criteria, better-for-you as well as things that can add accretion to our existing margin structure. We like number one and number two brands. And certainly anything that adds a component where we can bring some innovation is obviously attractive to us. So we continue to evaluate opportunities.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I just have two questions. One is on grocery, what are the prospects for the top line growth in that business? I know it struggled a little bit, but on the flipside is what are the key inputs that have broken your way in terms of \u2013 and what's the timing to which you're going to be able to realize some of those breaks in the input prices?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. On the top line side, we enjoyed really an excellent quarter on the MegaMex franchise, particularly the Herdez and Wholly brands and so those definitely should be superior delivery vehicles for Grocery Products going forward. Our expectation is that SKIPPY is going to be a solid growth contributor for our company and it has been every quarter that we've owned it, except for this one. And so we need to get through this price decrease activity that occurred during the quarter and move on and restore our growth there. We continue to enjoy growth with our SPAM product line, have good consumer marketing against that line and continue to add flavors.","So overall, we're encouraged that Grocery Products should be able to deliver growth within its segment. On the input or more cost oriented side, I mean we were talking about probably the second half of the year is where we really expect Grocery Products to start showing significant year-over-year growth. That will come in part we think from the top line benefit of the ad campaigns that we referenced in our earlier comments. We're in a better raw material cost picture. When you look at churn (18:54) costs, for example, they're much more favorable right now than they were a year ago. And we're still working through some old inventory before we can fully reflect those, but that definitely will be a help. We should be in a better position in terms of our production resources following the closure of the Stockton plant and moving a couple of those lines as well as some new lines of production at Dubuque that we previously announced. So those are all reasons why we're bullish on the second half for Grocery Products on the input side.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","You expect to have volumes up in the back half of the year. Is that fair?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then just, I guess, follow-up is, can you just talk about what is the impact of the West Coast port issues? Have you had any major impact? Did you foresee it? Do you think it's going to get resolved? Is it one-time in nature? Any sort of color on that. I know it's a loaded question, but just curious on that. Thanks.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean compared to a lot of companies, we're probably not as exposed, but we still do care about our International business and it's certainly a pain to have some of our important branded products being held up and not being able to deliver them to our customers in the marketplace. We're as hopeful as anyone that the thing will get resolved, but I don't know that I have any better perspective than anyone reading the paper can provide as to how likely that is to happen, but we're a little hand to mouth with some of our inventories right now in terms of shipping overseas, but in terms of total impact to the business, it has not been meaningful.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Larson from Janney Capital. Your line is open.","Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Two questions. Margins in the turkey segment were obviously off the charts this quarter. Can you give us a little bit of help? I know that a year ago in the extremely cold weather that we had we just had crazy fuel costs, mainly in propane and even shortages. They were even hard to get it. Could you give \u2013 possibly quantify the potential year-over-year benefit you received Q1 from that?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I can't put a price tag on that, Eric, but in terms of the trend, you're absolutely right. I mean not only was propane short, it was very expensive. So the market for the product is much better this year. On top of that we basically operate in Minnesota and Wisconsin. That's where all our turkey barns are. It has been relatively speaking a more mild winter here, so in terms of propane usage it's not been as significant. So those are both definitely benefits that have been part of what you described as sort of the off-the-chart performance by Jennie-O, coupled with commodity meat markets that have remained higher than we had thought they would, although they certainly are starting to trend back to a more normal level.","Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Yes, obviously your commodity meat markets are going to have a much bigger impact. The next question is probably for Jody. Jody, in the quarter your year-over-year corporate expense line was down sharply. Was there a one-time issue in last year's number or was there a one-time positive issue this year or how should we look at corporate expense?","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","So I would say there were one-time positive issues this quarter. We had some miscellaneous sale of assets as well as some sales on (22:38) use tax refunds and that would get parked in that corporate line. So I would guess that last year is more representative of a going forward rate.","Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Diane Geissler from CLSA. Your line is open.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Diane.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Good morning.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Hey, I wanted to ask about your comments about the food service strength in the Refrigerated Foods group. Could you talk a little bit more about that? I think we've seen some improvement in comp trends recently in the restaurant space. So maybe your forecast and what you're hearing from your customer base that would be helpful?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Yes, we definitely have heard more positive commentary in terms of the general outlook for the marketplace. The lower gas prices seems to kind of play itself out fairly quickly within that segment in terms of traffic builds. We obviously hope and I think we've delivered over time performance over the trend line for the overall business. And I guess I would attribute that to some of the innovative new products that the team's come out with, including the BACON 1 that we're having good success with right away this year. And then also their focused approach on certain of the business segments, some of the non-commercial areas such as colleges and universities and healthcare that they've really been able to create new items for and really create some excellent relationships and service that again hopefully allow them to perform above that market trend.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then I wanted to ask a follow-up on Eric's question actually on the JOTS margins. So obviously very strong this quarter, but you did indicate that you felt that commodity prices would begin to soften as we move through the year. Can you just tell me what your expectations are for the margin structure in JOTS in the back half of the year, comparing your expectations on the commodity side versus what I think will still be beneficial raising cost year-on-year, not only the roll-through of the inventory in terms of the propane and terrible weather last year, et cetera, but also lower grain prices? I guess what I'm asking is when you look at the second half of the year, do you expect your JOTS margins to be above your normalized range or do you think the pricing dynamic will bring JOTS margins back into a normalized range?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We did provide heading into the year a new sense of what we thought was a normalized range of 13% to 17% and certainly acknowledge this quarter exceeded that. Now all the ranges we provided were annualized ranges. Jennie-O has historically had stronger profit delivery in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, and then as you get into the summer months the cost picture is a little more challenging typically and some of the demand changes. So it's hard to give you a quarter-by-quarter sense of that. I mean for the full year, we certainly expect Jennie-O will come in nearer to the top of the range than in the middle and they definitely still should enjoy the benefits on the grain side, but we expect less benefit in terms of the commodity meat performance.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Greetings from sunny Florida.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. It's only two degrees up here, so...","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Oh, don't make me jealous. Don't make me jealous.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's my line.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. But I think it's very rare that we get to see 9% volume growth in a meat business and you're seeing it in Jennie-O, and is it really a function of greater demand for value-added products that you're selling? Is it new customers that you brought along or is there a commodity element in that 9% as well?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there is some commodity element, but we did enjoy solid high-single-digit growth really throughout the value-added pieces of Jennie-O. The most heralded part of the brand would be the retail products that we're enjoying excellent success on ground turkey, sold both in tray pack and chub forms that are being supported by the ad campaign, but also a nice quarter from the deli group, rotisserie and some other premium seasoned items. Food service also had a good quarter.","So I think we do look at it as we've been able to spur greater demand for the value-added products. The consumers that have found the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand are trying more items and enjoying it more often. And while we've enjoyed really great growth, not just this year but over a number of years, when you look at overall household penetration, it's still very low. And so we think we've got all sorts of room to go. The trend toward health and wellness is certainly a tailwind that Jennie-O takes advantage of. And so I think we're well positioned to continue to grow this item.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So, when you say that the commodity benefits in turkey aren't going to stick around forever, are you also referring to that top-line number or are you just referring to the pricing in turkey has to fall due to \u2013 I don't know \u2013 increased supplies or something?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, our focus at Jennie-O is clearly trying to have a supply chain that delivers against the value-added portfolio. Although we've done a great job of creating items that utilizes dark meat portion of the turkey, the reality is, as with most companies, there is an element of that product line that ultimately ends up being exported or utilized in the non-value added form and it will probably, I don't want to say it will always be that way, but it's certainly been that way for the last 10, 15 years and it certainly is trending that way. So that aspect of it we think the dollar sales will definitely be lower because those prices are coming down on a market basis. But in terms of then the $1 billion plus worth that go out in a value-added form for Jennie-O, those we see holding their own even in this diminished marketplace for commodity.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I'm going to cheat with one follow-up. You raised your guidance $20 million or so pre-tax. How much of that do you think is just a commodity benefit and how much of it do you think is like really earned kind of value-added business? Is it possible to break that out?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think it is. I mean when you look at the total portfolio, I mean there's elements that Jennie-O probably had some commodity benefit, but there are other parts of the business that are still experiencing general input pressures frankly that diminish their usual returns. So I mean all in, we're all about our balanced model and we're comfortable that for the course of the year with that $0.05 we certainly attained for the first quarter and we expect to be able to hold our plan then for the rest of the year.","Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Mario Contreras from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Good morning.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, I wanted ask in the Refrigerated Foods business, I guess looking at pork, their cutout values, the spread between the cutout values and live hog costs are bit wider than what they've been on a historical range. Is there anything in particular that you see driving this? And how do you see it playing out over the remainder of the year? Is it your expected normalization or is it still going to kind of remain a bit wider than where it's been historically?","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Yes, this is Jody. We certainly have seen that spread remain high, although the year-over-year impact to Hormel was not significant. So that was not a big driver for our Refrigerated Foods business this quarter. And we'd expect them to be in more normalized ranges for the rest of the year. The hog prices have come down, but the value of the inputs have also come down and they've maintained that respective spread.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, in the International business, it looks like you confirm the exit of the Vietnam joint venture. I guess I wanted to ask is given that Asia has been kind of a focus in terms of you've talked in the past about wanting to expand there both organically and by M&A. Your experience in Vietnam, does that change your outlook in terms of what you want to do in that region from a growth perspective?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","A good question, Mario. No, it really doesn't. I mean maybe it's a refinement that we're going to just redouble our attention on the markets where we have enjoyed better success; China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea. And Vietnam, it's a combination of how that business was structured. We just were not able to find a way to profitability given its verticality. It was feed mills, pig farms, a meat processing business and then ultimately the sale into the marketplace. And after trying for several years in collaboration with our partner there we just decided, look, this doesn't seem to be working for us. And so we've sold our interest to the partner. But no, that should not be seen as a reflection of any sort of abandonment of Asia overall. We're still very high on that. We've been happy with our new plant in China that came onboard with SKIPPY and our ability to grow in Asia with that franchise as well as many of our meat franchises.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Very helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Larson from Janney Capital. Your line is open.","Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thanks, everyone. Thanks for the follow up. I was going to ask this and I didn't. Could you just give us \u2013 and you've talked about this in the past, Jeff, about (32:42) the opportunities with CytoSport for distribution gains. Can you give us a rough idea of what your ACV penetration is today across all the various channels? And then the one thing that CytoSport did bring to you where you didn't a lot of presence was access to the convenience channel, the C-store channel and I believe that was really with the liquid beverage product form for Muscle Milk. Can you give us an idea what we can look for more distribution gains or where we sit on that front?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, on the specifics of ACVs that's probably something maybe Jana could go over with you. I don't have those numbers with me right now, and it kind of does depend by channel. But I certainly can get to the second part of your question. We were fortunate within the convenient store channel to be partner with the Pepsi organization. They do a terrific job within that area. They've enjoyed being partners with the Muscle Milk team for a long time and have been really appreciative of the redoubled effort that we're now able to do to our new product innovation in that area. And so they see it as a growth vehicle for their distributors to utilize and we clearly see it as a growth area for us as well. It does enhance our overall knowledge of the C-store area and we kind of handle the food aspects of the C-store still with our own team with products such as our Don Miguel products and REV and those other types of items, but as we become larger within that segment that can only help in terms of our ability to develop the types of items that the C-store world is looking for.","Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks, everyone. I'm really pleased with the opportunity to be able to talk about another record performance for the company this quarter. We recognize that there are still a number of challenges that face us this year, but I'm confident that our teams have the plans in place to drive continued growth for our shareholders.

We announced record third quarter earnings this morning of $0.51 per share, up 21% over the last year. Operating profit increased by 23%. We also achieved record sales of $2.3 billion, an increase of 6% over the last year with a 1% volume decline. The resiliency of our balanced business model was evidenced this quarter by our ability to deliver sales and earnings growth in a highly elevated input cost environment with three of our five segments registering profit gains.","I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products segment profit decreased 36% and sales were down 3%. Pricing actions taken earlier this year on our core canned meat and microwave meal items slowed sales of these products. Record high beef, pork and chicken input costs also significantly impacted margins. The center of the store has become a more challenging environment for many food categories. We have some franchises such as our Dinty Moore stew and Compleats microwave meals that appeared to be affected as well.","However, we have several items positioned in the center of the store that continue to grow even in this more difficult time, such as SKIPPY peanut butter, Hormel bacon toppings and the HERDEZ line of salsas and sauces within our MegaMex Foods joint venture. We will continue to build on the momentum of the SKIPPY peanut butter brand with national advertising during the back-to-school season this fall after many years off air.","Segment operating profit for the Refrigerated Foods group was up 101%. The large increase was driven by beneficial pork operating margins, which were stronger than expected and growth of retail and foodservice value added products.","Pork cutout values remained unseasonably high this summer, which more than offset record high hog costs. At the end of the quarter, we had anticipated volatility in the Refrigerated Foods segment due to tight hog supply, but our team did an excellent job by curing hogs and managing inventories to support growth of our key franchises.","As part of the preparation for low hog availability, we\u2019ve reduced our Fremont, Nebraska harvest operation to four days per week through most of the summer. We have recently returned to a normalized schedule. Dollar sales for Refrigerated Foods increased 12% led by retail sales of our Hormel Black Label bacon, Hormel REV Snack Wraps and LLOYD\u2019S ribs.","We also enjoyed sales growth in our foodservice business, including such items as our Hormel FIRE BRAISED Meats, Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon, and Hormel fully cooked sausage. Segment volume was flat compared to last year driven by lower commodity sales, as we have increased internal utilization of raw materials in our value-added products along with higher pricing on key retail items to mitigate margin exposure.","Our Refrigerated Foods team launched distribution of Hormel REV, A.M. Breakfast REVs this quarter. We introduced four varieties each with flatbread, egg, cheese and breakfast meat. Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered a segment profit increase of 42%, driven by value-added sales growth, strong turkey commodity pricing and beneficial grain input costs. The last of the flocks impacted by the harsh winter weather and elevated fuel cost, moved through our system during the quarter.","Segment dollar sales rose 4% on a volume decline of 2%. High turkey commodity prices more than offset lower volumes driven by the timing of whole bird sales in the retail channel. Sales of our value-added items experienced nice growth this quarter, led by our Jennie-O Turkey Store ground turkey items, which continued to benefit from our turkey taco advertising campaign won earlier this year. Value-added products in our foodservice and deli lines also drove sales growth.","Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 25%, and a sales decrease of 10%, largely resulting from the expiration of the agreement in July 2013, allowing Diamond Crystal Brands to sell certain sugar substitutes into foodservice trade channels. This is the final quarter of challenging comparisons related to the expiration of this agreement.","We completed the acquisition of CytoSport Holdings on August 11, 2014 and welcome the team to Hormel Foods. We look forward to realizing the synergies between CytoSport and our existing protein-rich sports nutrition operations and applying our innovation capabilities to maximize the potential of the Muscle Milk brand in the fast-growing sports nutrition space.","Our international and other segment profit increased 12% and sales grew 18%. results were led by strong sales from our Beijing and Shanghai facilities into the foodservice channel, along with the addition of the SKIPPY business within China. exports of our SPAM family of products were impacted by high input costs, during the quarter.","as we move into the fourth quarter, we expect elevated meat input cost to continue to squeeze margins on certain of our value-added products, especially in our Grocery Products segment. Pork operating margins will likely remain seasonably positive this fall, as hog cost began to moderate with better supply, but difficult comparisons to last year will minimize this factor for our Refrigerated Food segment in Q4.","We expect our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment to finish the year strong with value-added sales growth, continued high turkey commodity prices and beneficial grain markets. Specialty Foods has lapped the expiration of it sugar substitute contract and should return to year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter.","CytoSport results will also be included for Q4, increasing revenues for the segment, but not materially impacting earnings net of the acquisition closing cost. We look for our International & Other segment to continue to drive growth, led by our China operations and SKIPPY peanut butter export business, offset in part by high U.S. meat input costs, impacting exports of our fresh pork and SPAM family of products in the near-term. Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2014 guidance range of $2.17 to $2.27 per share.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter.","Jody H. Feragen","","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 rose 21% to $138 million, or $0.51 per share, compared to $113.6 million, or $0.42 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $2.28 billion, compared to $2.16 billion last year, a 6% increase. Volume for the third quarter was 1.17 billion pounds, down 1% from the same period last year.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 6.7% of sales versus 7% last year. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be about 7.1% to 7.3% of sales. Equity in earnings of affiliates was $3.5 million in the third quarter versus $1.3 million last year. The increase is largely due to the improved performance at our MegaMex Foods joint venture.","Advertising expense for the quarter was $21.1 million, compared to $22.4 million last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. We expect interest expense to be about $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2014. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34.7%, versus 35.7% in fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, we expect the effective tax rate to be about 34.5%.","The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was $264 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was $270.4 million. We repurchased 267,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter, spending about $13 million. we have 8.9 million shares remaining to be purchased under the current authorization in place.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.5 million, versus $31.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about a $130 million in fiscal 2014. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million unchanged from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $34.8 million, up $11.5 million over the last year. For fiscal 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million.","As Jeff indicated, we closed on the acquisition of CytoSport Holdings using available cash and a portion of our $300 million credit revolver to fund the $450 million acquisition. We expect to repay the credit revolver by the end of fiscal 2014.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Danny?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Hi, Farha.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Congratulations for a great quarter.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Thank you.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","We\u2019ve noticed a lot of variation between divisions in terms of performance and so just starting with Grocery Products those earnings were very impacted with the higher commodity cost. How do you think that recovery goes and when do you think earnings can get back to flat year-over-year and back into growth?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","","Obviously Grocery Products was the one hit hardest by the input cost environment during the quarter. We expect the fourth quarter to be still negative year-over-year, but not to the depth we\u2019re reporting here today. Now we\u2019re not in a position to give 2015 guidance here, but the long-term \u2013 our long-term outlook for the Grocery division is that it should be able to drive growth. We have some excellent franchises still within that business such as all our Mexican Foods businesses as well as SKIPPY and SPAM continues to have general strength on a long-term basis. So we\u2019ll provide more specific guidance on the next call in terms of what 2015 will look like that we should start trending in the positive direction.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then a question really on MegaMex, I mean earnings in that business almost tripled. What is the trend? How should we think about that business going forward and what\u2019s driving the improvement?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, Q3 last year, I mean to be fair, we had a fairly significant hit, remember we announced in terms of the added earn out on the fresh foods component, and so in terms of comparison that that was an easier comparison if you will for the MegaMex group. They\u2019ve had some costs squeeze within their group as well frankly both on the Don Miguel side and in terms of the avocado based products. Avocado costs seem to be normalizing and so and the top line is excellent in terms of the Wholly Guacamole franchise, so we\u2019re encouraged and excited about that and the HERDEZ brand is very strong and we just continue to rack up double-digit of top line increases for the variety items sold under that authentic Mexican brand.","So overall MegaMex is a key component not only to the Grocery Products, but to the total company period on trend products, and we think that\u2019ll continue to deliver growth for us.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","","Hey, Ken.","Jody H. Feragen","","Good morning.","Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","So, one strategy question, Hormel has been very successful of gaining outside market shares in niche categories, that\u2019s kind of your \u2013 over the last decade or so. You moved into SKIPPY, obviously you made a bid for Ragu. Could you think \u2013 and any of this performance you see what you are doing here, the success has been always in your niche categories. Do you think that you are starting to move away from that and do you think that\u2019s a good thing or bad thing? Can you talk about that and then I have a follow-up.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","","Sure. I don\u2019t think we are moving away from that, Ken. I mean I think what we are doing, if you look at the core portfolio Hormel Foods, clearly started in 1891 as a pork company, and the pork value-added products are still very important to our overall operation with sales of those items going through both Refrigerated Foods and to some extent Grocery Products segment. But over the years we clearly have had try to diversify the portfolio to mitigate risk exposure in terms of raw materials. But probably more importantly to stay up with the consumer, and so our Mexican Food franchise were trying to get more aggressive in the health and wellness area with Jennie-O and Natural Choice.","We\u2019ve had identified that we really thought we needed to provide more on the go offerings, and so hence our innovation with REV, that was a big motivator frankly behind the MUSCLE MILK acquisition was that \u2013 people are viewing those items in many cases as meal replacements, consumed on-the-go. And so again we are looking in most cases for leading share brands that we can drive with our marketing and hopefully operate on an efficient basis.","Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay, my follow-up question, what would limit the Turkey margins from moving up from this 17% \u2013 16.9% or 17% level going forward, it seems like this quarter kind of as represented what the future will look like if not even better, is there something that I\u2019m missing here?","Jody H. Feragen","","Yes, sure, Ken. This is Jody. I think the environment that the Turkey operations are operating under with industry conditions and the shortages, we\u2019re seeing some pretty favorable commodity pricing, so to the extent that we had any extra to sell on the commodity markets that\u2019s probably moving a little bit to the upside. So, I\u2019ll stick to that normalized range that we\u2019ve given in the past.","Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","So you don\u2019t think 17% is the right level to move \u2013 am I miss understanding you?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, I mean \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you are looking for a long-term number or a short-term number, as mentioned earlier we\u2019re not going to give 2015 number here today. But it would be fair to layout; obviously what\u2019s going on in the marketplace as we head into 2015 could well be in a market where the commodities are little less favorable. But I\u2019m recognizing that the grain markets could be more favorable, and so we\u2019ll just see what that \u2013 when we provide that guidance in November.","Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","","We\u2019ll take our next question from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Thank you, Akshay.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","So, can you give us an update on REV, the AM Wraps, you are launching I guess am I correct in understanding that the difference there is you\u2019ve added the sort of the egg component to it. So can you talk a little bit about why now with the AM Wraps instead of overall how is REV doing relative to your expectation?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure, Akshay. So, I mean I know on past quarters I was \u2013 I provided some estimates based on some of the early tracking with the brand, we\u2019re now in a position where we have 52 weeks of scanned data available, the sales on that basis were on $55 million on the last 52-week basis, that does not count sales into the college and university or convenience store channels, that\u2019s a little bit more, the lion shares through the Grocery channel.","We\u2019re very happy with those that\u2019s one of our best ever first-year performances on our brand. We think the brand has upside in terms of its sales capabilities beyond that, even with the core items and then as you point out on top of that, we are introducing the breakfast items. a part of it is just kind of coming out with the core line first, a part of it is making through that you have the product ready and performing the way you want, I\u2019m actually really quite excited and pleased with the team, coming out with a year later if you contrast it for example to our complete line and it took a several years to get a breakfast offering, that was the right offering within that product line.","Right now, we\u2019re focusing our attention on these breakfast related items on customers that already have a pretty good set of REV items. There are certain customers that really do have that in place, other certain regions of the country and certain retailers that\u2019s still spottier, or maybe they only carry three or four or five items.","In those cases, we\u2019re probably saying that we may not want to come right out with two or three breakfast items until you settle little more legitimately. But we do think breakfast revenue is another excellent innovation that will drive new consumption to this product line and we\u2019ll continue to excite consumers who like the REV line.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just on SKIPPY, give us an update especially on the International operations you talked about it a little bit, but given what happened in the grocery segment this quarter it would be nice if you could sort of tell us if SKIPPY was impacted by any of that doesn\u2019t seem like it. And then more importantly, can you give us a little bit more color on the Cyto acquisition and strategically sort of longer term how that fits in and what kind of growth profile you expect from that? Thank you, and I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","","Okay. SKIPPY, we\u2019re very pleased with the domestic results for SKIPPY, on a net sales basis, lesser because of \u2013 that was a category that saw price decreases. But a volume high single-digit increase in volume still continuing to get good future activity, we\u2019ve had some nice placements in terms of distribution sales there. And we\u2019re going to work on innovating within the category, our SKIPPY Singles are off to a good start, the dark chocolate natural item is doing well; also and look for more items in 2015, maybe more in the middle of the year for that.","On an international basis, it\u2019s still a little rocky to read. I mean it was positive in the sense that we obviously now own the China plant and all the production out of that plant is now being reflected in the sales. We saw a little bit of decline in business in Canada. And we also \u2013 in a couple of the Asian markets, we\u2019re still on kind of a conversion mode between our ownership and the prior ownership in terms of who has got the distribution and so forth. But overall, I mean that plant is in a good position to support growth and we expect to have that be a real growth catalyst for international going forward.","On CytoSport, we were obviously very excited, last time we\u2019re on the phone with all of you was in the middle of the quarter, when we made the announcement related to the deal, we did close on that deal recently. A couple of follow-up questions that had kind of emerged, just even since we announced the deal related to the kind of this notion of all, what does Hormel bring to the party, when it comes to the Muscle Milk acquisition.","So I did want to address that. We have knowledge of manufacturing and of the category, that perhaps has been overlooked a little bit, I mean our Specialty Foods group is a less branded group, and so sometimes doesn\u2019t get talked about quite as much, but we\u2019ve been manufacturing both powdered and ready-to-drink protein items for over 10 years with our Century Foods business unit that\u2019s under Specialty Foods, indeed to us. This was a great opportunity to bring a branded catalyst for that group to build apply that knowledge, the way we do in the rest of our companies to a branded item.","We feel we\u2019re going to be able to bring deeper sales and category management skills to the largest market for this product line, which is the food, drug and mass market where we sell so many of our other items. And really, I mean anytime you\u2019re bringing a product line, that\u2019s frankly kind of a one-off product line, a single brand and bringing it to a portfolio where you have deeper relationships at least we found that we should be able to drive growth doing that, we certainly did that with Wholly Guacamole for one example and we should do that here.","We also feel our innovation track record bodes well in terms of coming up with great new items that would fit under this brand. We\u2019re very early on; the category growth that we\u2019re looking at is still very significant. as we mentioned on the last call, our feeling and even the prior management were kind of conceded us, there was prior a little bit of lack of focus as they were in the sale process of the business. and so their share has not quite kept up with all the category growth, but notwithstanding that, I mean it still grew in terms of both the ready-to-drink components, the big Muscle Milk branded presence, as well as the full protein line. And so it should be a great growth catalyst for Specialty Foods and for Hormel going forward.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks a lot. that\u2019s excellent.","Operator","Our next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Hi, Diane.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Congratulations on your quarter. I wanted to ask you about the outlook, which you maintained your guidance, it seems like an awfully wide range for having normally, one quarter left in the year. and I just wanted to make sure that that wasn\u2019t sending us a signal about one area of your business team, potentially problematic. I know the hog numbers have come down pretty significantly, but it sounds like you are finding adequate supply in the fact that you\u2019ve reopened your plant, the one that you have curtailed those. There is something we need to be aware of, as we move through the fourth quarter, that\u2019s kind of giving you pause and making you keep that that wide of a range for the fourth quarter?","Jody H. Feragen","","So Diane, as we were sitting down this time for \u2013 at the end of our second quarter, there, we certainly did not expect the type of positive pork operating margins that we experienced in the third quarter. So I would say that\u2019s probably one thing that would lead us to have a somewhat wider range there going into the fourth quarter, but certainly feel more comfortable that we are in the middle range of that guidance instead of the lower end that we\u2019ve guided to at the end of the second quarter.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, all right. Well, that\u2019s fair enough. And then I wanted to follow up on Jeff\u2019s comments about the acquisition. so you guys have obviously signaled that you are looking to do bigger deals, I think you\u2019ve made sort of more aggressive comments at your Analyst Day last year after doing the SKIPPY transaction about big deals, small deals take as much time and kind of management time as little deals do, but if I heard you correctly Jody, you basically used your big pile of cash and your revolver, which will be paid out by the end of this fiscal year.","So if you kind of rate back where you started from which is significantly under our balance sheet. So the question is really more, do you think that you could do another sizable transaction here in the near-term and then would it be a drain on the organization\u2019s ability to kind of integrate, or do you feel like you need to give the CytoSport acquisition kind of time to get integrated before you could go out and make another sizable transaction?","Jana L. Haynes","","Diane, you are right. from a financial perspective, we certainly have the bandwidth to do another acquisition. And I think from organizational resource perspective, we also have the ability, especially foods might have trouble doing another one right on top of this, but we certainly would have the ability to do it from an organizational perspective. It\u2019s finding the right transaction that has the strategic fit that has the number one or number two brand, looking for something that is accretive to our margins and where we can really add some values. so something that has non-U.S. portion of the business is also very attractive. So we just need to find the right set and certainly, I believe our organization is ready to step up and do that.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","","Can I just ask a \u2013 sorry expected to follow up to that comment, that\u2019s sort of accretive to your margin, but you\u2019re talking about accretive to your margins are on the whole, or just within the segment in which year?","Jana L. Haynes","","We look generally\u2026","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","","Making acquisition.","Jana L. Haynes","","The first step is segment, but with the ability to become accretive to the overall Hormel margins.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","","Okay. All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hi, thank you. I guess two questions. One is, everyone thought that the PED virus was going to have a negative impact, eventually on packing margins, and it really hasn\u2019t, are we thinking now that there is not going to be any negative impact on those processing margins? And then secondly, Grocery margins, I get it that the protein inflation flowed through here and hurt the margin, but I guess there\u2019s a little surprise that SKIPPY didn\u2019t stabilize the business enough to kind of keep them from going into single-digit. Our SKIPPY\u2019s margins lower than the margins in the rest of Grocery, and is that also an impact for why margins are lower?","","Jana L. Haynes","Well, I think I\u2019ll take the first part of your question regarding the pork margins. I think what the unexpected on result that we saw in the third quarter was that demands continue to hold up to cut out value. So we\u2019ve really had anticipated the hog prices to rise like they did. But then the final portions also seem to be supported by that. We are looking to continue to see that positive thread, but we are up against some pretty positive thread from the fourth quarter of last year. So don\u2019t expect that to have a significant impact on the Refrigerated Foods segment in the fourth quarter.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","So on the Grocery side, SKIPPY\u2019s margins should be accretive ultimately for the Grocery Products group and are currently. that being said, I mean probably, the highest profitability element of the Grocery Products portfolio is the canned meat area, and that\u2019s the area where we clearly saw the biggest squeeze during the quarter, brought in part by the prior price increase that we\u2019ve taken based on just kind of long-term increases in the raw materials. and then when you add to it despite from PED in terms of the input cost on hog. I mean that really hurt their ability ultimately that deliver margin.","So that\u2019s what needed to cover, that\u2019s what, to the earlier question, I mean we\u2019ll start seeing some recovery in that Q4, but not all of it and we have some of the inventories already put up with higher cost and so forth, but heading in the future we do expect that to normalize.","Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And, Jeff, what is going to cause it to normalize? Do you need the protein prices to fall, because it sounds like you already to pricing earlier in the year? Do you have to take it again, or are you waiting for the protein to fall?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","That\u2019s well, I mean I guess waiting for that in the sense that we didn\u2019t feel, we\u2019ll show it, or we are in a very good position to take second pricing based off of a spike. if these inputs have become the new norm, we always do it and have to reevaluate that, but a lot of these input costs are already down, also really significantly even in the last couple of weeks. So I mean we do think that\u2019s what PED cost, it didn\u2019t end up hurting the processing margins, but it did end up driving very significant increases in inputs that we didn\u2019t still think we could price against, and we don\u2019t hopefully involve and we don\u2019t feel we\u2019ll have to, because we do think those are going to come back to a more normal level.","Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Just a last question, one of the concerns I hear a lot from investors about the process food industry in general is that people are paying more and more attention to help in wellness, and especially, in the meals part of the store like convenient meals. And I mean I will take the view that Dinty Moore, and chili and SPAM are kind of our own niche businesses, but microwavable meals like shelf-stable microwavable meals, I think are \u2013 could be just off trend. Do you have any view on the long-term for Compleats and what your strategy for investment there is?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","So I mean we had obviously, enjoyed very significant growth in the Compleats line during the 2000 decade almost right to the end of it. and then clearly, the product line has stagnated somewhat since then, one effort to try to attract new consumers and restore growth had been the notion of kind of going after the more health oriented consumer or a looking for higher end items and hence the introduction of our blue and green labeled subcomponents are complete. No. I think, we\u2019ve conceded here in recent calls that really doesn\u2019t seem to be working. I mean the consumer that really enjoys these types of items is looking for more of a basic meat , potato casserole type item, value is a very important element to this franchise and so as you kind of add more bills and vessels in cost to product that that doesn\u2019t seem to resonate well with the consumer.","So we do believe we can get kind of go back to the basics and get this product line stabilized whether it\u2019s going to be a big growth catalyst for grocery products anymore. I mean at this point, I guess we\u2019re not seeing that, but we think between Mexican Foods, SKIPPY, and some of the other items grocery should be able to meet their growth objectives using those items, but I think your overall take is correct. My understanding know when it comes to single-serve meals that especially even if you look in the frozen segment which has also suffered. Even the health and wellness oriented items and frozen aren\u2019t doing all that well. So I do think it maybe a combination of \u2013 where consumers are looking for items, but also just kind of shear economic and who is getting hit the worst from that.","Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","That would make \u2013 I would agree with you that frozen isn't doing well either in that area. But I was focusing on your shelf-stable part of it because that\u2019s really where you play. Totally make sense. Thank you.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our next question from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Thanks for taking the follow-up. The first one is for Jody. Can you talk a little bit about the corporate expense line item this quarter? It was significantly higher than the run rate that we've seen in the past. Does that include charges for the Cyto deal?","Jody H. Feragen","","Not really those will get in our fourth quarter and we\u2019ll show up in the Specialty Foods segment lines. General corporate expenses really impacted this quarter by some employee related costs, as well as the write-off of a bad debt. Those will be the two biggest things, so we\u2019ll see the transaction cost in the next quarter.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","How much of that would be sort of one-time like the bad debt write-off seems unusual, right? I mean would you say first of all \u2013 sorry?","Jody H. Feragen","","That was about $4 million.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Okay.","Jody H. Feragen","It would hopefully be a one-time thing Akshay.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yes. And, just going back to the PED virus from my recollection and just talking to others in the industry I mean this quarter was the quarter where you expected the most impact on supply. It doesn\u2019t seem like it translated into any volume declines in Refrigerated Foods. Can you help us with how many hogs you process? I mean we\u2019re thinking the industry would see 6% to 7% lower hog supplies. Does that just not materialize or can you give us a sense of what\u2019s happening there with supply?","Jody H. Feragen","","I think you can get a follow-up with Jana on the specifics with the industry numbers, but the amount of hogs being processed has increased week-over-week. The trouble is we\u2019re looking at some significant numbers from last year, so the year-over-year comparisons are still going to be down probably until the October timeframe. We \u2013 our team has just indicated, has done a super job of making sure that we have had the supply and we are now back up to normalized operations, a lot of the hog numbers that we\u2019re down were being offset by higher rates as well. So impact of the total industry isn\u2019t down as much as I think people originally anticipated, certainly helped by a summer that\u2019s been much cooler than normal and that allowed the hogs to put on the extra weight .","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Okay. and just one last one on the guidance range being as wide as it is, first, does it include these charges that you expect, or the Cyto deal, and if you can give us the order of magnitude that will be helpful and then just secondly, I mean you cited our margins that has been a main reason for your conservative approach there. What I can tell I mean margins so far have held pretty steady relative to the quarter you just reported. So is there something else that we should be thinking off when we are looking at that $0.10 range, which is unusual?","Jody H. Feragen","","Okay. the first comment regarding the titles for the expenses, as we indicated on the call, when we announced the transactions, we would expect that any income from that operation would be \u2013 would offset the transaction costs. so those should be a net neutral in the Specialty Foods segment. Pork margins are being maintained at the levels that we saw in the third quarter to-date, but there has been a lot of volatility. the comparison that Jeff talked about was to fourth quarter last year, and they were unusually strong in our fourth quarter last year. so that year-over-year comparison for the fourth quarter won\u2019t be as beneficial to Refrigerated Foods as it was in the third quarter.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Okay, great. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) At this time, it appears there are no further questions in our queue.

Please note during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as organic net sales and organic volume. ","I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.","Jim Snee","Thank you, Nathan. Good morning everyone. We are pleased to report our team delivered record sales and earnings in the third quarter. Our company\u2019s long-term growth formula is anchored in building brands, innovation, strategic acquisitions, and achieving balance across our portfolio. We take a consistent, long-term approach to our business decisions and strategy.","Over the years, we have increased marketing investments in support of our brands. I am pleased to report those investments are paying off with growth both from established brands such as Spam and Skippy, and with emerging brands such as Natural Choice, Applegate, Jennie-O, Holy Guacamole, and Herdez. We are also delivering innovation to the marketplace at a faster cadence than ever before. Food service innovations such as Bacon 1, Fire Braised Meats, and Austin Blues continues to generate growth. Retail innovations like Skippy, PB Bites, Herdez Guacamole Salsa, and Natural Choice snacks are also making meaningful contributions to our results.","Our recent disciplined and strategic acquisitions expand our presence in areas where we are a market leader, such as deli and food service. While it is early, I\u2019m happy to report the Fontanini, Columbus and Ceratti acquisitions are meeting our expectations. ","The final component of our long term formula is balance. This is why we made the decision last week to divest the Fremont harvest facility, which when complete will decrease our earnings volatility. Our long term strategy is sound and our experienced leadership team is executing this strategy. ","We achieved record sales and earnings in the third quarter as we managed through foreign trade uncertainty, increased freight costs and commodity market volatility. We generated record earnings per share of $0.39, up 15% from last year. The benefit from tax reform also contributed to our record results. ","Record third quarter sales were up 7% on a 5% volume increase. The increases were driven by the recent strategic additions of Ceratti, Columbus Craft Meats, and Fontanini, as well as growth from many of our brands across our entire organization. On an organic basis, volume was up 1% while sales were flat. Strength in key brands across our portfolio were offset by lower pork and turkey markets, which drove decreased pricing for the quarter.","Third party consumption data continues to show growth across our portfolio in both center store and the perimeter of the store. We are pleased to see growth in household penetration this quarter from emerging brands such as Herdez, Natural Choice, and Jennie-O, and also from established brands such as Spam, Skippy, and Dinty Moore. ","Grocery products had a solid quarter. We are pleased with the continued growth from our core grocery products portfolio as that team grew sales mid single digits. Brands such as Skippy, Hormel chili, Holy Guacamole and Herdez all delivered excellent sales growth this quarter. Total grocery product sales were flat due to declines in CytoSport and our contract manufacturing business. ","Earnings grew 4% as our core grocery products portfolio continued to deliver excellent results and were able to offset declines in contract manufacturing, increased advertising investments, and increased freight costs. The team at CytoSport continues to work on improving their business results. While volume and sales declined, earnings grew for the quarter due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses.","Our international segment delivered sales growth of 11% on a volume increase of 9%. Sales increased on stronger exports of Spam luncheon meat and Skippy peanut butter, favorable results in China, and the addition of the Ceratti business in Brazil. We continue to gain momentum in China as we grow distribution for our Spam family of products. International segment profit increased 9% despite lower fresh pork export earnings, higher advertising investments and increased freight costs. ","Refrigerated foods grew volume 5% and sales 10%. In addition to strong value-added sales growth, the inclusion of the Fontanini and Columbus acquisitions also contributed to improved sales. A reduction in hog harvest volume of 4% drove an organic volume decline of 2% and an organic sales decline of 3%. Pricing declined due to lower pork markets year over year.","We continue to grow our branded value-added volume and sales in the retail, food service and deli channels. Brands such as Austin Blues, Fire Braised Meats, Caf\u00e9 H, and Natural Choice all showed strong sales growth in the food service channel. We have also successfully launched the Applegate brand into the food service channel as we work to introduce this leading brand to operators around the country. The Natural Choice and Applegate brands also generated excellent sales growth in the retail channel as consumers continue to search for brands that align with their lifestyles.","On a segment profit basis, refrigerated foods value-added increases were able to offset a dramatic decline in commodity pork profits, higher freight costs, and higher advertising investments. Commodity profits were down 88% to near breakeven levels. This accomplishment speaks to the team\u2019s ability to deliver results and to the long-term strategy of moving the portfolio away from commodity business toward branded value-added products.","Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered strong volume growth of 14% and sales growth of 8%. Our three value-added businesses all grew volume and sales this quarter. Value-added sales growth was led by Jennie-O lean ground turkey, Jennie-O premium deli items, and the Jennie-O oven-ready products. Sales also increased due to earlier shipments of whole birds to minimize cold storage expenses. Segment profit declined 23% due to lower whole bird and commodity prices. ","As we look to our fourth quarter, we expect to remain on track with our previous earnings guidance. We expect a strong finish to the year from refrigerated foods as they continue to grow value-added sales and profits while managing through commodity volatility. We anticipate the international segment to generate earnings growth in the fourth quarter given the positive momentum that team has with branded exports and improving business results in China. We do see risk from tariffs which could negatively impact fresh pork exports and the segment\u2019s results. We anticipate a slight decline in earnings for grocery products. We expect to generate ongoing growth in the core center store portfolio while managing through continued declines in contract manufacturing. ","For Jennie-O Turkey Store, we still expect earnings to decline in the fourth quarter compared to last year. We see fundamentals slowly improving and are encouraged by trends in the turkey breast meat market. We will not lap the declines in the whole bird business until calendar 2019 but expect our successful Make the Switch campaign to drive branded sales growth, including our lean ground turkey product line. ","We continue to see double digit increases in per-unit freight costs. Our efforts to find mutually agreeable solutions with our customers are helping to offset a portion of this increase. ","Taking all these factors into account, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $1.81 to $1.95 per share. We have lowered our sales guidance to $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion from $9.7 billion to $10.1 billion due to lower pork commodity markets. ","Last week, we announced an agreement to sell the Fremont processing facility to WholeStone Farms. This was not an easy decision. The Fremont facility has been an important part of our company for decades and we are pleased to have found a home for this team and facility with WholeStone Farms. Fremont is a single shift operation. Given the changes in the pork industry, the facility will need additional investments to keep it competitive. I\u2019m pleased to see that WholeStone Farms has committed to modernize the facility. This strategic decision right-sizes our pork supply chain, reduces our earnings volatility, and is aligned with our vision as a global branded food company. ","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter, key assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018, and financial and operational details of the Fremont transaction.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. In the third quarter, we increased our investment into our business in the form of advertising, capital expenditures for our value-added products, and a universal stock option grant for 20,000 employees. The third quarter marked the completion of 90 consecutive years of quarterly dividends. ","Our financial strategy and capital allocation decisions support the long term growth strategy that Jim discussed. Volume for the third quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, a 5% increase compared to last year. We generated record sales for the third quarter of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase. Net earnings were $210 million, up 15% compared to last year. For the quarter, SG&A expenses excluding advertising were 7.2% of sales compared to 6.9% last year. The impact of acquisitions drove the increase. Advertising investment was $40 million compared to $44 million last year. We are currently advertising key growth brands, including Skippy, Spam, Jennie-O, and Natural Choice. General corporate expenses increased primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including the $4 million expense related to universal stock options. Expenses also increased $2 million due to tax-related services. ","Operating margins were 11.1%, a 160 basis point decrease compared to last year. The decline is primarily a result of lower margins at Jennie-O and higher freight across the entire business. Our effective tax rate was 18.4% compared to 34.3% last year. We engaged a third party to review our deferred tax liabilities in light of changes from tax reform. As a result of this study, the quarter reflects reduced taxes of $8 million. A $2 million expense was recorded in general corporate to complete this study. Considering this event, we now estimate our full-year effective tax rate will be between 15% and 16%. This implies a fourth quarter tax rate between 21% and 24%.","Year-to-date, we have generated operating cash flows of $743 million, up 40%. The increase was related to higher earnings and improved working capital. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $103 million compared to $42 million last year as we continued to invest in new production facilities and manufacturing capacity for our value-added businesses. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $400 million in 2018.","In the quarter, we paid $99 million of dividends at the annual rate of $0.75 per share. This marked our 360th consecutive quarterly dividend. ","Total debt is $720 million. This is split between long term and short term debt. We remain in a strong financial position to fund other investments. We did not repurchase any stock this quarter. ","We continue to focus on three factors in the hog industry: export demand, domestic demand, and industry capacity utilization. Exports remain uncertain, impacted by multiple rounds of tariffs and recent animal health issues in China. The USDA forecast export volume to be up 6% in 2018. Domestic consumption remains very high; however, pork pricing has come down since last year as the USDA Composite value was 16% below year-ago levels in the third quarter. We expect hog supplies to increase 3% to 4% this year and expect continued hog supply growth into 2019. ","The sale of the Fremont facility is the culmination of a multi-year assessment of the pork industry as well as a detailed review of the capital required to modernize the Fremont facility. We concluded that running Fremont as a single shift operation was not a viable option and we would have to either spend the capital to modernize the facility, find a long-term supply partner, or close the facility over time. We began discussions with WholeStone Farms after learning of their interest to enter the hog processing business. Our discussions resulted in the sale of the facility at terms that provide benefits to both parties. The purchase price of the transaction is $30 million and includes the Fremont processing facility and a multi-year agreement to provide pork and raw materials from the first shift of production at market-based prices. ","The sale of the Fremont facility allows us to do a number of things. First, this transaction allows us to contractually secure a source of raw material for our value-added business at competitive market prices. Second, this deal reduces the number of hogs we purchase and related exposure to volatility in the hog markets. Finally, the sale of the plant allows us to avoid significant capital to modernize the facility. For example, we recently invested $80 million to modernize the Austin facility. A similar investment would be required for Fremont in addition to investments to double shift the facility. ","We expect approximately $15 million to $20 million of expenses associated with this sale in fiscal 2019. These expenses include the cost to move value-added equipment out of the facility and various pension-related expenses. Fremont Harvest\u2019s 10, 500 hogs per day currently represents one-third of our harvest volume and less than one-third of refrigerated foods commodity pork earnings. We will provide further guidance on the impact to fiscal 2019 on our fourth quarter earnings call.","Input costs for the third quarter were generally lower. Hog prices were 10% lower than last year. We expect hog prices to be lower than last in the fourth quarter. Belly prices were 20% lower than last year. We expect belly prices to remain volatile and below year-ago levels. Seventy-two percent pork trim prices were 22% below last year. We expect trim markets to be modestly lower than 2017 levels. As we look into the first half of fiscal 2019, we see flat to lower hog, belly and trim prices. We do expect volatility as new harvest plants and hog supplies come online. ","Fifty percent beef trim was 43% lower compared to last year. We expect beef trim prices to be similar to 2017 levels. Market costs for feed were higher compared to last year. We expect feed costs to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter. ","We continue to see signs of a slow recovery in the turkey industry. Full placements have shown low single digit declines in recent months which indicates lower harvest levels in the coming quarters. Turkey pressed meat and whole birds in cold storage are still well above long term average levels. Breast meat prices increased during the quarter. Breast meat averaged $1.88 per pound compared to $1.53 last year. We expect moderate increases in the coming quarters. Whole bird prices are 17% lower than 2017 levels, and we do not expect a material change in pricing until the first quarter of fiscal 2019.","Various market factors, including tariffs, freight, supply levels and demand have all created market volatility, yet we have demonstrated an ability to manage through this volatility and deliver long term value for our shareholders. ","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question and answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question is coming from Akshay Jagdale from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Akshay Jagdale","Hi, good morning. I wanted to get a sense on Jennie-O turkey profitability and how you see it. What\u2019s the long term bridge to a more sustainable and higher level? If we have low breast meat prices which seem to be moving off a bottom and then you\u2019ve got a bunch of higher costs, maybe you can help us just think through high level, long term how we\u2019re going to regain profitability levels that we\u2019ve seen in this business historically. Thank you. ","Jim Snee","Good morning. The JOTS business, we still remain very pleased with that business, very pleased with the value-added growth that we\u2019re seeing, just like we did this most recent quarter. Over time certainly we need to make sure that the supply comes in balance in the marketplace. We\u2019ve talked a lot about lower poult placements, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the need for reduced inventory in cold storage, and although we\u2019re seeing those trends, they\u2019re happening slower than we have expected. You\u2019re correct - we are seeing higher breast meat pricing, we\u2019re seeing a stabilized whole bird market which are very positive for the fundamentals of the business, but over the long term for us, it\u2019s really about our ability to continue to grow the value-added business, and we believe the results that we\u2019ve delivered in the third quarter are a very good indication that the business is healthy and will return to growth in 2019.","Akshay Jagdale","That\u2019s helpful. One follow-up, I guess, would be on the refrigerated foods business. Obviously the value-added business is doing exceptionally well in offsetting some of the weakness in the commodity markets. I know you gave a lot of information so we\u2019ll have some time to digest it afterwards, but can you help us understand where you think the commodity margins are? Have they bottomed out, or do you think things might get a little bit worse before they get better as it relates to industry capacity utilization rates? Thank you.","Jim Snee","That\u2019s a number that\u2019s very, very hard to predict. Clearly we\u2019re dealing with a lot of projections that remain uncertain and volatile. There have been a number of announcements in terms of increased hog processing capacity, but in terms of what happens with the timing of that, that will feed into projections and into that volatility, so at this point it\u2019s really hard to say.","Akshay Jagdale","Okay, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Ken Zaslow","Good morning everyone.","Jim Snee","Morning Ken.","Ken Zaslow","Two questions. Will you be able to grow EBITDA in 2019?","Jim Snee","We\u2019re in the midst of a planning process for \u201919, and our early look into fiscal \u201919 shows pre-tax growth. Obviously we\u2019ll have more precise guidance for everyone on our November call, but as we think about all the different businesses, with refrigerated foods we expect to see continued value-added growth, we\u2019ll have our deli division fully up and running, impact of the recent acquisitions, and clearly we\u2019ll have the impact of the Fremont sale that we\u2019ll talk to you more about on the fourth quarter call as well. Our GP business, the core business remains very, very strong. We\u2019re seeing growth from Mega Mix, steady growth from Nutbutters on the core business but also on the innovation front, the pipeline is very robust. We have work to do to continue to stabilize CytoSport and contract manufacturing in that portfolio, but we think the outlook is very positive. We\u2019ve talked a lot about the JOTS business, the slowly improving fundamentals, the growth in value-added, especially lean ground; and in our international business, we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in China. We know that we have some volatility in the fresh pork exports due to tariffs.","So our early look into \u201919, Ken, shows pre-tax growth and we know that there is certainly headwinds out there and unknowns in terms of the tariffs, and we\u2019re going to battle through that; but yes, we do think we can grow pre-tax earnings in 2019.","Ken Zaslow","Great, and my follow-up question, just as a nuance, is in the quarter, how much was freight and the higher hog, higher deli prices relative to lower [pork] [ph] packing margins? Can you give some sort of relative so we can understand the importance of different factors in the quarter? I\u2019ll leave it there.","Ken Sheehan","Sure. On a freight basis, it\u2019s still been a headwind in the quarter, and we expect it to be a headwind in 2019. We\u2019ve said again we\u2019re focused on finding the most mutually agreeable solutions in terms of minimizing miles, maximizing weight, less internal freight, and we\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve offset a majority of the cost increase on go-forward basis. Nathan, you can have a follow-up conversation perhaps on the quarter, but really of the full year, our freight costs are expected to be up $0.06 to $0.08 on an EPS basis for the full year.","Ken Zaslow","Great. Thank you very much.","Ken Sheehan","Thanks Ken.","Operator","The next question is coming from Eric Larson from Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","Eric Larson","Yes, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on Fremont, and I\u2019m kind of inferring that this is what your contractual obligations are going--what your supply contract is going forward. Are you obligated--are you contracting to take all of the output from Fremont going forward, or just the needs that you have? In other words, are you moving away from some of the commodity oriented products that would normally be produced, and you will not have an obligation to sell that?","Jim Snee","Eric, in the short term, it\u2019s going to be essentially business as usual. We\u2019re contracted to take all of the meat just like we do today for the first three years, and then over time we\u2019ll have the opportunity to evaluate the business and make those decisions. But in that first three years, we are taking all of the meat off of the first shift just like we do today.","Eric Larson","Yes, okay, and that makes sense. I assumed that that probably was the case. Maybe this is for Jim Sheehan. Jim, I probably should know the answer to this because it\u2019s been a big delta for the whole year, but your general corporate expenses were up, it was a big delta in the quarter year-over-year. Can you explain what that is? You didn\u2019t highlight any one-time items that were in there. Can you just refresh us why your corporate expense is up so much in the quarter and for the full year?","Jim Sheehan","Certainly. First of all, we talked about the universal stock options. The universal stock options were issued in the third quarter, and that created a $4 million corporate expense. The other issue that we referenced was the tax study that we did. The tax study reduced our taxes in the third quarter by $8 million. There was a $2 million fee that exists within the corporate expense for that, and then we had generally higher employee expenses in the quarter.","Eric Larson","Okay, thank you, I appreciate it. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question is coming from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. On your EPS guidance for the full year, it\u2019s still a pretty big range, so I was curious what are the key factors driving that larger range. Any sense at this point whether you\u2019re trending towards a bottom or higher end of that range?","Jim Snee","Good morning, Rupesh. Given what\u2019s happening in the marketplace, we\u2019re talking a lot obviously about the volatility, whether it\u2019s tariffs, market conditions. We felt it was appropriate to keep the range intact for the full year, obviously reaffirming that guidance. As we think about some of the things that could take you either way, on the high end if we see continued declines in input costs, if there is a sudden end to tariffs, if there is a rapid recovery in turkey. On the lower end, the flipside or the inverse would be true - if we see a spike in input costs when you think about hogs, bellies, trim, grain, or if the tariff situation worsens. But we believe that the midpoint is still very reasonable, and we thought it was very appropriate to keep the range where it is.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great, and then my follow-up question on tariffs. I know there is a lot of different tariffs out there and, I think, some proposals out there, so I was curious if you can just help us understand the dynamics currently, and then what is assumed in your current guidance? ","Jim Snee","Sure. Obviously it\u2019s difficult since we\u2019re dealing with markets. For the back half of the year, it\u2019s about $0.01 to $0.02, primarily coming from our export business, our fresh pork exports. As we think about it on an annual basis, probably about $0.04 to $0.06, but clearly there is a lot of uncertainty. As you think across our business, the impact would be pork, steel, aluminum, but the majority of that really is being export related.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Michael Lavery from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery","Thanks, good morning. Could you just give an update on some of your supply chain reconfiguration? I don\u2019t remember you mentioning that as a driver of \u201919 earnings growth. What do you expect for some of the savings opportunity, what\u2019s some of the timing? Can you just give us some more color on where that all stands?","Jim Snee","Sure, good morning. We\u2019ve put our supply chain in place earlier this year, led by Glenn Leitch, and we have kept Glenn and his team incredibly busy since that time, obviously dealing with all of the freight issues in the industry, evaluating our total supply chain. He was really the point person for the Fremont transaction, and we have got a lot accomplished in 2018, doing a lot of work around in-sourcing production, asset utilization, some automation, efficiency projects, and then we can\u2019t forget the fact that we\u2019re in the midst of building a new facility in Melrose for our Jennie-O Turkey Store business, and then a significant expansion for our value-added capacity down in Dold. We have kept that team busy.","We are working for a perspective on 2019 and we\u2019ll be able to provide you more detail on that in our fourth quarter call.","Michael Lavery","Is it right to assume some of the freight efficiencies you\u2019re looking for are all integral to that work? Just related to freight, when you talk about some of that headwind continuing into next year, is that all on rates that--are you still seeing those going higher?","Jim Snee","I think it\u2019s a combination of things. I mean, you\u2019re going to have--who knows what\u2019s going to happen with fuel prices. Certainly the shortage of drivers can impact rates. What we\u2019re really focused on are the things that we can control, and I mentioned it\u2019s the minimizing miles, maximizing freight, and really making sure that we\u2019re doing the right things on an internal basis so that we can offset as much of that as possible. But we feel really good about the work that\u2019s been done.","Michael Lavery","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is coming from Jeremy Scott from Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott","Hey, good morning. Just want to talk a little bit about the Fremont sale. I guess it\u2019s one third of processing, less than one third of commodity sales, so that would imply that the value-add mix is somewhat higher than Austin. Maybe you can elaborate on what you meant by that.","Then on the multi-purchase agreement, just the answer to the prior question on taking all the meat, so it sounds like your overall volume is not going to be impacted because you said it\u2019s business as usual; however I guess I\u2019m a little bit confused as to what the margin structure on that looks like. Presumably there\u2019s commodity product that you\u2019re going to be buying and then reselling without a value-add component, is that right?","Jim Snee","That is correct. If you think about the transaction, what we are losing is the spread between the hog cost and the USDA composite value. That\u2019s how I would look at it.","Jeremy Scott","Okay, so that\u2019s a pretty good margin today, but if you were to buy ham and then resell ham, that margin would effectively go to zero, is that correct?","Jim Snee","Well, you\u2019re correct that the margin is pretty good today, and what we\u2019ve talked about is that historically, it\u2019s less than 5% of refrigerated foods earnings, and in the current year, far less than that. We talked about a significant drop last quarter, about 25%, significant drop this quarter of 88%, and then really what the future holds in terms of how much comes online, what the timing is, it\u2019s all projections and it remains very uncertain and volatile.","Jim Sheehan","Yes, so as we\u2019ve talked, we\u2019re giving up that spread, but the margins in retail, the margins in food service we\u2019ll still retain. We\u2019re taking out the volatility, and we still believe that this creates the right mix of internally sourced primals and outside purchased primals. It also allows us to avoid a very significant capital allocation. If you think about the Austin plant, that was over $80 million and did not include the cost to double shift this plant, so the capital investment into Fremont would have been very extensive.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. The $30 million sale price, that\u2019s a good amount lower than what you were able to gain from Farmer John. I know it\u2019s an older plant and it needs some capital work, but would that imply a lower normalized margin than Farmer John, or is there something in the multi-year purchase agreement with WholeStone that we need to consider going forward, or is it just you said you\u2019re going to take the market price plus? What do we need to consider going forward as we\u2019re mapping this out?","Jim Snee","I think the first thing is that you can\u2019t look at the purchase price in a vacuum. The first thing is Fremont was not a full business like Farmer John, and then the price does not include any of the value-added assets. We\u2019ve talked about some of the expenses that we\u2019ll have in 2019 as we relocate those assets, but the price does not include any of that because we will retain that. ","As Jim mentioned, the facility really is in need of significant investment to remain competitive, and in fact it couldn\u2019t support both a double shift and value-added capacity, and so it does have the supply agreement at market-based prices, which we believe is a mutually beneficial agreement, and it\u2019s consistent with our long term strategy and we\u2019re excited. We really look forward to a long, successful partnership with WholeStone.","Jeremy Scott","Got it. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue, thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe first question on refrigerated and the value-added side. The organic volumes in the quarter were down 2, you talked about harvest levels down 4, so can you talk about what the Ceratti and Columbus, or I guess Fontanini and Columbus organic volume growth were in the period? I know they\u2019re still in M&A, but just trying to think about what that organic volume growth looks like prospectively as you get those lapped into the base and you start comping some of those declines in harvest values that you\u2019ve seen in the last few quarters.","Jim Snee","Adam, I think it\u2019s safe to say the value-added growth that we saw in the quarter was significant. I mean, to be able to offset that type of commodity profit decline of 88% tells a story of value-added growth. When you think about what\u2019s happening with Columbus, we\u2019re putting that deli sales division together to really leverage the strengths of the organization. The Columbus business remains very healthy and is going to be integral to the foundation of the deli division. The Fontanini business, also very healthy, and we\u2019re now able to really leverage what the acquisition thesis was in terms of taking our food service portfolio into the Fontanini organization and taking that Fontanini portfolio into the food service organization, so that we really can--you know, over time we know that we\u2019re going to see a sequential acceleration in that food service business. ","I mean, we feel really good about what both of those businesses are bringing to the party, and they are going to play a key role as we continue to drive that value-added business over time.","Jim Sheehan","I would add that we completed the integration of both Columbus and Fontanini. The other thing that we\u2019ve talked about is that volatility of the market can create some noise between quarters, and if you take a look at the belly market, the belly market\u2019s increased all during the third quarter and our pricing trails that increase. You saw a steep decline at the end of the third quarter in belly pricing, so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we feel that there will be a strong finish to refrigerated foods in Q4.","Adam Samuelson","Okay, and then just going back on Fremont, just want to be clear on thinking about the sale price. So $30 million for the asset, you guys internally would think that there\u2019s at least $80 million of capital needed to go in, so effectively it\u2019s 110, some capital foregone that you don\u2019t have to spend, and from an earnings contribution at the plant, in the past you\u2019ve talked about commodity profits in refrigerated averaging about 15% of the segment, probably under that this year, and Fremont you talked about being less than a third of that. So the EBIT contribution of the plant, I\u2019d guess this year somewhere in the $10 million to $20 million range, is that a fair assessment, and then thinking about the sale price effectively is 110 because it\u2019s capital that you\u2019d otherwise have to spend?","Jim Sheehan","Right. The commodity profits were down 88% in the third quarter, and we discussed that they were near breakeven levels. The fact that Fremont is a single shift plant, it\u2019s not as efficient as the Austin plant, which is a highly efficient double shift plant, that\u2019s why the profits are less than the volume at the plant. I would say that it\u2019s closer to $10 million a year than the numbers that you\u2019re throwing out.","Adam Samuelson","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question is coming from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thanks. I guess a couple questions. One is on bacon pricing versus bellies, the spreads in the quarter. Were they favorable versus last year? I noticed that Bacon 1 was not mentioned in the press release as being a growth driver - that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen that in years. Bacon 1 has been a big driver of growth for you, so I just want to know what the spread was, whether it was good or bad.","Then second, maybe if we could just take a step back at the big drivers for fiscal \u201919, the puts and takes. I imagine there\u2019s going to be the headwind from the costs to transition Fremont - you mentioned it here, $20 million or so. Maybe you could also help us on the commodity bridge to fiscal \u201919. Are you close to zero this year in commodity profits in pork, and therefore we don\u2019t have to think about another decline in fiscal \u201919 because if you\u2019re close to breakeven this year, we don\u2019t have to worry about a tough comp in fiscal \u201919 on the commodity side, or maybe we do? Can you help me with that?","Jim Snee","Yes, good morning Rob. I\u2019ll take the bacon part and then we\u2019ll let Jim take the commodity part. The bacon dynamics, we had a solid quarter on retail bacon. It\u2019s obviously a very competitive category. I think the spreads have been positive, so really no issue there. In terms of the food service bacon dynamics, there was no fundamental reason why it was omitted. We\u2019ve seen strong demand for all of our bacon items, especially Bacon 1, so the bacon category is very healthy for us. We feel really good about where it\u2019s headed and are excited because we\u2019re in need of the capacity that\u2019s coming on line at our Dold facility. Very, very healthy bacon dynamics.","Jim Sheehan","Yes, I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the pork commodity. As we talked about last quarter, profits were down 25%; this quarter, they\u2019re down 88%, almost to near breakeven. As additional capacity comes online, and we\u2019ve talked about the additional capacity for a number of months now, knowing that WholeStone was also going to add additional capacity into this, it\u2019s likely that you will see lower pork margins going forward than what you\u2019ve seen historically. Historically, those margins have run about 15% of refrigerated foods, and that was all of the analysis that we made, lowering our harvest level, and sourcing the meat externally would be a favorable outcome. ","Jim Snee","Rob, I would add that we\u2019re still in Q4 and so it\u2019s hard to get a full year projection. We obviously saw a significant decline in Q2 and Q3, and the market is a little different in Q4. So again, we\u2019ll be able to give you some better visibility as we wrap up the year, but I think it just speaks volumes to the volatility that we\u2019ve been talking about over the last couple of years.","Robert Moskow","Just to follow up, I think Jim, you talked about the outlook for \u201919, saying that you think you\u2019ll be driving some profitable growth in \u201919. I can see the logic, but the people I talk to are very worried about a protein glut overall in the market. The chicken companies are talking about it, there\u2019s too much beef on the market. Is it possible for your value-added business to benefit, I guess, from these lower input costs in this market? Is that what has to happen in order for profitable growth to occur in fiscal \u201919, or are you worried that with all this protein coming on, that even the value-added items might see some price pressure as well?","Jim Snee","We think, Rob, that we would benefit obviously from lower input prices on our business. I think the other issue is really what happens on the tariff front, and so there\u2019s rumblings out there about some progress that is being made and if that comes to resolution, that could change the dynamics. But for us, I mean, we do certainly benefit from lower input costs across the portfolio.","Robert Moskow","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question is coming from Heather Jones from Vertical Group. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Thinking about your tax guidance, the review you did in the quarter, have you made any changes to where you think the \u201919 tax rate will shake out, or should we still be thinking somewhere in the low 20s?","Jim Sheehan","Heather, I\u2019d think about 21.5% to 24.5%.","Heather Jones","Okay. I\u2019m sorry, go ahead?","Jim Sheehan","That\u2019s what we think Q4 will be, and we still think that we\u2019ll be in the low 20s in 2019, probably that same range in 2019.","Heather Jones","Okay, and then I just wanted to go back to the Fremont. I\u2019m sort of curious, you said $10 million for that plant, so if I take how many hogs it was killing a day, it comes to about 2.5 million to 3 million hogs a year, assuming no Saturday kills. I was hoping you could give us a better understanding of what you all are defining as commodity, because that would equate to only about $3 a hog, $3 to $4 a hog, which I know you guys said it\u2019s not the most competitive plant, but that is well below--on an LTM basis, well below what we\u2019ve seen from others in the industry and well below industry margins. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us a sense of how you\u2019re defining commodity when you say that it\u2019s closer to the $10 million number.","Jim Sheehan","We\u2019re defining the commodity as the spread, the pork profitability margin along with some profitability that would include our commodity sales into the excess market, is what I would refer to.","Heather Jones","Commodity sales into the excess market is what you would call the commodity part?","Jim Sheehan","Yes, the provision sales. Nathan can probably drill down into it deeper offline.","Heather Jones","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","The next question is coming from Farha Aslam from Stephens. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Farha Aslam","Hi, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the tax question. What is the deferred taxes that you\u2019re including in your taxes for this year, the deferred tax revaluation benefit total overall?","Jim Sheehan","Certainly. If you\u2019re talking about the change in the tax rate because of the study, what we did was to reassess our fixed assets to see if we could accelerate depreciation into the time period that had a higher statutory rate.","Farha Aslam","Okay, but your revaluation of deferred assets, that was just completely in your first quarter and we didn\u2019t add to that this quarter.","Jim Sheehan","Right, it\u2019s the--no, we reassessed that in the first quarter because the tax law took impact, had impact in the first quarter. You lower the amount that you can deduct in future years, but you reset that in the quarter. Your existing liability is reset at the time that the new tax rate is effective. Deferred tax is an ongoing change.","Farha Aslam","Okay, so the tax benefit for this year, is that about $0.10?","Jim Sheehan","It\u2019s about $65 million. ","Farha Aslam","About $65 million - okay, that\u2019s roughly around $0.10. Okay. Then my second question is really broader, on CytoSport. You highlighted that sales were down in the quarter, but earnings were actually up. Could you give us some color going into the fourth quarter and into 2019, how we should think about that business? ","Jim Snee","Farha, the team is hard at work at stabilizing that business. The big thing is what\u2019s happening in terms of the C-store market and the ready-to-drink space, and we need to gain back lost distribution. We\u2019ve talked about getting that consumer message right, and the team is working hard on that. ","We also are pleased, though, with what\u2019s happening in really the food, drug and mass channel. Our take-home Tetra Pak drinks are growing really, really well, our innovation is doing well, and so we expect in 2019 that we\u2019ll see some stabilization in the business but there is still work to do around that brand. ","Farha Aslam","Okay, so we\u2019re not going to see the fourth quarter recovery, because I think we had previously anticipated top line growth in the fourth quarter because we\u2019re comping against a pretty easy comp. ","Jim Snee","Yes Farha, we were talking about earnings growth. We saw some of that in our third quarter, like we said, and we would expect to see that again in the fourth quarter.","Farha Aslam","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question is a follow-up coming from Jeremy Scott from Mizuho. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Jeremy Scott","Hey, thanks. I think that question was just answered, but the driver of grocery products margin decline in the fourth quarter, we would expect to see some benefit from lower commodity prices, so are we to assume that some of that is being reinvested in your advertising? ","Jim Snee","Yes, we\u2019re making significant advertising investments in the GP business. The GP core business remains very strong, very healthy across the entire portfolio. The difficulty, the headwind really is--you know, we talked about contract manufacturing and then also that continued recovery of CytoSport.","Jeremy Scott","Right. Just one follow-up on Fremont. The product that you\u2019re currently producing today and selling fresh at Fremont, you\u2019re now going to turn around be a customer of that product and you intend to produce it into value-add, at least a portion of it. To what extent does that incremental demand for this new stream of value-added pork exist today, or should we assume that you\u2019re going to be pushing a lot of this product onto the marketplace?","Jim Sheehan","As we\u2019ve stated, we\u2019re a net buyer of bellies and trim, and we utilize all of our ribs. We utilize 100% of the product coming off of Austin for value-added products. There are some excess products coming off of Fremont, and we\u2019ve had our stated goal--as we\u2019ve stated in the past, our goal is not to sell any commodity meat at all, so as we expand our production, for instance at Dold as we expand our Natural Choice product lines, those products will go into--those commodity products now will go into value-added products.","Jeremy Scott","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. At this time, I will turn the call back to our hosts for any additional or closing remarks. ","Jim Snee","Thank you all for joining us today, and a special thanks to all of our team members for their efforts as we wrap up our fiscal year and successfully deliver on our key results. Thank you. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to the Hormel Foods First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded today, February 23 at 8:30 Central Standard Time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Jones, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kevin C. Jones","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6:30 a.m. Eastern Time. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at www.hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.","On our call today is Jeff Ettinger, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jody Feragen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jeff will provide a review of the operating results for the quarter, then Jody will provide detailed financial results for the quarter. The line will be open for questions following Jody's remarks.

It will also be posted to our website and archived for one year.","Before we get started with the results of the quarter, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the company are fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products. Please refer to Pages 27 through 30 in the company's annual report for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2011 for more details. It can be accessed on our website. [Operator Instructions] And I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Good morning, everyone. We announced first quarter earnings this morning of $0.48 per share, down 13% from a year ago. During the quarter, we experienced weak pork operating margins and soft sales in the center of the store. Nonetheless, our current performance represents the second best quarter in our company's history. In terms of the top line, we generated a sales increase of 6% with gains in 4 out of our 5 business segments. Although total volumes declined 2%, the majority of the decline was due to a planned reduction in harvest levels at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. ","As you may recall from our November conference call, we had anticipated a challenging start to 2012. Though our overall results were not surprising, how we got there wasn't exactly as we had planned. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment performed better than we expected and International turned in a good quarter, while our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments did not perform as well as we had anticipated.","I will now take you through each segment. ","For Grocery Products, segment profit decreased 9% on 3% lower sales. These results were prompted by significant input cost inflation and by decreased sales of our core products. We have encountered some sluggishness as consumers adjust to higher prices. Despite these conditions, we are seeing continued growth of our MegaMex product lines. Sales of Don Miguel products and the Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dips registered the biggest growth gain. Sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals declined slightly during the quarter as our new advertising campaign and the new product varieties and packaging have not yet been fully implemented at the store level. ","Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 44% decline in operating profit, due primarily to unfavorable pork operating margins. You may recall that pork operating margins were particularly strong during our first quarter a year ago. Higher raw material costs also negatively impacted margins in our Meat Products group during the quarter. ","Sales for our Refrigerated Foods grew 7% in the quarter, led on the Retail side by Hormel's Sliced Pepperoni, Hormel Country Crock Side Dishes and Hormel Natural Choice deli meats. Foodservice sales were also higher with solid gains from Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, AUSTIN BLUES barbecue products and Caf\u00e9 H ethnic products. ","Operating profit at our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment increased 4% on a sales increase of 4% driven primarily by expanded sales of our retail value added products. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers were particularly strong as we continue to benefit from our Make the Switch advertising campaign late last year. We reduced our harvest volumes during the quarter in order to better balance our turkey meat supplies. Export demand also remains strong, supporting dark meat prices during the quarter. ","Our Specialty Foods segment operating profit declined 4% in the quarter as higher raw material and freight cost negatively impact results. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 14% during the quarter led by nutritional products, private label canned meats and gelatin dessert products. ","In our All Other international segment, operating profit grew by 25% on a 17% increase in sales. We enjoyed strong exports of fresh pork and sales growth in our SPAM family of products. We also saw improved results at our Purefoods-Hormel joint venture in the Philippines. ","As we stated in our Fourth Quarter Conference Call, we anticipated a more difficult operating environment in 2012 and for comparisons to be more challenging in the first half and to become more favorable in the back half. We look for pork operating margins to slowly improve as the year proceeds. Grain costs will remain volatile this year, but we expect our team at Jennie-O Turkey Store to continue to do a good job of maintaining margins.","We are optimistic that sales in our Grocery Products segment and our Meat Products group will improve during the remainder of the year as our Hormel and SPAM brand advertising campaigns gear up. We expect our Foodservice Group to build upon their solid start this year as the foodservice industry shows gradual improvement. We are looking for better results from our Specialty Foods segment going forward as sales should continue to grow and the pricing we have implemented takes effect. We also anticipate enhanced operational efficiencies will improve profitability later in the year. We expect continued growth from our International segment, which is benefiting from a positive export environment and from their branding and marketing efforts. Taking all these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. ","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 totaled $128.4 million or $0.48 per share compared to $148.8 million or $0.55 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the first quarter totaled $2 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year, a 6% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, down 2% from fiscal 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.5% of sales, down slightly from 7.6% of sales last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be between 7.5% and 8% of sales for the entire year. Interest and investment income was $1.6 million for the first quarter compared to $441,000 last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $6.6 million last year. With lower debt levels and decreased interest rates, we expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012. ","Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.4% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2011. For total fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average numbers of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270 million. We repurchased 380,000 shares of common stock during the first quarter, spending $11.1 million. We have 3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. ","Total debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million compared to $350 million last year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31 million, even with last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $29 million compared to $15 million last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be about $140 million to $150 million. We will be integrating the sales of Don Miguel Foods, part of our MegaMex Foods joint venture beginning with our fiscal third quarter. Our retail sales force will take responsibility for representing this expanded Mexican foods portfolio and we will report these sales in our Grocery Products segment. Profits will continue to be accounted for, through equity and earnings, in the Grocery Products segment. As a result, added sales from the Don Miguel integration for the second half of 2012 are estimated to be between $75 million and $85 million. ","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Akshay Jagdale.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask you about your read-through on the consumer, especially as it relates to Grocery Product volumes, which you cited as being weak. We have CAGNY and trying to get an explanation from one of the food companies as to why we've seen a weakness. And I'd like you to just give us your perspective from a consumer insight standpoint. So why do you think -- what's going on with the consumer? Why are we seeing weakness in the center of the store?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, there's a few factors that could be coming into play. First of all, as many of the companies in the industry have had to push pricing, we certainly could be seeing consumer reaction to the pricing. Typically, over time, as consumers get used to both the new shelf price and new feature price, volumes return to a more normalized level. Secondly, it's really -- in our case, there's certainly is a potential of some -- of a weather effect. The areas where we saw the biggest weakness within Grocery Products were our canned good franchises, which for example, in the prior-year when there was a cold winter throughout the country and people were eating at home more often, we saw quite strong sales and that was where our biggest declines occurred this quarter. Really, if you look at some of the other items within Grocery Products, Compleats were down, but they were only down 3% on a volume basis. MegaMex was up 1% and that's not counting the Don Miguel sales, which as Jody mentioned, in the future will start counting within our total sales starting in the second half. And then lastly, we really have seen a mixed bag in terms of trends. There's no question that in terms of our total groceries results, the kind of tonnage that was delivered was lower than we had hoped. But we had some areas of very strong tonnage within the retail franchise. Our Natural Choice business did great during the quarter, we had good growth in Pepperoni and Country Crock, Jennie-O had big double-digit increases in their tray pack and burger numbers. So if you get away from some of the center aisle areas, we are still seeing very sold volume growth.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And just one for, I think, Jody or even you, Jeff. On the pork side, why are -- in your opinion, why are margins, the cutouts, below normalized levels right now? And why do you think they're going to get, sort of trend towards the normalized level later this year?","Jody H. Feragen","Good question. I think you have to look at the comparisons that we have to the first quarter last year where we had abnormally large pork operating margins. But as the market generally does, it trends back to some more normalized levels. The fact that we're seeing those tighter spreads in the first quarter of 2012, we would expect them to come back to more normalized levels, but certainly below last year.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. But why are they below normal? I understand the year-over-year comparisons are tough. But just forgetting last year's outperformance, I'm just saying -- I'm asking why do you think they're below normal? Is there weakness at the retail level? I mean, I'm trying to understand why they're below normal, they should be below year ago because year ago was too high, but why do you think they're below normal?","Jody H. Feragen","I would think that exports probably play a part in it. So the demand side of exports have been strong. We also saw, perhaps, a little bit larger harvest in the first quarter from the industry standpoint. So whether that ran up the prices of live hogs, that could be part of the impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lindsay Mann.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted a couple of quick questions. First of all, I was a little bit surprised to see -- I mean, I think the conventional view is that when Refrigerated Foods is weak from a margin perspective, you get some offset in Grocery. So can you just talk about the dynamics between the 2 divisions?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I think what occurred this quarter that did sweep across both areas was unexpectedly high input costs and we knew it last summer, they spiked. We knew it for the full year this year, we were looking at general increases, but our early look had been this fall and early winter time frame would see more of a normal seasonal dip. So that did not really occur. And so when you get into whether its pork trim or some of the beef inputs, those areas that affect both franchises. So on Grocery, it affects the SPAM, it affects bacon bits when you have those higher pork inputs just as it does some of the items on the meat product side. And then beef, same thing. Some of our meal-based items Dinty Moore, et cetera, have really felt the squeeze from those higher inputs than we had anticipated.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on Jennie-O, the division continues to perform exceptionally well. I'm just curious how you guys think about some of the commodity dynamics looking forward, particularly on the supply side and how you're positioned to sort of mitigate those factors?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, I mean, we are seeing some increase in egg sets and poult placements and an anticipation of an overall volume increase in turkey of probably 3% to 4%. We're -- because we're so focused on our value-added portfolio, we want to keep it, our structure, as tight as possible. And that was part of why we went into this year with a diminished expectation in terms of overall production. And so we have the right balance to be able to maintain values in those areas. And in terms on how they're reacting in the marketplace, I mean, still very solid results on the retail side of the business. A little more softness in foodservice and deli. But overall, obviously, Jenny-O came through with a very strong quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Ken Zaslow.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just one question. You did mentioned SPAM, Hormel and party trays as well as Mary Kitchen and Hash, can you just talk about how those brands are performing just to complete out the retail brands?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. SPAM had quite a weak quarter on the domestic side, a very strong quarter outside the United States, and we sell almost as much SPAM outside of the United States now as we do in the U.S. So that's the key driver to the success of the International business segment. Solid quarter in terms of party trays. Hash was down slightly, not as much as Chili and SPAM. -- I'm sorry, you mentioned a fourth item, I'm forgetting it. What was the other one that you wanted to know our trend on?","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Hormel.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Just Hormel Chili or just...","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes. Just Hormel Chili, yes.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes. Our Hormel Chili was down in the high single-digit level, so it was definitely a soft year, kind of had that impact more similar to SPAM.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And when will the increased advertising start to hit, that we could start to see maybe in retail, a date that we could start to see the turn in the brands?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Definitely. So we, the Compleats -- for the Hormel Brand campaign, we're featuring 3 items this year: Natural Choice; Pepperoni; and Compleats. That advertising first went on-air on the last 2 weeks of the quarter, so not enough time to really impact Q1, but it's on-air right now. In terms of our new SPAM Creative, it's the first campaign we've had now in 3 years domestically for SPAM. That goes on-air here in late February and should have us a decent impact on Q2 and going into Q3.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. And my last question is the Specialty. What's going to take that's up from -- like, it seems to somewhat disappoint a little bit, relative to our expectations and it seems like a business that should be starting to turn the corner and we anticipate it turning the corner. But what's it going to take to actually make the business kind of get to that $20 million or $25 million operating profit per quarter? I think it's kind of higher than more normalized run rate.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, I mean, we had a good fourth quarter with Specialty Foods and we definitely anticipated doing better in the first quarter. They didn't miss by a lot. I mean, it was in the range of $1 million. And then there's a lot of things that can go on in a quarter that can lose you $1 million. I think the team has their hands on those things. We did see volume gains. So we're good on the top line side in terms of Specialty Foods. So it really is a matter of creating the right efficiencies in the business and getting their pricing up, which they had to do that some during the first quarter and those will now be reflected in Q2.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Could you just give us some more color on the MegaMex JV? In terms of what's the total sales of the JV, what portion now is going to be in Hormel's P&L and kind of what the operating profits are of the JV? And what we can expect on the -- come through on the equity income line?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, I think the sales part we certainly can give you some good color now. The latter part, we might need then -- maybe I'll do a follow-up with Kevin to give you that kind of level of detail. In terms of sales, what has been reflected thus far in the sales line in Grocery Products are both of the franchises that the partners brought to the MegaMex venture, so that would be Herdez, CHI-CHI'S, MANNY'S, El Torito, La Victoria, those types of items. The 2 acquisitions that the joint venture has been subsequently made, Don Miguel and Fresherized Foods, to this date have not been reflected in sales. They have flowed through to the extent we've owned them through equity and earnings on our half of the profits. So what Jody announced this morning is starting the second half of fiscal 2012, we will be integrating the Don Miguel piece. We will be selling it through our sales force and running it through our invoicing system and our distribution system. And so from then on, those sales will start being reflected within the GP sales results. They won't change the profit any, because we still had our 50% share of the profits already in that business. And then in terms of the Wholly Guacamole, the whole Fresherized side, which is $100 million-plus in sales, those are still not being reflected through even with this change. We've just brought that on board and that's still being run separately.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so the margins in Grocery with all of these changes, where would you expect full year EBIT margins in grocery to come out roughly?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, that's where -- I think we'd want to follow-up with you on that. I mean, this is going to be a partial year. Clearly, as we've kind of teed up in the past, we recognized it as we bring in sales that only have 50% earnings component that's going to change the outlook in the long run as to what should you see for a percentage operating margin from Grocery, it will lower it a little bit. But in terms of the exact number on that, we can give you what our normalized year will look like and maybe some sense for what the remainder of this year will look like. But I can't really do it on the fly here.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just more color on Jennie-O Turkey Store. You had highlighted the value-added mix and highlighted that it was your promotional and sales efforts on that value-added product. Did you get any benefit that's probably more permanent in terms of your gains and distribution, because Cargill's issued earlier this year. And is that sustainable longer term in terms of the distribution gains? And also, do you have grain hedges that were better than the market that's flowing in, helping those results?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay, I'll let Jody answer the second part. In terms of the first part. I think we probably saw a little bit of benefit from customers who had uncertainty about their supply availability in relation to Cargill's recall last year. We're building franchises for the long term and we're really -- when we have dialogues with customers, we make it pretty clear, we're not looking to be a 3-month fill-in item. There's this significant demand for this product line and we really look for customers who are going to build a program with us. So we think the business that we've added on primarily is a business that should stick with our franchise and should benefit from the fact that we advertise the brand and we promote it very strongly in the marketplace.","Jody H. Feragen","As far as regarding hedges, I would say that in 2011, we had a more aggressive position on our hedges as well as that more favorable prices than we do in 2012. So we actually saw a rise in our overall feed costs for Jennie-O for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Jeff, I'm still trying to get my hands around this Jennie-O Turkey Store result, because it is stunningly good. And I totally viewed last year's first quarter as an outlier, not something that related to low-cost grain last year and difficult to repeat. And you're not giving us a lot of kind of outlier sort of talk about this. I mean, you're verbiage sounds like this is somewhat normal, and that would be awesome news if that's true. But can you just kind of talk through this margin structure, and should we be thinking of just structurally higher margins in Jennie-O going further forward?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, Tim, our goal for Jennie-O this year was to have them hold their own as best as they could with a strong year last year. And obviously they're off to a very good start in doing that. We would certainly point out that our 20% operating quarter, just as it was last year, the Q1 and Q4, they're strong quarters, that certainly is not the operating rate that we would anticipate maintaining throughout the year. But we feel they're a combination of the promotions they've done, the cost saving efforts that they have in place, the pricing that they've pushed, et cetera, at this point puts them in a good position to deliver against that goal of holding their own for fiscal 2012. In terms of the long-term, I mean, I think what we've suggested is we do think we've slid the range up, and we do think we've narrowed the range by tightening our bird supplies and making sure we're not a big player in the commodity meat realm of turkey. But clearly, there still is potential --  it's not always going to be exactly on one number. There still is a range of results that could happen at Jennie-O Turkey Store.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Got it. You didn't view this as an outlier number. I think last year, you really did view the first quarter as an outlier number.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","The Jennie-O performed probably a little better than we expected for the quarter, so we're pleased with their performance. But I don't see it as something that was a ridiculous outlier.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I just want to ask about the second quarter trends and then maybe some of your commentary. So I understand that there was maybe a little bit higher retailer stockouts during the December, January time period and I just wanted to know if you've heard anything about that from your sales team? And then sort of what have shipments looked like here if you opened the second quarter? And then, also just some clarity on your comments about how you expected the first half of the year to be challenging? I think consensus and I appreciate you don't give quarterly guidance anymore, but I think consensus is looking for earnings to be up on a year-over-year basis. But I guess, is your commentary about the first half of the year being the tougher comps and a little bit tougher, mean that you're looking for your budget says the second quarter's going to be down year-on-year?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","In terms of the first part of your question, we -- I had not heard a lot from our group about retailer stockouts during that period of time. So we wouldn't attribute our results on either direction to that. Clearly, the focus of the sales team within the Grocery area is to get the right mix of features, pricing products to support the advertising that's about to get turned on and to then start getting -- reversing the trend in terms of those results. We're just 3 weeks into the new year. So I really don't -- excuse me, the new quarter. So I really don't have a read for you on that. In terms of one of the other major drivers of results, the pork packing margins that Jody referred to, those are still quite soft right now, and those are numbers that everybody can read and see. In terms of a quarter, I mean, not wanting to sort of fall back into the mode of giving quarterly guidance, I think I can at least say that our expectation for the unit -- for the total business for the quarter would be a flat to slightly up quarter. That's the kind of range of results, I guess, we're looking at for Q2.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then can I just ask on the Foodservice? You're not alone in talking about some near-term strength that you're seeing in the Foodservice channel. Do you attribute that to the weather impact? So people weren't snowbound this year, they were out and about during the holiday time period or do you think that's -- so was it just sort of we got lucky with the weather, or do you think it's a sign that the consumer has improved and we're going to see sort of a more sustainable trend there on Foodservice versus eating at home?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. Our group once again was able to outperform the industry, which is certainly one of the goals we have in terms of share within that category. So the industry was up slightly and we certainly did a little bit better than that. I would guess that there had to be some weather effect. I mean, if we're saying that, that went away from some of the centers or sections in retail yet the same amount of meals were eaten ultimately, clearly somebody benefited within the Foodservice segment. I think our team right now would say that they're guardedly optimistic in terms of those volumes holding, probably would have been even more so, except that -- I don't know, everyone's watching a little bit the recent spike in gas prices and what that might do to consumers. But putting that aside, we do feel we have momentum heading into the second quarter in terms of our Foodservice volume.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Actually, I had a follow-up on, I guess, the explanations on pork margins and why they're weak. I would've thought with exports being strong that, that would be a positive for pork cutouts, and you mentioned that as a negative. And I'm just more curious about what you're seeing in terms of the packing facilities being disciplined. I thought that was a big benefit in fiscal '11, a lot of capacity had come out of the system. Are you seeing any industry capacity coming back in and is that adding to the issue on softer margins?","Jody H. Feragen","I guess I'll take that, Robert. I haven't seen large-scale additions to capacity from a harvest standpoint. But some of that can be impacted by the number of Saturdays that get operated within the industry. And I think that we saw, perhaps, stronger than traditional numbers in the industry for the first quarter, particularly in January. So to me, that drives up the price of the hog. And then the export drives up the price of the components that go into the cutout out, and we call the difference between the 2 the pork operating margin and that's as best as I've been able to understand what's impacting that, and they still remain pretty soft today.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So maybe some extra operating going on, on Saturdays might have impacted it?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","It seems that way.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, okay. And just, Jeff, your comment on second quarter being flat to a little bit up, is that for the overall business?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, that was company-wide.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And Refrigerated Foods was well below my expectations here on profits, but sales were well above. I guess you attribute it to just really just the pork cutouts. If you strip out the pork cutouts, were things pretty much in line with the year ago on a Refrigerated basis?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, the other thing that hurt us during the quarter was kind of what I was alluding to when I asked the question earlier about going across the franchises. The second piece was in addition to the margin of processing being squeezed,  but the absolute value of the primals was higher than we thought, and not just the primals, the trim, et cetera. And so there were cases, particularly within our retail portfolio where we did experience some margin squeeze during the quarter, just because those inputs were higher than what we had anticipated. And in Retail, I mean, the pricing is just slower. I mean, you tend to have to give 60 days notice and honor your features and so forth. Our Foodservice Group did a better job of being very current with the pricing versus these changes in cost.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Larson.","Eric J. Larson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just want to drill down, Jeff, just a little bit more in your turkey margins. I know that maybe it's 12 or 24 months ago, you folks took a much more aggressive cost cutting approach to that business. You did make a big splash of it -- you just mentioned that you did make a big splash, but you didn't quantify necessarily the numbers. But I remember it was a fairly significant program. Is that -- would that be now -- past you, would that be -- starting to be reflected in your margins at Jennie-O? And I know that last year you did not have a market-to-market gain in that 20% margin and it looks like you actually had up-costs this year. So it is a surprising margin and I'm just trying to get a better feel for, i.e., sustainability. It really kind of relates along to Tim Ramey's question.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. On the second part, I mean, we look at cost on a total cost-in basis and that's what the team is seeking to price against and that's when they look to try to manage their whole system in terms of total cost. Then say, okay, netting in your hedge, netting in everything you see with your grain positions and what the current market is, what's it going to take to deliver a decent margin within the business, and the team's done a very good job of that. In terms of timing, I think the impact of most of those efficiency changes that we've been seeing now for 5 quarters. I mean, that they've been in place and the team continues to do a good job of bringing those home. So that definitely was a focus for the group. Probably occurred over a couple-year time frame and is still being executed very well.","Eric J. Larson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just this next question, which is my last one, it's sort of an odd-ball question. I noticed that you'd mentioned in your press release that Country Crock is still a registered trademark of the Unilever group? I would have thought that you would have gotten that trademark through the acquisition. Does Unilever use the Country Crock trademark internationally or something or what? How come you were not able to secure the trademark for Country Crock when you acquired the business?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","The Country Crock brand actually had a much more significant presence for Unilever in the margarine segment. And so that business, they are still selling everywhere. So what we have is a transitional agreement. We have the right to continue to use the brand in this category for it's either 3 years or 4 years, somewhere in that ballpark. We're already in the process of transitioning the item. We've added the Hormel brand to it, so it's now Hormel Country Crock. We note from our consumer research that frankly the colors and shape of the product are very -- of the package is very important also. So we have a high degree of confidence that as we phase out of the Country Crock brand, again, we won't miss a beat and the consumers will understand the product. And in a way, it will actually probably help us in the long run because we're selling it right with our Hormel Entr\u00e9es and so it allows us to promote them with the same brand name. So we're in good shape with that, but we still have -- you'll probably still see the Country Crock on there for at least a little while longer.","Eric J. Larson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, I think I did. I think you actually co-brand Country Crock\/Hormel on the package right now. I think that's what I -- I was just curious as to what that arrangement was.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Christine McCracken.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Sorry for the background noise, I'm here at USDA. I was just curious on your export outlook for pork. If you look at the record numbers we had in 2011, especially with foot and mouth in Korea as the big orders into China in the second half. I'm just curious as you look out at this year and your expectations around pork margins, I'm wondering how should we think about the potential hurdles there? Are you still looking for another record year to top last year? Could there be some additional pressure if things start to slow down a little? It seems like you've mentioned that it's a little softer here to start the year. I'm just curious, how should we think about that?","Jody H. Feragen","Well, I wish I had a crystal ball. We've had extremely strong exports for 2 years, 2 years of record, so record-over-record. Is that sustainable for a third year? They seem to be strong now, but currency has a lot to do with the impact on that. I don't -- I would guess that they'll still be strong, but I would probably suggest that they won't be record and that's just my opinion.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","So with nearly 30% of pork going into export markets, couldn't that put some additional pressure on pricing overall? And then as it relates to your portfolio, how should we factor that in?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, I mean, it definitely factors into the overall processing margin in terms of what the primals are worth and the product costs. I mean, the other element for us to point out at Hormel, though, in terms of the kind of sales impact, is we're really not a big player in terms of some of the more primal-oriented export markets in the area of pork. We tend to do more specialty items in those markets. And those have been -- we've grown them, but that's been much more consistent and it's much less susceptible to what the current market is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of the Mr. Robert Moskow.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick reminder, is Don Miguel accretive in the back half of the year to EPS?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes.","Jody H. Feragen","Yes.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","By how much?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","We haven't really specified with the different Mexican acquisitions. It's definitely providing a benefit, though, to the overall GP franchise.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Seems like bigger than a pepperoni stick with me or bigger than a...","Jody H. Feragen","I mean, from a sales standpoint, we gave you some color of between $75 million and $85 million that would happen in the back half of the year.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","And that -- and we had a pro forma we did the business acquisition on and it's meeting or even slightly exceeding that pro forma. So we're very happy with it.","Operator","Mr. Jones, there are no further questions at this time. Please continue.","Kevin C. Jones","Okay. Thank you all for participating in the call.

Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. Please note that during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as adjusted sales and volume.","I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone.","Earlier today, we announced record first quarter results of $0.44 per share, up 2% from last year. Sales for the quarter were down 1% on a 2% decrease in volume. Adjusted sales grew 3% while adjusted volume grew 5%.","For the quarter, three of our five segments reported earnings growth. Refrigerated Foods, International, and Grocery Products grew earnings, while Specialty Products earnings were flat. Jennie-O Turkey Store had a difficult quarter versus last year with earnings down 25%. Sales were up 13% and volume was up 22% compared to last year. Segment profit margins declined from over 24% in the first quarter last year to 16% this year.","As a reminder, last year, we made dramatic shifts to product mix and cut operating expenses as we managed through avian influenza and a substantial decrease in volume through our system. As we communicated during our fourth quarter call, we knew the first half of the year faced difficult earnings comparisons. However, the erosion in market conditions was deeper and faster than we expected. Three main issues affected Jennie-O Turkey Store's profitability this quarter: declining turkey prices, increased expenses and increased competition. We can handle any one of these issues during a given quarter or year, but all three factors in the same quarter created a difficult operating environment that we did not expect.","First, turkey prices such as breast meat have fallen over 60% year-over-year to seven year lows, which were much lower than we expected. Jim Sheehan will discuss our outlook for key commodities, but given the industry, now appears to be in an oversupply situation. We do not see near-term relief on commodity prices which will pressure our pricing in the marketplace.","Second, we incurred higher operating expenses primarily for bio-security measures in our live production system and lower yields in our plant operations. We will continue to make investments throughout our business, including additional investments in bio-security to protect our business from an avian influenza outbreak.","Third, as we have addressed in the past, competing proteins continue to pressure our business in addition to increased competitive pressure. We experienced this across all three sales divisions; foodservice, retail and deli.","The team at Jennie-O Turkey Store is taking the appropriate actions to address near-term operating conditions and challenges. We remain very optimistic about the demand for JENNIE-O branded products. We have improved similar turkey commodity cycles before and we always emerge in a stronger position. We will continue to support the brand, deliver innovative new items and invest in the business.","Refrigerated Foods had another strong quarter. First quarter operating profit increased 4%, with sales and volume down 3%. As previously announced, we completed the divestiture of the Farmer John business on January 3, 2017. Excluding the divesture, adjusted sales were down 1% while adjusted volume was flat. Refrigerated Foods continues to benefit from growth in both retail and foodservice value-added products.","In foodservice, innovative items such as Hormel BACON 1 fully cooked bacon and Hormel Fire Braised meats delivered solid growth. In our retail business, items such as Applegate bacon and breakfast sausage, Hormel Gatherings party trays, and Hormel Natural Choice meats delivered very nice growth. International operating profits increased 5% while sales decreased 2%.","Our fresh pork exports during the quarter were very strong. We did experience a temporary slowdown in our branded export business due to changes in import regulations in certain countries, which have since been resolved. Our SKIPPY business in China performed well while our meat business in China continues to experience high pork raw material prices.","Specialty Foods operating profit was flat while sales declined 19% and volume declined 30%. Excluding the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands, adjusted sales were up 10% while adjusted volume was up 12%. CytoSport posted growth this quarter, driven by our success in the food, drug, mass, and convenience channels in addition to growth in CytoSport powders. Innovative new items such as Muscle Milk bars and Muscle Milk yogurt smoothies continued to perform well.","We saw strong sales growth once again in Grocery Products. Sales were up 7% with volume up 4%. Adjusted sales grew 3% while adjusted volume grew 2%. The addition of Justin's specialty nut butters and strong sales from brands such as Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, and SKIPPY all contributed to sales and volume growth. We completed the integration of the Justin's business during the quarter, and the business is on track to meet our valuation expectations. Segment profit for Grocery Products was up 1%.","As we look to the remainder of 2017, the balanced model we have intentionally built in our business will allow us to overcome the challenges at Jennie-O Turkey Store. We expect Refrigerated Foods results to be better than we projected for the remaining three quarters. We see continued growth in many of our brands across both retail and foodservice, such as Hormel Natural Choice, Hormel Gatherings, Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel BACON 1 fully-cooked bacon, and Hormel Fire Braised meats. Grocery Products will continue to build momentum, especially in the back half of the year. We continue to see sales growth aided by product lines such as SKIPPY peanut butter, Justin's specialty nut butters, and our Mexican Foods portfolio.","Specialty Foods is expected to perform slightly better than projected for the full year. The team has done an excellent job offsetting the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture. And as a reminder, we will lap the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture in May.","International will perform as planned for the full year. We anticipate strong sales for SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter, and CytoSport protein products in the International segment for the year. We expect the Jiaxing plant to begin producing products in the third quarter, enabling us to produce SPAM in China for the first time. We also expect relief in China pork prices in the second half of the fiscal year, which will improve the operating environment for our China meat business.","We continue to see positive demand trends for JENNIE-O branded products, but market conditions are expected to cause full-year sales to be flat to last year. Percentage declines in earnings for the second quarter will likely be similar to the first quarter, while decreases in the back half of the fiscal year are expected to be in the mid-single digits.","While it is early in the year, our assessment of the impact of turkey prices at seven-year lows creates challenges for Jennie-O Turkey Store and the total company's full-year outlook, despite expected growth in other segments. As such, we are adjusting our full-year guidance to $1.65 to $1.71 per share. We are confident in the balance we have purposely built into our business and expect strong performance from our other segments to overcome the market headwinds at Jennie-O Turkey Store.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and additional key drivers for the remainder of 2017.","James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone.","Volume for the first quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, a 2% decrease compared to last year. Sales for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, a 1% decrease. Excluding Diamond Crystal Brands, Farmer John, and Justin's, volume increased 5% and sales increased 3%.","Net earnings for the first quarter were $235.1 million, flat compared to last year. SG&A expenses on a dollar and percentage of sales basis were flat to last year. General corporate expenses were lower in the first quarter compared to last year, primarily on lower employee-related and legal expenses. We expect general corporate expenses to be lower than last year for the balance of the year.","Advertising expenses for the quarter were $52 million compared to $48 million last year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31.3 million compared to $31.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million for 2017. Equity in earnings for the quarter was $13 million, up 16% compared to last year. The increase was due to strong MegaMex results, including Herdez and Wholly Guacamole brands.","Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.7% compared to 33.6% last year. For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33% and 33.5%. Cash flow from operations was $178 million, down from $278 million, primarily due to the changes in working capital.","Capital expenditures totaled $38 million compared to $33 million last year. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million this year. Projects include completion of our plant in China, numerous capacity expansions for our value-added products, and ongoing investments for food and employee safety.","We paid our 354th consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 15 at an annual rate of $0.68 per share. We repurchased nearly 870,000 shares of common stock, spending $31 million in the first quarter. We have 12 million shares remaining from the current authorizations, and we'll continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises.","Total company operating margins fell 10 basis points to 15.6% compared to last year. The Jennie-O Turkey Store segment was the primary driver for the reduction. Jennie-O Turkey Store incurred higher expenses, including increases in bio-security measures, upgrades in our facilities, and investments into consumer trends such as our raised-without-antibiotic products.","Input costs for the first quarter were mixed. Feed costs were lower compared to last year, but bird yields underperformed. The Jennie-O Turkey Store team continues to make adjustments to improve performance in live production. Barring any unforeseen weather events, we expect favorable grain prices for 2017.","Although we anticipated decreases in turkey markets, the decline, especially in breast meat, was deeper and faster than we expected. Breast meat prices are now down 60% since last year's record levels. Since October, most turkey markets are down 20%. Based on current inventory and production levels, we do not expect a material change to prices for the balance of the year.","Beef prices were lower for the quarter, which provided a benefit to many of our value-added products. However, lower beef prices are putting pressure on the ground meat category, including ground turkey. We expect slightly lower beef prices for the full year. Hog and belly prices experienced significant increases in January. Hog prices increased 17% and belly prices increased 20%, 72% pork trim prices were over 20% higher than last year. Higher trim prices and the rapid increase in belly prices created short-term margin pressures for some of our value-added products.","Belly prices are being impacted by lower cold storage levels and higher demand for bacon. We project belly prices to be significantly higher compared to last year. We expect pork trim markets to be similar to last year for the balance of the year. Based on the futures market, we expect hog prices to be slightly higher than last year.","As we assess the long-term future of the hog industry, we see three areas of focus: export demand, domestic consumption, and total U.S. harvest capacity. The majority of the new harvest capacity is reportedly coming online in late summer to early fall, representing an eventual capacity increase of about 8%. In our opinion, utilization of the additional capacity is dependent on increases in exports and domestic consumption. We will closely monitor the market dynamics as the new capacity comes online. At this time, we believe Hormel is at the right level of capacity given the current market conditions. We are well-positioned to make the necessary adjustments in our business to address changes in the pork industry.","We remain confident in our balanced model. While Jennie-O Turkey Store may struggle this year, our growth in our other segments will be able to offset the declines.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","First question is on Jennie-O. Are you able to adjust your internal production to buy more from the outside to take advantage of some of the low prices in the open market?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Farha, Jim Snee here. We do already purchase some meat on the outside, and we do have flexibility at times. But our production cycle is a relatively long production cycle. So the flexibility doesn't really allow you to capitalize on all of that opportunity. But certainly, our team is looking at that and watching those market dynamics and taking advantage of it as they can.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's helpful. And then the second question is regarding M&A. I think you have a debt free balance sheet. Could you share with us what opportunities you're seeing out there? And where Hormel's focus is right now?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Sure, Farha. We're very active on the M&A front. And like most quarters, we feel good about the pipeline we have. For us, the biggest issue continues to be getting it across the finish line. That's always the most difficult part. But as we think about what we are focused on, the need to become more global, businesses or items that afford us the opportunity to become more healthy, holistic, on-the-go, multicultural are all things that are squarely in our wheelhouse. And then we also, of course, are looking for those right opportunities that will add scale or support existing businesses with the idea that we want businesses that are margin accretive, that are one or two in the categories where they compete, and we want to make sure that we're bringing more than just a check that we really can add value to the business. But I think the important thing to understand is that Fred and his team are very active. The pipeline is full, and we'll continue to work hard in that area.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe first continuing in Jennie-O, hoping you could dimensionalize a little bit and you did a little bit this before, but how much of the guidance reduction for the full year was really just the first quarter realized versus a weaker expectation for pricing and maybe some operational stuff in the balance of the year? And then I think you alluded, Jim, in the prepared remarks to Refrigerated, actually the guidance \u2013 the implicit guidance coming up a little bit and any way to \u2013 it was a $0.03 reduction at the total level kind of the Jennie-O decrease versus the Refrigerated increase, and how we should think about the size of the two of those?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Sure. So, Adam, as we put together our new guidance, on the JOTS side of the business, we do expect in Q2 to see similar decreases that we saw in the first quarter, and of course in half two, we're calling for mid-single digit declines for JOTS. We don't feel like we're being overly optimistic there, we are taking a realistic look at the business. We do expect stronger performance in Refrigerated Foods have very strong value-added sales, we expect that to continue. Specialty Foods group, the business and CytoSport which, of course, includes Muscle Milk, continues to perform well. So we are expecting stronger performance throughout the year. And then, Grocery Products have seen a lot of good sales momentum, we expect that to continue. International, same thing. So, we are expecting that those two business units will meet expectations. And then as we said, when we roll that all up, it's really \u2013 what we tout is our balanced business model that will offset some of those challenging market conditions for JOTS.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, that's helpful. And then within Refrigerated, I was hoping that the pork packing environment in November and December were exceptional, frankly, and I'm just wondering. Can you talk about the contribution of that to the Refrigerated and I guess the International business a little bit on the export side versus maybe some of the pressures you felt on the belly inflation that you saw in January and how those dynamics impacted the quarter?","James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.","So, Adam, this is Jim Sheehan. You're right. We did have good market conditions more in the early part of the quarter, for us November, December. What we saw in January was that there was a freezer report that showed that there were some low levels of inventory, especially in the belly areas. And you saw some drastic increases in belly prices, trim prices were up and hogs were up, hogs were up, I think, 17%, bellies were up 20% in that one month alone. So that created some pricing pressure \u2013 short term pricing pressure but as those prices increase so quickly, it's hard to keep up with the pricing. There is generally about a 30-day delay before we can reset our prices and with that type of an increase, it put pressure in Refrigerated Foods.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And if I can just squeeze one final quick one. In Grocery, Justin's, it seems like there was only $13 million of sales in the quarter, I think the guidance for the year was $100 million. Can you just talk about what was going on there?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Yeah. Adam, we did \u2013 that your number is right and for us what it is the seasonality in the business. And we learned through the rollout \u2013 our innovative SKIPPY PB bites items, that once you get past Halloween, there are some seasonality, downturn in the confectionary business. So, it wasn't totally unexpected. But we are on track for the $100 million and the $0.01 EPS accretion this year. So feel really good. I think at its core, the volume for Justin's year-over-year was up 20%. So the business is doing quite well.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. Thank you.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Scott with CLSA.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning. And thank you for the new disclosures in the press release. It's very, very helpful to break that out. I think in the past, you've talked about how ground beef wouldn't be a major challenge to turkey demand as it came back online. Are your views changing on this? Have consumers reacted to the drop in retail beef prices more actively than you previously thought?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Good morning, Jeremy. Jim Snee. I don't know if we've ever said that ground beef wouldn't be a major challenge. They obviously have a very strong position. Our position has been that we've seen growth in ground turkey because it continues to be on trend for consumers. And we expect over time that we are going to see growth in the share. We're going to see growth in the category. Obviously, in any given quarter or any given year you run the risk of the supply cycle, and I think that's what's happened here. Obviously, from a pricing perspective, we've seen some discounts.","The one thing that I would point out is that our tray pack volume was still very strong for the quarter. The tray pack volume was up 15%. And so that tells us that the product is on trend with consumers. But ground beef is certainly going to be a challenge for us as we continue, but we feel like we've got the right product connecting with the right consumers.","James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.","Jeremy, this is Jim Sheehan. One of the things that I'd remind you is with our balanced model, the lower beef prices are providing lower input costs for both Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products, as beef is a major input for both of those segments. So there's a bit of an offset of the challenge in the turkey business.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Just on that point, I think we saw the ramp up in futures, and to a certain extent has continued, for beef that is, throughout the first couple months of 2017. But it almost seems like we're starting to reverse that and turkey is getting more futures support. So are these new numbers just a conservative outlook on 2017? Can we see upside to what you're currently posting at 15% \u2013 16% margins?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","As we looked at the rollup, Jeremy, we really feel like we've done a deep assessment of the business, and this is a realistic outlook for the business. We've got some good strong sales growth even in the first quarter in retail, foodservice, deli. But the fact is there is competition out there, and we understand that. We understand the market dynamics. And so we feel like this guidance is a very realistic look, not only at JOTS, but all of the business segments.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And if I could just squeeze in one last one, we're hearing that some of the plants coming online are having difficulty finding labor, an issue that seems to be pervasive throughout the industry. Can you address that? Can we expect capacity to maybe be a little bit slower than originally thought in terms of the ramp?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","That's a hard one, Jeremy. And we've talked about that a lot in terms of when we've been asked the question about what does it mean to you, one of the things we have responded with is tell us when. And so once we know when this is all going to happen, we'll be able to give you a better answer. And I think labor certainly is one of the variables that comes into the mix. From our perspective, clearly, we've got a great long-term workforce in many of our facilities, so we're well positioned. And so we will be watching the timing of these plants coming online very closely and trying to better understand what that means.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Jones with Vertical Group.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us some color on Refrigerated Foods, specifically with regards to Q2. You said your outlook for the rest of the year was incrementally more bullish than previously. But for Q2, the comparisons are difficult on the fresh pork margin side, and the belly prices have been high. And so I was wondering if you could give us some color on how quickly you're able to pass through those higher belly prices with your bacon pricing, and if you could just give us some sense of the cadence as far as year-on-year for the rest of the year for Refrigerated.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Sure, Heather. This is Jim Snee. From our perspective, as Jim Sheehan described earlier, we did see a spike in belly prices, and we took appropriate pricing action. It's going to take a little while to work through the system, but we feel really good about our ability to continue to take pricing in that category. We've also seen some competitive pricing action in that category as well, which bodes well, we believe, for our future, especially in bacon.","In Refrigerated Foods also, let's not forget about our strong foodservice business. They had another great quarter in the first quarter, and there's no signs of that business slowing down. So we feel really good about that. And so the second quarter should be a good quarter for Refrigerated Foods, and that's what's leading us to say we do expect it to be a stronger performance for the full year.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay. So we should expect Q2 Refrigerated to be up year on year despite the margins we're seeing on the packer side?","James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.","This is Jim Sheehan, Heather. Again, we're less concerned about the packer margins. We're more concerned about our input costs. So we do expect belly prices to be higher. Trim we think will be similar to last year, so we think it's going to decline a little bit. And hogs, we believe, will still remain a bit high.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay, thank you.","James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.","So we have those input pressures, but we're confident about Refrigerated Foods.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay, thanks. And on the Jennie-O side, could you give us a sense of where you're seeing the most \u2013 you mentioned breast meat prices being down roughly 60% year on year, and you mentioned there's pricing pressure in all the channels, but is there any specific channel that's seeing the most price pressure?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Heather, I would say it's pretty consistent across retail, foodservice, and deli.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Good morning, Ken.","James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.","Good morning.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So when I think about the $0.03 guidance reduction, how does this change your earnings power in 2018 and 2019?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Ken, it's early. First thing, obviously, is we're looking out the balance of the year driven by JOTS. As we get throughout the year, we'll be able to take a closer look at that, but it is early for us to be looking out into 2018 and 2019.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Let me rephrase this a little differently. I'm not looking for guidance. I'm saying, does this change your ability to deliver the 5% and 10% and your margin expansion opportunities in 2018, 2019, and 2020 going out? How much does this structurally change how you think about your business going forward?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Okay, thanks for the clarification, Ken. I don't think that it structurally changes our business going forward. We're obviously in a market cycle. That cycle will correct. And when we think about JOTS in particular, from our perspective, we know that there's history here. History has been on our side. We've seen this in 2003 and in the 2008, 2009 timeframe. In each case, we've emerged stronger. We know that it's important for us to stay disciplined. And JOTS, as you know, it's a key part of our balanced model and a key part of our business. So in terms of structural change, we don't see it, we just have to get through this cycle and we will.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And my next follow-up question to this is, on Refrigerated Foods, you indicated that it's going to be better than expected this year. Again, pork pack margins coming down, belly is higher. Help us understand how your business actually functions because I think those indicators would suggest otherwise, and yet you're saying it's stronger. So, help us understand how this business can actually operate in a subsiding pork packer margin environment.","James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.","This is Jim Sheehan, Ken. Our Refrigerated Foods segment is the hardest segment to model. And it's difficult to model because of the focus on not only providing raw materials for our own \u2013 their own products in Refrigerated Foods, but it provides products to other businesses, especially International and Grocery Products. For instance, this quarter, fresh pork was actually transferred to International because International margins were greater than the margins that could be attained in fresh pork. So that \u2013 what you're referring to is the packer margin, you're really seeing some of that benefit in International and not in Refrigerated Foods.","We had a strong quarter for the value-added products within the division. We're focused on what our input costs are, and I think we've given you some ideas to what input costs are going to be. There will be some commodity benefit. But in general, we think that spread will be offset by higher belly and trim prices. So again, focus on what's happening with the hog markets; what's happening with belly and trim prices.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. So I wanted to just get a little bit more clarification on the turkey shortfall. It looks like \u2013 and your disclosure, again, we really appreciate the extra disclosure. But it looks like profits are going to be off for the year by close to $100 million. But I'm trying to break that down into its components, right? So you said there is competitive pressure, and it looks like competitive pressure can be broken into two things, which is competing needs, and I'm not sure if there are any competing brands that are causing any pressure. But it looks like it's all competing needs. So, can you break down sort of the pressure into buckets, whether it's competing needs and lower turkey prices versus higher costs that are in your control? Like maybe just give us some sense of order of magnitude of those three.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Sure, Akshay. Jim Snee. So the first part around competition and competitive pressure, I mean, we are seeing it in the markets, or in the meats, as you say, and we are also seeing it from competitors. We're not the only company that was coming back out of AI looking to regain distribution and regain business. So there is an element of market pressure and competitive set pressure. So we are seeing that on both sides. And then when we think about the next piece when you talk about expenses, Jim Sheehan referenced some of the bird performance on the live production side and we know that those are cycles and our team, again, coming out of AI is already working on addressing that in the live production side of the business.","So competition does have both parts. The expenses with bird performance. The other thing that we mentioned, which is going to be a very good thing for us over the long-term is our venture into raised without antibiotics. And right now, obviously, we're making investments in that business. We know that it's the right thing to do. And that includes feed, supply chain densities. There's a lot of things too that go into that. And then the last thing, Akshay, and I want to make this part just clear on your opening comment. We are not projecting $100 million decline year-on-year for Jennie-O Turkey Store.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Yes.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","We would expect it to be less than that, more \u2013 maybe half of that.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Yes. I meant relative to what your expectations were. So, yeah. I mean your guidance basically points to a $50 million decline, but relative to what you maybe were expecting before the delta might be that much. But that was helpful. So just want to delve into those issues a little bit more. So when you look at your projections now going forward, have you taken into account, there was \u2013 so I'm at CAGNY, there was a very large competitor in chicken that's getting into the ground poultry business, if I may. Is that included in your guidance? Do you think that's going to have a major impact this year?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Akshay, we saw that release earlier this week as well. Obviously, chicken has been in that space for a long time. And so it's too early to tell. We haven't seen the product, haven't really heard what the consumers think, haven't heard what retailers think. So it's really too early to tell on that specific product line. But clearly we'll be watching it closely.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Just last one. Prior to this quarter you were guiding to \u2013 Refrigerated EBIT growth to be flat for the year. Obviously, now you are saying it's better. Can you give us an order of magnitude how much better? I mean it looks like Refrigerated Food projection being better is the major offset to JOTS being lower. So, it looks like there's a significant positive change in your Refrigerated Food operating margin assumption. But can you just give us some order of magnitude what you expect EBIT growth in Refrigerated Foods for this fiscal year? Thank you.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Thanks, Akshay. Really we've got stronger performance for the balance of the year in both Refrigerated and Specialty Foods. On the Refrigerated side, the big driver there is going to be continued strong value-added sales both on the retail side of the business and continued strong performance from our foodservice team. And then on the Specialty Foods side, like we said, the CytoSport business continues to do well gaining distribution, but also some great, new innovative items that are really starting to take hold in the marketplace. So between those two things, that's really what's going to offset some of the difficult market conditions for JOTS.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. On the Grocery Products side, is it fair to say and I think you broke this out in the release, I'm just trying to clarify that the category was up about it 3.1% on the top-line? And then I guess as a follow-up there, we didn't really see a lot of operating profit growth in that category but we did see a little bit of advertising jump in Q1. Is it fair to say that we expect to harvest some of those advertising investments as we get through the remainder of the year?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Yes, Sean. Jim Snee. That's a fair statement. Really in terms of expenses, obviously, advertising was up on the quarter. There, as you would expect, were expenses associated with the Justin's integration that are one-time expenses. So certainly advertising will play a benefit for the rest of the year. We won't have the ongoing integration charges, but the bigger driver in all of this is really the sales momentum for Grocery Products. And so SKIPPY continues to do really well. Our MegaMex portfolio of products is doing well. And then we do see some favorable market conditions that will help them out and then again the full year benefit of Justin's. So that's really what's driving our outlook for Grocery Products.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, that's great. And then, I guess, a follow-up would be just on the Refrigerated Foods segment. And there's been a lot of discussion about different commodities that are happening out there. But is there anything that you can talk about just in terms of structural changes that have been made in this segment? And I'm thinking specifically about the mix of sales and value-added versus commodity within that segment which may limit some of the downside pressure that you may have experienced 5 years to 10 years ago. Just any sort of delta in the value-add there.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","I think, Sean, we've talked a lot about the continued growth, the migration up the value ladder, if you will, in our Refrigerated Foods segment, and it occurs not just in packaged items. We're doing it across the entire Refrigerated Foods organization, in fresh pork, in meat products. It's happening everywhere. And so we'll continue to work on that, and we've been very successful.","The other part to really consider is the, once again, strong growth of our foodservice business. That's a business that continue to deliver quite well for our organization. We don't expect that to slow down. And then a lot of the innovation work that we are doing in on-the-go with our party trays and some of our other items that we've developed. So is it a structural difference? It certainly is a structural shift, and we will continue to be working on that so that we do eliminate volatility over the long-term.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. I think most of the questions have been asked here. But two things. Just a follow-up to Ken Zaslow's question about your long-term margin aspirations. I think we need to hear it from you, Jim. Are you adhering to that long-term goal of being in your top quartile of your peer group and the range being 15% to 19%? Can you stick with that?","And then the second thing, just more a technical thing. I think you said tray pack sales up 15% in Jennie-O. Is that a true consumer demand number, or does that also reflect just being on shelf more with an easy comparison to the AI from last year?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Rob. So to your first question, the answer is yes. We are committed to that long-term margin guidance, and clearly the impact of Jennie-O on just this one quarter moved us back a little bit. But we do believe that this business is going to rebound and will emerge stronger and it's going to be a key part of that journey in the margin improvement. So the answer is yes. We are committed to that.","And to your second question, certainly there are elements of both, right? I think we are still probably gaining back some distribution, but you're gaining back distribution because there's consumer demand. And so again, the underlying fundamental there is we feel really good about the business, it's connecting with consumers and it's on trend, and we expect to continue to do that.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thank you.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So I had two questions just related to your recent acquisitions. So first on Justin's, do you still believe you can achieve the $100 million sales target for this fiscal year? And then on Applegate, I was just curious how that's performing versus expectations. And as you look at the environment, clearly seeing deflation in more of the conventional offering, just wondering if that's at all challenging the Applegate offering.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Sure, Rupesh. Good morning, Jim Snee. Yeah, just following up on the earlier question around Justin's, the $13 million in the first quarter does account for some seasonality in the business in the whole confectionary space. But we do want to point out that the volume is up 20% year over year. And so we do believe that we're on track for $100 million for the full year and still remain very positive about that acquisition and that business going forward.","And as you get to the Applegate business, our team there continues to work through the rebound of the supply situation, both on the pork side, and then that was compounded with turkey supply shortages through AI. And as you think of that business in specific parts of the store, the walled deli space is extremely competitive. The team's making progress there, but that's been a battle. Really a lot of continued success in the meat case and the freezer. Hot dogs, dinner sausage, the nuggets, the chicken breakfast sausage, those items are doing well. And we're working now on developing business in the foodservice channel as well. So we think that that business is very healthy and going to continue to do well.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting me worked into the Q&A. Really a follow-up on the grocery sector, Jim and Jim. When you look at certain commodities, obviously you've had some cost inflation with avocados. You've got trim costs. Is that leading to some higher pricing in your guacamole and maybe even your SPAM division? I think guacamole prices have actually gone up a little bit.","And then can you just talk about \u2013 your revenue growth is really strong there and I would think that that would be more of a positive mix, with SKIPPY growing, et cetera. So obviously with one-time expenses in the quarter, it held back your margins and your profits this quarter. But isn't there also a positive mix shift going on here as well for grocery which would be beneficial to margins as you move forward?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Sure. Eric, good morning, Jim Snee. Thanks for those questions. I'll try to break those down here. So the first one around avocados \u2013 and you are correct. We have taken pricing increases on Wholly Guacamole. And those prices have been in the marketplace a little while now, but consumer demand remains strong for the products. In terms of the avocado market, there are a couple of things. Prices are historically high, but they are down from some of their October peaks.","The other thing to understand is that there is adequate supply. And so we have a number of \u2013 or a lot of the supply that comes out of Mexico, but we have other sources for supply as well. So there's adequate supply in that space. And we again feel really good about the business going forward.","From a Grocery Products perspective, our guidance is consistent with what we laid out in the fourth quarter call. And so the business is very healthy, a lot of sales momentum. And you're right, once you get through some of these one-time expenses, we'll be able to deliver the guidance we laid out. And yeah, there is a mix shift (53:56), a mix shift as we think about the Justin's and SKIPPY and all of those product lines that really continue to build a nice broad base in the Grocery Products portfolio. So we feel really good about what Grocery Products is doing and where they're headed.","Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, thank you, Jim.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Hi, Mario.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just wanted to follow up on the 5% sales growth target that had been laid out in the previous quarter, 5% excluding M&A. I didn't really hear much mention of that today. So my first question would be, is that intact? And then if it is, what's going to allow you to get to that? It would require some amount of acceleration over the upcoming quarters here. You're not going to have the benefit of the turkey supply normalization. That will have already been lapped at some point this year. So is there any additional detail you can provide on that? Thank you.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","I think we're on track for the 5% organic growth number. As you go around all of the different business segments, Refrigerated Foods, the strong value-added sales will continue to deliver there. JOTS will be slightly lower. We are going to see some volume growth, but obviously we understand the market conditions. Specialty Foods will continue to perform well. And then International, Grocery Products are all on track for what we said they were going to do. So we do believe, Mario, that we're going to be able to deliver that 5% organic number.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And I guess, is there any specific segment that is going to contribute more than what we've seen so far? Or is it going to be fairly evenly balanced?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","I mean, I think, we've said our stronger performance will come from Refrigerated and Specialty, but there's some really nice sales momentum in Grocery Products, and we don't expect that to slow down.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much. That's all for me.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Thanks, Mario.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Scott with CLSA.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC","Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. Just on that point, your organic growth in Specialty has been very, very strong and it's a little bit different than what we are tracking. So, if you can just point to that, what's your \u2013 I know you're just kind of bottling up all the different segments to get to your 5% number but could you give some indication on what Specialty Foods organic volume growth could be this year?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Specialty Foods, you've got to remember that that's still a mix of CytoSport, HHL and our Specialty Products group. And so when we talk about that business, we are talking across all those different categories that are performing well. So I think we expect that business to continue to be strong, and even within that segment there's a bit of a balance that goes on at any given time. We've seen some nice growth with CytoSport in some more traditional channels. Remember, the C-store business, which is a big part of the CytoSport business, isn't measured. And the team's done a great job not only gaining distribution but creating innovative new items to meet the needs of that channel. So it's all of those things that are really setting it up for a strong 2017.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Jones with Vertical Group.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just had a quick question on exports. Historically, Hormel has not been a big exporter on the pork side, but you guys mentioned that this quarter they were strong. I was wondering, the Chinese pork market continues to be strong but it has cooled some. So, should we expect that strong export volume to continue for the rest of the year? Or how should we think about that?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Heather, just a reminder, fresh pork exports are \u2013 they are a decent-sized part of the International business. They're not, I would say, a huge part of the overall company. And on any given year, obviously, we've had strength and then we've had some challenges with pricing pressure with products coming out of the European markets the last several years. But it does look like the markets are setting up for a strong full year. Certainly, you've got the China conditions, but I think we've also all read what's happened, or what is happening in South Korea, which is a strong export market for us. So I mean we do feel like it'll continue to be strong throughout the year.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","But am I correct in thinking and maybe I misunderstood this because the industry as a whole, it's roughly a quarter of the volume goes to export. I had thought that Hormel's \u2013 their exposure was less than that, but are you all in line with the industry?","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","No, we're less than that, Heather.","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we have one final question from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. Just on turkey, can you just help me understand the dynamics of lower commodity prices on your portfolio, because 80% or so is value-added, so lower commodity needs should be good for a majority of your business? So I'm just a little bit \u2013 I'm trying to understand why that is causing such a big impact negatively on your margins. Thank you.","James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.","Akshay, this is Jim Sheehan. And really what's happening with that lower commodity prices are the pricing pressure that it's putting on to the sales price. So that's really where we're feeling the impact.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Right. But on to \u2013 because you are value-added, typically you would be able to have a better margin, right? Your inputs, when you are doing value-added, are down so your end price shouldn't be coming down as much, right, typically. So I guess...","James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.","I think to understand what occurred in the first quarter, one of the things that you shouldn't lose sight on is the bird performance, because the birds that we raise, we've talked about that we had some additional costs in those flocks. The flocks that we raised cost more and then they provided less meat than they typically will provide, and especially less breast meat. So the cost of raising the birds was the same price. Yes, there is some advantage in the commodity prices for breast meat that we're buying on the outside, but it's really the pricing pressure.","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC","Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And there are no additional questions at this time, gentlemen.","James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.","Great. Well, thank you all very much. While unfavorable market conditions in the turkey industry challenged our Jennie-O Turkey Store business, the balance we have intentionally built into all of our businesses allowed us to deliver earnings growth this quarter. Our team has a track record of delivering results, and we clearly understand what needs to be done this year to deliver the guidance range we provided. On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Good morning everyone. Throughout the year, we made significant progress towards our long-term vision as a global branded food company. With an emphasis on brand building, innovation, acquisitions and intentional balance, our long-term approach allowed us to manage through difficult situations, such as commodity market volatility, increased freight and global trade uncertainty.","This year was marked by many milestones. We made the largest acquisition in our Company's history with the purchase of Columbus Craft Meats, and we also successfully integrated both Columbus and Fontanini into our supply chain. We reinvested a record amount of capital back into our company to increase capacity and improve the efficiency. Major capital projects in 2018 included the Dold foods, pre-cooked bacon expansion and a highly automated Holberg facility. We also delivered many innovative new items to the marketplace, items such as Herdez guacamole salsa, Natural Choice snacks, Applegate Naturals products in the retail space and Fire Braised Flank Steak for food service customers.","On our financial perspective, we delivered record sales, earnings and cash flows. 2018 also represented the 90th consecutive year of paying a quarterly dividend. Our strong financial results and confidence in the business allowed us to announce our 10th consecutive double digit increase in the dividend for 2019, which will mark our 53rd consecutive year of dividend increases. By many measures, 2018 was a success. Refrigerated foods made impressive contributions to our performance with significant growth coming from value-added brands in retail, deli and food service. However, there are areas of the business that did not meet our expectations. Jennie-O Turkey store had another difficult year as they manage through continued oversupply in the Turkey industry. And CytoSport had a disappointing year with declines in powder and single serve ready to drink product lines. We are taking appropriate actions in both businesses and expect a return to growth in 2019.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $0.51, a 24% increase. ","Many brands and product lines across all four segments drove growth. This effort was led by the success in refrigerated foods and overcame significant commodity headwinds to deliver impressive results in all parts of their business. Our international team also delivered strong growth in the quarter, led by exports of branded products.","For the total company, sales increased 1% on a 1% decline in volume. The sales increase was driven by our MegaMex joint venture and growth of branded products in refrigerated foods. The Fontanini, Columbus craft meats and Ceratti acquisitions met our expectations for the year and contributed to the increase for the quarter. On an organic basis, volume and sales declined 3% due to weakness in contract manufacturing and lower commodity market. Refrigerated foods grew volume 2% and sales 6%. Products, such as Applegate, Natural and Organic Meats, Hormel Natural Choice products, Hormel Fire Braised meats, and Hormel pepperoni, all delivered excellent growth this quarter. Sales also increased due to the Fontanini and Columbus acquisitions.","A reduction in hog harvest volume of 3% drove an organic volume decline of 2% and organic sales decline of 3%. Pricing declined due to lower pork market. Refrigerated food was able to deliver 25% increase in profits even as commodity profits declined 31%. The team was able to offset higher freight costs and higher advertising investments. I am particularly proud of how the refrigerated foods team continues to shift the portfolio towards branded value-added products. International sales increased 7% on volume growth of 5%. We saw strong sales increases on branded exports of products such as SPAM lunch and meat and Skippy peanut butter. The addition of the Ceratti business in Brazil also drove the sales increase.","International segment profit increased 7% in spite of lower fresh pork exports and increased freight costs. Lower SG&A expenses also contributed to improved earnings. Jennie-O Turkey store volume and sales declined 4%, primarily due to whole bird sales decline. As we mentioned on our last call, a portion of our whole bird sales were shifted to the third quarter to minimize cold storage expenses. Sales of Jennie-O lean ground Turkey and premium deli items showed sales growth this quarter. Segment profit declined 31% due to lower whole bird prices, increased freight and higher feed costs.","Grocery products sales decreased 4% as strong volume and sales growth of Herdez salsa and Wholly Guacamole dips did not offset declines in our contract manufacturing business. Adjusted segment profit decreased 6% on lower sales and higher freight expenses. This year, we made excellent progress on our path forward that I laid out at our 2017 Investor Day. This included becoming a broader food company, expanding and accelerating food service, becoming a more global company, reducing volatility, divesting non-strategic assets and modernizing our supply chain. We will continue to execute against these initiatives in 2019.","I anticipate a combination of external factors will impact our business this year. On one hand, we expect to benefit from lower pork input costs and a return to more normalized fundamentals in the Turkey industry. On the other hand, we expect continued inflationary pressure in addition to commodity market volatility. Our team's ability to focus on the controllable elements of the business will help us manage through these challenges. The quality and speed at which we are bringing innovation to the marketplace will be even better than it was in 2018. Our pipeline of innovative products will help us achieve our 15% by 2020 challenge.","We made progress toward this innovation goal in 2018 as more than 14% of our sales came from products innovative in the last five years. In 2019, we expect continued growth from innovative products such as Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon, Fire Braised Meats, Natural Choice, snacks, taps and wraps and Herdez guacamole salsa. The start of fiscal 2019 is also the official beginning of our new Hormel deli solutions division, which combines all aspects of our deli brands and businesses into one group within refrigerated foods. As we outlined at CAGNY in February, this new division delivers an unmatched array of high quality deli and prepared foods offerings marketed and sold through a direct sales organization. We are excited to help retailers create the deli of the future.","Looking at the segments for 2019, we expect all four business units to show sales and profit growth. The fundamentals in the Turkey industry are showing slow improvement with declines in placements and cold storage stocks. For the first time in over two years, we are seeing signs of consolidation within the industry. While we are encouraged by these factors, we continue to take proactive steps to restore the growth of this business. Our expectation this year is for a modest recovery in the turkey industry and earnings growth from Jennie-O Turkey store. Commitments to control costs, optimize the supply chain and investments in the Jennie-O brand will be important in 2019.","Similar to 2018, we expect an increase in branded value-added sales and profits in refrigerated food. Growth will be led by our teams in food service, deli and Applegate. Gains in our value-added businesses are expected to once again offset a reduction in commodity profits. International is expected to have a strong year. Exports of branded products and gains in China and Brazil will offset continued declines in fresh pork exports. We see sales and earnings growth in grocery products coming from established brands such as spam and Skippy in addition to emerging brands such as Justin's, Wholly Guacamole and Herdez. We also expect a meaningful contribution from the Muscle Milk brand.","Our supply chain is complex and for many years we were able to capture incremental savings through grassroots projects, known internally as best of the best. Since reorganizing our supply chain teams into one structure at the beginning of 2018, our teams have been thinking differently about ways to optimize procurement, manufacturing and logistics. In 2018, the team was able to capture over $70 million in savings through a focus on in-sourcing production, better asset utilization and more automation in our manufacturing facility, all while managing the sale of our Fremont plants and dealing with higher freight costs. These results speak to our culture of corporate and personal accountability.","For 2019, our cost savings target is $75 million. Areas of opportunity cover the entire spectrum of our supply chain. We plan to use the savings to help offset inflation, reinvest into key brands and contribute to earnings growth. One macro factor we are continuing to watch closely is freight. We saw a double-digit increase in 2018, and we expect another large increase in 2019. We remain focused on finding mutually agreeable solutions with our customers and if necessary, increasing prices. Taking all these factors into account, we are setting our full-year earnings guidance at $1.77 to $1.91 per share and our sales guidance at $9.7 billion to $10.2 billion. This guidance reflects pretax and segment profit growth across all of our business units, driven by strong retail, food service, deli and international performance. As a reminder, we had a significant tax benefit in 2018 due to tax reform.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter and key assumptions for fiscal 2019.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2018 was a record year for sales and earnings per share, operating cash flow and dividend. Our financial strategy is aligned with our vision for the Company. The balance sheet is strong and capital allocation decisions support the long term growth strategy.","Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, a 1% decrease compared to 2017. For the full year, volume grew 1%. In the fourth quarter, sales were $2.5 billion, a 1% increase. Sales for 2018 were $9.5 billion, a 4% increase. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $261 million, up 20% compared to last year. Full-year earnings were $1 billion, also a 20% increase. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year were $1.89, a 20% increase. In the quarter, we recognized non-cash impairment of $17 million or $0.03 per share associated with the CytoSport business. The impairment was recorded in the grocery product segment.","For the full year, SG&A excluding advertising was 7.2% of sales compared to 6.8% last year. The impact of acquisitions drove the increase. In 2019, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to decline as the company continues to focus on funding efficiencies throughout the organization. For the year, advertising was $152 million compared to $136 million last year. We continue to shift investments between advertising and trade to attain the highest return. In 2019, we plan to use advertising to support such brands as SPAM, Hormel pepperoni, Hormel Natural Choice, Columbus and Jennie-O.","General corporate expenses increased in 2018, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including the universal stock option grant for all employees. For the full year operating margins were 12.6%, 140 basis points lower than 2017. Higher freight in all segments and whole bird declines at Jennie-O contributed to the decrease. We expect operating margins to improve in 2019.","The full year effective tax rate was 14.3% compared to 33.7% in 2017. The decline was due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed December 2017. The effective tax rate for 2019 is expected to be between 20.5% and 23%. In 2018, we generated cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion compared to $1 billion last year. The primary use of cash was CapEx, the acquisition of Columbus and dividends.","Capital expenditures for the year were $390 million, including the expansion of value-added capacity at Dold and a highly automated whole bird facility. We anticipate capital expenditures to be $350 million in 2019. Major projects include the expansion of value-added capacity, investments to improve efficiencies and expanded automation in our plants. We paid our 361st consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 15th at an annual rate of $0.75 per share. We also announced the double-digit dividend increase. This was the 53rd consecutive year we have increased the dividend and the 10th consecutive year we have increased the dividend at a double-digit rate.","We repaid the remaining short-term debt associated with the Columbus acquisition in the fourth quarter, ending the year with $625 million in total debt. We remain in a strong financial position to fund other capital needs given our low level of debt and consistent cash flow. Share repurchases for the full year totaled $47 million, representing 1.4 million shares. We will continue to repurchase factor offset solution from stock option exercise and based on our internal valuation.","We continue to monitor supply and demand in the hog industry. We expect hog supplies to increase next year. Near-term volatility is heavily dependent on the progress of the new plants ramping up to full production. Domestic pork prices have declined due to an abundant supply of protein on the market. We expect this to continue into 2019. Lower protein prices benefit our value-added businesses. We expect exports to be up 3% to 4% in 2019. However, the African swine fever outbreak in China could impact U.S. pork exports."," Input costs for the fourth quarter were generally lower. Product prices were 16% lower than last year and well below the five-year average. We expect slight increases to hog prices next year. USDA composite values declined 9%. We expect USDA composite value to be lower in 2019. In 2019, our hard purchases our hog purchases will decline approximately 30%, reducing the exposure from the volatility of hog prices. When the Fremont sale is final, we will be purchasing all hogs from the facility is based on the USDA composite value. Included in our guidance is a decline in commodity profits due to the reduced harvest level and lower industry margins.","Deli markets declined 11%, finishing below the five-year average. Overall, we expect modestly lower deli prices and continued volatility in 2019. 72% pork trim prices were 14% below last year. We expect trim markets to be lower in 2019, especially in the first half. 50% beef trim was 9% higher. We expect beef trim prices to be flat next year, compared to 2018. Feed costs were higher driven by soya meal. We expect feed costs to be higher in 2019.","Industry data shows turkey pull placements down 3% over the last six months, cold storage of breast meat is 12% below 2017 but higher than the five-year average. Despite improvements in both key drivers, recovery remains low. Turkey commodity prices, including whole birds pressured Jennie-O results in 2018 despite higher breast meat prices. Whole bird prices were 15% lower than last year. The multiyear lows will persist through this calendar year. Whole bird prices next year will be impacted by Thanksgiving volume.","Breast meat prices were 33% higher. We expect higher breast meat prices in 2019. As Jim discussed, we created a new deli division within refrigerated foods. As a result, beginning in 2019, we will report Jennie-O deli results within the refrigerated food segment. Actual deli sales and profits, including an allocation of supply chain profits, will be transferred from Jennie-O to refrigerated foods. The size of the deli business moving from Jennie-O to refrigerated foods is approximately $300 million in sales with margins in line with the Jennie-O segment. The Company will restate the segment results beginning in the first quarter of 2019. The sale of the three months plan to WholeStone Farms is scheduled to close in December. We will incur approximately $12 million of expenses in the first quarter to build value-added equipment out of the facility and various pension related expenses. In 2018, the team demonstrated an ability to manage through various market factors and volatility. We are confident in the plan for 2019 and our strategy for delivering long term value to shareholders.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator from the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery","Can you clarify a little bit how we should think about the supply chain savings? You've talked about 75 million, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it includes any bigger more restructuring type savings. Is that something that should likely down the road or what's the right way to think about that?","Jim Snee","I think the best way to think about it Michael is we started-off the year saying the thing that we had to get right was the structure and the process, and making that we could indentify capture, validate and strategically reinvest the savings. So the team is thinking differently as we look to optimize procurement manufacturing and logistics. And certainly 2018 keen focus on labor, overhead, supply. Of course, let's not forget the fact that we put them in the middle of the freight increases and the Fremont divestiture. So they have a lot going on. 2019 we'll have some of the things. But I will tell you that they're also starting to pivot towards the bigger and more structural thing. So an example of that would be as the baseline for freight has probably shifted over the long-term is making sure that we have the most optimize network possible. And so what does that look like for a distribution center, how do we travel fewer miles over the long-term. So, yes we are getting to those bigger and more structural issues. But right now, it is a combination of some of the short-term and long-term things.","Michael Lavery","And your number for '19, could that have upside as you get into some of these projects later in the year or do you have a pretty good best amount of visibility and those will be further down the road?","Jim Snee","Those will be a little further down the road. I mean for us what is realistic so that we know disciplined and thoughtful, and we'll know more as we get closer.","Jim Sheehan","The other item I would add, Michael, is that $75 million we're talking about excludes any previously announced synergies that we have in our acquisitions.","Operator","And will take our next question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Couple of things on the guidance I was curious about. What is -- is that the sales guide is pretty lofty, especially in light of the fourth quarter numbers being below expectations, particularly on price. Can you give us a little more color on how you got there? And are you expecting some price recovery in the commodity markets in order to get there? And then secondly on the guide, you said that you thought hog prices would be up, but that the composite would be lower for '19, and how you've got that assumption as well?","Jim Snee","As we've looked across the different segments, we look at the sales guidance as realistic. When we think about grocery products coming off a weaker Q4 and really the driver there was the fact that we did have some incremental sales in Q4 of '18 -- we didn\u2019t have in 18 that we did have in '17, but we think we're set up really well because the baseline for our GP business are very healthy. So heading into 2019, we expect that business to show mid single digits growth. Refrigerated foods, it\u2019s a lot more the same in terms of the value-added growth that we expect to see. We\u2019re not expecting anything crazy and JOTS. I mean we've got low single digit increase there, which we believe is very achievable. And then our international growth on the top line is really in line with our historic expectations of high single-digit. So do believe the guide on the sales is very realistic and achievable, and maybe I'll ask give you little more color on your other question.","Jim Sheehan","We expect the hog industry to be similar to the structural makeup of 2018, including the supply growth and the volatility based on the capacity coming online. Hog prices right now are low we expect them to be up in the low single-digits. Regarding the spread, we expect the higher supply, the beef that will be available because of the additional capacity coming online while lower the commodity prices, including we expect delis and trimmed hog to be down in 2019.","Robert Moskow","And have you put any assumptions for China's hog herd disease issues, and what that might mean for American exports? Is that a positive or negative or too soon to tell?","Jim Sheehan","It's really too soon to tell. And I would tell you, Rob, we have limited African swine fever risk assumed in this plan, because of exactly what you said. It's a risk to the China business but potentially an opportunity for our pork export business. We do believe that if it is a risk to China that we'll be able to take some pricing in line with the rest of the market, but it s really too early to tell. But we're watching and it's certainly in our radar like I\u2019m sure it is everyone else's.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Thomas Palmer with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Thomas Palmer","I just wanted to ask about the first quarter set up. In the past, you provide some commentary and the queues around the call and how you\u2019re seeing margins or EBIT overall trend across the different segments. I was hoping you could provide that here again on that first quarter set up?","Jim Snee","Yes, so we haven\u2019t really done so much by quarter. Last year, we talked a little bit about JOTS just because of the very unique situation we were in and the recovery was heavily skewed to Q2. I would tell you or I would guide you to the couple of things that we have called out for Q1 that will impact the business as we did have the benefit last year of a mega tax credit and then you heard in Jim Sheehan's comments the fact that we will have some Fremont closing expenses in Q1. So obviously, we're going to have that as a headwind early in the year.","Thomas Palmer","And then just to follow-up on that on the Muscle Milk side, you mentioned meaningful contribution for the year. Is that both top and bottom? And can you maybe talk about what you're already seeing in that business in terms of its inflection?","Jim Snee","So that would imply top and bottom line growth from the Muscle Milk business. And again we've talked about several different components the part of the business that has grown throughout the year and continues to show growth is really the take home or the multi-pack Tetra business. You've seen that in more food drug and mass as they expand out their sports nutrition category, that business has been healthy and will continue to be in 2019. We've seen recovery in the ready to joint space. So we saw growth in the back half of the year like we had said we would, and we expect that to continue in 2019.","The area of the business that continues to be under pressure now is the powder business, and really the driver there is just that shift from the traditional brick-and-mortar specialty channel into more online business, and we have spent time and effort and resources building-up that muscle for that digital competency that supports the e-commerce business.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale ","I wanted to ask about the Turkey business. Obviously, there has been some headwinds from the industry and the commodity pricing a little bit. Can you -- as you\u2019ve gone through this cycle, which has been quite long. Can you talk about what -- maybe helps us dimensionalize the company specific issues cost wise that you think you can address going into next year. I mean when you go through a down cycle, I'm sure you tighten the belt a little bit more. But there was also some specific cost issues in your grow out division. So can you help us put into context where we are in turkey, genuine turkey margins and how much of the -- underperformance is industry versus company specific high-level?","Jim Snee","I think the key driver in JOTS is that we need better fundamentals in the industry. I mean that really is what is going to get us where we need the business to be. And so we've seen some of that happening, but we're still disappointed in the pace. And so we're looking into 2019, we are just projecting a modest growth. But in that modest growth, we know that we'll continue to outperform the industry. And so in some of the areas that Jim mentioned, Akshay, we continue to have a keen focus on security for our facilities to make sure we can avoid another avian influenza outbreak.","We had talked about the work that we\u2019re doing in the raise without antibiotics initiatives. And our team continues to make progress and they are making it more efficient and cost-effective. Clearly, they're impacted as much as anyone on the freight side of the business, and so that's not unique to them. And that\u2019s really a companywide initiative on how can we find those mutually agreeable solutions with consumers, while still working in the long term to optimize our network.","The other part is we see it as a business that continues to be on trend. We invested in the brands this year. We'll be reinvesting in the brand again in 2019, as we know, Turkey is on trend. And so we have to continue to outperform the industry, and we think the things we've done put us in a position to be point to accelerate our performance, our outperformance versus the industry.","Jim Sheehan","Akshay, one item that I would add is that we\u2019re very excited about the new Melrose plant coming online in the spring. That\u2019s a state-of-the-art plant that will really take our efficiencies to a new level. So that will, as Jim said, the business has outperformed the industry for a long time. This is going to allow us to increase that outperformance.","Akshay Jagdale ","And just one follow-up on what Rob was asking about, but maybe in a different way. Looking through your segments, your business is so unique with the exposure to commodity meat prices that it's hard to really tell what's happening with full price. So can you at high level give us sense what you\u2019re seeing pricing wise as it relates to freight cost being up and overall food industry inflation has picked up. And so we feel like all the companies are talking about taking pricing. But what's your take on where we are in that cycle? Are you finding more success now than six months ago? Or how would you characterize the environment?","Jim Snee","I think we\u2019re no different than anybody else in that. We\u2019re looking at all of these macro factors. So whether it's African swine fever, freight, tariffs, exports. It's clearly a dynamic situation. And we continue to look at it really on a category-by-category basis. And so refrigerated foods and JOTS are more market based, closer to the market. And so you do have pricing that will move a bit more frequently. GP pricing really is less market driven and impacted by the macro issues that we're talking about. And we took pricing obviously late '17 early '18, and we are looking at only categories by category basis. And we don\u2019t just look at pricing.","We\u2019re taking that holistic view of each of our brands in each of our categories understands the levers in regards to trade, other revenue growth management initiatives, and obviously making sure we understand the corresponding projected elasticity. And I guess I would really look the fact that pricing has never easy, never has been so think it ever will be. But the fact that we have number one and number two brands also puts us in a very solid position to make sure that we are taking those leadership roles.","Akshay Jagdale ","And just one last housekeeping one, the guidance for next year order of magnitude in terms of the profits that will be gone as a result of the three months deal. Is it roughly still -- I forget. But did you say $10 million? I mean, I know the costs are 12, but what's the profit contribution roughly that you are assuming will not be in the P&L next year?","Jim Snee","We discussed in the script that commodity profits would be down 40% from this year, and a major portion of that is the three Fremont plants, the sale of the Fremont plant but we also expect that those -- the margins on those or the spread on those hogs are going to decrease during the year. So I think it's a combination of both.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","Eric Larson ","I think I know the answer to this, just want to make sure -- little follow-up on the guidance question but the expenses that you outlined, which will probably come in Q1, if the sales of Fremont happens in December. How much of those expenses are included in your guidance or not excluding, so you are -- that's a GAAP. I'm assuming it's a GAAP number. Is that a fair assumption?","Jim Snee","That's a fair assumption, Eric.","Eric Larson ","And then the second question, which I wanted to follow-up on here is, we saw the impairment charge for CytoSport in the quarter. I think Jim talked a little bit about the issue of sales moving more toward the e-commerce side of the business. But is this a business that you're still putting a fair amount of advertising support behind it? Is that the only fix that you need? Or what else in the powder side and I think it's also still widely competitive. But what else needs to happen for CytoSport to get back on track?","Jim Snee","One of the things, Eric, that I called out was as those sales have shifted, we were behind the curve in terms of having the digital infrastructure that we needed. And so that has a big initiative for us and we feel like we're in a position now where we have the appropriate content and sales infrastructure that we need. From an advertising perspective, the team that we have in place has reallocated some of those advertising dollars into slightly different messaging, which we're finding to be highly effective. And so I think those were really two of the bigger things that we had to get done and we're well-positioned for 2019.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","I guess the first question in Jennie-O. I think you talked about modest profit improvement for fiscal '19. Can talk about the pass through a couple of here? I mean it would look like some of the market indicators are moving in the right direction in terms of breast meat pricing being above $2 in terms of pulp placements being down, competitor potentially shutting down early in the new year. And I guess still only calling for modest profit improvement. Can you help us think about the path to getting back to those mid-teens margins this business did pre-avian flu?","Jim Snee","I think you touched on this. It's really the fundamentals are moving in the right direction. I think the biggest issue there is really the disappointment in the pace. And so even though the trend in the last quarter was down for full placements, if you look at October, it was actually up a little bit. So I think we've got to stay on track with those fundamentals and see them accelerate. You're correct in regards to breast meat pricing. We see that as a positive. We see inventory levels coming down certainly as a positive but again, still at historically high level. So we need to see that accelerate. We will continue -- as we said several times, we will continue to outperform the industry and the things that we're doing behind the scenes really help us be in place to accelerate the outperformance, but to get back to truly more normalized levels, we need to see the fundamentals accelerate.","Adam Samuelson","And then my second question is over in refrigerated foods, the organic volumes in the quarter were down 2%, you attributed that to lower hog harvest levels. At what point does the organic volume trajectory in refrigerated disconnect from hog harvest. And just trying to think about layering in Columbus and Fontanini's as a glare into organic through the first -- through or after the first quarter. I mean at some point you should need to be growing this on the volume side the new capacity that you put in. I mean did that happen sooner or just help us think about the past actually started grow the volumes here organically?","Jim Snee","I think 2019 is the year that you will see that where it will be the investments that we've made in those businesses that are driving volume, sales and earnings growth. We see that across the board. We've been very intentional in terms of the investment to support value added business and 2019 is a year that you will see that really connect.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Benjamin Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Benjamin Theurer","Now a question on the deli business and you've mentioned you're going to move what you basically had within the Jennie-O Turkey up into the refrigerated foods segment. And you have nicely associated the sale volume, as well as the profitability. Now the question is for the whole restructuring and bringing that together. Are there any additional costs we should be aware of that you're going to encourage us by consolidating that business? And if you could share what is the size of the business if it's at some stage you would consider to actually spin it off from the refrigerated food segment and reported on a standalone basis just to get a little more magnitude of this business that would be my first question?","Jim Snee","In regards to the deli business, we don't have any other expenses that we're expecting in 2019 and beyond as we've consolidated this business. For us the bigger issues most of the work was done in 2018 really bringing all of these businesses together and integrating them behind the scenes, there was a lot of work that took place. And so as we've set-off into fiscal 2019 really being able to stand-up this organization and have them ready to go is exciting.","In regards to the last part of your question, we've said it's about $1 billion business, and haven't really given any thought into splitting it and operating like that, because it is still closely linked and tied to refrigerated food. It makes perfect sense to have it there. And really the focus now is achieving and doing what we said we were going to do and making sure that it's A, our next growth engine and really helping retailers create the deli of the future and to capitalize on that opportunity.","Benjamin Theurer","So basically $1 billion that's what the $300 million that comes in from Jennie-O. Correct?","Jim Snee","Yes.","Benjamin Theurer","And then last on the international part, I mean clearly, their sales was -- strong driven. Could you give a little bit update on how the Brazil acquisition is doing, the Ceratti brand, how you\u2019ve being doing, how the competitive environment has been doing? Because what I've seen is that at least in some of the prepared food side business, we've seen major competitors being relatively aggressive on increasing pricing. So wanted to get your exposure there and how you were able to benefit from that environment? Thanks.","Jim Snee","So the Ceratti acquisition has met all of our expectations. And as we said, it's really given us a great entry point into the Brazilian market. In 2018, we did take some pricing down there as I think there\u2019re some macro issues around inflation but we've been able to successfully pass along pricing, a reminder that the brand is a premium value-added brand very well recognized by Brazilian consumers. And so it mirrors a lot of what we have here in the United States in terms of being a premium authentic high quality artisanal brand that resonates with consumers. And so business is meeting all expectations. We're in the midst of continuing to make sure we're innovating, adding capacity to capitalize on the growth opportunities that are down there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Scott with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott","So just wanted to clarify on refrigerated foods guidance being up next year so just want clarify, this includes the $15 million to $20 million in closing costs, which I think is what you estimated last quarter. It includes the estimated $10 million decline in commodity profits but it doesn't include the reconciliation of let's say $35 million, $40 million in JOTS business being reclassified into refrigerate food. So is your guidance implying that there's something in the range of $65 million to $75 million in organic operational improvements in fiscal 19?","Jim Snee","I think it's fair to say everything that you've talked about is included in the growth that we're looking for in 2019. I think the $12 million is going to be in general corporate, but it's reflected in our overall number. But I think the other the other elements that you\u2019re talking about really are reflected in refrigerated foods, and it will be another strong year for them. Jeremy, I guess if there's any more specific detail that you need certainly Nathan can be available to give you those answers.","Jeremy Scott","But just want to make sure the Jennie-O reclassification is or isn\u2019t included in your guidance, so refrigerate would've being up next year?","Jim Snee","So that is now -- the Jennie O business has shifted into our deli organization, which is now included in refrigerated foods. So we are essentially rebasing refrigerated foods to reflect that.","Jeremy Scott","And probably if you could expand on the pre-Fremont post-Fremont dynamic in refrigerate. I think you said commodity products would be done, hog harvest will be down but you\u2019re getting your contract there would be no impact on volumes. So can you clarify what percentage of the tonnage that you will be buying from WholeStone under contract that will effectively be passed through, or in other words the profit that you don\u2019t turn into value-added, the green hands and their equivalents? Could you just quantify that if possible? And then within that, are there products that you're going to be entirely passing through and will there be products that you don\u2019t necessary add value on but you'll earn a spread, because you're locked into contract with a customer and you're getting capability there?","Jim Snee","So we will take all of the meat coming off of Fremont line. Some of that meat will go into our value-added products. Some would be sold as fresh pork.","We retain all margins on fresh pork sales. So we\u2019re purchasing the meat at the USDA composite carcass value. So the spread between the carcass value and the sale and either the retail or the provisions market belongs to Hormel. So we\u2019re taking down our harvest by 30% and as we see it, this is with the additional capacity coming online, this is exactly why we made the move to sell Fremont and de-risk the refrigerated foods business and that is the structure.","Jeremy Scott","And then just maybe lastly on the 12% dividend hike into your provided guidance, so a solid acceleration in the payout ratio does not entirely off trend given what you've done in the past decade. But just curious what was the rationale for leaning into the payout in 2019? And should we be interpreting that as a recalibration, however, slight -- how you're thinking about M&A opportunities that maybe at your doorstep?","Jim Snee","I think the biggest driver, obviously, is the strong cash flows of our business, strong cash flows and clearly our balance sheet remains strong for the organization. This is consistent with what we've done over the last decade, so the strong cash flows but the optimism that we have in our business going forward. So as we head off into 2019 and beyond, clearly the dividend is one of the levers when we think about capital allocation but we are in a very, very strong position to make any acquisition that we think is appropriate and strategic for us.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","A real quick on your comments on freight, so some of your -- some of the other companies in the industry are talking about not lower freight in '19 but honestly, more benign commentary on the outlook than what you articulated. So I was wondering if you could -- are you envisioning inflation similar to what you saw in '18 on the freight side.","Jim Snee","I think it's going to be a little lower than we saw in fiscal year 2018. We believe that there is still pressure but there's a bit more balance in the marketplace now that the freight lines have had time to work on, and certainly we've spent time working on it. So I guess I don\u2019t want to overstate it but certainly it's a headwind in 2019. And again, it really goes back to this longer-term solution that our supply chain team is working on and what is the right network optimization for us.","Heather Jones ","And then on advertising, so you guys had talked about 20% increase for '18, it came in below that and I think you made some comment about shifting it into other types of promotion that you found more effective. Could you help us -- give us the sense of what you're thinking about advertising dollars in '19 as far as year-on-year increase?","Jim Snee","So at the end of the first-quarter, what I've said was that we would increase our advertising and promotional spending in the neighborhood of 20%. And as you know, we were always working to find the highest ROI between all methods of brand support. And while advertising was significantly ahead of last year, good strong double-digit increase, it was below that 20% but we did see our trained dollars come in above plan by an equal amount. So we hit the number that we thought we would, and it does ebb and flow in terms of how we spend those dollars across brands and dollars. The real message here is that we're dynamically managing this brand support for the highest ROI, and we do a lot of time -- spend a lot of time around revenue growth management, pricing, trade, advertising all of those things. So we feel good with what we've said and what we ended up spending.","And then we're going to have a fine increase in 2019. And in Jim Sheehan's comments, he talked about some of the brands where we'll be spending those dollars. We'll continue to support the SPAM brand who just -- they're coming off their fourth consecutive record year, and it's a brand that we know will respond well to advertising. We've spent a lot of time and effort and dollars under our Umbrella brand, Natural Choice, and of course the reinvestment in Jennie-O Turkey store business. So feel like our investments are giving us the returns that we need whether they're advertising or trade.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Just s couple things to clear up. Frank, can you give us a sense of what the dollar inflation was in fiscal '18, just to get a sense of the headwinds just all in all. Second bellies, belly prices I think started pretty low in the quarter and were rising. Were you hedged on belly, did you get a really strong bacon margin in the quarter? And do you expect that to ease off in first quarter, just because of the slope of the curve going higher. Maybe give us a little more clarity on what those bacon margins look like?","Jim Snee","The freight was $0.06 to $0.08 in 2018, belly markets as I said, we think that we will see volatility and we have seen volatility this year in bellies. We do not have a hedge on bellies right now. We still believe that they're going to be lower over the year. And I'll let Jim talk a little bit about the margins on the bacon.","Jim Sheehan","Our bacon business was very strong, and it ties into to my previous answer in terms of really where is the biggest ROI in terms of pricing or trade. And so we navigate through that. But I would tell you that we\u2019re very pleased with bacon performance for the year, for the quarter, both top line and bottom line.","Robert Moskow ","Last question, corporate expense it was like $60 million this year. I think it's twice as high as the year before. Should we expect it to be similar in fiscal '19? I didn\u2019t catch that.","Jim Sheehan","Well, we'll have the $12 million from the closing of the Fremont sale in corporate expenses, so it won't be -- that will put pressure on increasing the corporate expenses.","Robert Moskow ","So something in the mid-70s then, Jim.","Jim Sheehan","No, we don\u2019t see them that high.","Operator","And there are no further phone questions, at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Snee for any additional or closing remarks.","Jim Snee","Great, thank you. On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you to all of you for joining us today. To our team members listening in, thank you for all your tireless work that allows our company to be so successful in the marketplace. Your focus on delivering our key results and maintaining our culture of accountability will continue to make this company uncommon in the marketplace.

Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the fourth quarter of FY '16. We released our results this morning before the market opened, around 6:30 a.m. Eastern. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at www.HormelFoods.com under the Investor section. ","On our call today is Jim Snee, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Sheehan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim Snee will review each segment's performance for the fourth quarter and also provide outlook and guidance for FY '17. Jim Sheehan will provide detailed financial results for the quarter and further assumptions relating to our FY '17 outlook. The line will be opened for questions following Jim Sheehan's remarks. ","As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to get back in the queue. An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 11:30 a.m. Central Standard Time today, November 22, 2016. The dial-in number is 877-627-6590 and the access code is 5999118. It will also be posted to our website and archived for one year. ","Before we get started with the results of the quarter, I need to reference the Safe Harbor Statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the Company, are fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products. Please refer to pages 33 through 40 in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 24, 2016 for more details. It can be accessed on the website. ","Additionally, please note the Company used non-GAAP results for FY '15 to provide investors with a better understanding of the Company's operating performance by excluding the impact of certain non-recurring items affecting comparability. Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. During our call today, comparisons to the fourth quarter and full year of FY '15 will be made to these non-GAAP results. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. ","James Snee","Well, thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced record fourth quarter results of $0.45 per share, up 22% from last year. Sales for the quarter were up 9%, on a 9% increase in volume. For the full year, earnings per share were $1.64, up 24% versus FY '15. Sales were $9.5 billion, up 3% and volume was up 2%. ","For the quarter, three of our five segments reported volume sales and earnings growth demonstrating the strength of our balanced business model. Refrigerated foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store posted excellent earnings, both up double-digits. Grocery products recorded solid gains, while specialty and international earnings were down for the quarter. I am particularly pleased with our top line results, with four of our segments generating sales growth. ","Refrigerated foods fourth quarter operating profit increased 51%, with sales up 8% and volume up 9%. Refrigerated foods benefited from excellent growth in both retail and foodservice channels and from lower input costs notably hogs and bellies. In foodservice, items like Hormel Bacon1 fully cooked bacon and Hormel Fire Braised meats delivered solid growth, while our retail business was led by items such as Applegate deli meats, Hormel Natural Choice and Hormel Gathering party trays. ","Jennie-O Turkey Store fourth quarter segment profit increased 26% with sales increasing 29%. Volume was up 32%. As a reminder, last year's results were negatively impacted by avian influenza. Higher bird weights and low grain prices were a benefit for the quarter. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store foodservice business performed well, with growth coming from many areas such as our Jennie-O raw boneless breast and sliced breast meat categories. ","We also experienced sales growth in our retail and deli businesses. We were back on air with the Jennie-O Make the Switch campaign through October and have seen a positive response once again from our consumers. We saw strong sales growth in grocery products, up 16% and segment profit was up 5%. ","Our legacy portfolio performed nicely with organic sales up 10%, including gains from many brands such as SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter, Hormel Compleats, Herdez salsa. In addition, Justin's specialty nut butters contributed approximately $25 million in sales to the quarter and is well on track to meet our valuation pro forma and the $100 million in FY '17 sales we guided to when we announced the acquisition. ","International sales increased 2%, while operating profits decreased 16%. While we're encouraged by the results from our SKIPPY business in China, our meat business continues to be pressured by high input costs. ","Exports of fresh pork improved, as U.S. exports became more competitive due to lower hog prices. Specialty foods, excluding Diamond Crystal brands, grew sales 6% and volumes 11%. CytoSport posted excellent sales growth as they continued to introduce new innovative items in both ready-to-drink and powder formats. The CytoSport team also launched new Muscle Milk bars featuring 12 different flavors. Acceptance by our retail partners has been favorable. ","The decline in segment profit is attributed to increased advertising on a year-over-year basis for the Muscle Milk brand. Innovation has been a foundation of our Company's success over the last 125 years which is why we recently announced a new innovation challenge for the year 2020, to have 15% of our total sales come from new products introduced in the previous five years. We finished 2016 with approximately 12% of sales from new products launched in the fiscal years' 2011 to 2015. This is a stretch goal for our organization and we expect to make substantial progress next year aided by recently introduced products, as well as those in the pipeline. ","Looking to FY '17, we have positive momentum in each segment, employees all working towards the same goals and numerous initiatives in each of our strategic growth pillars of global, multi-cultural, healthy and holistic and on-the-go. Grocery products is expected to show growth in excess of their long term growth goals of 3% top line and 6% bottom line. Growth is expected to come from the positive momentum we have in SKIPPY peanut butter products, Herdez salsas and Wholly Guacamole dips in addition to Justin's. We will continue to invest in our key brands in 2017. ","Yesterday, we announced the divestiture of the Farmer John, Saag's and PFFJ farms businesses. While the businesses performed well, they no longer met our strategic goals. Additionally, the divestiture allows for the integration of the pork processing facility at Farmer John, with the majority of live production operations which supply the facility and are currently owned by Smithfield. This divestiture is in the best interest of our shareholders and we continue to seek opportunities to utilize our cash towards investments aligned to our growth goals. ","We're expecting decreased sales in refrigerated foods, as increased sales of value-added products will be offset by the divestiture of Farmer John which represents approximately $500 million. We see continued growth coming from brands such as Hormel Natural Choice, Hormel Gatherings, Hormel pepperoni and Applegate, in addition to foodservice sales growth from Hormel Bacon1 fully cooked bacon, Hormel Fire Braised meats and Hormel pizza toppings. ","Due to the earnings per share dilution of approximately $0.03, refrigerated foods earnings are expected to be flat. Jim Sheehan will provide more color on the hog and pork environment in FY '17. We expect strong sales and earnings growth for the full year, as the Jennie-O brand continues to resonate with retail, deli and foodservice customers and consumers. Results will be weighted to the back half of the year, as the first half faces more difficult comparisons. ","We intend to continue our advertising investments through the Make the Switch campaign to highlight the versatility of turkey in many of our consumer's favorite recipes. We expect our international segment to deliver strong profitable growth. In addition to improving results in China, we anticipate stronger exports for SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter and CytoSport protein products. Our international team is eager to get our Jiaxing plant up and running in first half of the year, so they can leverage new production capabilities to grow our retail and foodservice businesses. ","Specialty Foods results will likely show year-over-year declines in the first half due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal brands, but we expect organic sales and earnings increases in the back half, as we anniversary the divestiture. The Muscle Milk brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories and we expect those results to continue. I'm also very excited about our new Muscle Milk smoothies and many new Muscle Milk items in the innovation pipeline. ","As we roll up our earnings outlook, we would have expected our guidance range to be $1.71 to $1.77 per share, representing a 4% to 8% increase. We took into consideration the three prior years of double-digit earnings growth and the one less week in 2017 as compared to 2016. However, factoring in the divestiture of Farmer John business representing earnings per share of approximately $0.03, we're setting our guidance range to $1.68 to $1.74 per share. ","From a sales perspective, excluding the impact of both the Diamond Crystal brands and Farmer John divestitures and the positive impact of the Justin's acquisition, we anticipate our business will generate organic sales in line with our long term target of 5%. We believe our Company can continue to grow at 5% top line and 10% bottom line over the long term. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and additional key drivers for 2017. ","Jim Sheehan","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Volume in the fourth quarter was 1.4 billion pounds, a 9% increase compared to last year. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion, a 9% increase also. Excluding the impact of both the sale of Diamond Crystal brands and the Justin's acquisition, volume was up 14% and sales were up 11%. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $244 million, up 30% compared to GAAP net earnings last year of $187 million. Net earnings were up 22%, compared to non-GAAP earnings of $200 million last year. ","FY '16 was a 53 week year, with the extra week falling in Q4. We estimate the impact from this extra week was between 1% to1.5% for the full year. Advertising expense for the quarter was $55 million, compared to $30 million last year as we continued to invest in our brands. Looking into 2017, we anticipate advertising expenses to be similar to 2016. ","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $35.4 million, compared to $34.4 million last year. Equity and earnings for the quarter was $11 million, up 41% compared to last year. The increase was a result of our strong results in mega packs with brands such as Herdez salsa and Wholly Guacamole performing well in the marketplace. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33% versus 35.2% in 2015. For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33% and 33.5%. ","Cash flow from operations was $371 million in the fourth quarter, up 23% over last year. During the quarter, $145 million of short term debt was repaid. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $90 million, compared to $47 million last year. The increase in CapEx is primarily related to our new plant in Jiaxing, China and lean ground turkey expansion at Jennie-O Turkey Store. ","For FY '17, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million, compared to $256 million in 2016. Major projects for 2017 include the completion of our plant in China and numerous capacity expansions for value-added product lines. We will continue to invest capital to support our value-added products and improve food and employee safety. ","We paid our 353rd consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 15, at an annual rate of $0.58 per share. Our Board of Directors approved an annual dividend rate of $0.68 per share, representing a 17% increase. FY '17 will represent the 51st consecutive year of increasing our dividends. Jim Snee and I intend to continue this longstanding policy. ","We repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock, spending $43 million in the fourth quarter. We have 13 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises. ","As we discussed at our third quarter conference call, we're providing a total Company margin goal. Our goal for 2020 is to have our EBIT margin to be in the top quartile of our peer group. Today, the top quartile range is 15% to19%. The goal is consistent with our long term growth goals of 5% top line and 10% bottom line. ","We experienced favorable input costs for the fourth quarter in many, but not all of our businesses. Key inputs such as hog and belly prices were down, compared to the fourth quarter last year. Trim prices were below -- were flat, beef prices were down. Corn and soybean meal prices were lower for the quarter versus 2015. Turkey breast meat prices were below 2015 during avian influenza. ","We expect favorable hog and pork markets for 2017. The USDA is calling for a 3% to 4% increase in the hog supply in 2017. The majority of the new industry capacity is anticipated to come on line after the summer of 2017. We expect hog harvest levels at our Austin and Fremont plants to be down 1% due to one less week in the fiscal year. ","Barring any unforeseen weather events, we expect favorable grain prices for Jennie-O Turkey Store in 2017. We anticipate turkey breast meat prices to be below 2016 levels. Going forward, we expect lower beef and chicken input costs for our value-added products. We also see comparable prices to 2016 for other key raw materials such as peanuts and tomatoes. ","One area we're watching closely is the avocado market. The avocado market increased substantially in 2016. We're maintaining an adequate supply of avocados by leveraging our global supply chain. Overall, we're confident that the strength of our value-added products, recent acquisitions and favorable market conditions will provide Hormel another record year. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question and answer portion of the call. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. ","Robert Moskow","I thought that Jim and Jim you were going to give us at some point a three to five year outlook for operating margins and where you think margins can go kind of longer term. Are you working on that or am I mistaken? ","Jim Sheehan","We did provide a margin goal that is to be in the top quartile of our peer group by 2020. Currently, that margin range is 15% to 19%. We're currently in the third quartile of that group so to reach that goal we not only need to improve our own margins but we need to outperform our peers. ","Robert Moskow","Okay got you, so top quartile 15% to 19%, that\u2019s over three to five years or is that correct? ","Jim Sheehan","15% to 19% is where those margins exist now. We intend to be in the top quartile in 2020. ","Robert Moskow","Okay, sounds good. And I guess my follow-up here would be specifically on your refrigerated outlook, obviously refrigerated to be flat in fiscal 17 despite losing some profit from the divestiture is quite bullish for the business. Can you give us a sense about the mix of that, do you expect your fresh pork profits to be up or do you expect those to be down and value-added mix do you expect those profits to be up or down, can you give us a sense of what the break out is? ","James Snee","Sure. Well good morning, Rob this is Jim Snee. I think as we think about our refrigerated Foods portfolio we've got a lot of positive momentum. Our foodservice organization had a great year in 2016. We expect that to continue in 2017. Our meat products group with a number of their value-added items, bacon, party trays, Natural Choice, all performed extremely well this year so we expect that to continue and clearly those will all have a positive impact as we head into 2017. ","Robert Moskow","Okay, so with profits being flat is the implication that value-added is up and maybe commodity is down a little bit? ","James Snee","Yes, that's correct. ","Operator","We will now hear from Farha Aslam with Stephens. ","Farha Aslam","Could you talk about the new pork plants that are coming online how you anticipate that will affect your business and in particular how that would affect your pork operations? ","Jim Sheehan","We're expecting hog prices to be similar to 2016 and 2017. We believe there's a balanced supply and demand of hogs in 2017, the USDA is estimating that the hogs will be up about 3% to 4%. The plants that are coming online are expected to come on line after the summer of 2017. ","Farha Aslam","And so beyond 2017, how do you think Hormel is positioning itself for those new plants coming online? ","Jim Sheehan","We think that we're well positioned. We're constantly looking at the supply needs that we have for our value-added products. The reason that we harvest hogs is to provide those raw materials for the value-added products so we're really balancing it with the value-added products that we need. ","Farha Aslam","Okay so you can just purchase more of the meat coming out of those facilities? ","Jim Sheehan","That's exactly correct. ","Farha Aslam","Rather than the hogs, so you continue to maintain that balance in your portfolio? ","Jim Sheehan","That's correct. ","Farha Aslam","Okay and then my last question is on M&A. You have a pristine balance sheet. What are you seeing out there? What are you interested in right now? ","James Snee","Our pipeline on the M&A side is full and just as a reminder, we're looking for opportunities that are accretive to our overall portfolio, are number one and number two in the categories in which they compete. We want to make sure that we can bring value to the business, so I mean we start there but we made sure that they are aligned around our strategic growth areas of becoming more global, more multi-cultural items or brands that are more on the go and then of course this area of healthy and holistic. It's all about timing and getting some of them across the finish line but I would tell you that the pipeline is robust and full. ","Operator","Our next participant is Jeremy Scott with CLSA.","Jeremy Scott","So pretty impressive guidance number next year. I just wanted to clarify from your commentary it seems like, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like Grocery Products is driving the majority of the organic top line and bottom line and I'm just - based on some of the trends we've seen in our checks it seems like a little bit of a stretch so if you can just maybe synthesize and break down exactly where most of the earnings growth will come from next year? ","James Snee","Sure, well good morning Jeremy. We feel good about all five of our business units, Grocery Products is planning to have a strong year next year organically in line with our 3% top line 6% bottom line goals, but then the addition of Justin's so we feel really good about the momentum that we have in Grocery Products coming off a very strong fourth quarter. Our Specialty Foods group with the work we've done building the Muscle Milk brand is showing impressive growth, as I mentioned earlier we do see strong value-added growth across a number of Refrigerated Foods portfolios and then we're well positioned we're back in supply with Jennie-O Turkey Store and so really believe that all five business units are going to be able to show very positive contributions as we head into 2017. ","Jeremy Scott","Okay, and then just maybe on the long term the top quartile of the 15%-19%, can you get there on the core business or is that include some type of mix of acquisitions and divestitures including obviously the Farmer John which is margin accretive but sales dilutive. ","Jim Sheehan","Yes, it's going to be a mix of all of those things, Jeremy. We know that we need improvements in our organic business. We will have M&A along the way and we're constantly reviewing our portfolio and if we have pieces of it that don't fit that are no longer strategic I think we've clearly established that we'll make the right moves there as well. ","Operator","We will now hear from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. ","Akshay Jagdale","Just two questions. First on the long term target obviously, very much in line with what you've done historically but if you look at the last four years your margins are up I think 460 Bps, a vast majority 70% of that has been driven by Refrigerated Foods margins improving. Part of that I would say I don't know how much of it is related to industry dynamics being favorable so I'm just trying to understand like the building blocks of the next four years considering or coming off we'll be coming off of a pretty favorable environment in one of your segments that happens to have driven a vast majority of the increase historically so that's my first question.","And the second one, again related to Refrigerated Foods when this capacity does come on which clearly you're saying in \u201817 doesn't look like it's going to cause any disruption, when it does come on, there's likely to be some disruption on the processing margins. How do you envision navigating through that environment from an earnings growth perspective? Thank you. ","James Snee","So on your first question, I mean for us we need to continue to grow our value-added businesses in all of our portfolios so we've been transparent that market conditions have provided some of the improvement in Refrigerated Foods but certainly not all of it. We've had a number of value-added improvements, some M&A activity in that space that's proved to be accretive and so those are the things that will continue to do across all of our businesses to move into that top quartile. ","Your second question in regards to some of the capacity coming online post 2017, we have navigated through volatility and delivered earnings growth, 28 out of 31 years now and so as Markets change, clearly we know that we have to react and I think we've demonstrated that we can react that our business can react and deliver growth so we're watching all of it very closely. Jim\u2019s assessment of the timing we believe it's the most accurate timing that we have and we'll take advantage of it while we can and then when market conditions change we'll act accordingly. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. ","Adam Samuelson","Was hoping to dig deeper on the sales growth guidance of 5% organic for the year and think about it by business a little bit because I see a market outlook and you talked about during your cost that is at best neutral but probably a little bit deflationary given the key proteins that you touch and that kind of organic growth maybe save easy comps in Jennie-O in the first half of the year that for the totality of the portfolio hasn't done 5% organic for some time and I'm trying to just think about where the accelerations coming from in the base to get that kind of organic revenue growth especially given the commodity environment we're likely to continue to see for some time. ","James Snee","You know, as we've talked about all of our growth goals for each of the business units, we've had Grocery Products which is at throw and six organic and we do feel like we're well positioned with the success that we've had with Spam and Skippy and our air Des line of products to be able to deliver on their organic goal, as you mentioned the Jennie-O Turkey Store piece which we do believe we'll be able to exceed that 5% top line number, the specialty group we're going to have to anniversary the DCV piece but feel really good about the Muscle Milk business which is the driver of that organization.","We see a return to our accelerated growth rates from our international business which is 10 top line 15 bottom line and so obviously Refrigerated Foods with the divestiture you're going to have a lot of moving parts there but as we go around the horn and think about all of our business units, we see a lot of momentum and feel really positive as we head into 2017 and we understand the deflationary piece you're talking about and there are some commodity portions of the portfolio that will react to that but so much of our portfolio is value-added that it's less impacted. ","Adam Samuelson","Okay and then maybe just a clarification point on the long term on that long term margin piece. A, 15%-19% would be where the top quartile is now so we're talking apples-to-apples the number for fiscal 16 is just the equity income minority interest what was the realized 2016 number and second is that long term margin goal going to be part of long term Management incentive compensation in any form? ","James Snee","The five and 10 will continue to be the goals we set and we measure against but as you take the five and 10 we will increase our operational margins and I want to be clear that we're talking about not 15 and 19 in 2020. We're just giving you the range that we see the top quartile currently. ","Adam Samuelson","Right, I'm just asking where you are today. ","Jim Sheehan","About 14%. ","Adam Samuelson","Okay and then so but it won't be part of formerly part of long term Management compensation as such? ","James Snee","We'll continue to be focused on 5% top line 10% bottom line. We have as I mentioned a little while ago some business units that are three and six in GP and then 10 and 15 in international but those are the long term growth goals that will continue to be focused on and incenting our top management. ","Operator","We will now hear from are Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","I also wanted to touch on the operating margin so again another strong year of operating margin expansion. Is there a way to isolate the impact from the changes in the portfolio from divestitures and the recent acquisitions that you made, what type of benefit that helped in 2016 and how we should think about the mix impact next year? ","James Snee","The acquisitions have been accretive to our margins and we see those acquisitions continuing to perform strongly in 2017. So they've been an advantage. ","Rupesh Parikh","And the divestitures would be the same. Those obviously are lower than the margins weave historically had. ","James Snee","Correct. ","Rupesh Parikh","Is there any way to quantify what that benefit could be for the upcoming year? ","James Snee","No. ","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. And on the grocery products portfolio very strong products in your legacy with 109% organic growth. Want to get a sense of what's driving that this quarter and how you think about the sustainability and strength there? ","James Snee","Yes, our team has done a great job. When you think about the portfolio, we have had ongoing success as a result of the Skippy acquisitions, the investments we've made in that brand, the distribution we've gained, the innovation we've had and if you go across that entire line, Spam had great performance as well. That's a brand that we continue to invest in. We think about our multicultural product offerings, our salsas and dips and again something that's resonating with consumers that's on trend and we did have a nice fourth quarter from completes as well so obviously as we head into the future some of the comps are probably a little easier but I do think that our team is continuing to figure that brand out that product line so we just feel good about the momentum we have in Grocery Products. ","Rupesh Parikh","Okay great last one for me clearly your results have been an outlier compared to other food companies as you look at the grocery back drop on the foodservice side, have you seen any changes in the overall back drop on the macro front? ","James Snee","From a foodservice perspective, our team has consistently outperformed what's happening in the industry and they're doing that through their ability to connect with foodservice Operators by the salesforce, the direct sales for that we utilize, their ongoing innovation and really creating great solutions for operate res, so we expect that to continue. From a retail perspective it's the same thing. We understand what's happening with the consumer but the consumer is shopping many different parts of the store and I think the beauty of our portfolio is that no matter where they go in the store if center store or on the perimeter we've got a full offering of products to meet their needs and I think that really set us up for strong future growth. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. ","Mario Contreras","So about a year ago we were hearing about relatively high pork operating margins moderated somewhat over the next couple of quarters but fast forwarding to today, it looks like that's once again at pretty historically high levels in terms of where the cut outs are versus live hog prices so I just wanted to get a sense of how you view that dynamic, what's driving the widening spread and where do you see that going over the next couple quarters here? ","Jim Sheehan","Well we focus primarily, Mario on hog prices and we see hog prices being similar to 2017 as they were in 2016 and 2017. The USDA is looking for an expansion of 3-4% and appears the supply and demand is in balance so we look at the hog Markets as being favorable as we go into 2017. It's important to understand that we're a net buyer of other commodities so we're impacted by some of the decreases in the other inputs, such as bellies and trim. ","Mario Contreras","Okay and then just one question on China. Want to understand where you see that recovery coming from in 2017. I know you have the plan that's going to be opening up at some point during the year so is that going to be driving most of the improvement or is there some other factors at play there, thanks. ","James Snee","This year the story in China was really the higher input costs and as we head into 2017, when we get past the Chinese New Year, we're forecasting a decline in that raw material market and so it wasn't a story of volume in China. The retail business got off to a slow start but it rebounded, our foodservice meat business was strong throughout the year, it really was more about the input cost and the tightening of the margins. We expect to get some relief after the Chinese New Year so we would expect to continue the volume growth and then have margin expansion as well. ","Operator","We will now hear from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. ","Ken Zaslow","Just wanted to touch base on this. Your margin outlook, getting into that 15%-19% CAGR by 2020, what is the progression step to get there? ","James Snee","I think it's the continued growth of the value-added product. The moving of the value-added product up what we've referred to is the value ladder taking into higher levels of margins. Clearly acquisitions are a part of our strategy. We've sold out some businesses that were on the lower end of that range so I think it's the focus on improving our operating margins across-the-board. ","Ken Zaslow","What about also operating favorable operating leverage because as you talk about sales growth this year you're in a deflationary environment your volumes will have to clearly exceed your pricing. My pricing could be down or flattish or whatever but it's all volume and yet you aren't talking about leveraging your facilities or any sort of structure all reassessment of your plant. Is there any other enhancement from a structural basis that we could think about? ","James Snee","Certainly. We're constantly looking at leveraging our capacity and finding the correct capacity utilizing the capacity in the optimal manner, continuous improvement as a focus of all of our plants taking cost out of the system as a focus of our operations every day so we're constantly focused on taking cost out whether it's through cost reductions or efficiencies in the operations. we made movements with a few plants now where we optimize other capacity and have been able to eliminate some excess capacity to improve the efficiencies. ","Ken Zaslow","Okay, I think it's a great target and over time hopefully what we may be able to get a little bit more insight on is the progression really the strategic improvement of how to get there because again, I think somebody earlier mentioned it that you have defied logic and not a commodity coming in the top quartile of the growth of your package food peers and you continue to do that so I'm just trying to figure out exactly what's the next steps to be able to get to that 15%-19% and I guess the value-added and just trying to figure out how you'll go from being top quartile in your growth rate to continue that process so any clarity on that is always helpful Thank you. ","James Snee","Well thanks, Ken. This is Jim. I think you hit on it right. There's been a very logical strategic progression and we do expect to continue down that path. It will be supplemented along the way certainly with right M&A opportunities but fundamentally and I've talked about it many times in the past, is for us it really is all about this formula for success so it's investing in the right brands, it's making sure that we have the right innovation process, I mean we're challenging ourself with this increased innovation goal and then the strategic acquisitions aligned around our growth pillars and so it is a very logical progression.","It's also a very disciplined progression and I think what Jim Sheehan described to you in terms of our focus on continuous improvement each and every day going our people are going to work saying how do I do things a little more efficiently, a little more effectively to take costs out of the system those allied up to that logical progression in getting us to that top quartile so appreciate your comments but I mean that's how we're going to get there. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. ","Eric Larson","First question I just want to clarify make sure that I'm collecting this with the divestiture of Farmer John, that effectively takes you out of all harvesting activities, do you have anything else anywhere else? ","James Snee","No, we still have our harvest facilities here in Austin, Minnesota and Freemont, Nebraska on the pork side of the business. ","Eric Larson","Yes, but you don't effectively own those? Via what from the labor settlement that you had I believe somebody else actually operates that for you is that correct? ","James Snee","In Freemont, I mean we own and operate in the Austin facility we have a third party relationship but that's in essence a pass through so we do have in our opinion we have two harvest operations, one in Austin and one in Freemont. ","Eric Larson","And then it was an impressive dividend increase. I was actually thinking that you were going to have even a greater dividend increase given the year that you had and I think that it puts you in a payout ratio of about 41% and I think your peer group is a little bit higher. Can you kind of clarify your kind of how you're targeting your payout ratio and maybe you're going to return more cash to shareholders through maybe modestly more aggressive buybacks more than maybe just covering your dilution from stock options can you kind of discuss that dynamic? ","Jim Sheehan","I'll do the math of our peer group we're number 11 out of 18 as we look at the peer group and we do have a goal to move that up over the years. We've done it in a fairly consistent but aggressive manner. We're focused on the use of cash. Dividends is one of the four uses of cash that we have. We certainly have been focused on acquisitions. We've made acquisitions over the last several years. We'll reinvest $250 million into CapEx in 2017 those are primarily to support our value-added businesses and we along with the dividend we also do some stock buyback. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll hear from Jeremy Scott with CLSA. ","Jeremy Scott","Just you probably heard this question a number of times but given the significant move in wholesale ground beef costs, does Jennie-O need a higher level of add and Marketing support going forward in order to sustain volume growth? ","Jim Sheehan","This is Jim Sheehan. I'll take that question. It continues to increase penetration of ground Turkey and the ground Turkey represents about 10-12% of the total ground meat Markets, we're competing well against the ground beef and we continue to see growth in that. We've expanded capacity for our ground Turkey business. ","James Snee","We need to watch that. Clearly we understand what's happening in that competitive set but again, our main focus is making sure we have the right products consumers are looking for and we've been through this before with ground beef pricing and so to use a comment from an earlier question is there's a logical progression here so this lien ground Turkey is connecting with consumers, Jim describes how it's growing in terms of its relative share to the grant meat market so we feel like we're well positioned. Will we be opportunistic where we need to be? Absolutely but the fact is we're in the right place, this is an on trend consumer product that we know is going to continue to grow. ","Jeremy Scott","I was hoping you could give a broader assessment of grocery trends relative to foodservice obviously we're seeing a growing gap between the relative inflation rates and perhaps the shift in demand. You know the strong sales in Spam and Skippy are you starting to see pantry restocking and which categories will continue to benefit in this environment? ","James Snee","I mean, I guess again, just going back to how we think about our business heading into 2017, we feel really good about the momentum we have in our Grocery Products division. Again Skippy has had a nice long runoff quarter-over quarter growth. Spam will show growth again in 2017 and then you referenced our foodservice business and again, great year 2016, poised for another great year in 2017, we talked a lot about our bacon one fully cooked bacon and the capital investments that we've made their support that business, so we feel really good about both grocery products and foodservice. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take a follow-up from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. ","Robert Moskow","Just want to make sure I understand the guidance on Jennie-O correctly. I think you said that it's a difficult it will be more of a back half loaded year. Did you mean that in terms of sales and profit or just sales? And if I recall, I think January is when you think that you're going to get more distribution on shelves for your ground Turkey business because that's when retailers are resetting their merchandising? Thanks. ","James Snee","From a sales growth perspective, we see that being fairly consistent throughout the year, the earnings comp would be skewed to the back half and certainly, gaining distribution is tied to the plans that the retailers have so we'll continue to take advantage of that. I think again the underlying premise here is that our team is doing a great job, they are gaining distribution and it's a product line of lien ground Turkey that is squarely in the consumer need set and we feel really good about it. ","Robert Moskow","So you're on track in terms of your distribution expectations? ","James Snee","Yes absolutely. ","Operator","Once again we will hear from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. ","Akshay Jagdale","Again just as we think about the long term goal, can you I know you probably aren't willing to give out a number on percentage value-added etc. , because I don't think that's how you manage the business but can you give us some color on sort of segment by segment how you're going to get to this margin target. I mean basically it equates to your normal algorithm of double digit EPS growth, so we know the formula is to increase percentage of value-added right? But probably what's more important math [indiscernible] is the margin profile of value-added you always are enhancing that, so can you without getting into the numbers can you just give us some sense of how you're managing how its managed at the segment level that would be helpful and I had one more follow-up. ","James Snee","Sure, this is Jim. I mean, I think the important thing when you're thinking about this is we have to absolutely remain focused on the long term growth algorithms that we've set for each of our business units so we talked about Grocery Products at throw and six and that's going to be a mix of organic growth and acquisitions. We're going to see the same thing across all of our business units, the other Refrigerated Foods, Jenny-O Turkey Store Specialty Foods, five and 10 and then we'll need international to return to their 10 and 15 long term growth algorithm. If we're able to deliver that and we know we will and we'll do it through abalones of organic growth, you referenced of value-added which is something we do each and every day and then also having the right strategic acquisitions that's the logical progression for how we get there. ","Akshay Jagdale","Okay and just one more so when you look back the list four years obviously you'd agree there been a benefit from grain costs and I guess favorable hog prices if I may. It's hard to quantify that bouging rally speaking, I think you also would agree that potentially, that's going reverse going forward. So when you think about you can call to offset that clearly M&A is an area where you can get more aggressive given your balance sheet and your solid track record but can you just give us any incremental sort of buckets that maybe historically weren't part of the equation that you might be considering? ","James Snee","I think our story of the markets ebb and flow and our history of delivering 28 out of 31 years of growth in some of the most volatile market conditions, there's a bucket to consider in terms of our ability to be able to weather unfavorable market conditions. Clearly you've hit it on the head that there are M&A opportunities for us as we head into the future.","We've got as I mentioned earlier a robust pipeline of opportunities that we're pursuing and then I think the other thing we have to remember is you delivered the growth 28 out of 31 years but we also have a Management team that has 26 years of experience with Hormel Foods who are responsible for delivering those results, so as we head into the future, we're confident that we have the right people, the right products, the right processes in place to be able to get into that top quartile. ","Operator","With no further questions in the queue I would like to turn the call back over to your hosts for any additional or closing remarks. ","James Snee","Yes, well thank you all very much for your participation today. Before we leave today, I would like to take this time to acknowledge our outgoing CEO, Jeff Ettinger. As we previously announced, Jeff retired as CEO effective on October 30. During Jeff's tenure over the past 10 years, the Company significantly increased revenues, net earnings, dividends and shareholder value. Under Jeff's leadership, the Company continued to focus on innovation while adding new brands & Companies into the Hormel Foods family. Brands like Skippy, holy Guacamole, Applegate and Justins. I personally look forward to working with Jeff and his role as non-executive Chairman of the Board.","I also want to let everyone know we will be holding our in vast or day in New York on June 15. I'm excited to showcase our senior leadership team and take you deeper into each of our segments while also describing our plans for growing the business. You will see a Press Release soon.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, November 26, 2019.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Nathan Annis, Director of Investor Relations.

Please note that during our call, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as organic volume and organic sales.","I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.","Jim Snee","Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. We had the opportunity to outline our company's growth strategy at our Investor Day in October. Our 2020 path forward, a set of six strategic priorities sets us up for growth in 2020 and well into the future. The six priorities we presented were, one, growing our Deli and foodservice businesses; two, accelerating growth in ethnic cuisines; three, pursuing bold new innovations; four, expanding our global presence; five, protecting our core brands; and six, continuing to transform our company through one supply chain and Project Orion initiatives.","These priorities represent another step forward for Hormel Foods as a global branded food company. We made great progress in 2019. Notably, we launched the Hormel Deli Solutions division and Refrigerated Foods; delivered $700 million in sales from our MegaMex joint venture, which also celebrated its 10th anniversary; completed our state-of-the-art whole bird facility at Jennie-O Turkey Store; exited two non-strategic businesses, CytoSport and hog harvest in Fremont, Nebraska; and made tremendous progress on our one supply chain and Project Orion initiatives.","From a financial perspective, we grew organic sales by 1%, improved our cost structure and operating margins. Invested over $290 million back into our business with capital projects such as the Burke pizza topping facility and an additional Fontanini production line, raised our dividend for the 54th consecutive year, the 11th consecutive year of double-digit increases. Repurchased $174 million in common stock, the highest annual repurchase in our history. Reduced our long-term debt and grew our cash balance.","From a segment perspective, Refrigerated Foods grew earnings in spite of a 50% decline in commodity profits as our value-added businesses delivered strong growth. The Black Label, Bacon 1, Fire Braised, Natural Choice and Applegate brands were all meaningful contributors to value-added growth.","Grocery Products had a year of mixed results. We grew organic volume and sales for the year, driven by brands such as Herdez, Wholly and Dinty Moore. I'm also really proud to say, SPAM had its fifth consecutive year of record sales, which is a tremendous accomplishment.","However, sales and profits declined for SKIPPY as we face deflationary pricing pressure due to competitive dynamics in the peanut butter category. Our team rally did an excellent job using revenue growth management with a number of customers to identify the right pricing and promotional tactics to drive category growth for our customers.","MegaMex continues to generate excellent top-line growth. From a bottom line perspective, earnings declined as they lap a tax benefit and were impacted by higher avocado markets during the year.","Jennie-O Turkey Store managed through both industry oversupply and the effects of two lean Ground Turkey recalls. The fourth quarter proved that the Jennie-O brand remains strong and the additional investment we are making in the business is the right long-term decision. This team clearly has momentum going into 2020.","The full year results for the International segment were disappointing. As the team encountered numerous challenges, stemming from African swine fever in China, the impact from tariffs and global trade uncertainty. These headwinds greatly masked excellent growth in our China business.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $0.47. This put our full year earnings at the top end of the guidance range we provided at our Investor Day in October.","Sales decreased 1% on a 2% decrease in volume. Organic sales increased 2% on a 1% increase in volume. Three of our four segments, Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Jennie-O, delivered organic volume and sales growth. Total company sales growth was led by brands such as Columbus, Fire Braised, Bacon 1, Natural Choice, Gatherings, SPAM, Herdez, Wholly, and Hormel Chili. Refrigerated Foods grew volume 1% and sales 4%.","While many products across retail, deli and foodservice contributed to the sales growth, I would be remiss if I didn't call out the growth we are seeing from Bacon 1. The Hormel foodservice team is doing an excellent job growing Bacon 1 account-by-account. We also recently introduced the product into the club channel under the brand Hormel Thick Cut Reserve.","The recent expansion at our facility in Wichita, Kansas is providing the necessary runway to continue growing this important business. Strong earnings growth from our value-added businesses was not able to overcome a 46% decline in commodity profits, leading to a Refrigerated Foods segment profit decline of 3%.","Grocery Products volume declined 9% and sales declined 10% due to the divestiture of CytoSport. Organic volume increased 2% and organic sales increased 1%. Center-store brands such as SPAM and Herdez drove sales and earnings growth. Lower pricing on Skippy Peanut Butter remained a headwind this quarter.","Jennie-O Turkey Store volume increased 5% and sales increased 3%, primarily due to whole bird and commodity sales increases. Segment profit increased 6% due to operational improvements across their supply chain.","As expected, we are regaining distribution on our most important item, lean ground Turkey. We recently gained distribution back at a large customer, but still have work to do in order to get back to our pre-recall distribution levels.","Advertising and promotional activities in select key markets also helped drive growth during the quarter. It's important to note, this quarter represents the first time since the fourth quarter of 2016 that we grew volume, sales and segment profit at Jennie-O Turkey Store.","International volume sales and segment profit declined dramatically during the quarter. We saw weakness in our export sales and in our Brazil business due to higher protein prices. We are taking the necessary pricing actions to offset these cost increases.","From a total company perspective, we expect to deliver sales growth in excess of our 2% to 3% organic sales growth goal in fiscal 2020. Two key drivers to sales growth across the company are innovation and e-commerce. First, we continue to see innovation successes across our business and remain confident as we close in on the final year of our 15% by 2020 challenge.","The percentage of sales from products innovated in the last five years has grown at just under 15%. Products such as Natural Choice Snacks Stacks and Wraps, Herdez Guacamole Salsa, the Applegate Blend Burger and SKIPPY P.B. & Jelly Minis are all important initiatives help us achieve our 15% goal.","Second, our e-commerce capabilities continue to improve, especially for the online grocery pickup segments. Through our efforts in analytics, package optimization and customer expansion; we see another year of strong double-digit growth for e-commerce. We expect to deliver another year of operating income growth in 2020.","The biggest risk factor continues to be the impact African swine fever could have on our business. While we have seen volatility in the market, we have not seen a major and sustained increase in pork costs as we and much of the industry expected. A combination of higher domestic pork production, higher levels of cold storage in China and presumably lower Chinese consumer demand are factors keeping prices in check. Jim Sheehan will provide more details related to our market outlook.","We are still very confident in our ability to manage through ASF. First, we are very optimistic about the demand for our products whether from an up and coming regional pizza chain using our Hormel pizza toppings, a Deli consumer looking from our premium charcuterie items like Columbus craft meats or a family looking for affordable and versatile protein like our SPAM family of products.","Second, we hold leadership positions in many of the categories in which we compete. This affords us the ability to be pricing leaders when market conditions weren\u2019t. We demonstrated our ability to pass higher pricing during PEDV in 2014 and again during the market run-up in 2017. As a global branded food company and a leader in the industry, we believe it is our responsibility to lead in these situations. Finally, we expect input cost volatility to persist into fiscal 2020. As a net buyer of protein, major market swings can shift profits from quarter-to-quarter when our pricing lags the market.","Looking at the segments for 2020, we expect three of our four business units to show sales and profit growth, with the exception being Grocery Products as they lap, the CytoSport divestiture for the first half of the year. We do however expect sales and segment profit growth for the rest of the Grocery Products segment, led by center store brands such as SPAM, Dinty Moore and SKIPPY.","We also expect growth from MegaMex and remain extremely confident in our ability to continue growing the Herdez and Wholly brand. I am excited by the authentic and innovative products they are bringing to the marketplace such as Herdez, Refrigerated Guacamole, Herdez Taqueria Street Sauces and Wholly Smashed Avocados.","We expect 2020 will represent a return to growth for Jennie-O Turkey Store. A clear focus on regaining lost lean ground Turkey distribution, the efforts to realign our cost structure and slowly improving industry fundamentals gives us confidence we will get this business back in growth mode.","International is expected to show sales and segment profit growth in 2020. However, we do expect volatility as we manage higher input costs in China and Brazil in addition to short-term noise related to an uncertain global trade picture.","Again this year, we expect Refrigerated Foods will grow sales and profits led by many brands across foodservice, retail and deli. I have a high level of confidence in this team's ability to execute in the marketplace and continue to grow branded value-added projects.","At Investor Day, we highlighted the great work happening within our supply chain group. And I am pleased to report; we achieved our $75 million cost savings goal this year. We also highlighted our long-standing key results of holding controllable cost increases to less than 1% over the prior year. While large investments can impact a single year, we have specific targeted actions to improve our cost structure over time.","Achieving our 1% key result implies savings in 2020 of approximately $75 million similar to 2019. Taking all these factors into account, we are setting our full year earnings guidance at $1.69 to $1.83 per share and our sales guidance at $9.5 billion to $10.3 billion.","Our expected fiscal 2020 organic pre-tax earnings growth rate is in line with our near-term goal of 5% to 7% organic pre-tax earnings growth we outlined at our Investor Day. As a reminder, CytoSport earnings in 2019 contributed $0.10 to earnings per share. We also expect a higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2020.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter and key assumptions for fiscal 2020.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $2.5 billion, down 1%. Organic net sales were up 2% with three to four segments showing growth. Sales for 2019 were $9.5 billion, down 1%. Organic sales were up 1%. Pre-tax earnings were $324 million, up 1% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. For 2019, the company grew pre-tax earnings to $1.2 billion, a 2% increase. The full year effective tax rate was 19.1% compared to 14.3% last year. The 2018 tax rate was impacted by deferred tax remeasurements.","The effective tax rate for 2020 is expected to be between 20.5% and 22.5%. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.47 a share compared to $0.48 last year. Earnings per share for 2019 was $1.80, a 3% decline. The higher effective tax rate contributed to the lower earnings for the quarter and the year.","For 2019, SG&A, excluding advertising, was 6.3% of sales compared to 7.2% last year. The decline was due to the impact of the CytoSport sale and lower selling and employee-related expenses. In 2020, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase.","Excluding CytoSport, expenses will increase because of the costs related to Project Orion. Net unallocated expense was down significantly in 2019, resulting from the gain on the sale of CytoSport, lower selling expenses and a legal settlement in the first quarter.","Advertising was $131 million, down from $152 million in 2018. The decline was due to the CytoSport sale. In 2020, we plan to increase advertising expense to support our leading brands, including Natural Choice, Black Label, Wholly, Herdez, SPAM, SKIPPY and Jennie-O.","For the full year, operating margins were 12.6% compared to 12.4% in 2018. Lower SG&A was a benefit to margins in 2019. In 2020, we anticipate operating margins to be flat, but we may experience periods of volatility due to input costs.","We generated cash from operations of $923 million during the year, down 26%. The decline resulted from higher working capital as we strategically built inventory in anticipation of higher input costs due to African swine fever. The primary uses of cash in 2019 were dividends, debt reduction, CapEx and share repurchases.","We paid our 365th consecutive quarterly dividend, effective November 15 at an annual rate of $0.84 per share. We also announced an 11% dividend increase for 2020, making the new annual rate $0.93 per share. This marks the 54th consecutive year we have increased the dividend and the 11th consecutive year of double-digit increases.","In 2019, we repaid the remaining $375 million in debt associated with the Columbus acquisition. Capital expenditures for 2019 were $294 million, including the expansion of the Burke facility Project Orion and additional capacity for Fontanini products.","We targeted capital expenditures of $360 million in 2020, with a focus on value-added capacity projects and automation. Share repurchases for 2019 totaled a record $174 million, almost double any single prior year. 4.3 million shares were repurchased. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to capital allocations utilizing our strong balance sheet to grow through acquisitions and capital investments. We will remain focused on long-term investments to drive exceptional shareholder return.","The generally higher input costs for the fourth quarter were in line with expectations. The 2020 guidance range assumes higher protein prices for key inputs. African swine fever continues to impact the global hog supply as the disease spreads in China, Southeast Asia and parts of Europe.","The USDA is projecting exports to grow 7% to 8% in 2020. To meet the growing need for exports, total domestic production is expected to increase 2% to 3% according to the USDA. Our prices are expected to increase in excess of 15% in 2020. We anticipate the USDA composite value increases to be consistent with increases in hog prices.","Selling prices in 2020 are projected to be marginally higher with periods of volatility. We expect pork and beef trim markets to be higher in 2020. The Turkey industry is beginning to show signs of recovery. Industry data shows turkey placements down 3% since the beginning of 2019. Additionally, cold storage of whole birds continued to decline leading to improved pricing.","Pricing for the fourth quarter was up modestly over 2018. We should see the majority of the pricing benefit realized for the 2020 holiday season. Cold storage of breast meat is 5% below last year. Breast meat pricing has traded near $2 over the past 12 months. We expect the market to improve in the second half of 2020.","Other Turkey commodity items, such as fire meat should benefit from better pricing in 2020 due to supply shortages on other competing proteins. Freight costs which were up modestly compared to 2018 are projected to be marginally higher next year. Project Orion continues to progress on schedule.","In the first quarter of 2020, we will begin the implementation across HR, Finance and supply chain organization. We are excited to begin the transformation of our company to increase efficiency and our analytical capabilities to manage our business.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","Eric Larson","Yes, good morning, everyone. A Happy Thanksgiving to all.","Jim Snee","Thanks, Eric. Good morning.","Eric Larson","A quick question. We saw -- as Jim outlined, we saw a fairly significant inventory build at the end of the year. So how much cost visibility does that give you folks? Is it -- does it cover the first half or a good portion of 2020? Or how should we look at your ability to control your costs for the near-term with that inventory?","Jim Sheehan","Happy Thanksgiving, Eric. This is Jim Sheehan.","Eric Larson","Thanks, Jim.","Jim Sheehan","We did build inventory at the end of the year and that will give us visibility on some important primals into the first quarter. So I would say well into the first quarter.","Eric Larson","Okay. Thanks. And then just real quickly as a follow-up question on your marketing spend here. It was down sharply for the year was mainly divestiture of CytoSport. But you also bumped up your spending in Jennie-O with your burger campaign, which has been very successful. So if you were to look at your marketing spend for the year on an apples-to-apples basis excluding CytoSport would it have been flat to up, down slightly? I mean, how should we look at that marketing spend number?","Jim Snee","Eric, I would say that for the year it was relatively flat. One of the things that we've done really well over time is we've been able to consolidate some of our advertising dollars against key brands where we used to have dollars spread a little more widely. But when you think about the work that we've done with SPAM, with SKIPPY, with Natural Choice, with Hormel Pepperoni and now really getting back in the game with our Jennie-O Turkey Store advertising efforts in select key markets, our focus has changed a little bit. And so -- but we've been pleased with the results and the dollars would say relatively flat for the full year.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Ken Zaslow","Good morning, guys.","Jim Snee","Hi, Ken.","Jim Sheehan","Good morning.","Ken Zaslow","Just two questions. One is you talked about two projects that you are underway. The plans in the state-of-the-art, the sausage production, as well as pizza toppings, how much capital you put into that? What's the return on that?","And my second question would be on the turkey side. It seems like you've gotten more positive on the underlying fundamentals. Is that because of the trade opening? Or can you discuss more on that? And I'll leave it there.","Jim Snee","Okay. I'll start with the second one first, Ken. In terms of the turkey business, we are very positive as we head into 2020. And it's really -- the story is being able to do what we set out to do when we talked to you last quarter.","We talked about the need to regain distribution. And we've been able to gain some of that distribution back in the fourth quarter. We have more work to do for the full year, but we do expect to see a sequential improvement as we progress throughout the year. And, of course, not only just gaining back that distribution, but being able to support that business with appropriate advertising dollars that really we had backed off for the last several years as we're facing some of those headwinds.","In regards to the two expansion projects that we talked about we're going to -- between the two of them will be roughly $300 million combined. As a reminder, we have already spent some of the money in the Burke project when we announced that and we are quite a ways along. Again, the key message to remember here with both of these projects is that they're supporting our value-added growth.","The new plant in Nebraska is designed to support our Columbus business, which has performed incredibly well, and the same thing with our Burke business. Not only does it support the Burke organization, but it supports the pizza topping business in our core foodservice organization. So we're excited to not only announce those projects, but have them come online to really support the business.","Ken Zaslow","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Thomas Palmer with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Thomas Palmer","Good morning. Thanks for the question.","Jim Snee","Good morning.","Thomas Palmer","First, I just wanted to clarify guidance. Your EPS guidance range is $0.14. Your pre-tax income range, I think, it can explain about $0.04 of the variance. Your tax rate guidance can explain around $0.05. So I'm getting kind of a $0.05 gap, could you maybe help reconcile that $0.05 gap? And then, also, just give us some clarity on what exactly the base number is for 2019 that we should be applying that growth from? ","Jim Snee","Yes. Thomas I think the best way to think about it, in 2019, our results included about $0.10 EPS for CytoSport, which is in our Grocery Products segment profit. And then when you consider that along with a higher tax rate of about $0.03, I mean, that's really where you'll find how our growth is in line with that 5% to 7% organic growth target. So thinking about 2019 actual 1.80, Cyto at 10, tax at 3, gets you to 1.67 number, really as probably a base. And I would say, if there's additional information you need, feel free to follow-up with Nathan.","Thomas Palmer","Okay. Thanks for that. I'll probably will follow-up a little bit. And then, just on the international segment, it sounded like there were two main issues. It was the export side and then rising input costs. On the export front, did you shift some of your pork sales, because exports were weak into the Refrigerated segment?","And then on the input cost front, you made reference to price increases that you were instituting, sounds like now-ish. What are you assuming in terms of kind of the bounce back in that segment? Are you assuming that exports continue to lag, but you get the pricing flow through? And then is there an offset, as we think about Refrigerated, just given the reallocation. Just trying to understand how that plays out?","Jim Snee","Sure. Let me try to help you. When we talk about our export business in international, there's really two components. We've got a strong branded export business. And you would think more around SPAM and SKIPPY, and then our pork export business. So there are two parts.","And as we think about 2020, our branded export business is expected to be strong. And although, we talked about it being a little bit soft in the fourth quarter, that really was more of a timing issue. When you think about the fresh pork piece that's really driven about - driven by everything that's happened in the marketplace. As you think about some of the global reorganization of how pork has slowed, especially throughout the Asia region. And that's going to continue to be a headwind until all of the tariffs and global trade uncertainty gets resolved. So that's the first piece, the export piece.","The second piece in terms of cost increases in Brazil, we saw kind of a constant run up throughout the year. The biggest impact really in the fourth quarter. And so we did get a little more aggressive with our pricing in the fourth quarter and then we expect some of those cost increases to moderate next year. But that's really what's driving those comments around exports and input costs in Brazil.","Jim Sheehan","Thomas back to your first question. When you think about that $0.10 in CytoSport, you should think about it $0.04 came out of Grocery Products, $0.03 was a reduction on net unallocated through the gain. And then there was a $0.03 tax gain. So that's how you can think about the $0.10.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Ben Bienvenu","Hi, thanks. Good morning.","Jim Snee","Good morning.","Ben Bienvenu","I wanted to ask about Jennie-O, really impressive sequential improvement in the results there. And in particular, noteworthy, I thought that you mentioned, you'd won back distribution with a large customer. I'm curious to hear what is the factor or factors that are driving that conversion to get distribution back with your larger customers. Do you have to allocate additional trade spend or professional dollars or is it just demonstration of more consistent results and improved execution?","Jim Snee","Yes. So I mean, we are very pleased with what the team was able to get done in the fourth quarter. And it's consistent with the commentary that we've provided that when we did lose distribution, the category tended not to perform for the retailer. And that where we did have distribution the category was performing as expected.","And so being able to take that story and remind the retailers of what we're able to do with the leading brand has been very powerful. And then of course, we are supporting it. We've talked about some of the advertising in select key markets. We are supporting it with trade dollars, especially at the outset. But the big win here is the distribution gain as we head off into 2020.","Also would remind you that we have more work to do. So we have regained distribution but we have more work to do early in the year and really throughout the year. And then just as a reminder for the JOTS business, we are going to still lap some pre-recall sales in Q1. So when you take the total year, we are very, very optimistic about the JOTS business, starting with what we've been able to get done in the fourth quarter.","Ben Bienvenu","Okay, great. And then a follow-up question on guidance. Just thinking about the top end versus the bottom end of the range kind of the swing factors that dictate that whether it's the timing or magnitude of African swine fever, given that you've considered some implication associated with price inflation and cost inflation there, maybe some of the other key factors that we should be considering as we monitor sort of the progress of the results for the year.","Jim Snee","Sure. I mean, you hit on obviously the key risk factor and we talked about that in the comments in regards to ASF is less of an event from an international perspective. If tariffs are lifted and we see a more \u2013 well, we would consider a more normalized flow of product. And then the other thing that we just talked about is if we're able to gain back distribution at JOTS faster than anticipated. I mean, those are things that really drive us towards the top side.","On the bottom side, if the impact of ASF is sustained and steady increases in costs that continue to compress margins as we're catching up with pricing that could be a headwind. But as we talked about that's on the way up. And once costs moderate, we'll be in a much better position. But that's really how we're thinking about bottom side and top side of the range.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery","Good morning. Thank you.","Jim Snee","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lavery","I was off for a minute. I just hope somebody didn't just ask this, but when you mentioned the protein increases that you expect -- that you factor into guidance, how does that compare to now? And what magnitude do you have already is your expectation in a base case scenario?","Jim Snee","Certainly. So let's start with hogs. Hogs went up about 11% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and we anticipate that they'll go up 15% over 2020. With higher prices in the back half compared to the first half. The cutout value was up 4% in the fourth quarter. We think it will go up probably just under that 15% and with a similar run rate with higher prices in the second half compared to the first half, bellies were up 15% in the first quarter and we think that they're going to go up low single digits. And we see belly is fairly consistent across the time frame.","Now bellies are up 132 now, so they're a little bit lower right now but we've seen a lot of volatility in the belly markets. So we've seen some significant moves even day-to-day in the belly market. And then 72% trim, which of course is an important input, was up 9% in the fourth quarter. We think they'll be up high single digits in 2020 with higher prices probably in the back half. They're at $76 as we look at it today, so they've already seen a little bit of a run-up from where they were in the fourth quarter. So you're seeing that volatility in the trim and the bellies and as we always say, volatility will create some noise for us between quarters. In the end it will -- we'll be able to recover those costs but volatility will be important to us. We'll watch that.","Michael Lavery","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on some of the language in that first guidance paragraph, you mentioned some of the brands that are key drivers of growth. But then you mentioned a few that you're going to put a lot of energy behind. It reads initially like maybe that's not as bullish but your prepared remarks for Bacon 1 certainly sound quite optimistic. How do we think about Bacon 1 and the outlook there? Do you still expect this to grow? And then also the same question for Fire Braised, which wasn't on either list.","Jim Snee","Yeah. Michael, I mean, we are very bullish. I mean, all the brands that we had in the press release, I mean, those are the ones that have grown and really are on trend with today's consumer. And not only are we growing the core business, but we're innovating against those.","And when you talk about our foodservice brands, especially Bacon 1 and Fire Braised, the growth opportunities for both of those brands in our foodservice space are still very, very strong. We talked about the Bacon 1 growth and how it happens account by account and that's really a hallmark of how our foodservice business operates.","It's the ability to penetrate, saturate and dominate the operator community with these key brands. We also have obviously plenty of capacity for Bacon 1 as we completed the expansion of our Wichita, Kansas facility last year to meet the needs for that business.","The other thing that we talked about in the prepared remarks is the fact that we're now moving Bacon 1 into the club channel under our Thick Cut reserve brand, where it's met with a lot of consumer acceptance. So we feel good about both Bacon 1 and Fire Braised, not only in core food service and then we didn't even talk about the opportunities that they represent in the deli business for the prepared foods section. So, very bullish on both of those, along with all the brands that we have listed in our press release.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. ","Heather Jones","Good morning.","Jim Snee","Morning.","Jim Sheehan","Morning.","Heather Jones","Look, I have a quick detailed question on corporate expense. So even taking out the gain on sale and all, it was down considerably from 2018 and 2017. I was just wondering, how we should be thinking about that run rate for 2020?","Jim Sheehan","For 2020, I would target it in the $40 million to $60 million range, Heather. It's a small number, so small changes have a big percentage impact. We had the CytoSport gain in 2019. But we've also lowered our selling expenses. We had lower employee-related expenses. Some of the cost-saving programs that we put in place are showing their impact in SG&A. But I would see it in the $40 million to $60 million range.","Heather Jones","Okay. Thank you for that. And then my second question is on Jennie-O, a two-part question. So from what I remember, you guys are a net buyer of breast meat. So is this business -- should I be thinking about this in the sense of, if exports for that business pick up at all, that would be -- well, I guess, more simplistically, would you rather the dark meat part of the bird to go higher over, et cetera, or would you rather breast meat go higher?","Jim Sheehan","Yeah. I mean, really, Heather, that changes every year. And, of course, our supply chain people are able to navigate and take advantage of the opportunities. Obviously, there was an announcement in regards to China here recently. We just learned that we have seven of our plants that are approved. We're still working through the details. But at a very high level, we expect that announcement and the opening of the market to be positive for us.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hey, thanks and Happy Thanksgiving. Jim and Jim, your forecast for a 15% increase in the cutout value that's for the full year. But then you said that the second half expected to be I guess the inflation to be higher than the first half. So I mean, does that kind of indicate like a pretty sharp run-up in the second half? And are you thinking first half is like single-digit and then it spikes quite a bit higher because of -- I don't know frozen inventories running out in China. And if that's how you think about it, how have you prepared your customers for that type of an increase? And then I have a follow-up.","Jim Snee","That is not how we think about it. We're thinking about it just being a few percentage difference between the first and the second half. So we don't see a significant run-up in the market.","Jim Sheehan","From a pricing perspective Rob, I mean, if there is a -- if there is a dramatic run-up in pricing, what we've talked about it in regards to what's happened or what happened with PEDV. And really there you had the run-up -- belly prices for example went up, I think it was at $1.30 to $1 -- $1.30 to $2.50 in three months.","And we were able to take pricing, the market warranted it and customers understood that. And if you go back to what happened on shelf, bacon that was usually $3.99 to $4.99 went to $9.99. And so there's a precedent here. And I think depending on how the markets weren't that pricing the customer -- we've had the conversations with the customers. Really we've been talking about ASF for over a year now and it's not going to be a surprise to anyone.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Can you give us a little more detail into fourth quarter itself. One of your competitors said that there was a lot of inflation in bellies and then it kind of all reversed very quickly and that movement made it hard to change pricing quickly enough to react. Did you see something similar for yourselves? Or were you able to adjust accordingly? Or maybe the timing was different?","Jim Snee","Bellies averaged about 157 in the fourth quarter and right now bellies are at 132. So you've seen some movement but you've seen volatility in bellies for the last two years. So I wouldn't say that amount of volatility we've seen in bellies in the fourth quarter and early into our first quarter is anything unusual.","Jim Sheehan","Yes. And from a pricing perspective, nothing really to speak of on the retail front. Some adjustments on foodservice but we always talk about how we're able to stay a little bit closer to the markets with our foodservice business but nothing that was overly impactful.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to follow-up on the happy little plants launch that you guys discussed at the Analyst Day. I was curious what type of retailer and foodservice interest you're seeing so far? And how you guys are thinking about the contribution from this launch this year?","Jim Snee","Yes, the contribution Rupesh is going to be minimal in 2020. Really for us, it's the learning about that space. Another is the reception at the retailer and consumer level has been positive. We're probably seeing a little more acceptance in the foodservice space. And so the foodservice team has done a nice job with that same retail pack introducing it into foodservice operators. In addition, just some of the blend burger items that we talked about at Investor Day.","So it's really the combination of I'll say the pure play and then also the blended play that we're very intrigued by our agile team is already working on 2.0 to build out that line, thinking about different forms that we should be taking to the marketplace. So -- and based on the early read, it's positive, we're still heading down that path to build out the line, but I wouldn't look for any meaningful contribution in 2020.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up question. So for the full year guidance, does that at all contemplate share buybacks than the EPS targets?","Jim Sheehan","It does take into account some share repurchase. And we face share repurchase on our intrinsic value of the stock and the amount of stock options that are being exercised offset for dilution. So we do have a number in there. So yes.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. So a follow-up, Jim Sheehan on the guidance on port costs. And if I heard you comments correctly before, you talked about a 50% increase in hog prices, a 15% or so increase in the cutout values, but then lower increases in bellies and trim as components of that cutout. So should we take that to imply that you think that there's more inflation likely in other cuts of hams, shoulders and butts that would actually present opportunities on the commodity profit side and the contribution that that would present? I'm just trying to understand the piece of that. Because the cuts that you typically would be long seem to be the ones do you think there's more inflation in?","Jim Sheehan","Yeah, Adam. I think a good example is hams right now. Hams averaged $69 in the fourth quarter and they're up to $94 early in -- or late last week. So you're seeing some inflation in hams that I would say normally you wouldn't see. So I would say there's opportunities in some of the other commodities.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. And then taking a step back at a high level with the guidance, I think you talked about increases year-on-year in advertising and SG&A, I believe as a percent of sales. Do you have what the clean gross profit would be in -- gross profit margins would have been in 2019 if we strip -- fully strip CytoSport out? I'm just trying to get a sense of what kind of gross profit expansion is embedded in the guidance at least, can you talk about operating margins up. So I'm just trying to make sure I understand that in the context of higher SG&A?","Jim Sheehan","Well, we're talking about advertising costs, we're talking about the increase that we're seeing in advertising costs for instance we're expecting in the high single digits and that's off the base without CytoSport. You're going to see higher SG&A, because we're going to have some Orion implementation cost in SG&A. So I'd say that those would be unusual from a run rate.","So we're talking about some unusually high expenses in SG&A because of the implementation of Project Orion that will start actually in the next couple of weeks. We'll start some implementation with that. ","Jim Sheehan","And, Adam, I would say, I mean, some of the more detailed items, certainly you follow-up with Nathan or corporate. And that we -- for us, the message here is really the pre-tax operating profit growth that's in line with that 5% to 7% or organic target that we laid out at Investor Day.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Yes. Thank you. Good morning. We've talked a lot about ASF and the impact you expect that to have on your pork export business, I mean, your JOTS business. But I'm kind of wondering, how you expect that to impact your SPAM business, given the increasing popularity that we're seeing of SPAM in China? And I assume that there's probably some positive demand opportunities, probably some cost risk. But I'd just like to hear the way you're thinking about ASF impact on that brand and kind of what you're expecting for 2020.","Jim Snee","Yes. It's a really, really good question. And when -- at a high level with ASF, we fully understand the scenario that results in higher prices. And I think we've talked a lot about our ability to price in the event that we see a larger scale or bigger impact ASF have had, whether that's domestically or in our business in China.","The SPAM brand is a brand that has probably some of our strongest pricing power. To be honest with you, it's in a category by itself, so to speak. And if you remember, we did take SPAM pricing this year based on some of the runoff that we saw, not only in the market, but some of the buildup that we'd have in expenses over the last couple of years.","And we do have a scenario modeled where if we have to take pricing again. We're positioned to do that. But we are closely watching the fundamentals of supply and demand. And if we need to take pricing with SPAM, we'll do that. To your point, what's happening in China with SPAM is incredibly positive. It's exceeded all of our expectations and we've been able to really build out that distribution even faster than we expected.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Okay. And then, as a follow-up, like, so are you -- I know you're experiencing very strong growth in the brand in China. But have you seen an acceleration today? Or maybe that's delayed due to the high cold storage?","Jim Snee","In regard -- are you talking about SPAM?","Rebecca Scheuneman","Yes. Yes.","Jim Snee","Yes. I mean, the growth has been steady, but it has exceeded the expectations, when we model putting in the SPAM line in our plant in Jiaxing, China. We've been able to exceed the distribution growth expectations that we had, even in spite of some of the higher costs.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Peter Galbo","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Jim Snee","Yes. Hi, Peter.","Peter Galbo","Jim, just wanted to ask on the sales guidance. I would assume that kind of the high end of the range is assuming some pricing goes through to offset some of the inflation that you're expecting. I guess, what would be helpful though is what kind of demand elasticity are you assuming in relation to any price increases on things like bacon or pepperoni?","Jim Snee","Yes, Peter you're right. I mean, we do have the high end of the pricing would be driven by the scenario that results in higher cost coming from ASF. And the elasticity is really vary across business unit and vary across brand. What we saw, and again I'll go back and reference what we saw during the PEDV event, where you saw belly prices go from $1.30 to $2.50, retails go from $3.99, $4.99 to $9.99 and we still saw very strong volumes in that bacon category.","And so it does vary from category to category, business to business, but we obviously are very incredibly sensitive to that working closely with the retailers and having the brand strength, the brand power that we referenced in our comments and then also having that direct-selling organization in our foodservice business is the opportunity to get in front of the customers and tell the story of the products as a solution versus just the cost.","Peter Galbo","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just one quick clean up one. On Jennie-O, I mean with Thanksgiving being as late as possible as it could be this year, is there an extra kind of week of shipments that you've got maybe that's spilled over into 1Q that we should be thinking about on the volume side?","Jim Snee","No. I mean we haven't really thought about it that way. Just again, as a reminder, we're still lapping some of the pre-recall sales from Q1 of last year as we head into 2020. Really the key takeaway for JOTS is this distribution wins for lean ground Turkey. We're obviously working on the next few wins and we've got to bring those across the finish line. Still early but we're really seeing the right signs for this business. And that's why we feel like they have so much momentum going into 2020.","Operator","We will now take our last question from Benjamin Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Theurer","Hey, good morning, Jim and Jim Just a quick follow-up on the CapEx. So kind of realized last quarter you were guiding for like $250 million for full year. As you said there were a couple of delays in some of the things and then actually you ended up spending $294 million. Could you elaborate a little bit on that significant increase of what was spent already in the third quarter? Is it all related to the new plan for Columbus? And then if you could lay down a little bit in between what is the Burke pizza toppings, the facility in Nebraska and Project Orion. Can you just split what the CapEx is going to look like, what each segment is going to get from the $360 million in 2020?","Jim Sheehan","Thanks, Benjamin. You are correct. The increase of what we expected in 2019 had to do with the early stages of the acquisition of the property for the Columbus expansion. Originally we thought that was going to fall into 2020 but we got to close a little bit faster than what we thought. And you are correct in the three big projects that we're looking at in our $360 million is finishing up the Burke project, the Columbus expansion and Project Orion and I'll refer to you to -- I'll refer to you to Nathan to get a little bit more detail on the actual breakout of those numbers.","Benjamin Theurer","Okay, perfect. And then on the inventory, you've clarified already the increase on purchases to be prepared for ASF. But can you give us a little bit of an idea of how much actually the decrease was because of the divestiture of CytoSport? So, how would have been inventory a year ago, if we would have to exclude CytoSport just to get a clean like-for-like comparison to understand the actual magnitude of the increase?","Jim Snee","Certainly. CytoSport inventory ran $25 million in that range.","Operator","This concludes the Q&A session. I'd now like to turn it back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Jim Snee","So on behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you to all of you for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions]","Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We announced first quarter earnings this morning of $0.48 per share, even with last year. The value of our balanced business model was again on display as strong results by our Specialty Foods, Grocery Products and International All Other segments offset weaker results by our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. Results in our Refrigerated Foods segment were even with last year, hindered by poor pork operating margins.","In terms of the top line, we generated record sales of $2.1 billion, an increase of 4%. Total volumes increased 2% despite a planned reduction in harvest levels at our hog processing operations. We increased sales in 4 of our 5 segments.","I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products segment profit increased 13%, and sales grew 24%. We began including sales of our Don Miguel products in Grocery Products results beginning in the third quarter of last year, and these sales were very robust in this recent quarter. We were also pleased to see that sales for Grocery Products were up 4% excluding Don Miguel products. Sales gains in Grocery Products were led by our SPAM family of products, Hormel chili, Mary Kitchen hash and Herdez salsa. Sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals also increased during the quarter as our new Cheesy Pasta items aided growth.","Segment operating profit for Refrigerated Foods was even with last year, as poor pork operating margins and weaker results in live production eroded the results in our value-added franchises and stronger performance by our affiliated business units. The affiliated business units include Farmer John, Burke and Dan's Prize. Sales for Refrigerated Foods declined 2% in the quarter, primarily attributable to a planned reduction of harvest levels in our hog processing operations. We did achieve growth in retail sales of Hormel party trays, retail and food service sales of Hormel Natural Choice deli meats and food service sales of our new HORMEL FIRE BRAISED Meats.","Segment operating profit at Jennie-O Turkey Store decreased 23% as we faced significantly higher grain costs and lower commodity turkey meat prices. Increased sales of our value-added products across all trade channels were unable to offset these headwinds. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items, turkey franks and turkey bacon were particularly strong, as we continue to benefit from our Make The Switch advertising campaign over the past 3 years.","We reduced our harvest numbers at Jennie-O during the quarter in order to better balance our turkey meat supplies. However, higher bird weights offset most of the decrease in harvest levels this quarter.","Our Specialty Foods segment profit grew an impressive 43% in the quarter. These results were attributable to both significant sales growth and improved operating efficiencies. Sales grew 7% during the quarter, led by Hormel Health Labs products, private label canned meat, savory ingredients, nutritional products and ready-to-drink products. Segment profit results in Specialty Foods have now registered year-over-year growth for 4 consecutive quarters.","Our All Other segment, which consists primarily of our Hormel Foods International business, grew operating profit a strong 37% on a 4% increase in sales. Results were primarily attributable to strong exports of fresh pork and improved profitability by our China operations.","Our current fiscal year and beyond are shaping up well. In our Grocery Products area, we are seeing strength in all 3 of our key product platforms. In the traditional canned goods area, we have excellent momentum on the SPAM family of products, Hormel Chili and Mary Kitchen hash. Our microwave franchise is being reinvigorated by our new Cheesy Pasta Compleats items. And within our MegaMex Foods joint venture, we continue to grow our consumer franchises with Herdez salsas, Don Miguel appetizers and Wholly Guacamole dips and salsas.","We expect continued growth from both our Specialty Foods and All Other International segments. For Specialty Foods, our approach of managing operations on a segment-wide basis is paying dividends, coupled with some nice sales success in the industrial and private label arena. For International, we look for continued success in growing our SPAM franchise worldwide and with targeted fresh pork exports, coupled with the added sales growth and efficiency we are seeing from our China operations.","We're also encouraged by the strength of our value-added protein products in both Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Stores. This bodes well for positive long-term contributions by both units to our overall company. We recognize that both of these units are facing some challenges in terms of immediate delivery of segment profit growth. In the case of Refrigerated Foods, the soft and even negative processing margins in pork are weaker than we had anticipated, but we do expect the balance to eventually return to this area, allowing for more traditional returns.","Higher grain costs and lower turkey commodity meat prices will continue to hinder margins at Jennie-O Turkey Store in the near term. We expect the results to begin to improve as we move into the latter part of the year. The planned reduction in harvest levels at Jennie-O Turkey Store and modest and strategic pricing should help mitigate those headwinds going forward. I would point out that this unit is still delivering excellent operating results.","The current business is solid from our standpoint, and we expect we will soon see a substantial added benefit in 2 of our 5 operating segments from the Skippy acquisition. Although our ownership of this iconic brand is in its early stages, we are excited by what we see in terms of opportunities for growth, both domestically and abroad. The financial benefits from this acquisition will emerge more significantly as the year proceeds, in that our second quarter will bear the burden of a large amount of the charges related to the transaction.","Strong operating margins, enhanced by expected synergies, will flow fully through our results commencing in fiscal 2014. The estimated charges and income are both reflected in our revised guidance.","In addition, we continue to enjoy outstanding contributions to total company growth from our innovation efforts. The latest example of our team's work is the planned launch this spring of our new Hormel roast snack wraps, which are being offered by the Meat Products team within our Refrigerated Foods segment. This line consists of 8 varieties of meat and cheese combinations, each rolled in flatbread. These ready on-the-go products can be enjoyed by consumers either in a cold state or easily warmed up in 20 seconds in a microwave oven. This new line outpaced all of our benchmarks in recent test markets, and we are receiving broad acceptance of the line from retailers throughout the United States.","Taking all of these factors into account, we are raising our fiscal 2013 earnings guidance to a range of $1.93 per share to $2.03 per share from our prior guidance range of $1.90 per share to $2 per share.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 totaled $129.7 million or $0.48 per share compared to $128.4 million, also $0.48 per share, a year ago. Dollar sales for the first quarter totaled $2.12 billion compared to $2.04 billion last year, a 4% increase.","Volume for the first quarter was 1.24 billion pounds, up 2% from the same period last year.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.4% of sales, down slightly from 7.5% of sales last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be between 7% and 7.5% of sales for the full year.","Interest and investment income was $1.8 million for the first quarter compared to $1.6 million last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million compared to $3.2 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2013.","Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.5% versus 33.4% in fiscal 2012. For fiscal 2013, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%.","The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 263.9 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 269.1 million shares. On January 29, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a new share authorization to repurchase up to 10 million shares of our common stock. We now have authorization in place to purchase approximately 11.2 million shares.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $29.8 million, down slightly from $30.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $120 million in fiscal 2013.","Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $22.1 million compared to $30.5 million last year. For fiscal 2013, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million to $140 million.","At the beginning of our second quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Skippy business, excluding China, using our available cash balances. We expect to have minimal borrowings on our revolving line of credit in the current quarter.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","My first question is more an industry one. Recently, you've seen China implement some restrictions on U.S. exports with ractopamine. How do you anticipate that will impact the industry and as well your business, because you've seen recently a significant selloff in hogs as a result of that? Is that a net positive or negative for your business?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, Farha, it's obviously very current, what's going on there, a very fluid situation. Each day seems to bring some different results. And it's fluid in terms of the market impact. I mean, for example, yesterday, the processing margins turned positive for the first time in quite a while now with a fairly sharp change from what we had been seeing before. So it's probably a little early for us to tell both whether that's going to have that long-term impact on the processing margins and more specifically what it will do to export volumes. I can say that in our case, I mean, we're not a big player when it comes to exporting of pork directly to China. And so it's not -- we don't see it as a major direct impact on our business, but clearly, it can have spillover effects on the markets, as you pointed out.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So net so far has been a positive because the hog prices have gone down and your pork margins turned positive?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Per day.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And then just a follow-up. You have now had Skippy for a few weeks. As you've gotten under the hood, is there anything that's been notably positive or negative that you've noted in the new business?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I mean, I guess we're still very positive about it. It is very early. The Skippy -- the onboarding happens in multiple phases with Skippy. On the domestic side, we are now involved in managing the Little Rock plant on a day-to-day basis. And having had a great chance to get to know the team down there, and they have an excellent operation there, and so a business emanating from that venture, operationally, we're right in charge of it right now. In terms of the sales logistics, et cetera, for the upcoming quarter, those will still be handled by Unilever as part of the transition agreement we have. We actually have up to 5 months of transition opportunity with Unilever. Our goal is to get that done in 3 months, but we're trying to have that totally in our hands by the beginning of the second half. When it comes to the international side of the business, it's a little tricky, and so I'll kind of lay that out for how that works. As we said on the Skippy acquisition call, we don't own the Skippy plant in China yet, and we won't for several months. That has to be approved. That permit has to be transferred by the Chinese government. However, sales internationally that emanate from the Little Rock plant, so for example, the Canada or Mexico, those we have right now, clearly have control over. The sales of products out of the China plant into markets other than China will count in our international results starting now. However, the margin will probably be a little different than we ultimately experience because, again, we're not only having a co-pack, but it's also being distributed and sold for us by Unilever. And then lastly, sales in China don't count at all right now, where that comes with the permit. And so that probably won't come on board until, at the earliest, Q4, and maybe more like the beginning of next year. But overall, we're really very excited by what we see.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","So I continue to be positively impressed with the margins of Jennie-O Turkey Store. The macro certainly was worse than a 15% margin would have -- macro would have indicated a worse margin than 15%, so congratulations on that. Your comments suggested that -- are we going to see it sort of go a little lower in the near term, or just sort of hang in this level and then recover as the year progresses? Do you have that sense of granularity about the business?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. And what we talked about at the year-end call was sort of a new annualized guidance range for Jennie-O of an 11% to 15% range, and we're still quite comfortable with that. The 15% delivery this quarter -- Q1 and Q4 are traditionally their highest margin delivery quarters, and the middle of the year is traditionally lower. So on that basis alone, if you're looking at percentage returns, we would expect Q2 to be lower than Q1. If you're looking at it on a year-over-year segment profit delivery basis, we do feel the Q2 -- by the time you really get in all the different cost impacts and all the commodity market impacts, our best look right now would say we'll probably have a somewhat -- a slightly deeper decline in Q2 year-over-year than what we experience in Q1, but we expect then to build a rebound from that as the year goes on.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I mean, obviously, the mix of commodity items changes from Q1 to Q2. Is that right or am I overstating that?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","That's an impact. The other impact that occurs is on the operations side, as when we get summer conditions, weights go down, and typically, margins decline.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask -- so in your script, you said you, through the quarter, kind of came in line with where you thought it would be originally. You did take up your guidance modestly. Is that solely reflecting the closure of Skippy? And then if you could just tell us what are -- I'm assuming the onetime cost you're going to have is a separate line item in your P&L when you report your second quarter results. To the extent the Street excludes those as onetime items, would your EPS range then be higher by whatever that amount is, and if you could quantify that amount?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I'll let Jody answer part of the second question. I'm doubting she can answer the last part of it. But in terms of the guidance change, typically, we've been in the motto of giving annual guidance for the past couple of years, and our philosophy has been not to just tweak the range based on results of a given quarter. We really want the focus to be on annual. In this case, with the significant announcement of the Skippy acquisition in the middle of the quarter, we then did undertake the responsibility as a team to reassess, okay, what do we now think the year looks like on the basis of our knowledge right now? So clearly, the addition of Skippy was factored in. We looked at the trends of what was going on in our other businesses, and that's where we ended up with moving the guidance range.","Jody H. Feragen","And as far as -- I think the part that was left for me is to talk about the onetime transaction costs. I would expect that at the end of the second quarter, when we have paid all the onetime transaction costs, that we'd be able to give you some level of magnitude. We have include our -- included our best estimates of those in the guidance range that we provided this quarter. But a lot of them are uncertain at this point, so I wouldn't want to give you something that wasn't precise.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up on Skippy, can you give us an idea about when you think you might be able to tell us what you expect in terms of synergies? I appreciate the China business, you're not going to talk about that at this point. But just in terms of you have to have some synergies within the U.S. business itself, which I'm assuming you'll be able to quantify over the next 6 months, 3 months?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","We've tended to not really endeavor to precisely lay out, \"Okay, here's the synergy target.\" We prefer to give you the all-in, \"Okay, here's the operating results we expect to have from the business.\" Right? We provided that for the 2014 goal the $0.13 to $0.17 range, and we're still comfortable with that. However, as we get our hands around the business more, if we find that, that has changed, we certainly would provide an update then to that expectation.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Were there some synergies included in that '14 impact that you gave us when you announced the deal?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes. And it was -- but yes, that was intended to encompass that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport & Company.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just want to ask about 2 areas. One is your strategy in deli meats. Are you changing any pricing or trying to get into any different segments in that area? And then second, can you just update me on peanut contracts for the Skippy business? Where are those?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","On the first question on deli meats, I mean, the category is evolving somewhat. We are still a significant behind-the-glass player, with ham and turkey being 2 of the major protein components that are behind there. And we certainly are working actively with all our retail partners to keep that business as robust as possible. But it's a business that has seen small declines for the last couple of years. A lot more activity is occurring in grab-and-go context. And between our Natural Choice offerings, which are still doing quite well in the marketplace, and our party trays would be another example of deli offering, and the snack trays -- so that's our effort to go after those kind of areas and provide other options when it comes to deli meats. On peanut contracts, I'm really going to have to punt on that one and maybe come back to you next quarter. I -- we just don't have our hands around that aspect of it completely at this stage. It's still pretty early on.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to chat a little bit about the pork margins that you mentioned. I mean, overall, the pork complex has been pretty weak, right? I mean, the hog prices have come down recently, and pork cutout has been weak now for a while. I mean, in that environment, with the value-added portfolio that you have, you typically do well or better than you did in Refrigerated Foods. So first, am I understanding that correctly? And if I am, I mean, what's different about this time around where you have weak cutouts and you have relatively weak hog prices, and yet the Refrigerated Foods business showed some weak results?","Jody H. Feragen","Let me try to help you with that, Akshay. We did see hog costs this quarter that were below the quarter a year ago but quite a bit above where we were at the end of fiscal 2012. We would expect those higher hog prices to continue for the full year. Now that is certainly subject to all those uncertainties related to the recent news on China. What we have seen is low domestic demand for pork. Certainly, that's driving that cutout and the value of those primals that go into our value-added products lower, which do benefit our value-added businesses. And sometimes, that's not quite an immediate benefit but happens over a period of time as you work through some inventory. So we would expect higher cutout values for the rest of the year, and that should help Refrigerated Foods as they turn back into more normalized margins.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So is -- so if I understand correctly, the cutout being weak, net-net should be a positive since you have a value-added portfolio. And what you're saying is there may just be some timing issues related to your portfolio. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Jody H. Feragen","Right, I would expect those margins to improve as the year goes on.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets.","Andrew Strelzik","This is Andrew Strelzik for Ken Zaslow. First, I'm interested in how you're thinking about capital allocation, particularly on the M&A side, after the Skippy deal? Has your appetite for acquisitions changed at all? What type of deal or size of deal would interest you? Any color around that would be helpful.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. We really haven't changed our outlook. We're intent on growing our business. Our long-term guidance for the business is 5% top line, 10% bottom line. And if you look at our track record over the past dozen years, I mean, clearly, acquisitions have played a role on that, and we're very pleased to bring on the Skippy brand as the latest example of that. While that did winnow down our cash position and our slight net borrowers after that, we still have virtually no debt, and realize we have significant debt capacity and are fully ready and capable of utilizing that capacity if the right opportunity comes along. In terms of strategic area, I mean, we were excited by the many things that Skippy brought to the party. I've been asked a couple times, \"Gee, does that mean you're only going to buy shelf-stable items now or grocery items?\" And while we definitely like that aspect of that transaction, that does not mean that we wouldn't look to continue to grow our protein businesses, our international business, our specialty business, et cetera. So we're -- we still intend to be actively looking for things that would be logical fits with our company, and we have the financial capability to do that.","Andrew Strelzik","Appreciate the color on that. My second question is related to food service. Some of the recent data we've been seeing shows a weakening in the food service segments, so I'm just interested in what you're seeing there.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","We're seeing the same thing. Now food services to me has been a very choppy environment for quite some time now, I mean, almost since the recession began. It has its ups and downs. It seems to recover. It goes back. This weakness that we're seeing is really only a couple months old. Some of the theories out there include the recent hike in gas prices, they include the lapse of the payroll tax holiday, and I think those probably do make sense. I would say, though, I mean, based on what has happened over the last couple of years, that consumers do sometimes seem to, for a short time, change their habits and maybe, okay, have more meals at home. But they usually eventually kind of revert back to what their preferred mix of at-home versus out-of-home occasions are. And so my best guess right now is that this will be a fairly short-term phenomenon, and we'll see at least some growth returning to the food service segment going forward.","Andrew Strelzik","And then lastly, you talked about reducing your harvest volumes on the turkey side. Can you quantify that? And have you changed your outlook for production levels internally for the rest of the year?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, the goal we -- I think we kind of said it's probably in the maybe 1.5% range was the annualized pound change we were looking to see. And we acknowledged, I guess, in the comments earlier that we made the head adjustment that we had planned. But at least in this early season, the weights ended up a little higher. We do think still, over the course of the full year, there will be a reduction. Whether it'll be the 1.5% within fiscal 2013, it may not be after having a quarter where that didn't occur. But the trend will definitely be in that traction. And that's part of -- I mean, commodity meat values are lower, and so we really don't see the need to have surplus meat in this environment. We'll still have sufficient meat to support our growing value-added businesses for Jennie-O.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Christine McCracken with Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Just -- I don't know if you mentioned it earlier. I might have missed it. But we're hearing a lot about this sequester and the potential for the furlough to impact USDA inspectors. I'm wondering, is it realistic to think they could even withdraw those inspectors, and do you have any contingency plans in place should that happen?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","It's definitely an issue we're keeping our eye on. And obviously, we're one of many players that would be affected. I mean, the sequester side related to inspectors is just one of numerous things going on in the economy that may or may not happen, depending on how the political games play out. Our best information right now would suggest that, okay, even if no budget deal or change is made and a sequester begins, if there are notice requirements within the government to their own inspectors that would probably push a change in operations out to the May, June timeframe. And then we'll just have to see, okay, how many -- what are the numbers you're talking about? What does that potentially do to our operations? Our position has been consistent with the position articulated by the American Meat Institute, which is we believe that there are other discretionary things within the USDA's total operation that potentially would be more logical targets for reductions in costs versus the mandatory presence of inspectors in our facilities. And if they're not there, and that means all those people have to get laid off and all that food is not delivered, that seems to be a pretty disruptive thing to the economy and society, and perhaps, we can come up with a better solution than that. But it's a very fluid situation. It definitely would -- it's something we have to keep our eye on. But right now, we don't expect there to be an immediate impact from it.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then just one follow-up. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic on value-added sales going forward tied to your portfolio, and yet we're seeing some weakness on the protein side for commodity meats. I'm curious, how does that fit? You've got pretty strong expectations, I guess, around more expensive or what I would consider premium products versus weaker expectations for commodity. So maybe you can explain further?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. Christine, one explanation I would have is the commodity markets, at least for our 2 main proteins, turkey and pork, are significantly influenced by export activity. And so as the -- there's been Russia doing this and China doing that, and as things potentially tighten up some on that basis, that will have an overall impact on the commodity values that clearly is affecting turkey, for example. Now as we move up and up the value ladder into having consumer-based items that, yes, come from protein but that are used by consumers, whether they're meal-type items, like chili and Compleats or Don Miguel, or items that are more fully meat, like a Natural Choice. I mean, our experience right now is that those are very robust franchises. We're growing them at high single digits in many cases, and they're meeting the lifestyle needs of consumers. And so I think those are somewhat divorced, then, from what the commodity markets are doing.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Eric Larson with CL King.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","This -- and we've talked about this before. Maybe, Jeff, this might be a question for Jody as well, I'm just not sure. Can you quantify the impact -- the margin impact of including the Don Miguel sales in Grocery Products in the quarter? And the reason why I'm asking is because, actually, the profit impact was bigger than I had expected. And you did a good sales in some of your very high-margin products in the quarter, SPAM, et cetera. So is there a way to sort of quantify what the impact was with the Don Miguel sales in Grocery for the quarter?","Jody H. Feragen","Well, you have to remember that we get an equity and earnings contribution from the Don Miguel sales, so it's not a margin thing. And I'm not, off the top of my head, thinking what that impact would have been quarter-over-quarter. That might be a follow-up with Kevin if there's any additional color. Sorry.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. Well, that was the second part of my follow-up. Your equity earnings were actually down modestly in the quarter. I think you were at $9.8 million in equity earnings versus $11 million the year before. So I was just trying to reconcile those 2 lines a little bit. That's all. We can maybe get that offline.","Jody H. Feragen","Well, but let me do -- let me clarify what is in that equity and earnings line that's on the top side financial statement. That is equity and earnings in not only our domestic joint venture, the MegaMex, but also our international joint ventures. So that -- any change there is not just attributable to MegaMex.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","No, I realize that. And I've -- again, I was -- I saw that, that was down as well. So I mean, I was just trying to -- I realize there's more than just Don Miguel sales in that equity line. So I was just trying to get an idea of what the impact was with all of that for the quarter.","Jody H. Feragen","Okay.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","The other thing to remember there, Eric, with Don Miguel is the only change that has occurred year-over-year is the sales being reflected in the sales line. And we've owned the deal for 2-plus years. So the bottom line profit of it has been our half -- share has been the same. But Jody is correct in terms of you probably need to kind of dive into it maybe offline to know which part flowed through margins versus equity in earnings.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's -- it's more of a technical question than anything else, in my judgment.","Operator","And I'm showing no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn it back to Kevin Jones for closing remarks.","Kevin C. Jones","Okay. Thank you for all of you who did take the time to listen, especially those who'll be at CAGNY in Boca Raton, Florida. I wish everybody a great rest of the day, and please feel free to follow up with me directly with any follow-up questions. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"11487":["Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) Q1 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call February 16, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Jon Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, CAGNY Co-Chair ","Jeff Ettinger - Chairman and CEO","Jody Feragen - CFO","Jim Snee - President and COO","Jana Haynes - Director, IR","Analysts","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc.","Rob Moskow - Credit Suisse-North America","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank","Jon Feeney","Good morning everyone. Once again, I\u2019m Jon Feeney, CAGNY Conference Co-Chair. And once again, I have the pleasure of introducing Jeff Ettinger, Chairman and CEO, Hormel Foods. But first, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank Hormel for hosting lunch today, featuring many of their leading branded retail and foodservice items, that\u2019ll be immediately after this presentation.","Hormel was nice enough to move up their strong earnings release this morning for this presentation, which you probably saw this morning, just like they\u2019ve been nice enough to lead the industry in returns for the past 15 years and to grow dividends every year for the past 50.","For 125 years, they\u2019ve been the protein Company everyone else would like to be. And through the recent acquisitions like Skippy and Muscle Milk, they\u2019re very quickly becoming the food and CPG company everyone would like to be.","Today, their CFO, Jody Feragen will cover the highlights of their earnings in lieu of an earnings call first, while both Jeff and recently named President and COO, Jim Snee will follow up and focus on their long-term strategic efforts, of course followed by your questions.","So, Jody, welcome. Thank you, and take it away.","Jody Feragen","Thank you, Jon for that introduction. Before we get started this morning, I need to remind you that certain statements will be forward-looking and they are based on current conditions. And I would refer you to the risk factors in our 2015 annual report. Additionally, 2015 results are non-GAAP numbers that exclude certain adjustments and those too are detailed in the annual report and also in the back of the presentation deck that you received when you walked in today.","As Jon said, we did wait to deliver our record quarter for this morning, $0.43 per share, our 11th consecutive quarter of record earnings. And we were pleased that four of our five business segment contributed to the growth.","Now, sales were down 4% due to lower pork markets as well as the turkey harvest supply issues that we\u2019ll talk about later. You\u2019ll note that the earnings per share and all the earnings per share numbers in the presentation have been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split that our shareholders approved on January 26th and became effective on February 9th.","So, taking a look at the segments, Grocery Products segment operating profit was up 26%, really benefitting from improved operational and supply chain efficiencies. In the first quarter of 2015, we rationalized our plant in Stockton, California and moved that production into other facilities. So, they\u2019re seeing a nice benefit from that and they\u2019re also winning with favorable raw material costs. Sales were down 4%, as we saw some softness in the canned meats area but we were really pleased with the results of our HORMEL bacon toppings, our CHI-CHI foods products and our Wholly Guacamole items.","Refrigerated Foods had an outstanding quarter, segment profit up 65%. And really, it was great improvement -- a great performance across all our value-added businesses as well as strong pork operating margins. This segment also benefitted from the inclusion of the Applegate Farm operations. That was the business we acquired in July of 2015 and it continues to perform as we expected. I think you\u2019ll hear a little bit more about that later in the presentation today. Sales were up 2% on a 5% volume increase as the higher sales were offset by those lower pork prices. We did see nice gains in our HORMEL refrigerated entrees, our HORMEL party trays in the retail side as well as OLD SMOKEHOUSE bacon and FIRE BRAISED meats from the foodservice side.","Jennie-O Turkey Store operating profit was down 2% for the quarter, really still recovering from the impact of highly pathogenic avian influenza that hit our farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota midway through 2015 last year. We are seeing improved performance and we would expect that by the end of our second quarter, they should be back at normalized operations, providing we see no further widespread outbreaks of AI. And then they\u2019ll also benefit from lower feed costs as grain prices have been lower. Sales were down 15%; volume down 23% and really that was just a supply issue, as we are vertically integrated in the turkey side of the business.","Specialty Foods operating profit was up 44% on the 10% decline in sales. They too benefitted from favorable input costs and also some supply chain efficiencies, as we look to rationalize the MUSCLE MILK production into some of our existing facilities. We were pleased with the growth of our MUSCLE MILK products, particularly the ready-to-drink items. But, we did see decreased sales of some contract packaging sports nutritional items that were at a low margin basis.","International saw 1% increase in operating profit on a 7% decline in sales. We were very pleased with the strong SKIPPY sales, both on an export basis as well as SKIPPY sales within our China operation, but they couldn\u2019t offset softer pork exports as we continue to battle challenging market conditions. Our China results were lower year-over-year. First quarter 2015, we were able to import SPAM and sell that in the domestic marketplace in China, that\u2019s no longer an option, so they are up against those difficult comparisons. But, we are fully looking forward to our plants that we are building in China to provide us the opportunity to sell SPAM to that marketplace.","Some other financial metrics that we traditionally go over on our call, advertising spend was $48.1 million, up nicely from last year; we would expect full year to be up low double-digits area. Our effective tax rate was 33.6% and we\u2019re expecting approximately 33.5% to 34% for the full year. Depreciation and amortization was slightly under $32 million while our capital expenditures were $33.5 million. As a reminder, we guided at the end of our fourth quarter that we were expecting approximately $250 million in CapEx, and you\u2019ll hear about some of the projects later in the presentation.","From a market outlook perspective, we are expecting hog production to be up about 2%. And while we benefitted from historically high favorable pork operating margins in the first quarter, we would expect those to moderate as the year goes on. Turkey production, assuming no widespread outbreaks of avian influenza, expected to be up 5% to 6%. And as that production increases, we should see prices moderate in the back half. Grains will be favorable year-over-year versus 2015. And as a reminder, we traditionally looked to hedge between 25% and 75% of our needs on a two-year forward looking.","We have a very strong balance sheet. The $185 million of short-term debt that was on the balance sheet at the end of our fourth quarter related to the Applegate transaction was repaid. And we now have $250 million of long-term debt on our balance sheet which we really believe gives us the opportunity to continue to look at all types of investments. And I believe we could have $3 billion of additional debt on our balance sheet and still remain investment grade.","Our excellent earnings results coupled with our disciplined capital model has allowed us to generate cash flows over the last five years of 21% growth rates. And if you look at the trailing 12 months ended in the first quarter, we\u2019re up over 65%, so, certainly generating the nice cash flow.","And our priorities have remained the same, pretty consistent year-over-year. We look to invest in our businesses as well as to return to our shareholders. We\u2019ve invested about $2.8 billion in growing our business, some of that organic being capital investment. We\u2019ll talk about adding capacity to meet some of the demand for our value added products, and then about $2.1 billion in strategic acquisitions. The way we look at these investments is the same regardless if I\u2019m adding internal capacity or looking at a strategic acquisition, we build the base case business model, we use a long-term cost of capital and we do a discounted cash flow, and we believe that that allows us to make the best decisions for our shareholders.","Speaking of shareholders, we believe in returning to our shareholders our excess cash flow. Our share repurchase is a little more opportunistic given our ownership structure, but we certainly are pleased with our dividend results. And as Jon referenced, 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. Our Board of Directors approved a 16% increase for 2016 and our average growth rate over the near term has been about 18%, in excess of the excellent bottom-line that we\u2019ve been able to deliver, as we try to get a payout ratio and the dividend yield closer to our Pepperidge [ph] food peers.","So, excellent earnings results; disciplined capital allows us to put up a return on invested capital that\u2019s in the top quartile of our peer group. And with that I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jeff Ettinger.","Jeff Ettinger","It\u2019s our pleasure to be with you this morning to be able to share what was an outstanding quarter for Hormel Foods, and to be back at CAGNY after a few year hiatus and what you know what we\u2019ve been up to and what our priorities are going forward in terms of our brands and our team.","As Jon was nice enough to mention, we\u2019re also hosting the lunch. So, we don\u2019t have a formal Q&A session after this but we\u2019ll all be available including others of our team during the lunch to take any additional questions you might have.","One of the questions you could ask anybody in there is what does 5 and 10 mean to Hormel Foods. 5 and 10 have been our consistent goals within our corporation for the past 10 years, what we strive to achieve 5% revenue growth each year and 10% earnings or operating income growth. These are among the most aggressive goals within the food industry and even in our past presentations here at CAGNY that Jody and I have done, you should have consistently seen that these were our goals at those sessions as well.","Importantly, we\u2019ve really done a nice job at achieving those aggressive goals. Our track record over the past five years on the topline is indeed at that 5% rate. We\u2019re now a $9.3 billion Company. And in area of earnings, we\u2019ve actually been able to exceed our 10% goal with the 12% CAGR capping out last year.","What I want to share with you is kind of how we\u2019ve done that and a little bit of our thinking behind some of the decisions we\u2019ve made that have led to these types of results. We\u2019ve grown our Company on a topline basis and certainly significant profit contributions in three ways: Through M&A; through new product innovation; and by continuing to expand our traditional product portfolio.","In the area of M&A, we certainly had an active decade during the 2000s with a number of deals, somewhat smaller deals ranging from about $15 million to $200 million in deal value, over a broad spectrum of products. This array of deals enabled us to gain confidence in our ability to integrate and to look for new prospects but as we headed into the most recent timeframe, we kind of did make a couple of changes in our mentality toward acquisitions. We look for somewhat larger deal as our Company\u2019s getting bigger and in order to move the needle, we recognized we needed to look at bigger opportunities. And so, four out the five largest deals in the Company\u2019s history have come in the past four years. Wholly Guacamole at a total deal value of north of $200 million counting, an earn-out off, Skippy which we completed in 2013, a $700 million deal, Muscle Milk in 2014 was a $450 million deal and then most recently Applegate at $775 million.","In addition to the deals being larger, we also looked critically at our portfolio and said, you know, I mean our core portfolio, we love a lot of the items that have been with us a long time and we\u2019re continuing to grow those items but honestly, it was a very American dominated portfolio with a lot of kind of traditional American food type items. Neither SPAM nor bacon items are probably going to be accused of being health oriented items any time soon and we recognized the consumers are more and more on the go, and our portfolio is really dominated by kind of sit down meal type items. So, all four of these acquisitions, and Jim\u2019s going to give you more detail on these, really are aimed at making our portfolio more global, more multicultural to add that element of health and holistic attributes and to provide on the go solution.","Another decision you have to make when you acquire something is, how are you going to run this operation? We\u2019re still headquartered in Austin, Minnesota, a small town, two hours south of Minneapolis and indeed for some of these properties, particularly businesses or brands that we buy from another company or corporation, we tend to fold those and run those in-house. And so that was true of the domestic Skippy business, it was true of the Lloyd\u2019s barbecue line, it was true of the Country Crock Side Dishes who are now named Hormel Side Dishes.","For some of these recent deals however, we have looked at those deals and said look, to really optimize the consumer connection and the uniqueness of some of these opportunities provide, we may need to look at running them a little bit differently. We still try to find ways to harmonize and gain synergies on a back room basis in every chance we get. But in terms of that direct to consumer connection point, for example Skippy in China, it came at the plant in China from which we sell to most of Asia, and so they are Chinese team that have been in place for over 15 years, that\u2019s taken on that business. Muscle Milk had a strong presence in Northern California, was kind of a young vibrant market and we wanted to maintain that, so we\u2019ve left that team there supplementing with a few folks in the Hormel organization. MegaMex into which we put the Wholly Guacamole acquisition is a joint venture. Our partners are two companies from Mexico, Grupo Herdez and Grupo KUO. And so on a combined basis, we run that entity from Southern California, which certainly is a hot market for understanding the Mexican food experience.","And then very recently with Applegate, this team and this business really had both a unique supply chain of organic and antibiotic free natural products and also very strong consumer connection to -- and unique set of folks that we wanted to make sure we preserve that connection.","So in order to go with the theme of kind of providing you with a little bit of a behind the scenes mentality of what we\u2019ve been seeking to do, I want to share with you now a video that kind of depicts what the Applegate experience is all about from the mouths of their team members. ","[Audio\/Video Presentation]","New product innovation is also a key element of our growth story at Hormel Foods. Indeed, our founder George Hormel founded the Company on the principle of innovate, don\u2019t imitate. We\u2019ve had a number of notable successes over the years including our party trays franchise, NATURAL CHOICE, our Bacon 1 items for the foodservice trade.","Within the retail world, we recently were recognized as an IRI Pacesetter for three of our items. This is a tracking of the last 52 weeks sales via the IRI organization of the best selling new products in the United States. And so, we were pleased that our MUSCLE MILK Pro Series, our REV snack wraps and our Wholly Guacamole minis all made this list.","In the nature, [ph] the editors from Progressive Grocer magazine bring in products from all over the country and have their editors try these items and see what they are excited by. And we were excited to see that we had eight items from our overall organization, ranging from Farmer John to Jennie-O Turkey Store, to our meat products group to our grocery products group that made this list.","The third area of growth I mentioned in top of M&A and innovation is continuing to emphasize the growth of our core items. More often when we\u2019re talking to the press, we\u2019re kind of known as Hormel \u2018maker of SPAM\u2019 still, so that\u2019s a long term core item we\u2019ve had. And I\u2019m going to share [ph] a secret, SPAM is still growing it. It\u2019s growing at 3% GAGR over the last five years in the U.S. and a 7% CAGR outside of the U.S. But in addition to SPAM, we own a number of other items within the portfolio that we\u2019ve been able to create really nice household penetration growth, ranging from our flavor bacon portfolio to HERDEZ authentic Mexican sauces to Jennie-O Turkey Store lean ground tray pack and chubs [ph] items to our Hormel pepperoni items.","And the story is a little bit different for each of them in terms of what\u2019s driven that growth. For the flavor bacons, these were items that frankly we borrowed from our foodservice team. We came up with these innovative flavors for the restaurant trade and they were so popular there that we created retail versions of the items. For HERDEZ it\u2019s been geographic and consumer expansion, as authentic Mexican food is going into more and more cities in the U.S. and is seen as an authentic eating experience by more and more consumer who are working for that kind of local item.","For Jennie-O Turkey Store, it\u2019s been the advertising, the Make the Switch campaign that has enhanced awareness of overall Jennie-O and has enabled us to ride the wave the consumers looking for more health oriented items. And even pepperoni minis that have been around for a 100 years, we\u2019ve been able to grow households recently. And in that case, I think recipes have driven a lot of it, as we\u2019ve encouraged consumers to put pepperoni pieces and slices on many more items. ","I mentioned to you that this growth of our overall company, the top-line where all the items I just mentioned and that some of the bottom-line has come from the enhancement of these portfolio items but clearly some of that 12% CAGR on the bottom-line has come from cost efficiency gains. We don\u2019t tend to have kind of active projects going on; we try to really watch this on a continual basis. Another one of the founding principles of George Hormel was continuous improvement, always seeking to find a way to do the job a little bit better day-in and day-out. One of the ways this manifests itself is through our best of the best projects. We encourage our teams from throughout the corporation to have projects during the course of the year to offset inflation and maybe even be able to provide enhanced bottom-line returns as well. We had over 1,500 such projects during the past year. And these projects drive cost control; they allow us to better utilize our raw materials; they can create yield improvements; and they can allow us to better utilize our capacity.","An example of those enhanced returns within two of our most vertical oriented units are seen in Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store, as over the past five years Refrigerated Foods has enhanced our overall operating income percentage by 250 basis points, and at Jennie-O Turkey Store that\u2019s about 590 basis-point increase.","One other way to see the leveraging of efficiency is the growth versus the kind of the overhead within the Company or the corporate team. So, we\u2019ve grown the top line in the past five years at an aggregate 28% but our corporate staff team during that same timeframe grew at 14%. So, 50% leverage opportunity there. Or if you look at overall sales, the CAGR of 5.11 versus SG&A without advertising at 3.95, again about a 20% leverage point -- versus our sales versus that total cost picture.","One last aspect of the secret behind Hormel Foods that I\u2019d like to share with you really relates to our team, where we are -- I mentioned to you we\u2019re in a small town in Minnesota; we\u2019re little bit of a throwback in that regard. When someone joins our organization, they tend to join it for a life and indeed our average tenure of our officer team at Hormel Foods is 26 years, that\u2019s not 26 years of industry experience, that\u2019s 26 years of experience at Hormel, which I think does make it somewhat unique in the industry.","We had our chance of -- I saw the earlier presentation from General Mills and they\u2019re celebrating their 150th anniversary, which is fantastic. Hormel Foods is celebrating our 125th anniversary this year. And in anticipation of that event, I had a little gathering here recently with my two predecessors in the CEO, President roles at Hormel Foods, Joel Johnson and Dick Knowlton. We were taping some things for that 125th anniversary celebration and then we kind of had a little breakfast session for some of our favorite SPAM recipes and had a chance to share some of the things we thought have made the Company strong over the last few years. And I want to share a couple of minutes of that video with you right now.","[Audio\/Video Presentation]","So, between Dick, Joel and I, we\u2019ve been President of the organization for the past 35 years; it\u2019s been our privilege to do that. But this last October we had an exciting announcement, it was the announcement of just the 10th President in our Company\u2019s 125-year history. Jim Snee. And let me tell you a couple of things about Jim. So, this maybe the first time for many of you to be introduced to Jim. Jim also has 26 years of Hormel Foods. So, he hits the average on the nose; so, we don\u2019t have to change that slide with him moving into this. He came up to our organization from the foodservice, sales and marketing team. He ran three different regions for our foodservice team. Jim was then asked to head up our corporate-wide purchasing function; after that he was inaugural Vice President of our affiliated foods group within Refrigerated Foods, running Farmer John, Burke and Dan\u2019s Prize. And then for the past four and half years, he lead the International team. And during his tenure, his team grew segment profit for international from $26 million to $88 million.","Without further ado, I\u2019m going to bring Jim up to podium, and he\u2019s going to share with you many of the exciting initiatives we have going forward.","Jim Snee","Thank you, Jeff. First, since this presentation is doubling as our first quarter earnings call, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to update all of you on our outlook for the rest of 2016. And during our fourth quarter conference call, we set our 2016 earnings per share guidance at $1.43 to a $1.48 per share. And those numbers are adjusted for the recent stock split.","Now, while sales growth will continue to be challenged, as we navigate lower pork markets and the reduced turkey volumes at Jennie-O, especially through the first half of the year, we do expect our earnings to continue to be favorable. And our strong earnings performance in the first quarter led by Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products, Specialty Foods as well as improvements in our Jennie-O Turkey segment, as we recover from the turkey supply pressures, has given us the confidence to raise our guidance for the full year to $1.50 to $1.56 per share. And that represents a 14% to 18% increase over 2015.","Now, while the Jennie-O Turkey Store business is still recovering from the impact of avian influenza last year, production volumes are expected to return to more normalized volumes by the end of the second quarter. And that will position them for strong growth in the back half of the year. Now, this expectation for normalized production volumes does assume that we do not have any new outbreaks of avian influenza in our operations, which are located in Minnesota, and Wisconsin. We look for continued favorable input cost for our Grocery Products and Refrigerated Foods segment. Refrigerated Foods will also benefit from strong pork operating margins. However, we do expect those pork operating margins to moderate as the year progresses. Specialty Foods should continue to benefit from an improved mix of higher value added items as our Muscle Milk franchise grows and we shift away from some lower margin business in other parts of that segment.","That team\u2019s done a nice job capitalizing on operational efficiencies between our existing Century Foods business but also our recent acquired CytoSport business. And we expect Specialty Foods to continue to benefit from those efforts. And we do expect our International segment to be able to deliver improved results as the year progresses with improved export sales of both SPAM and SKIPPY.","Now in terms of total Company performance, one of the reasons we\u2019re able to consistently set and hit our aggressive long-term growth goals is the balance that\u2019s built into our business segments. And when you put it altogether, our business model supports growth that exceeds the average for packaged food companies but is also inherently less volatile than our protein peers. ","Now, in the first quarter, you\u2019ve heard it several times, we certainly are pleased to post another record in terms of earnings which grew at a significant double-digit rate with four of our five segments delivering earnings growth, really demonstrating our balanced model. But the long term success of this model really is borne out over time, as we\u2019ve delivered year-over-year earnings growth in 27 of the past 30 years. And its financial consistency\u2019s not only due to the diversity across the business segments but also the balance built throughout our business model. And so, we have product offerings that are both protein centric but also packaged foods and that has really served us well over time. And the deep investments that we\u2019ve made in both our pork and turkey supply chains, allow us to better control the quality and consistency of our products and remove costs from our system. This is balanced by our position of buying other key inputs such as peanuts, avocados, and tomatoes on the outside. And that reduces our exposure to potentially volatile growing cycles but it also minimizes our capital investment.","And we have a very strong presence in both the retail and foodservice channels which allows us to serve consumers with meal solutions, both at home and away from home. And both our retail and foodservice businesses are strengthened by our dedicated sales force that concentrates exclusively on our family of brands. We have a strong sense of financial conservatism that serves the Company well. And as you saw earlier from Jody, we certainly have a strong balance sheet that gives us great flexibility.","Now, this conservative nature is complemented by a relentless pursuit of innovation that\u2019s allowed us to maintain relevancy with consumers. And it drives our success in both process and product improvement. So, this right balance allows us to prosper in various commodity cycles, and our diversified portfolio helps insulate the business in various market conditions.","And we have purposely prioritized our investments to expand the growth platform that we think positions our Company for long term growth, while complementing our existing portfolio of very strong brands, ultimately creating a platform of foods that fit the many consumer needs.","Now, even with the faster growth that we\u2019ve seen in our International business over the last several years, we acknowledge that our business is still primarily a U.S.-based business but we continue to seek opportunities to expand our global footprint. We also view multicultural items with new and adventurous flavors such as those items that you\u2019d find in our MegaMex portfolio of items as a strong growth platform. We believe there are more opportunities to expand our multicultural food offerings going forward.","Additionally, our innovation and acquisition efforts have been focused on delivering foods that fit today\u2019s busy, on the go lifestyles and the growing interest in products that are not only nutritious but has significant holistic attributes.","So, now let\u2019s take a deeper look at each of these platforms.","Our International business has achieved significant top-line growth over the last five years. We\u2019ve seen a 15% compound annual sales growth rate. And this segment is built on some long standing partnerships that we have with Purefoods in the Philippines, CJ in South Korea as well as a very a well-developed export business with iconic brands like SPAM and SKIPPY. And in China, we\u2019ve developed businesses in both foodservice and retail channels, leading to our decision to expand production capacity in that country. We broke ground this past April on our new production facility in Jiaxing China that will be completed by the end of calendar 2016. This facility will not only produce refrigerated and frozen meat items but it will include in-country SPAM production, allowing us to manufacture SPAM family of products in-country for the first time in our history. And this significant investment will give us much needed capacity and allow us to meet the growing demand for our products in China from both consumers and foodservice operators. Now, while we\u2019re pleased with the great work that our team has done to deliver this organic growth, we continue to seek opportunities to increase our global exposure in a more meaningful way.","I want to spend some time this morning, talking about some specific brands in our portfolio that support our growth platforms and the efforts made by our team to deliver innovation to meet the needs of today\u2019s consumers with food best fit their lifestyle. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we have had and will continue to have aggressive expectation to grow our business at a rate of 5% on the top line and 10% on the bottom line. The brands I\u2019ll be highlighting today are going to be key drivers to support this aggressive growth trajectory.","So, the Jennie-O has become a clear market leader through our team\u2019s efforts to build awareness. Their innovation and marketing efforts have led to 15 different items that hold the number one or number two market share position in their respective categories. And their Make the Switch advertising campaign highlighting turkey\u2019s versatility as an alternative to beef has been a huge success for the brand, driving both awareness and trial.","Consumer awareness for Jennie-O brand now exceeds 95% and it is driving purchase intent and share growth as consumers continue to look for fresh, nutritious meal solutions using Jennie-O Turkey products. In addition to the growing demand for these Jennie-O Turkey products, we believe our fresh supply chain focused on ground turkey is the best in the industry. And these efforts show up at the retailer, as Jennie-O share of ground meat business has shown fantastic growth over the last five years. We hold the number two item in the retail exactly meat category, the only turkey item in the top 10. We have worked hard to achieve that success and we have great retailer support, as they recognize the importance of these types of items and their growing demand from consumers. The healthy attributes of the Jennie-O Turkey product portfolio, our brand leadership and our rapidly growing share of the ground meats category position the Jennie-O Turkey segment to be a strong growth driver for our business for many years to come.","Now WHOLLY GUACAMOLE is part of our MegaMex portfolio of brands, and it\u2019s another brand that meets the growing demand from consumers for fresh, natural, fun organic products. This cool, on trend brand holds a 42% market share in the refrigerated guacamole category. and much of that growth has been built through digital media campaigns in conjunction with a strong social media presence and aligns well with our targeted growth areas with its healthy and holistic attributes. And of course, it has multicultural appeal. And from an innovation perspective, our introduction of WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis has been a huge success as it\u2019s made this great product easy for consumers to take on the go and have anytime, anywhere they want.","So, when we acquired the SKIPPY brand in 2013, we knew there were immediate opportunities to capitalize on the brand\u2019s existing recognition among consumers. We were able to make early distribution and share gains commensurate with the SKIPPY brand position. We also knew that we could grow the brand by going back to the basics with the commitment to advertising and innovation. And when we looked at innovation, we were not only looking for close in ideas but we wanted to bring to consumers the great flavor of SKIPPY beyond the jar. And we were able to do that with the introduction of SKIPPY P.B. Bites. It\u2019s a terrific combination of SKIPPY peanut butter with a pretzel or peanut butter center for a delicious protein infused snack that\u2019s perfect for on-the-go and anywhere snacking. SKIPPY peanut butter also enjoys the leading peanut butter brand from a natural perspective, allowing us to provide more choices for consumers. And while the team has done a lot of great work since the time of acquisition, we believe that there\u2019re still many opportunities to grow and innovate with this iconic brand.","Now, our Specialty Foods team is capitalizing on the 2014 acquisition of the Muscle Milk brand. Muscle Milk holds the number one market share position in the ready-to-drink protein beverage category. And they\u2019ve also been able to reinvigorate the brand\u2019s innovation efforts, introducing new items like MUSCLE MILK Pro Series and MUSCLE MILK organic products. With innovation even more critical in this fast growing protein category, our team has developed a robust pipeline of exciting innovations that we\u2019ll be sharing with you in the months to come. We\u2019ve also been able to leverage our team\u2019s capabilities to significantly expand distribution of Muscle Milk products with traditional retailers. And we expect our Muscle Milk franchise to continue to grow this premium protein category well into the future.","We got a peek at the Applegate brand earlier but I can tell you that we are still very excited about the addition of this great Applegate business to our portfolio of strong brands. Applegate is the number one brand in the natural and organic value-added protein category. And the acquisition was perfectly aligned with our interest in adding brands that resonate with consumers that are younger and more socially engaged. This acquisition has also expanded our distribution into the natural and specialty foods channel. It\u2019s provided us a faster path to creating a significant presence in this high growth attractive margin segment. It also affords consumers more choice, providing access to foods that fit the demand for more holistic products.","Now, as we anticipated and we communicated when we announced the acquisition, our team continues to work on securing supply to meet the high demand for some of our Applegate products. The team continues to deliver nice growth with chicken-based products such as our Applegate natural breakfast sausage and Applegate organic and natural breaded chicken.","I believe Jody said it earlier, if not, I\u2019ll say it for the first time that I\u2019m pleased to share with you that our Applegate business continues to perform in line with our expectations. And so, our approach of supporting our core items, driving innovation and strategically investing in acquisitions has allowed us to create a product portfolio that resonates with consumers of all ages, foods that fit many different lifestyles. So, many of our core brands have been well-represented in shopping carts for years. Our efforts on new product innovation and acquisitions have been focused on keeping our products relevant with changing consumer needs and trends, brands such as Wholly Guacamole, Natural Choice, Applegate, Muscle Milk and Jennie-O have broad appeal with millennials and a younger, more socially engaged consumer.","This broad and balanced portfolio of brands is another key to our long-term sustained growth. And these are strong brands. We have 30 -- we have over 30 brands that hold the number one or number two market share in their respective categories, helped in no small part by our dedicated sales team\u2019s effort to communicate the power of our brands and their value proposition in both the retail and foodservice channels. Many of these brands are familiar to consumers for generations. They\u2019ve grown and strengthened over time and we strive to keep them as relevant with today\u2019s consumer as when they were first introduced. And we remain committed to supporting these brands and strengthening these brands, and advertising is an important component. We expect a double-digit increase in our advertising spend this year on the heels of a similar sized increase last year.","Now, I\u2019d like to show you an example of some of our most recent investments, which represents a nice mix of both traditional and digital media.","[Audio\/Video Presentation]","We certainly have some creative individuals working across the Company on these ideas. Jeff shared with you earlier a slide sharing some of the great household penetration gains that we\u2019ve made over the last five years. And while yes, we have made a lot of gains, another reason we\u2019re optimistic about our ability to continue to deliver strong growth is that many of the products still have a long runway ahead of us. I spoke earlier about the growth in Jennie-O Ground Turkey products and they\u2019re only scratching the surface with a household penetration rate of 9%. Items such as Applegate sliced meats, Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Wholly Guacamole still all in the single digits with great consumer demand for these types of items, and even our iconic brands such as SPAM, Hormel pepperoni and Skippy peanut butter have significant runway growth ahead of them.","And Jody mentioned our CapEx plans earlier for fiscal 2016 of approximately $250 million. Now some key items in that plan are the China plant that I mentioned earlier as well as some production capacity expansion for select bacon item, including Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon which is an item that is developed for our foodservice group. Bacon continues to be on trend and it\u2019s been a great growth vehicle for us. We\u2019re also expanding production capacity for Jennie-O ground turkey products. Now, this was a project that we have scheduled last year but we put it on hold with the outbreak of avian influenza. So, we\u2019re just refreshing it this year.","And then, not all projects are about production capacity or plant efficiencies. And to keep pace with our innovation efforts, new technology and to maintain our laser like focused on food, quality and safety, we are making a significant investment in our research and development facility, which will be on line at the end of this fiscal year.","And so our efforts to innovate and keep our products relevant with consumers have delivered strong financial results. And clearly we\u2019ve been rewarded for those results in the marketplace. We\u2019ve enjoyed stock performance that exceeds the S&P 500 and an index of our food peers. In fact, an investment at the end of our fiscal year 2010 would have tripled by the end of our fiscal year 2015. And while we are pleased with this stock performance, our team understands that we must remain focused on those things that we can control. We will continue to concentrate on building our branded, value added portfolios and making the right investments today that will drive sustainable growth in our business over the long-term.","So, thank you for your attention this morning. We are now prepared to take your questions. And I do want to introduce Jana Haynes, who is our Director of Investor Relations.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking the question. So, congratulations on another great quarter. Can you talk a little bit about M&A? Obviously your returns have been above and beyond any of your peers but your balance sheet is still under-levered; you mentioned $3 billion in dry powder. The last three deals on average have added I think 4% to your earnings growth on average. What do you expect M&A to add to your growth algorithm going forward?","Jeff Ettinger","We talk about 5% and 10% but we\u2019ve said that that\u2019s inclusive of M&A. I think over maybe a 10-year timeframe, the M&A is in more like 1 to 1.5 of the 5. Over the last five years, it\u2019s been a little bit more robust as we have done some bigger deals. We clearly have the financial wherewithal to tackle more acquisitions. We\u2019ve talked in the past and if you look at even the recent ones, some are corporate properties, so SKIPPY came from a corporation; Lloyds. From time to time companies are changing their portfolio. And we will certainly look at items within those portfolios that makes sense to Hormel. But a number of our more successful acquisitions have been family-owned business that frankly we try to establish a relationship over many years with a hope that at some point if that family has made the decision to sell the business that we might be a preferred buyer.","We certainly have a number of hooks in the water and keep looking for the things. We know we can handle financially, we also know we can handle in terms of the capacity of our Company to integrate and handle more businesses.","Jody Feragen","And I think importantly is the disciplined model that we put around when we are looking at whatever our investments are and taking a long-term view because we do buy things that we intend to keep for the next 125 years.","Jim Snee","And I would add that we would probably keep them tied to those growth platforms, I discussed. So, when we think about global multicultural, healthy holistic and on-the-go, those are going to be key drivers for us as we go in the future. Doesn\u2019t mean that we wouldn\u2019t look at a business that perhaps adds scale to an existing portfolio that we have but really we want to focus on those growth platforms in the years ahead.","Jana Haynes","Farha?","Farha Aslam","Results today really highlighted the success of your allocating raw material to the highest opportunity, particularly your Jennie-O Turkey Store had volumes that were down kind of 20% plus but your earnings were nearly flat. So, kind of as you look forward, what more opportunity do you see in both turkey and pork, going forward.","Jeff Ettinger","I think from a turkey perspective, clearly it\u2019s exactly what you said. I mean the team has done a great job allocating those raw materials. But as we get in to the back half of the year, we will see that return to more normalized returns. We need to make sure that we\u2019ve got our business, our distribution back to where was pre avian influenza because there were some rationalization that had to take place. And so, we\u2019ve got the great fundamentals of the Jennie-O Turkey Store business. And now, if we can go back and put the supply on top of that we think that we are going to be well-positioned for future growth.","On the pork side, again, it\u2019s a pork operating margins could have an impact in the back half of the year. But when you look across the Refrigerated Foods in total, we\u2019re talking about meat products, foodservice, a number of different businesses that all -- they don\u2019t all have the same direct impact. So, I mean we expect to be fine on the pork side.","Jana Haynes","Rob Moskow?","Rob Moskow","Thanks. Also I thought what helped the quarter were bacon margins, deli prices were way down and bacon retail seemed really high. Was that a big driver of refrigerated margin in the quarter, and is that also sustainable given the volatility in deli prices historically?","Jeff Ettinger","That was a piece of it. I mean clearly if you look at the portfolio of items that we have available, whether it\u2019s Hormel pepperoni, bacon, certainly the Refrigerated Foods or the items in our foodservice group also has a bacon component to it as well. And so our team does do a good job of staying current on pricing, as it does, there is some volatility and fluctuation. So, I mean I think the margin management piece of it, the discipline our team, does a pretty nice job. And I would expect that we would keep that going forward.","Rob Moskow","Just to follow up, in turkey, is the industry going to come out of this AI event in the stronger position than it was before because maybe some excess capacity came out? I mean your pricing is up at a time when all other proteins are down. Can you explain how turkey pricing kind of takes [ph] once all that?","Jim Snee","I think turkey is kind of unique in the sense that it is a niche protein, even as greater job as our Jennie-O brand has done in proliferating the brand in the marketplace and adding these value added items, I mean it\u2019s not the lead item that the retailers going to feature in their ads, except for Thanksgiving. So, I think the pricing model for us is really fairly consistent one. As long as we build innovative items with true points of difference, we can attain a good margin with those. And we clearly want to support that with the advertising position. Hard to tell from a macro standpoint. I mean this year the whole industry is obviously going to be closely watching this spring to see if there are any further outbreaks. You\u2019re seeing cold storage stocks go up a little bit already. I think that frankly folks are holding to any surplus breast meat or other items they have in anticipation of a potential challenge. We didn\u2019t see any recurrence within our region in the fall. There was a recent incident in Indiana but was a fairly limited one of a different strain. So I think the AI dynamic is going to continue to affect the marketplace at least through the spring and then if it turns out we have a clean spring and we\u2019re kind of out of that mold, then things could change by next year.","Jana Haynes","Mario?","Mario Contreras","Mario Contreras, Deutsche Bank. So, I wanted to ask about your long-term targets; 5% sales, 10% earnings growth. It\u2019s obviously implying a decent amount of margin expansion over time. But, if we look at your specific segment margin ranges, you are already kind of at the high-end or even above the high-end in some cases. So, can you talk a little bit about where you expect to see that margin expansion come from over time?","Jody Feragen","Well, certainly we\u2019ll look to do some of that leveraging on the corporate and the G&A side of things, like Jeff talked about. But really it\u2019s about focusing on what the consumers are looking for and trying to find the value-added products that fit within the growth platforms that we\u2019ve put out there. Some will come from one of the things that we -- criteria we look for when we\u2019re looking at M&A transactions or even those internal investments are -- we expect the margin profile over those investments over the long-term be accretive to the segments that they\u2019re in. So, lots of different things working towards those goals.","Jeff Ettinger","As Jon mentioned in his introduction, we certainly have endeavored to shift the portfolio to become more and more of a prepared foods player but our aggregate margins are still well below the average of that universe. So, we think over time and we\u2019ll certainly move the segment margins as we see a logic behind that; we think over time the total Company margins can definitely migrate northwards.","Jon Feeney","Well, thank you. I think that\u2019s all the time we have on the webcast. Just as a reminder, lunch is immediately after this. I believe Hormel management team will be available for your questions. Let\u2019s take this opportunity to thank Hormel once again for what is sure to be a great lunch and for their support of CAGNY, had a great presentation. Thank you."],"11563":["Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call August 24, 2017  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Nathan Annis - Director of IR","Jim Snee - President & CEO","Jim Sheehan - CFO","Analysts","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Benjamin Theurer - Barclays","Jeremy Scott - Mizuho","Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group","Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Hormel Foods Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call.","At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, August 24, 2017.","I would like to turn the conference over to Nathan Annis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Annis.","Nathan Annis","Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6:30 AM Eastern. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at www.hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.","On our call today is Jim Snee, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Sheehan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim Snee will provide a review each segment's performance for the quarter, a strategic review of the acquisitions of Fontanini and Ceratti and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2017. Jim Sheehan will provide detailed financial results for the quarter, a financial review of the acquisitions and further assumptions relating to our fiscal 2017 outlook. The line will be opened for questions following Jim Sheehan's remarks.","As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to get back in the queue. An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 11:00 AM today Central Standard Time. The dial-in number is 800-263-0877and the access code is 9221656. It will also be posted to our website and archived for one year.","Before we get started with the results of the quarter, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking, and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the company are fluctuations in the costs and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products. Factors that may affect actual results of the acquisitions include, but are not limited to whether and when the company will be able to realize the expected financial results and accretive effective effectively the transactions and how customers, competitors, suppliers and employees will react to the transactions. Please refer to Pages 32 through 38 in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2017 for more details. It can be accessed on our website.","Additionally, please note the company uses non-GAAP results to provide investors with a better understanding of the company's operating performance by excluding the sales and volume impact of the divestiture of the Diamond Crystal Brands business, the divestiture of the Farmer John business, and the acquisition of Justin's specialty nut butters. Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. Please note that during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as adjusted sales and volume.","I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.","Jim Snee","Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced third quarter results of $0.34 per share, down 6% from last year. Sales for the quarter were down 4% on a 9% decrease in volume. Adjusted sales grew 1% while adjusted volume was down 1%.","While the results are not where we expected them to be, there is a lot of good news to share. I will briefly touch on some positive news in our company and then address the areas that are challenged and what actions we are taking to address those challenges.","From a financial perspective, we posted record pretax earnings for the quarter as our two largest segments, Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products more than offset declines in our three other segments. Adjusted net sales increased 1% even at Jennie-O Turkey store sales declined 9% or $35 million.","We also made progress toward many of our strategic initiatives since the second quarter conference call. We committed $130 million in capital towards an expansion of one of our vacant facilities in Wichita, Kansas. We have experienced tremendous demand for bacon and this expansion will give us much-needed capacity for many of our premium precooked bacon items, most notably BACON 1. We expect this expansion to be completed in December 2018.","We also announced two acquisitions of family-owned businesses. Last week we acquired Fontanini Italian Meats and Sausages. Since 1960, the Fontanini family has done a wonderful job growing their authentic, branded line of Italian meats and sausages items. Fontanini enhances our branded Hormel food service and Burke Pizza toppings businesses.","This acquisition also gives us more production capacity and allows us to avoid major capital expenditures at our current facilities. We intend to integrate Fontanini into the refrigerated foods group over the next six to nine months.","We do not plan to operate Fontanini as a standalone subsidiary, but instead integrate the plant into our Refrigerated Foods operations group and their sales force into our Hormel foodservice division. The integration will allow us to attain significant synergies.","We also announced the acquisition of Ceratti, an authentic family-owned, branded meats business located in Brazil. This acquisition is a great strategic fit for Hormel Foods as their retail and foodservice daily meat business closely mirrors our domestic portfolio.","Ceratti will operate as a standalone business in Brazil and will serve as a platform for future acquisitions in South America. Jim Sheehan will provide financial details related to the Fontanini and Ceratti acquisitions.","As you will see, we once again maintained our financial discipline in the acquisition process. As I mentioned, there were challenges this quarter. We saw two of our primary raw materials pork bellies and beef trim reach all-time record high prices.","Since late April, belly prices have more than doubled and are currently trading around $2 per pound. While we generate bellies internally through the hog harvest process, we also procure a large quantity of bellies externally. The speed and magnitude of these increases pressured both our retail and foodservice bacon business.","We have implemented price increases with the majority being realized late in the fourth quarter. We also saw 50% beef trim prices hit record levels this quarter. While beef trim prices have recently decreased, they are still at elevated levels relative to last year.","As a reminder, we procure all our beef needs externally for products in grocery products and international such as Hormel Chili, beef stew and products in refrigerated foods such as Hormel Pepperoni and dry sausage items.","We have taken different pricing actions depending on the category, channel and competitive activity and expect the majority of pricing to be in effect late in the fourth quarter. Jim Sheehan will provide further details on the financial impact of commodity prices in his remarks.","Now turning to Jennie-O Turkey store. As we anticipated and communicated in the second quarter call, Jennie-O Turkey store had another difficult quarter compared to last year with earnings down 20%. Sales were down 9% and volume was down 7% driven by the decision to reduce production levels.","Similar to the first half, three main issues affected Jennie-O Turkey store's profitability this quarter, Low Turkey markets, elevated competition and increased expenses. First, the Turkey markets were relatively unchanged from last quarter. We continue to operate in markets where lower Turkey prices year-over-year are affecting both our commodity sales prices and our value-added pricing.","Second, increased competitive activity from other Turkey suppliers and competing proteins such as beef continue to pressure results. 50% beef trim prices are up significantly compared to last year, but we have not seen this translate into meaningful increases in ground beef prices at retail.","Third, we incurred higher operating expenses, primarily related to bird performance issues with both our conventional flocks and those raised without antibiotics. Our team continues to work to address this issue through changes in feed and other live production factors.","Despite the market conditions and operating challenges, the Jennie-O Turkey store team grew lean ground Turkey sales by high single-digits and recent 13 weeks scanner data shows positive sales trends.","On our second quarter call, we indicated specialty foods would see double-digit growth for the back half of the year and that is not materializing. Part of the delta between our expectations and actual results is the increase in commodity prices for our contract packaging business.","Similar to our Grocery Product segments, it will take a few months for pricing to catch up with input costs. Beyond that, we are disappointed with the results from CytoSport. We experienced a sharp decline in Muscle Milk ready to drink protein beverages as investments in the brand did not drive the expected growth.","We continue to see aggressive competitive activity especially in the convenience store channel. We are making numerous corrective actions including increased promotional sport.","International had a difficult quarter as our China meat business continues to experience high pork prices. While hog prices have decreased in China, key raw materials such as bellies and hams have not decreased at the same pace.","We also incurred startup costs for our Jiaxing facility and higher-than-expected closing expenses for our Shanghai facility. We are now producing product at the Jiaxing facility and expect our SPAM production line to be running later in the fourth quarter.","Grocery Products had a strong quarter for sales. Brands such as Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, SKIPPY, SPAM and Dinty Moore Stew all contributed to the sales growth. Profits for many of our brands such as Wholly Guacamole, SPAM, Dinty Moore and Hormel Chili were adversely affected by higher input costs, which was offset by decreases in advertising expenses.","Refrigerated Foods had an excellent quarter as segment profit increased 15% primarily driven by high demand for fresh pork and operational improvements. Demand for our branded value-added products in retail and foodservice remained very strong.","Foodservice brands such as Hormel BACON 1, fully cooked bacon, Hormel Fire Braised meats and retail brands such as Hormel Pepperoni and Hormel Natural Choice Lunchmeats contributed to the excellent results.","Consistent with what we communicated on the second quarter conference call, we continue to make responsible reductions to advertising and marketing expenses.","Advertising expense this quarter was $24 million compared to $53 million in 2016. As a reminder, we incurred double-digit increases to advertising spend over the last three years and current advertising is comparable to our fiscal 2015 spend on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net sales.","To maintain our advertising and promotional spend efficiency, some advertising dollars have shifted to promotions in order to maintain our share of voice and store. We are committed to growing our brands through effective advertising, but are trimming advertising expenses while we work through commodity input costs increase. We will continue to evaluate our marketing strategy as conditions change.","Looking towards the fourth quarter, we see continued earnings pressure from high raw material prices, which will not be fully offset by price increases until late in the quarter. We indicated in earlier calls we have decreased our live production at Jennie-O Turkey store by mid-single-digits in order to procure more Turkey meat externally.","We have been anticipating a cutback in industry production and based on recent USDA reports, are finally seeing some positive signs. July pulp placements were down 5% following minor decreases in the prior months. Although cold storage stocks continue to rise, the rate of gain is slowly.","While the industry is moving in the right direction, we need to see further signs of lower pulp placements and lower cold storage. As such, we would expect turkey prices for the fourth quarter to be unchanged from current prices. We expect the fourth quarter performance to be similar to the previous quarters this year.","As I indicated earlier, Specialty Foods will not achieve double-digit earnings growth in the back half, primarily due to lower sales trends at CytoSport. We now expect flat earnings in the fourth quarter.","For Refrigerated Foods, our outlook has moderated due to rising input costs. Grocery Products expects a solid quarter of sales and earnings growth even as they work to overcome higher commodity markets. Jim Sheehan will be discussing the market dynamics impacting these segments in his portion of the call.","And we are tempering our outlook for the International segment as high raw material prices continue to impact results in China. Based on the underperformance in the third quarter, current market conditions and lower expectations for Specialty Foods and International, we are lowering our full-year earnings per share guidance to $1.54 to $1.58 from the low end of the $1.65 to $1.71 per share.","We have faced difficult market conditions this year. Commodity markets have been challenging to forecast based on both the volatility of the markets and the velocity of the change. The lag between the input cost increases and when price changes are realized in the marketplace, has pressured margins in the short term.","We know it is our responsibility to address these shifts and find ways to move the business forward. We have a plan and are executing that plan to realize our long-term goals.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and additional key drivers for the remainder of 2017.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Volume for the third quarter was \u00a31.1 billion, a 9% decrease compared to last year. Sales for the third quarter were $2.2 billion, a 4% decrease.","Excluding Justin's and the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and Farmer John, adjusted volume decreased 1% and adjusted sales increased 1%. We generated record earnings before income taxes of $278 million up 1% from last year.","Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34.3% compared to 28.6% last year. During the third quarter of last year we experienced an unusually low tax rate, which was a result of international restructuring.","Our income taxes were 22% higher this quarter compared to last year. We expect our full-year tax rate to be between 33.25% and 33.75%. Net earnings for the third quarter were $183 million down 7% compared to last year. General corporate expenses were lower primarily due to the continued focus on strategic cost management. We expect general corporate expenses to be below last year for the fourth quarter.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33 million unchanged from last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $125 million for 2017. Equity and earnings for the quarter was $4 million down 38% compared to last year. High avocado cost offset strong sales for MegaMex.","Cash flow from operations was $250 million in the third quarter, up from $213 million last year. The increase was primarily related to decreases in working capital. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $42 million compared to $66 million last year. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $190 million this year.","Projects include the completion of our plant in China, the replacement of the whole bird plant in Melrose, the bacon expansion in Wichita and ongoing investments for food and employee safety.","We paid our 356th consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15 at an annual rate of $0.68 per share. This completes our 89th year of consecutive dividends. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock spending $45 million in the quarter. $10 million shares remain from the current authorization. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises, based on our internal valuation.","Operating margins were 12.7%, a 70-basis point increase compared to last year. Grocery products and Refrigerated Foods increased operating margins during the quarter. as Jim Snee discussed, input costs for the third quarter were much higher than the previous quarter and the third quarter of last year with the exception of Jennie-O.","Belly prices sharply increased in the quarter. Bellies moved to record highs and remained at historically high levels. On average, belly prices were approximately 40% higher than last year. We expect belly prices to be well above last year as the industry continues to experience lower cold storage levels and high demand for bacon.","On average 72% pork trim prices were 20% above last year. We expect trim markets to remain well above last year for the fourth quarter. Prices for 50% beef trim were 70% higher for the quarter compared to last year. We expect beef prices to remain higher than last year for the fourth quarter.","As discussed at Investor Day, we purchased between $700 million and $900 million of meat annually. The 20% to 70% increase in purchased meat cost has significantly affected the expectations for the second half of the year.","Hog prices in the quarter were similar to last year. We expect to see more short-term volatility in the hog markets for the remainder of the year and into next year. During the fourth quarter, hog prices are expected to be higher than last year, but below the five-year average.","Year-to-date, export demand has been strong. The USDA forecast exports to be up 10% in 2017 and up another 4% in 2018. Domestic consumption also remains very strong. For example, pork feature activities has increased 120% in the last 13 weeks and pork pricing has materially increased since last quarter.","Two new pork facilities are coming online in September. Based on the strong international and domestic demand trends and high commodity markets, we feel the industry is not at risk for a short-term overcapacity condition.","We remain confident we're well positioned to utilize the internally generated commodities and purchase the externally sourced raw materials required to support our value-added products. Feed costs were lower compared to last year. We expect feed cost to trend in line with last year for the fourth quarter.","Breast meat and other turkey commodity prices remained at seven-year lows. Based on inventory and production levels, we do not expect material changes in prices until we see a few more months of declines in turkey pulp placements.","We're also looking at the cold storage levels as a leading indicator for turkey prices. Currently, cold storage levels for breast meat are 18% higher than last year.","As Jim discussed, we acquired Fontanini last week. The purchase price was $425 million and includes the Fontanini brand, a large salesforce, a fully staffed production facility in the Chicago area and access to new customers.","The transaction is structured as an asset deal and will provide an ongoing cash flow benefit as a result of tax amortization of the adjusted asset basis. The net present value of this cash flow benefit is estimated to be $90 million.","Fontanini provides us much-needed capacity and also allows us to avoid a major planned capital expenditure in 2018 of $150 million. The transition of production to the Fontanini facility will provide operational synergies.","Annual sales were approximately $240 million and are expected to grow 5%. Fontanini's operating margins are accretive to both refrigerated foods and the total company. We estimate that steel will be slightly dilutive in 2017 and between $0.03 to $0.04 per share accretive without synergies in 2018.","With Fontanini producing and selling products similar to our existing foodservice business, we will have immediate synergies in supply chain operations, finance and sales.","We also acquired the Ceratti brand, a value-added meat business in Brazil. The purchase price was $104 million. The acquisition comes with a sales and marketing team, fully staffed production facility and professional management team.","Ceratti's annual sales were approximately $100 million and have been growing at mid-teen levels. We expect that trend to continue. We estimate that steel will be slightly diluted in 2017 and $0.01 per share accretive in 2018.","Ceratti's margins are diluted to International's margins, but we expect to improve margins over time. Ceratti will not contain many synergies. One-time cost for the second half of the year for Fontanini, Ceratti and other acquisition efforts total $0.01 per share.","These costs include deal costs and estimated inventory step-up costs. We plan to finance these transactions with a combination of cash on hand and funds from our short-term revolver.","At this time, we'll turn the call over the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Jim Snee","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson","Maybe just at the outset Jim and Jim, help me think about the performance in the quarter and relative to the expectations you have on the May call and at the June Analyst Day, the bigger areas, the shortfall and as you think about the guidance cut, just maybe any way to parse the geography of where those cuts came from between raw materials and Refrigerated and Grocery and International and specialty and just how -- and the impact of the acquisitions in the short term and where things really fell short of your own internal projections two and three months ago?","Jim Snee","Okay. Sounds good Adam. So, when you think about that guidance reduction, I guess the first thing I would tell you is think about the reductions being spread equally across all the segments and now that being said, there were a number of different factors in each of the statements.","So, when you think about Grocery Products and Refrigerated Foods, primary driver there impacted by the record prices for the key inputs and as we mentioned, prising really won't be in effect until late in Q4.","From a jobs perspective, the recovery that we expected to see in Q4 does not appear to be materializing and from an International perspective, the raw material impact in China combined with the additional Shanghai closing costs and then they are taking a portion of the deal costs that Jim mentioned.","And then, really from Specialty Foods, we talked about again the raw material increase in contract packaging and then the miss on CytoSport. The sales didn't materialize the way we had anticipated. So that's how you can think about them across the business segments.","From a quarterly perspective, probably want to think about them about the majority of the reduction was in Q3. We do have pricing that takes hold in the back half of Q4.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. That's very helpful and then thinking about the implications into 2018, I appreciate that it's early still and certainly there is a lot of volatility in the near term, but as you starts to -- start penciling in pieces of 2018 can you talk about the confidence level on sustainability of Refrigerated margins, Jennie-O improvement, the accretion from the deals that you just alluded to, just the things that you're starting to get some line of sight to and where the thought is for next year?","Jim Snee","Sure. We can do that for you Adam. I will open it by saying we're not giving guidance into 2018, but again as we go through the segments and you think about, clearly in Refrigerated Foods, we'll have the benefit of Fontanini, which is a great addition to our portfolio.","We'll certainly be watching the changes in the hog markets and the volatility that could come. In Grocery Products, we know that will have our pricing in effect. Would tell you that we are also watching volumes as a result of that pricing and any changes we may need to make. But we're very optimistic about the Grocery Products portfolio.","In terms of jobs, we expect to see some of these unfavorable market conditions still into 2018, but we at some point, jobs is going to get incrementally better. For Specialty Foods, we had a lot of moving parts over the last couple of years and we've got work to do, but we know that will get Muscle Milk back on track and then from an international perspective, we're pleased with the addition of the Ceratti brand in Brazil.","We do believe that will have improvements in the China meat business and then of course the full benefit of having our new Jiaxing facility up and running, in country production of SPAM should have some really nice benefits there. So that's how we're starting to think about 2018 and some of the color around that.","Adam Samuelson","I appreciate the color. Very helpful. I'll pass the line.","Jim Snee","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to ask about the SG&A expense reduction during the quarter. If you can maybe provide more color in terms of the key drivers and how you're looking about the sustainability in the reduction that we saw?","Jim Sheehan","Sure Rupesh. As we talked about at Investor Day, we're really focused on making strategic changes to our expense structure. We've been focused on supporting our critical initiatives, our long-term goals, but reducing expenses in other areas. So that has been the main focus of the group over the last six months.","We did have an advertising reduction of $30 million in SG&A, but we're very pleased with the progress that we've seen around managing our expenses while supporting those long-term initiatives.","Rupesh Parikh","And then as you look at the pullback in the advertising spending during the quarter and I guess you've been going forward, do you believe that at all impacted your topline performance and do you expect it to impact your topline going forward?","Jim Sheehan","Rupesh, we don't. We are obviously strategically looking at our advertising spend and we are committed to the long-term growth and health of our brands. This level that we're at is our 2015 level, which is still a very healthy level after several years of double-digit increases and these are all prudent decreases.","The other thing I would remind you of is that we are shifting some of the dollars to trade, so that we're maintaining our in-store share of voice and we're confident that we'll still be able to drive sales growth.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thank you. I guess I just wanted to understand a little bit about why it is taking this long to pass through these higher costs. You didn't mention bacon, I don't think in terms of what that pass-through looks like. Can you be a little more specific about it because it's a big part of what you do?","Are you passing it through -- has it passed through already at retail because I know that's kind of quick? Is it taking longer in foodservice or not? And secondly, I didn't hear you mention retail bacon as being part of the things that went well in the quarter?","Our Nielsen data would indicate that your sales are way up on retail bacon. Can you be more specific as to what's happening there just to give us a sense of comfort that to say the temporary phenomenon?","Jim Sheehan","Absolutely Rob. So, I'll start with the pricing perspective and we've been very aggressive in the pricing action that we've taken across our entire portfolio and we frequently talk about from a retail perspective you're going to have a 45 to 60-day lag. And we have taken pricing on retail bacon, retail pepperoni and a whole slew of grocery products items.","From a foodservice perspective, we certainly get the benefit of the price increase sooner on our street business, but we do have some contract business that can have a one to three-month lag. So, it really is a mixed bag, but I think the key take away here is that we have been very aggressive with all of our pricing action and we're priced to the peak of the market that we've seen. And as a reminder, because of that lag, that's why we're saying the pricing will take hold late in Q4.","From a retail bacon performance, you're correct. We had an absolutely great quarter on volumes and sales, both in retail and foodservice. The challenge of course is that margins suffered due to the fast run up in belly prices and obviously it's a competitive category, but our focus has been growing our premium black label bacon line in retail.","And of course, we've talked to you at Investor Day about the investments that we've made in BACON 1 and as I started off my comments, we're very excited about the strategic investment that we're making down in Wichita, Kansas in our Dold facility to support the high demand for foodservice BACON 1.","So, pricing action, very aggressive, bacon performance very strong. Sets us up really well for the future.","Robert Moskow","That's great. Thank you for the color. And if I could move you to the acquisition that -- the Fontanini acquisition, it sound like a big part of the logic was opportunity cost avoidance I guess or however you want to put. You didn't have to build this new plant.","But you are kind of holding out a number for synergies that could also help us in fiscal '18, 5% of sales is a typical number in the group, maybe 7% of sales for synergies. When do you think you'll give us some insight as to what those synergies could be?","Jim Snee","Rob, this is Jim Snee. I am going to start with the first part about this fit, so your comment about I guess I call it capital avoidance, that was part of the equation. It wasn't a majority part of the equation. From our perspective and I\u2019ve talked a lot about my desire to grow and accelerate our foodservice business.","And so, this is a perfect addition to our foodservice business. It's branded, it's high margin business and it's a growing business. A direct sales organization, which in this day and age becomes less and less common. It mirrors the sales organization that we have and then we just see this as a great fit complementing our foodservice business.","It also complements the Burke Organization and as I mentioned in my comments, we are up against some capacity constraints that we were going to have to spend some money and this gives us tremendous relief in that respect. Jim, I'll turn it over to you for the synergy portion.","Jim Sheehan","Sure. And as you discussed, there was $150 million of capital avoidance, but also the $90 million of tax cash flow that really equates to $240 million of the $425 million that was spent. We obviously have looked at the synergies as we were doing our valuation.","We feel that the synergies will be at or above -- at or slightly above what you would refer to as an average synergy, but that excludes the advantages that we have from both the capital avoidance and the benefit we have from the tax cash flow. We're working with the Fontanini team now to finalize the plans and we think that the synergies will be gained very quickly.","Robert Moskow","Got you. Last question, you helped us shape a little bit fiscal '18 by segment Jim Snee. Are any of these segments do you look at vulnerable to declines in fiscal '18? It is one particular segment that might be more vulnerable than others?","I think the message was kind of like well, they could be flattish maybe with a little bit of upside I thought, but we've seen some unusual things happen across your business. So, I just want to know if there's one segment that appears more -- there is more that could go wrong I guess?","Jim Snee","Sure. Rob again I am going to qualify it by saying, I am not giving guidance into 2018, but we're clearly watching what's happening in the hog market in Refrigerated Foods and the volatility associated with that.","As Jim mentioned, Jim Sheehan mentioned, we know that there's additional capacity coming online and we're watching the three factors that we've talked about in the past; international demand, domestic demand and the corresponding capacity and where we sit right now after coming through the quarter, where four of our top seven inputs experience record prices because there was an adequate supply.","That additional capacity is certainly needed in the short term. So, these are unprecedented changes in the hog industry. We're watching them closely and so I think the answer to your question, we're watching Refrigerated as we head into 2018.","Robert Moskow","If I could, if there is more capacity coming online and international demand is really, really strong, is there enough hogs out there to meet it all? Like is there -- are you saying there is a risk that hog futures might spike.","Jim Sheehan","The interesting thing that has happened through the cycle is that hog costs have been very flat to last year. So, it looks like there is really a balance in the hog supply and the demand right now.","The other thing that we think is important to understand is that the groups that are bringing these processing plants online are in fact hog producers. So, we certainly feel that they believe that there is adequate hog supplies to fill their plants.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Farha Aslam with Stephens.","Farha Aslam","Hi. Good morning.","Jim Snee","Good morning, Farha.","Farha Aslam","It sounds like some of the disconnect between commodities and your margins is really on visibility. Could you share with us how you establish visibility into your commodity markets and what are you pricing policies overall on pricing?","Jim Snee","So Farha, I guess our approach to pricing, we are looking at commodity markets on a very regular basis. We certainly have forecast in place at the beginning of the year. We look at those throughout the year. That helps us not only set the pricing at the beginning of the year, but what we think it might look like through the course of the year.","From our perspective, the big disconnected in all of this is that we simply can't forecast record prices. We've taken the price action just as quickly as we could. We've priced these items to the peak of the market that we've seen and I would say, while the record high prices would be the disconnect, the connect would be that we have a proven ability to price in many market conditions and it's really that short term volatility that hurts us the most.","Jim Sheehan","As we gave guidance into the back half of the year, We predicted the trends, as Jim said, we didn't predict that they would hit record highs that we did not predict the velocity at which they would change. So, we saw the trends coming. We didn't see the magnitude and the speed in which we're seeing in the volatility of the markets at this level.","Farha Aslam","So as commodities moderate, because it looks like belly prices are starting to moderate, avocados should start to come down. Do you expect your margins to expand as you have pricing in place?","Jim Sheehan","Yeah certainly, that's why we're saying with the pricing taking hold in the back half of Q4 and then as I referenced, as I gave some color into our 2018 outlook, you're going to have grocery products that will benefit from the pricing that's in effect?","Farha Aslam","So that will be a positive for '18. That's helpful and then going into your Brazil acquisition, this is your first entry down in South America, it's rather small in scale. Do you have the distribution you need in the Brazilian market to get your products into retail and how quickly do you anticipate building scales down in South America?","Jim Sheehan","Sure. Well first Farha, now you have to believe me when I say the pipeline was full all those quarters right, we finally got a couple across the finish line. But yeah, you're correct. Ceratti is our first entry into South America. They're premium branded items and it's a niche portfolio that we know very well.","This is an established business and so they have distribution in the marketplace. They have a professional management team. It's an 85-year-old organization. So, as we look at it, yes from a $100 million perspective, you could say it's a small acquisition.","We look at it to say this is our first entry point into South America and we see this as a platform for future acquisitions in South America. Clearly there are some learnings that we need to obtain along the way and this is a tremendous vehicle, a successful vehicle for us to be able to achieve those.","Farha Aslam","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Ken Zaslow","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Jim Snee","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zaslow","I'm going to go at this a little differently. I get the commodity issues. I get the input cost, the pricing all that, but what I am not fully understanding is I get the sense that there is increasing execution issues and let me just kind of -- and that something I guess is more my surprise than anything else.","You got Applegate, you have CytoSport, you got China, help me understand how you're addressing the execution issue and why they have arisen and that's my first question and then I'll ask my follow-up.","Jim Snee","Sure. The way you described it Ken, probably the one that I would agree with you on is the CytoSport piece. We did give expectations of double-digit growth and to be fully transparent, we missed that one.","We're making some investments, got aggressive competition in that ready to drink C-store space and the results did not materialize the way we had anticipated. So, I would agree with you on that.","When you talk about Applegate, not much has changed from the last time we talked about it, but as part of Refrigerated Foods, clearly, clearly the driver was record prices for key inputs and so had we not experienced those record prices, especially in Refrigerated Foods we would've been fine in that space.","So, I certainly understand your commentary, but would say that the specialty area is the one where I can agree with you on.","Ken Zaslow","What about the China issue because in Shanghai you closed the facility. There is increasing cost relative to expectations. Again, I am not trying -- you go through a management change obviously at the senior level. There is a couple times that you've missed consensus -- expectation and again I get the belly prices, all the prices we all get.","But I feel like there is around the perimeter there seems to be more execution issues than I am used to over the last decade or so and I just didn't know if that's what you guys are seeing or it's just being exacerbated by the commodity outlook?","Jim Snee","I think that last part is right on Ken. I think given the exacerbation of the commodity markets combined with what's happening at jobs with historic issues there as well, the one part on the China piece was we're starting up a significant plant and yeah, we certainly had plan to have the Shanghai plant closed and items transitioned and it took us a little longer in terms of quarters not years.","And so, the cost spilled over and I appreciate your comment that the senior management team, but this is the same team that's been in place at very senior levels of our organization for the last five or 10 years and so I do think it is -- it's a situation that's exacerbated by the current market conditions and hopefully that helps with some color.","Ken Zaslow","Okay. And then my second question is the outlook for 2018, help me out a little bit, is it an earnings growth story or is it a rebasing of your earnings power and there is a big distinction between the two because now you're obviously taking your base down pretty considerably.","So is there a makeup in 2018 or you're just going to grow your five, ten that algorithm and again I'm looking for exact guidance, but I think there is a big difference between those two.","Jim Snee","Again, I agree with you Ken, there is a difference between the two and we're not in position at this point to give additional guidance. I gave obviously the color that hopefully is helpful. I guess some additional color around the fire and 10 which is repetitive to what we've discussed.","But clearly, we believe it's an all-in number, the 2% to 3% of organic topline growth that we've seen over the last several years, very achievable. Clearly, we need to leverage our balance sheet for accretive acquisitions for the other part of that five and 10.","We've demonstrated our ability to do that here recently. Jim talked about some of the strategic cost management, operational efficiencies, clearly gross margin improvements will help us get to that 10% bottom line and I do think of going back to some of our earlier conversations around these commodity markets, we've got a proven ability to price in these many market conditions and it's really that short term volatility.","So, I can't give you specific guidance, but hopefully the 2018 outlook color reminder on the five and 10 being a longer term all in number is helpful.","Ken Zaslow","So, the five and 10 is a long-term number that means that if you were under, you need to overachieve in some other distant year, is that fair?","Jim Snee","That's fair. Over time, you're current.","Ken Zaslow","All right. Thank you.","Jim Snee","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Benjamin Theurer with Barclays. Mr. Theurer. Your line is open. You may want to de-press your mute function.","Benjamin Theurer","Hello. Can you hear me?","Jim Snee","Yes, we can.","Benjamin Theurer","Okay. Kind of weird. Didn't work out. Sorry for that. I wanted to ask a question in regards to the Fontanini acquisition you've mentioned. So, I clearly get it that the CapEx benefit you have going forward, could you share a little bit more detail on the current profitability and what you think that business should be running up from an operating profit margin point of view?","Is a similar as what you're having in the two categories or is it a little lower and you believe that through the synergies you can get it to the same level? Thanks for sharing the sales number, but would be good to get also a little bit detail on operating more EBITDA level if you can share that, that would be much appreciated and I have one other follow-up question.","Jim Snee","Sure Benjamin. I guess the best answer I can give you on Fontanini is that the margins for the business are accretive to both Refrigerated Foods and the total company which is -- which obviously is a very good thing and just a reminder in our comments, we talked about it the $0.03 or $0.04 impact going forward.","Benjamin Theurer","Okay. And on the Brazilian acquisition, just to stick with the M&A business, so you've mentioned this is going to be basically a separated unit that's going to be completely separated run. Is that kind of business that you opportunistically purchase?","Clearly the price is a little lower as having like a foot in the country to potentially where you expand into future and if it's not working out, it's not that much of a cost associated, but how do we have to think about that tiny step into Brail which tends to likely be profiting and growing country and in coming years after two years of very tough economic environment. So that's to understand a little bit more of the strategic part behind that.","Jim Snee","Sure. So, this is a very strategic acquisition for us. It is not opportunistic. It provides a great opportunity for us, but it is very, very strategic. We've been working at acquiring this family-owned business for some time and those do take a little longer to get across the finish line.","We see this as a platform for future growth in Brazil. We continue to look for opportunities -- already looking for opportunities to expand. We've got a great professional management team that comes along with the Ceratti acquisition and it's a $100 million business but it's a very healthy $100 million business that's growing and will serve as a great platform for the future.","Jim Sheehan","One thing worth mentioning is that as we went into Brazil, we spent a great deal of time on due diligence and the deal also, the valuation of the deal will include a discount based on the country risk.","Benjamin Theurer","Okay. Perfect. That's much appreciated comment. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeremy Scott with Mizuho.","Jeremy Scott","Good morning.","Jim Snee","Good morning.","Jeremy Scott","So, the Refrigerated Foods margins, they came in actually nicely above where we were modeling and I was hoping if you could help break down some of the elements of the 230 Bps expansion year-on-year. The reason why I ask is, we were relatively clean comparison on core commodity margins outside of the trim pricing.","So, anything you can put a number on would be very helpful as we look to build out '18 and '19 and maybe starting with Farmer John. We've been modeling it is a 40 Bps to 50 Bps ongoing tailwind, but it was something little bit more in the quarter and then if there is a greater mix shift to Applegate, your value-add component, what will Fontanini build in '18, maybe just kind of help out with your core the 230 Bps you can break that down by peace would be very helpful.","Jim Snee","Okay. Jeremy, I think your assessment of Farmer John, there's I think dramatically difference there. Clearly the big driver for Refrigerated Foods is the improvements, the increases in the value-added sales and as we think about what's happened there, we've seen really a great performance in the quarter both in our meat products, which is our retail division across a number of different brands.","The foodservice business continues to outperform the industry and when we talk about the increases with BACON 1 and their portfolio, certainly those margins are accretive to the overall Refrigerated Foods organization.","So, it's the increase in value added, some of the mix shift even within the value-added and so again we remain very positive about the great work we're seeing in our Refrigerated Foods segment.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. And then maybe just keep -- talk a little about what was the core reason for the Muscle Milk softness? Is it strictly competitive issues or were there something else going on in the quarter whether the channel shift or maybe break that down a little bit for us?","Jim Snee","Sure. So, we talked about the channel and certainly it was primarily in ready to drink in the C-store and a year ago, would have been late summer, we had a voluntary recall on our ready to drink items and as we progressed at the end of 2016 and 2017, it's clear to us that we underestimated the impact of that voluntary recall.","So, we had some pipeline full fill, certainly some favorable comps that gave us a positive feeling about the business. What we've see most recently is some of the aggressive competition in the ready to drink C-store space, really exposed the business hadn\u2019t materialized the way we thought.","The bigger thing for us is now what are the actions that we're going to take in terms of giving that business additional promotional support, working very aggressively with our distribution partner to gain back any lost distribution and making sure that we're priced appropriately in key channels. So, a number of different things there and we've got work to do as we head into 2018 with that brand.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Jones with Vertical Group.","Heather Jones","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick questions, you mentioned I thought I caught a comment about pricing for the peak of these commodity input pressures and so like we've seen belly prices come down about 25%, pork trim is down about a third from its recent peak.","So, as we're thinking about the pricing actions and that you've taken, did you price assuming that bellies are going to go back to that $2 plus range and trim, how should we think about the magnitude of price?","Jim Snee","I think the key take away is we didn't think it was going to go up as fast as it did and so we didn't have a preconceived notion that it was going to moderate either. So, we priced it to the peak of the market. We know that obviously we work through some inventory, which takes longer in GP, our Grocery Products division than it does in some of the other divisions.","So that is the way that we thought about pricing is that we are priced to the peak of the market.","Heather Jones","Okay. And on the Turkey side, your volume declines, how much of that is purposeful declines to try to do your part to rightsize supply and demand and how much is related to the production issues that I don't know if you mentioned on this call, but I remember you mentioned on the Q2 call.","So just how we can think about purposeful versus just an effect of health issues or whatever?","Jim Sheehan","Yeah, I think from a business volume perspective, it was all purposeful, very intentional and that you can model that about a 7% decline.","Heather Jones","Okay. Thank you so much.","Jim Sheehan","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to talk through the Refrigerated Foods outlook and obviously you've been -- I've listened to everything you've said. We appreciate the color. I know it's hard to predict what's going to happen in an event like this, but even if the volume is there right, so if the demand is there for the plants to run, why wouldn't the profitability be lower?","So that's my question is would the processors are operating at three, four times normal profitability, so one would venture to say that okay, the demand there, they're going to operate the plants, but there's no way they're going to operate those plants at these profitability levels right.","It is inherent in your expectations that the cut-out margin will normalize, that's my main question really is. I get that the hogs that will come to market will get sorted and there is significant supply out there, but we're really talking about what's going to happen with the cut-out margin and how it will impact your numbers?","So is your expectation that cut-out margins will remain well above normal levels like they are now and then go ahead\u2026","Jim Sheehan","Well, as we discussed, what we focus on our hog cost, that our input cost primarily around bellies and 72% trim, we think the hogs will be slightly higher in the fourth quarter and even going into 2017. Bellies remain well above last year as freezer inventories are low and demand for bacon is very high. 72% trim is we expect to be above last year.","What we have seen again is this what seems to be very much a balance in the hog supply and demand that isn't driving up the cost of the hogs. What we said before is the additional capacity is a benefit to us and we continue to watch the international domestic demand and the additional capacity coming online. Based on our analysis, we believe that the additional capacity is needed.","Akshay Jagdale","Right. So, net, net you think that next year is a more or less favorable operating environment for Refrigerated Foods compared to what you've seen last couple of years?","Jim Sheehan","Well, we have the addition of Fontanini. We should be through the changes in the hog supply should be clear as the additional plants become online. Hopefully there's additional supply of the raw materials, so that there is not the type of volatility and spikes that we've seen in the bellies and the 72% trim.","Markets, bellies or beef excuse me, has been very hard to predict. So, I think the color that Jim gave you would be -- is what we feel about the Refrigerated Foods outlook for 2018.","Akshay Jagdale","Okay. And just to summarize everything you've talked about in terms of commodity prices. So, the best way to think about it is I guess that you've seen a significant rise, I think you have given some numbers around how much you buy in the open market.","But essentially the fourth quarter died down if I may is all related to the lag or significantly related to the lag between the commodity costs and the price pass through and that next year that will normalize, so you'll literally get that back right. It's not like you're just absorbing that. It's a timing issue and you get that margin back next year, but it's like a quarter and a half lag.","Jim Sheehan","Akshay, what I will tell you about Refrigerated Foods is historically and the way the business is structured, we do suffer on a short-term basis when we see spikes in commodity prices. It compresses our margins.","The velocity that occurred in this cycle, certainly added to that difficulty. But as prices decline, historically we expand our operating margins in Refrigerated Foods. We hate to say the cycle is a good thing, but in the long term, it would tell you that we will expand our operating margins as prices decline.","Akshay Jagdale","Perfect. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Snee for any additional or closing remarks.","Jim Snee","Well, thank you all very much for participating in our call this morning. There's no doubt this year has been challenging for us and I'm confident we are making the right long-term decisions to drive growth for our company while maintaining focus on delivering our key financial results.","Our team is working as hard as ever to continue our long-term growth story. On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you for joining us today.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

And welcome to the Hormel Foods Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, November 20, 2012.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Jones, Director of Investor Relations. Go ahead, sir.","Kevin C. Jones","Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Hormel Foods Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter of our Fiscal 2012. We released our results this morning before the market opened, around 6:30 a.m. Eastern Time. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at www.hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.","On our call today is Jeff Ettinger, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jody Feragen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jeff will provide a review of the operating results for the quarter and the year and our guidance for fiscal 2013; then, Jody will provide detailed financial results for the quarter and the year. The line will be open for questions following Jody's remarks. [Operator Instructions]","An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 10:30 a.m. Central Time today, November 20, 2012. The dial-in number is (800) 406-7325 and the access code is 4482517.

Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making.

It can be accessed on our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter. Earnings per share were $0.49, up 14% from a year ago, on sales of $2.2 billion, a 3% increase. As another example of our balanced business model in action, we generated segment profit and sales increases in 4 out of 5 segments.","For the full year, the company earned $1.86 per share, representing a 7% increase. We provided earnings guidance a year ago on this call wherein we said we would earn between $1.79 and $1.89 per share for the year, and I am pleased to report we finished in the upper half of that range. We also exceeded $8 billion in sales for the first time in company history, ultimately reaching $8.2 billion for the full year, up 4%.","I am also glad to announce that our team was successful in achieving the goal of $2 billion in sales of new products by 2012. All 5 of our segments made significant contributions to reaching this goal.","I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products group contributed significantly to our solid Q4 results, with segment profit up 22% and sales up 21%. You may recall that we began including sales of Don Miguel products in our Grocery Products results beginning in the third quarter of this year. Sales for Grocery Products in the quarter grew 3% excluding Don Miguel products.","For the year, segment operating profit was up 12% and sales were up 10%. Excluding the Don Miguel sales, sales were up 1% for the year.","Contributing to our sales growth in the quarter were our MegaMex Foods joint venture, our SPAM family of products, Hormel chili and Hormel bacon toppings. Strong sales of our SPAM family of products were propelled by our advertising campaign featuring Sir Can-A-Lot and the publicity around the 75th anniversary of this product.","In our MegaMex Foods business, sales gains were led by Herdez sauces and foods, Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dips and Don Miguel frozen and refrigerated products.","Sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals were somewhat soft in the quarter reflecting a shift in promotional timing. We remain confident that sales will resume growing in 2013 as we continue to rollout new products and support them with marketing efforts.","Our Refrigerated Foods segment profit declined 12%, with sales down 3%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was down 22% and sales increased 1%. Sales of our value-added products were not able to fully offset lower pork operating margins in the quarter. Spiking grain prices adversely impacted our costs for hogs sourced internally and those contracted under grain-based grow-out arrangements. Sales declined on flat volume due to lower commodity meat prices in the quarter.","Nonetheless, our Meat Products group had some solid sales performers in their product portfolio, led by Hormel pepperoni and party trays and Hormel Cure 81 premium hams. We were also pleased to see sales growth of our Hormel refrigerated entr\u00e9es in the quarter.","Our Foodservice group enjoyed nice contributions from its value-added products, led by sales of Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Hormel Always Tender prepared pork and premium bacon.","Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment completed a very strong year with a solid quarter. Both segment profit and sales were up 5% during the quarter. For the full year, segment profit was up 16% and sales increased 6%. Results of Jennie-O in Q4 were driven by continued growth in value-added sales and an improved product mix. These more than made up for higher feed costs and lower commodity meat prices during the quarter. Sales increased for Jennie-O in both retail and Foodservice value-added products, led by Jennie-O Turkey Store retail tray pack, turkey bacon and turkey burgers. Our third Make The Switch advertising campaign focused on our new turkey bacon and breakfast sausage.","Our Specialty Foods segment had another solid quarter, with a segment profit increase of 8% and a sales increase of 7%. Higher sales of canned meats, sauces and broths were the primary drivers of the positive results during the quarter. Full year results for Specialty Foods showed operating profit up 8% on 11% higher sales, with improved year-over-year results for 3 consecutive quarters.","Our International or All Other segment capped off an excellent year by posting another good quarter, with segment profit up 24% and sales up 1%. Strong export sales to Canada and lower costs for our SPAM family of products drove the positive results. Our China operations also continued to improve. For the full year, operating profit was up 38% and sales were up 7% for our international team.","Moving into fiscal 2013, we intend to again grow both sales and earnings. We expect our Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and International segments to contribute to the earnings growth. We expect our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment to register an earnings decline due to higher grain costs and tougher comparisons.","Headwinds to our outlook for 2013 include higher grain costs and volatile protein costs and processing margins. We plan on reducing our harvest levels in both our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Refrigerated Food segments by 1% to 2% in order to mitigate our exposure to these higher commodity costs. We will also continue to take strategic and modest price increases where we need them.","On the positive side, we continue to enjoy solid top line momentum, with a significant number of our important value-added franchises. For example, the continued strong sales growth of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack, turkey burgers and now turkey bacon should continue in 2013, fueled by our Make The Switch ad campaign and the trend toward eating more nutritious products.","Our Mexican food portfolio has begun to leverage its scale and our full range of product offerings in this fast-growing category. Our SPAM family of products has great momentum in both the U.S. and abroad. We look for continued strong contributions from Hormel pepperoni and Hormel party trays as snacking occasions continue to be a big part of the consumer eating landscape.","Hormel Compleats microwave meals should benefit from new products and refreshed advertising. These are just a few of the growth platforms that we believe will contribute to our success in 2013.","We believe our balanced model will continue to smooth out volatility in our earnings stream as evidenced by our track record of increased earnings in 27 of the last 30 years. We feel our innovation and strong brands in niche categories put us in a position to deliver strong results for years to come.","After taking into account all of these significant factors, we have established our fiscal 2013 earnings guidance range at $1.90 to $2 per share.","On previous calls, I said I would provide some added color with respect to operating margins in our Jennie-O Turkey Store and Grocery Products segments. For Jennie-O, we believe that a range of 11% to 15% can now be considered a normal range. For Grocery Products, given that we are including an increased level of sales by our MegaMex joint venture and recognizing only half of the profits, we believe that a range of 14% to 16% is now reasonable.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 totaled $132.6 million or $0.49 per share compared to $117.3 million or $0.43 a share a year ago. Net earnings for the full year totaled $500.1 million or $1.86 per share compared to net earnings of $474.2 million or $1.74 per share a year ago.","Dollar sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.2 billion compared to $2.1 billion last year, a 3% increase. For the full year, dollar sales were $8.2 billion, a 4% increase from last year.","Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, up 2% from fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, volume was 4.8 billion pounds, flat to last year.","As Jeff mentioned, a portion of our hog costs were directly impacted by rapidly escalating grain costs during the quarter. These include hogs sourced from our Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming sow operations and represent less than 20% of our total hog harvest.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 7.4% of sales, even with last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.4% of sales compared to 7.8% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7% and 7.5% of sales for next year.","Interest and investment income was $1.7 million for the fourth quarter compared to a loss of $3.3 million last year. Year-to-date, interest and investment income was $6.5 million compared to a loss of $786,000 a year ago. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $3.3 million last year. Year-to-date, interest expense was $12.9 million, down from $22.9 million last year due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for 2013.","Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33.1% versus 34.3% in fiscal 2011. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 33.4% compared to 33.3% last year. For fiscal 2013, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%.","Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 262.9 million and 263.5 million shares, respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 268.1 million and 268.9 million shares respectively. We repurchased 382,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, spending $10.7 million.","For the full year, we spent $61.4 million purchasing 2.1 million shares. We have 1.2 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.","We announced an $0.08 per share increase to the annual dividend, making the new dividend $0.68. This represents a 13% increase on top of an 18% increase last year and marks the 47th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend rate.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $30.9 million compared to $31.2 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $119 million compared to $124 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $120 million in fiscal 2013. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $38 million compared to $41 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $132 million compared with $97 million last year. For fiscal 2013, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million to $140 million.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Farha Aslam.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","In Refrigerated Foods, I was surprised by your commentary in hogs. Could you just review kind of what percentage of hogs, I think, it's 11% you sourced internally? And just provide us some color on the grain contracts, in terms of how you source your hogs. I didn't understand that completely.","Jody H. Feragen","Well, let me take a stab at that one, Farha. This is Jody. We have less than 20% of our hogs that have some type of grain impact. Most of those are sourced from the sow operations that we have in Colorado, Wyoming and Arizona. A large portion of them go to our Farmer John operation and the balance of them go to the Midwest to be finished. And we take responsibility for the cost of finishing those hogs.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on cash. I mean, you have net cash on the balance sheet. Could you share with us kind of your priorities for that cash? How does the M&A environment look? Are you looking more domestically, internationally, and how that relates to share repurchase?","Jody H. Feragen","I'm becoming a broken record. We certainly do look for opportunities to invest either organically, and we've made some nice investments in capital projects within the company this year. And we also look for acquisitions that meet our strategic initiatives. And we continue to look at those. There's also returning to our shareholders. We increased our dividend this year on top of an increase over the last few years that have been pretty robust, and then we look for share repurchase.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with the Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The guidance that you're laying out is a little bit less than your growth rate over your long term as well as last year. I was wondering if you could talk to the point of is there something that might be slowing down? Obviously, the grain costs, I get that. But is there something that's structural that may be slowing down your growth rate? Have you reached a certain size that maybe the growth rate historically may not be as applicable going forward? And can you just talk about that as a longer-term thought process?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure, Ken. It's a very fair question. No, we really don't think we've slowed down. We recognize that both the results we just completed in 2012 and the guidance range that we provided you for 2013 are below our long-term 10% bottom line growth algorithm. If you look at the 3 years prior to that, we were well into the teens. So there is a little bit of an ebb and flow going on. And to us really, a lot of it really does relate back to the grain and the input costs. We've -- our team's done a good job at mitigating a lot of those costs. They've taken pricing where they've had to, but it's been an environment where that's kind of been a nonstop effort for the last couple of years and will continue into 2013. The underlying health of the franchises, though, to me is very robust. And so I'm quite optimistic that our long-term goals remain very reachable, even at the current size we are as a company, having now reached $8 billion.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then can you talk about certain brands that have actually gained more momentum than you expected through the quarter? Are there certain things that -- certain brands that on the top line you're looking forward to having a little bit more greater penetration going forward?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. I don't know that there's -- they're necessarily surprises to what we expected, but we have a lot of brands that are really doing quite well and enjoyed very solid quarters. In many cases, these were double-digit increases. So on the Refrigerated Foods side, you have Hormel pepperoni and party trays. We have convenience bacon. We have our relaunch of our Cure 81 hams. We also enjoyed good sales growth of our entr\u00e9es. On the Grocery side, SPAM had a great quarter, bacon bits. The Mexican portfolio is doing very well across the board, a 5% increase not counting Don Miguel, not counting the Wholly franchise, and those are both growing as well. Our Foodservice group is having good luck. They've had their most successful new product launch in their history with one of their new premium bacon items, and they continue to also grow within their ethnic items, such as Caf\u00e9 H and their Natural Choice-based items. Jennie-O had solid double-digit growth in fresh tray pack and burgers and in bacon, the latter supported by their ad campaign. So we're really excited, and that's not counting International either which has delivered 2 terrific years in a row. We're growing the SPAM franchise and we're growing other pork-based items in various markets, particularly in Asia. So we're really -- from a top line standpoint, we're very excited about what's going on in the company.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey with D.A. Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Jeff, you laid out the normalized EBIT margin for Jennie-O Turkey Store at 11% to 13%. Did you -- if you said, I missed it, but did you say if you thought fiscal '13 would fall in the normalized range or be below the normalized range or...","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. The range I attempted to say was 11% to 15%.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Oh, 15%. I'm sorry, I misheard you.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, that's okay. And then yes, we do expect Jennie-O to fall within that range. We do expect some reversion back more to the middle of the range. They had achieved at the very high end during fiscal 2012, but that -- we do think they will perform within that new range.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And I guess one of the things I continue to struggle with is if that business did a 6.2% margin in fiscal '08 and there have not been structural changes, at least in terms of acquisitions and so on in the intervening time, what is it about the business -- and it was, I guess, sometime in the last 10 years, there was a 3% margin in that business. What is it about that business or the change in that business that makes you comfortable with saying that the long-term margin range is 11% to 15%?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure, 2 main areas. So one on the cost side; the team has done a number of things to improve their overall sustainable cost position. We recognize that when you invest in a vertical system, I mean you're putting a lot of capital out there and that puts the burden on you to deliver that. But they've done a wonderful job, whether it's the hatchery levels, the feed mills, the farms, the basic processing facilities. That's one of the advantages of that acquisition that keeps playing out, although we recognize the acquisition itself was a number of years ago, but you continue to find benefits as time goes on. And so we do feel we've lowered our systemic kind of cost per pound, cost per employee. We did an Investor Day presentation a year ago. I know the head of operations showed the year-over-year kind of sale -- the employee count decline versus an increase in sales. So that's again something that we do believe is sustainable. And then on -- the key part has been on the value-added sales side. We made major investments in advertising, took a little bit of a gamble on that, in a category where no one else was advertising. And it's driven just big-time double-digit increases in key franchises that are margin accretive to the overall average of the company. And we now have just really nice outposts for those key products in retailers throughout the grocery store. And as I just mentioned, again, I mean, the most recent quarter, again they were all up double digits, a lot of those key franchises. So we think that momentum is sustainable as well. And so those are the 2 major components. And then we also talked about our production cut again this year; that's on top of our production cut the year before. We've been very disciplined about making sure that we're only creating meat that's going to support our value-added items. We're not looking to be a big player in the commodity meat side. So those are the key elements to the Jennie-O story right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess 2 questions. Did you give any guidance for the dollar amount of grain cost inflation that you expect for fiscal '13 in turkey? And then secondly, in Refrigerated Foods, how will you work through what is likely to be a more inflationary environment, especially in the back half, on pork-related meat products? The futures market indicates that hog prices are going to go up. Do you expect to have to raise prices on sliced meats and any other of the value-added items?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. On the first question, I mean, it's hard to get very precise about it. I can give you a ballpark of $50 million to $100 million. It obviously depends some on hedge positions and other things going on. But clearly, when you look at what the core grains have gone up post drought, I mean, it's certainly a significant amount of money. On your second question -- well, I mean, let me finish on the first question because it kind of ties in terms of pricing. So the Jennie-O team, since it's a vertically integrated operation, already has those costs coming at them. And so they've announced price increases on many of their portfolio items in Foodservice deli and retail already to the trade. In terms of the Hormel side of the equation, so more of the beef- and pork-based items, we're seeing the same thing you are, which is that there's certainly a possibility of cost increases in the second half of the year. They're not here yet, so we're not announcing current pricing actions on those items. But we're going to watch them closely. And so that may well be something that the team has to have as part of their reactions during the second half of the year. But we have been taking pricing in past years here and, by and large, with our #1, #2 position brands in most of our categories, we've been able to take them and sustain our share positions.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jeff, do you think your pricing decisions will depend more on the level of inflation or what your competition does, if they decide not to raise, maybe you'll hold off, or is it just kind of like a combination per category and depends on the situation?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, in most of our categories where we have the leading share, we often then view that comes with the mantle of having to push pricing to where it belongs in order to sustain the system in the long run to be able to support it with consumer advertising and the right promotions in store and so forth. There are some isolated categories where we're more the #2, or even in a couple of cases, the #3 player. In those cases, you may -- you probably do watch your competition a little bit more to see what they do in the category, but that would be the minority of the different franchises that I've cited thus far this morning.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about your comments that you made about the production levels. I think it's fairly clear in jobs what you're talking about. But I just -- I was unclear when you say 1% to 2% reduction in the pork business. Is that total slaughter or is that just in the amount of hogs you expect to raise, fiscal '13 versus fiscal '12?","Jody H. Feragen","Diane, that would have been in our total harvest numbers.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And then I guess did you have any commentary about what you'd expect your grain cost to be year-on-year?","Jody H. Feragen","I mean Jeff threw out the $50 million to $100 million on the Jennie-O side of the business. It's obviously a lot less on the Refrigerated side.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you just -- any commentary on what you're seeing from Foodservice? Here, I'm really talking about just general industry trends. I know you tend to do better than the industry or better than some of your competitors, but can you just talk about what you're hearing from your customers about things like foot traffic, et cetera?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. The image I'm picturing is sputtering, but that's more negative than I want to really get across because it's not like it's not moving forward. But it's -- it does seem like every time the industry gets a couple of months where, boy, okay, they seem to have turned the corner and it's solidly doing well, either they get hit with a gas price increase or a food cost increase or some sort of change in consumer behavior. And so it's not just a steady robust environment out there. Overall, though, it's certainly better than the early part of the recession. I think the industry would say overall that they're seeing positive trends. And then we've had, as you mentioned, better results than that with our strategy of providing value-added items with an emphasis on the noncommercial segment, as well as the commercial.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Do you think that, that will improve in 2013? Here I'm just talking calendar because it just seems like we have so much -- we kind of came off the election thinking, okay, now that's done, and we can kind of move on. But it just seems like sentiment hasn't really picked up because of all of the issues with regard to the fiscal cliff and the Middle East and Europe and et cetera.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, we're expecting a solid year out of our Foodservice group, and they feel they have enough good initiatives going on with their key partners that they should see that kind of growth and be able to help drive that kind of growth for many of the operators. In the aggregate, I think it does seem like kind of modest optimism is the word of the day.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question, just a follow-up on Diane's. Have you seen -- you play both in the perimeter of the store and the center of the store. Have you seen any shift from the consumer back into the center of the store? There was a large publicly traded company that said they saw that recently. So I'm wondering if any movement that you're seeing back into the center of the store at all.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I would say our numbers definitely support that. I mean we saw sluggishness with some of our center of the store grocery categories for Q1 and into Q2 a little bit. But as we finished the year off, a lot more of them are on the upswing right now. So yes, I would agree with that.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And why -- what do you think is driving that, just to get a sense of how sustainable that could be?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, I mean we talked on the prior calls about why it was down before and people had different theories. We think with some of the price increases, that made it more difficult to hit some of the promoted prices that in the past had driven sort of the 10 for 10s or some of the hotter deals. For our business, especially when you look at franchises like chili and stew back in the winter months, we do feel the more benign winter that occurred in 2012 versus quite a cold winter in 2011 played into those comps. And so as we move through the year, that became a nonfactor. I don't know, that could be helping the comps as well.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I can just on Jennie-O Turkey, I mean truly impressive what you're guiding to in light of what's happened with the commodity, meaning grains. So my guess is a lot of it had to do with the mix improvement value-added and the type of margins that you're getting on that product. So first, can you just give us an update on where you are, percentage of value-added versus other? And second, as it relates to Refrigerated Foods, I mean why isn't a move like that possible on Refrigerated Foods, like why can't you margin up that business? I know it's probably a pretty complicated answer, but I'm just trying to get your thoughts on that.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. First, in terms of the Jennie-O and the percent, the percent itself of what we count as value-added hasn't changed dramatically. We've been on a dollar sales basis in that kind of mid to high 70% range for a time. But we always talk about the value ladder and the different steps. And we clearly have moved up a lot of the franchise into higher-level products. So we're in fewer categories and are relying less on the categories where there's 7 or 8 different competitors and the products are relatively non-differentiated. And instead, we're pushing it into innovative items, items where our brand really plays a major role. And so that has been the bigger upgrade at Jennie-O. In terms of Refrigerated, I think the general theme of your question I would agree with. I mean, it clearly is a work in process in that regard. Their operating margins are more on the 5% to 7% range today. They have -- in the basic pork business, although there's a lot of the commodity elements that pull that down somewhat, some of the more market-based products such as fresh pork or raw bacon are also not huge margin contributors. But we do believe that team over time, as they continue to develop and move themselves up that value ladder in the Foodservice and meat products area ought to be able to migrate those margins upward. And we think that's one of the stronger opportunities long term for the company.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask you about innovation and are you changing where you focus that? Will it be across the portfolio and then also, as innovation relates to the Compleats line of business?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. Well, really all of our teams kind of understand the company mission of seeking to grow 5% top line, 10% bottom line. And, clearly, innovation is one of the sources that they're all going to be utilizing to achieve that growth. They've each had wonderful successes that led to our achievement of the $2 billion challenge. We have platforms in various segments now that are $50 million to $100 million, in some cases larger than that, that weren't in existence in the year 2000 that are now really strong key figures for us. Natural Choice, party trays, the refrigerated entr\u00e9es, our Di Lusso Deli Company product lines, on the Grocery side, the newer Compleats items, Jennie-O's newer versions of burgers and ground tray pack products, so -- and then the International teams had some as well. So it's going to be a key driver for us going forward. In terms of Compleats specifically, absolutely, we rolled out at Investor Day about 1.5 years ago the new color scheme and the fact that we're going to have marked [ph] Cafe Creations blue line of Compleats and a relaunch of the green line, the more health-oriented items within the line. This fall has now seen the introduction of what we're calling our cheesy pasta type items. So mac and cheese and then other items that utilize the new technology that we put in place in our Dubuque, Iowa plant to really upgrade the quality of those items. They will be a feature of our advertising campaign in 2013 for the Hormel Compleats brand. And so that we're -- and our early read on the sales results is quite strong. So definitely innovation is going to play a role for Compleats and that microwave meal segment as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up a little bit on your discussion at Jennie-O, Jeff. I mean, I get everything that Hormel has done to improve internally the margin structure of Jennie-O, both in terms of product mix and discipline around volume, and that's been great. I guess what I'm surprised at and surprised positively at is the level of discipline the rest of the industry has exercised in the face of the stimulus of having enormous profits in this business by historical standards. Do you get the sense others in the industry have adopted your strategy, discipline towards -- and there's just a lot less commodity product out there? And, I mean, what explains that there hasn't been -- what are you seeing on the competitive landscape pricing-wise that sort of gives you confidence that the 11% to 15% can stick?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. Oh gosh, on industry discipline, I mean everybody makes their own decisions. We, obviously, announced our decision here again today in terms of making sure we keep our production levels tight. We know of at least one expansion going on in the industry that's been announced in terms of a new plant complex going up in the Indiana area that's going to be late '13, early '14. But otherwise, we haven't seen a lot of expansion which probably makes sense given the drought and the grain pressures that a lot of the entities are under. In terms of being able to lead in price, I mean, we do think having the leading brand, the one that's supported in the marketplace and that consumers have a significant demand for, does provide us with an ability to take that leadership position in that area. We're looking forward to the year where we don't have to deal with a $1 or $2 bushel grain increase and that the team can just run with the wonderful portfolio they have. But we'll play the cards that are dealt this year. They'll deal with the cost increases that are coming. But they really do have excellent momentum in terms of covering down their other costs and in terms of their value-added franchises.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Eric Larson with CL King.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Jeff, just a follow-up question on how we should kind of look at your overall corporate volume growth. You've got the dynamics in turkey where you've got -- you're holding capacity tight but you've got a very positive mix in value-add. And each one of your divisions has the various different components of that. How should we look at what your overall volume growth for the company is going to look? And what should that average over time? I mean, sometimes if you don't have any volume growth, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a -- it's bad. It's just that your mix has changed so much. So how should we look at volume growth for Hormel on average over time?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","That's a fair question, Eric. We'll probably not see it this year with -- based on the production cuts and having less commodity meat to sell in both the Refrigerated and Jennie-O side. But I would think over time, looking at a 2% to 3% in terms of volumes would be the right mix to get us to the 5% ultimately in sales, with the rest coming mostly from mix enhancement as we roll out more value-added items. It further can be a little bit of a hard read in this environment where there are certain cases with value-added items where we've chosen, in lieu of a pricing action, to change packaging size. And so that holds your volume down, but ultimately, is the right thing to do with that franchise. But I cited a number of the brand-by-brand examples to one of the earlier questions. And in those cases, all those items I was citing, had very solid volume number increases, in addition to net sales increases. So it's not just the price increases that we're registering in terms of the unit growth.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And when you look at your various divisions, which ones would you characterize would have the potential for better volume growth overall relative to the corporate average?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, Grocery Products clearly, and especially in the shorter run here with the advent of MegaMex and we're bringing on -- Don Miguel effect hit part of 2012, but will also have a lapping effect here in 2013 where the first half of the year will, once again, have new sales that don't have a comparison. But beyond that, I mean, between the Mexican franchise and the Compleats franchise, we really have a lot of optimism for Grocery Products. Our International division ended up the year kind of slow on the reflected sales standpoint, but their underlying franchises are quite strong. And so I'm optimistic that they're going to be delivering growth that's above our 5% levels as well on the top line.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it appears there are no further questions, sir, so please continue.","Kevin C.

Good morning everyone. We are pleased to announce our full year and fourth quarter results. For the year three of our five segments Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods and International, delivered record earnings in spite of one last week than 2016. These three segments also delivered exceptionally strong organic sales growth. The growth in these segments offset declines at Jennie-O Turkey Store and Specialty Foods, allowing the total company to achieve organic volume and sales growth in 2017.","In spite of a volatile commodity market environment, we delivered a quarter of strong organic volume and sales growth. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.41 in line with our most recent guidance. The fourth quarter was marked by many bright spots, Grocery Products delivered excellent earnings growth, our Grocery Products team continues to do an outstanding job growing iconic brands in the center store such as SPAM and Dinty Moore, while simultaneously capitalizing on pockets of growth and dynamic on trend categories with brands like Wholly Guacamole and Herdez.","SPAM was a strong contributor to international sales growth in addition to the inclusion of the Ceratti business for our international team. Our China business experienced strong sales and earnings from SKIPPY peanut butter and our branded meat products. The new Jiaxing client is producing and shipping products while the Shanghai facility has stopped production. Our current manufacturing operations in China now include Beijing, Jiaxing and our SKIPPY plant in Weifang. ","Refrigerated Foods delivered results in line with our expectations. Organic sales growth was driven by food service sales of Hormel BACON 1, fully cooked bacon and Hormel Pepperoni. In addition to retail sales of BLACK LABEL bacon, NATURAL CHOICE products and CURE 01hams. Earnings in Refrigerated Foods were down due to the divestiture of Farmer John and favorable markets last year.","The story of Jenny-O Turkey Store is very similar to what we communicated to you on the third quarter call. The Turkey market continues to be in an oversupply situation. Lower whole bird and commodity pricing was the key driver to lower sales and earnings this quarter. In spite of these difficult market conditions, Jennie-O Lean Ground Turkey continues to show growth and take share from ground beef.","The results from specialty products are disappointing and driven by lower sales of Muscle Milk ready-to-drink protein beverages in the convenience store channel. The new leadership team at CytoSport is making the necessary adjustments to gain back ground from the setback they had this year.","One key theme from this year is the impact record input prices had on our business. For some markets such as bellies and beef trim prices increased rapidly, but also decreased rapidly. Other markets such as Turkey breast dropped further and faster than anticipated and remain at depressed levels. Our sales and marketing teams continue to be diligent in their assessments and response to the cost volatility while finding ways to mitigate it.","Overall, this year has been challenging and did not meet the expectations we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. However, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the intentional balance that we create in all areas of our business. Even with the disappointing year we had in the specialty foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store, we still delivered record operating margin, record operating cash flow, returned a record amount of cash back to shareholders and increased our cash balance.","Looking to 2018 we will continue to follow our path forward that I laid out at our Investor Day in June. First, we\u2019ll continue to evolve to a broader food company. The Columbus acquisition broadens our portfolio as we expand into a total deli provider and enhance our position in this advantage growth space.","Second, expand and accelerate food service with the acquisition of Fontanini we will continue to aggressively grow our competitively advantage food service business.","Third, become a more global food company. We are excited for the Ceratti acquisition in Brazil and our new plant in China. Both strategic investments will allow international to deliver above average growth this year.","Fourth, reduce volatility and increase balance. We continue to increase the sales of value added products as a percentage of our total sales and we've complemented that growth with the acquisitions of purely value added businesses such as Fontanini, Ceratti and Columbus.","Fifth, divest non-strategic assets. We will continue to take a hard look at all underperforming assets and if necessary make the difficult decisions required to ensure we are delivering shareholder value.","And finally, modernizing our supply chain. Today we announced a reorganization of our supply chain. Glenn Leitch, who led Jennie-O Turkey Store to outstanding growth for the past seven years will now become Executive Vice President of Supply Chain. Glenn will be responsible for the entire supply chain from procurement to shipment. I would refer you to the separate press release for all the other details related to the reorganization.","Overall, headwinds to our outlook in two 2018 include volatile commodity markets, a slower than expected recovery in the turkey industry and uncertainty in the hog and pork markets. The tailwinds in our business are clear. In addition to the solid fundamentals that will provide stronger organic growth, we have three new strategic acquisitions, numerous strategic investments and value added capacity and an innovation pipeline full of exciting new products.","Our focus on innovation has never been stronger as evidenced by the substantial progress we made towards our 15% innovation by 2020 goal. As of the end of 2017, 14% of our total company sales came from products innovated in the last five years. Key products contributing to this growth include BACON 1, SKIPPY\u00aePB BITES and HERDEZ guacamole salsa. Our current pipeline of new products is deep and our innovation teams are thinking of new and interesting ways to get products to the market faster, with more scale and in a more cost efficient manner.","The headline for 2018 will read strong value-added growth and strategic acquisitions more than offset commodity headwinds. Looking at the segments for 2018, we expect Jennie-O Turkey Store to continue to navigate difficult industry conditions, while the remaining segments will provide earnings growth. We expect modest earnings declines for the full year at Jennie-O Turkey Store. Earnings decreases in the first half will not be fully offset by increases in the back half as turkey market moves towards a slow recovery.","We expect continued value added sales and volume growth led by Lean Ground Turkey, Oven Ready products and Turkey Burgers. We plan to be back on air with the Make The Switch media campaign in 2018. Despite the disparity of views in the hog industry, the fundamentals of refrigerated food have never been better. While we anticipate a reduction in the commodity profits and refrigerated foods we expect continued growth in our value added businesses to more than offset the declines.","Again this year, we expect the Hormel food service team to deliver industry leading results and the addition of Fontanini has put them in a great position to continue that trend. We also expect a solid year of growth from meat products. Once finalized, the acquisition of Columbus will help Refrigerated Foods deliver earnings growth in 2018.","This morning we also announced a union of the grocery products and specialty foods segments. Both organizations sell shelf-stable products, have a focus on the food, drug, mass and club channels; and are charged with managing CPG brands. Luis Marconi who currently leads Grocery Products will continue to lead this segment.","Combined this segment will be a model for how to manage iconic brands such as SPAM and SKIPPY while nurturing the growth of fast growing franchises like Wholly Guacamole, Justin's and CytoSport. Over time, consolidating these two segments will deliver revenue and cost synergies in all aspects of the business, while continuing to deliver industry leading growth. For 2018 specifically, we expect sales and earnings growth to be driven by our MegaMex line of products, Skippy and Justin's nut butters, as well as improvement in our CytoSport business.","International will have a strong year benefiting from the acquisition of Ceratti in addition to strong results from our China business. After taking into account all these factors we are setting our fiscal 2018 sales guidance at $9.4 billion to $9.8 billion and our earnings per share guidance at a $1.60 to a $1.70 per share. This guidance excludes the Columbus acquisition. Consistent with the acquisition announcement, we expect Columbus to be $0.02 to $0.03 accretive to earnings in 2018. I'm excited to close the Columbus acquisition and start the consolidation of our deli businesses. We expect to close the deal in December.","Our first quarter comparison will be a difficult one as we annualized this divestiture of the Farmer John business and continue to manage through the oversupply in the turkey industry. Our planned show sales and earnings growth weighted towards the second half of the year aided by acquisitions, innovation and cost reductions and improvements in the turkey market.","At this time I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and key assumptions for 2018.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you Jim. Good morning everyone. Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, a 10% decrease, compared to last year. Organic volume increased 2%. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.5 billion a 5% decrease. Organic net sales increased 5%.","Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $218 million, down 11% compared to last year. General corporate expenses were lower due to the focus on strategic cost management and lower employee related expenses. Advertising expense was $30 million compared to $55 million in 2016. We plan to increase advertising by 20% in 2018.","Excluding advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses were 6.6% of sales, compared to 7.2% of sales last year.","Deal cost associated with the Ceratti and Fontanini acquisitions were approximately $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter.","Operating margins were 13.2%, a 70 basis point decrease, compared to last year. For the full year, operating margins were 14%, 10 basis points higher than 2016. We are maintaining our goal to be in the top quartile of our peer group in operating margins by 2020. Today the top quartile trial range is 16% to 20%. We plan to attain this goal through a focus on strategic cost management, acquisitions, innovation and by investing capital into high margin products such as BACON 1 and SPAM production in China.","Our effective tax rate was 33.8%, compared to 33.1% last year. In 2018 we are expecting our full year tax rate to be between 32.3% and 33.3%.","Starting in the first quarter, we will adopt the new accounting standards related to stock compensation. This is expected to benefit our effective tax rate in 2018 by approximately 100 basis points and increase earnings per share by approximately $0.02. The adoption of the standard will increase quarterly tax rate volatility. We generated record cash flow from operations of $499 million, up 34% from $371 million last year. The increase was primarily related to decreases in working capital.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $103 million, compared to $90 million last year. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $425 million in 2018. The higher level of capital is driven by the investment into additional capacity for high-margin products and projects to improve manufacturing efficiencies. They include the expansion of baking capacity, modernization of the Austin plant and replacement of the Melrose plant.","We paid our 357th consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15, at an annual rate of $0.68 per share. This morning we also announced a 10% increase to our dividend. The effective annual rate will be $0.75 per share. This is our 52nd consecutive year we have increased the dividend and the 9th consecutive year we have increased the dividend by a double digit rate.","We repaid the debt associated with the Fontanini and Ceratti acquisition ending the year with $250 million in long-term debt, unchanged from 2016. After the Columbus transaction closes we expect our total debt to be approximately $1 billion. We remain in a strong financial position to fund any other capital needs.","We did not repurchase stock in this quarter. We will continue to repurchase stock to set dilution from option exercises based on our internal evaluation of the stock. Input cost for the quarter were generally higher with the exception of the turkey markets.","Hog prices in the fourth quarter were a 11% higher than last year. Prices last year reach multi-year lows. As Jim mentioned, there are conflicting viewpoints on the hog and pork industry. Hog price forecasts for calendar 2018 vary from high-single-digit decreases to mid-single-digit increases. Our expectation is for a low-single-digit increase in calendar year 2018.","We expect earnings pressure in Refrigerated Foods during the first quarter due to the high cost compared to the unusually low cost last year. We continue to focus on three factors, domestic demand, export demand and industry capacity utilization. With the consumer trends moving towards increased protein consumption domestic demand remains very strong. The USDA cut out was 5% higher than last year for the fourth quarter.","Export demand continues to be strong the USDA forecast for exports to be up 7% in 2017 and up another 6% in 2018. Hog supplies are expected to increase 3% to 4% next year. We continue to believe hog supplies are well-matched to industry capacity over the long-term. However, we do expect short term volatility depended on the progress of the new plants ramping it up to full production.","We continue to assess the industry conditions and will make the necessary changes to ensure we are sourcing pork for our value added products at the lowest possible cost. In 2017 our commodity profits were slightly above average based on our market assumptions we expect commodity profits to be moderately below average in 2018. In 2018 we intend to reduce our hog harvest capacity by approximately 4%. If market conditions change we have the flexibility to adjust harvest levels.","Belly prices remain volatile. Markets declined in the fourth quarter, but we're 25% higher than last year. We expect belly prices to remain volatile and in line with 2017. 72% pork trim prices were 15% above last year, we expect trim markets to be flat to 2017. 50% trim was 25% higher for the quarter. We expect beef prices to be flat to 2017 but higher in the first quarter. Beef costs we're lower compared to last year, we expect beef cost to be flat to last year.","Turkey commodity prices remain at seven-year lows. Breast meat prices were 28% below last year. We have not seen the reduction to pull placements required to alleviate the oversupply condition. Cold storage remains that elevated levels. Turkey breast inventories are 17% above last year, while whole birds were 23% above last year. Based on the lack of meaningful production declines at high levels of inventory, we do not expect material changes in markets until the back half of the year. Our expectation is Jennie-O first half profits will be below 2017.","We have made good initial progress on the financial strategy I laid out at Investor Day. These include reducing our general corporate expenses, improving our cash cycle and leveraging our balance sheet for growth.","At this time I'll turn the call over to the operator for the portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc.","Farha Aslam","Hi good morning.","Jim Snee","Good morning Farha.","Farha Aslam","Can you talk about Glenn Leitch's new role at the company? And how you look at your production facilities right now? And in particular, how you expect the Chinese plant to benefit earnings for next year?","Jim Snee","Sure. So let's start with the new supply chain organization. What this is going to do for us is it's really going to give us better alignment across our entire organization. Today we have our operations that exist in our business units. And I would say that they're probably a bit fragmented. They're very successful but a bit fragmented, which really it inherently allows for duplications and inefficiencies.","And so we believe that having this alignment across the organization and getting the structure and process right will allow us to become more cost effective, enhance our speed to market and really make us more agile over time, as we've \u2013 we're facing ever-changing, very dynamic market conditions. S I mean we believe this is a great move for our organization, it's consistent, very thoughtful with how we've been talking about our business and the needs to do this.","In regards to China the new facility is going to help us in a couple of ways. And we were at capacity on a number of different lines because of the successful business we have in the food service segment. The other part that is going to do when it's more of a slower build is for the first time ever, we have in-country production of SPAM. And so when now that line is up and running, we've already seen some nice early success and are rapidly regaining distribution because we have been in-market with that product before. But really feel like not only operationally but structurally, we are set of for long-term success in China.","Farha Aslam","That\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, you highlighted variable commodity markets in 2018. Could you talk about Hormel's ability and experience to price for those fluctuations? And how retailers and consumers are accepting those prices?","Jim Snee","Sure. I think we've demonstrated a track record of success when it comes to dealing with price increases. And a lot of that has to do with the brand positioning, delivering on the brand promise, but then also being a brand leader. And so given the strong brand presence that we have across our organization with so many number one and number two brands, we are able to successfully get those through. I would not say that it's easy, I mean, we take all price increases very seriously, and we work with all of our retail customers to make sure that we have got the best outcome for both of us.","The other thing I would say, Farhat, is clearly, we understand the data and the insights around price elasticity and built that into our modeling as well. So I feel like we're pretty sophisticated and successful in that area.","Farha Aslam","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","Yes thanks. Good morning everyone.","Jim Snee","Hi Adam.","Adam Samuelson","So I guess maybe some clarifying questions on the guidance where you laid out 160, 170 range. From the Fontanini and Ceratti deals there\u2019s $0.04 to $0.05 of accretion. Do you think in the prepared remarks you alluded to a $0.05 tailwind on tax from the accounting change. And in the International segment, you should have the new plant up and running. And in fiscal 2017 you are absorbing cost as that started up and had some construction delays.","And I guess, maybe there's a bit high accrual for incentive comp in the 2018 outlook, but I guess, if I put those kind of discrete factors to the side, I'm at the middle to upper end of your range on an organic basis for profit. And so is that the right characterization that the sum of grocery, refrigerated, Jennie-O and specialty profits are kind of in the middle to upper part of your range, flat net, am I doing that math right?","Jim Snee","Yes, Adam you are. I mean, I think, if we go back to the headline I described in my comments is that the growth in our value-added business is going to offset some of the commodity volatility that we expect. And so if you go around really the business units, and I'll, \u2013 I mean, we have merged Grocery Products and specialty together, but just to help you with some clarity in that area, I mean, Grocery Products is going to be in line with the growth expectations that we have for that business. And quite frankly, specialty will have the same growth algorithm that we've talked about at CytoSport. We expect a return to growth in CytoSport.","Refrigerated Foods is going to have low-single-digit growth in both sales and earnings. And International, you have assessed properly with strong double-digit growth and then John's will have low-single digit sales growth but really down mid-single digit from an earnings perspective because of the market conditions.","So I think your rollup is fairly accurate getting to that range.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. And then so maybe putting some finer point on refrigerated and Jennie-O, is there any way to maybe dimensionalize kind of the range of outcomes as you think of the key variables as you sit here today, is it for Parker margins for refrigerated, is it belly price volatility? And then in Jennie-O, kind of some of the supply factors that you would be looking at to make for a better, stronger, I presume, second half is probably the bigger I'd note at this plant.","Jim Sheehan","Certainly. Good morning Adam, this is Jim Sheehan. I\u2019ll talk a talk about some of the variables. The first thing is that there are very differing views about what's going to happen in the pork industry. Hog prices \u2013 forecast for hog prices are everything from down high single digits to up mid-single digits. We think we have taken a realistic view and we've identified our model on low single digits for the outlook. Now what is involved in that is that we're going to \u2013 we expect to see some volatility. Volatility as these playups ramp.","Now in the first quarter, the cost of hogs were at $57 so far. I think it's important to understand that the five-year average in the first quarter is $75. And if you exclude the impact of the PEDV, those costs were at $70. So they're still below historical levels. But we had unseasonably low hog cost in the first quarter of 2007 \u2013 part of 2016, excuse me. And so we expect that we will be up against that as we go into 2018. So we have an unfavorable comparison for the first quarter of 2018.","On the turkey side, I think, we\u2019ve tried to be clear on what we're watching. We're watching the poult placements and we're watching the inventory reports. So far, we're just not seen anything that would tell us that this \u2013 it's bottomed out yet. We believe that we're going to see market improvements in the back half of the year with some flattening of the conditions midyear, but really not much improvement until the end of the year. So depending on how those commodities work, we're trying to be very, very clear as to how we built our outlook and that should give you some insight as to what could change.","Jim Snee","And Adam, I would add on, clearly, I mean, a lot of the industry, the turkey industry, is operating near breakeven. I mean, clearly, we are well above that range. We feel like we've done what we need to do and that we've cut production, and believe that the rest of the industry needs to do that as well. Quite frankly, we are a bit disappointed that we haven't seen that as of yet. So that\u2019s on the commodity side of the business but we still feel very confident as I talked about our number of different items that we expect to grow, the value-added items that will grow, our Lean Ground Turkey business is very healthy, I'm showing good growth and then still taking share versus the beef market.","Adam Samuelson","Okay, that\u2019s all. Very helpful color. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.","Jim Snee","Good morning.","Rupesh Parikh","So I wanted to touch on the competitive environment. I was curious what you guys are seeing right now from a private label perspective and also what you're seeing from some of the other brand players.","Jim Snee","From a private label perspective, our belief is that it's pretty standard operating procedure. I mean, private label has been a competitor, have been in a lot of categories for extended period of time. And so we continue to focus on what we do best and that is building our number one and number two leading brands. If we do that and have leading brand positions, I mean, we'll be able to overcome any category challenge. So we don't see that it's escalated anymore than it has in the past. And I can say, we treat it like any other competitor and understand what it is that we have to do to be successful.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay great. And switching topics to e-commerce, can you remind us the size of the business currently? And then some of the key efforts that you expect going forward in this area?","Jim Snee","Sure, Rupesh. For us it's still a very small piece of our business. We have made some strategic investments of this year, creating our digital investment group. And so we've got the right structure in place. We're focusing our efforts around not only digital marketing, but e-commerce. And so we're not quite where we need to be, but believe that we're on the right track. We have the right structure and we'll get there with the team we have in place.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to David Carlson with KeyBanc.","David Carlson","Thanks for taking the questions. With the union of the Specialty Foods and Grocery Products segments, it becomes a little bit more difficult to gauge the progress of the sales turnaround efforts of MUSCLE MILK by looking at the Specialty Foods segment on the standalone basis. So what give you guys confidence that the issues with CytoSport will start to improve in the latter half of the year? And what else might be required in the form of ongoing investment and sales turnaround efforts. And I've got a follow-up.","Jim Snee","Sure, thanks, David. I mean, the one thing we want to be clear about is, I mean, we will continue to update you on our progress at CytoSport. It's a very important part of our portfolio and we want to make sure you understand the progress that we're making in that business. We're still rebounding from the impact to the recall we described to you last quarter, where we saw, obviously, we were off shelves, saw some increased competitive activity and we're working, continue to work to get pricing in our assortment correct.","I mean, our new leadership team, in addition to working on pricing and assortment, is focused on the consumer and making sure that we're focused on the key attributes of our product offering. And for us, as we head into 2017, a key differentiator is we have very strong alignment with our strategic distribution partner, Pepsi. And working closely with them we\u2019ve made this, they have made this a top priority for 2018.","We'll continue to make the necessary advertising investments in the business but having it at the top of their priority list is really an important part of the formula as well. So that's why we're optimistic heading into 2018 for CytoSport.","David Carlson","That\u2019s a great answer. With respect to the pricing actions you guys took during the fiscal fourth, can you gives us just a little bit more clarity on exactly when those prices begin to have a positive impact on your P&L? And are any \u2013 with so many inputs seeming to be pretty volatile over the last couple of quarters, are there any other pricing actions that are in the process of being implemented?","Jim Sheehan","Yes so the fourth quarter played out just like we told you on the third quarter the timing varied by category, but a broad statement, they took hold in the 11th period and that's really when we started to expect or experience the benefit. And what I would tell you is I talked earlier about some of price elasticity studies that we're doing to make sure we understand the impact that we've exceeded a lot of the pricing study expectations that we had when we took the price increases, obviously a very good sign. We do have some price increases in place for Q1 in our Grocery Products line with our Mary Kitchen corned beef hash and Dinty Moore Beef Stew.","David Carlson","Thank you for the time.","Jim Sheehan","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group.","Eric Larson","Yes good morning all. And happy Thanks Giving.","Jim Sheehan","Same to you Eric.","Eric Larson","Just two \u2013 one question on pricing in the Grocery Products division. I know that you took some pricing, I believe, midyear last year in fiscal 2017 to offset some of the higher belly and both the pork and beef trim costs. Could you reiterate what the \u2013 kind of the timing of that was? And fiscal 2018 should benefit, I would assume at least for the first half from that. Will that be correct?","Jim Snee","Yes so Eric so let\u2019s \u2013 may be we\u2019ll just kind of recap what we did in pricing in 2017. So in Refrigerated Foods, midyear, we had some pepperoni price increases as a result of the run-up in the beef trim market. We also saw an early run-up in the belly market which caused us to increase some bacon pricing. So that would have been Refrigerated Foods in the mid-part of the year that you referenced. And then as we got to the fourth quarter, we had another run-up on belly prices, so bacon was addressed again. And then we did have some other Grocery Products increases, chili and guacamole and peanut, butter in the fourth quarter.","Eric Larson","Okay good. Thank you. That helps. I know there was a lot of activity there, so I just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then just one other follow-up question here, Jim the kind of surprised me that the turkey market is still as depressed as it is. I think, we're about nine months sort of into kind of a lower profitability market and it's normally about a nine-months to 12-month cycle so it seems to be going on longer than normal. Is there something specific that's going on per se that \u2013 is there a change in why we haven't seen the start of a rebound in that turkey business yet?","Jim Snee","We have talked about the rebound being more of a 12-month to 18-month cycle, Eric. And so we would expect that we would have seen some lower bulk placements by this point. But I think one of the things that we need to consider is coming out of AI, that we've got a lot of producers who are perhaps awaiting the next outbreak. And so that supply side continues to go, nobody is willing to give up on their supply quite yet.","The other thing I would point you to is that even though in the midst of AI, there were supply issues, I mean, there were some record profitability. And so you have some probably better-than-average capitalized operators that could, I mean, be holding their breath, so to speak, a little longer. And I mean, we'll see. We're not quite where we think we need to be yet, but like I said earlier, we have cut our production. We're disappointed that we haven't seen the rest of the industry follow suit.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow","Hi good morning everyone.","Jim Snee","Hi Ken.","Ken Zaslow","Just going through \u2013 or kind of quantify the buckets of cost savings because, now, at this point, you have acquisitions, you have the combination of Grocery and Specialty, you have the supply chain savings, you have China and I believe that you have still corporate expenses. Can we bucket them in terms of kind of giving us both the actual numbers or kind of figure out how much it is? And how long it will go for, so we can kind of contextualize this beside \u2013 bringing from an abstract level to actually something to kind of bring it down to my level?","Jim Snee","Sure, that\u2019s a great question Ken. And I mean, I would tell you that we've had a number of different initiatives across the organization and we've seen some of the benefits. But part of this whole supply chain alignment is to make sure that we have our focus on getting the right structure and process in place. And so today, we're not in a position to offer you those buckets. I think from our perspective, we're starting with this supply chain organization, today it was just announced. We've got to get the structure in place, so that we have better alignment across the organization. I think, on one hand, we've done \u2013 always done a good job of focusing our things from the bottom-up continuous improvement. But on the other hand, I mean, it's just time for us to take a more proactive top-down approach and we need to aggregate what those projects are, what the buckets are, what the savings are.","So it's early in the process, but we certainly \u2013 to have had benefit, but our focus today is getting the structure and process in place.","Ken Zaslow","Will there be \u2013 I mean how long will this go on? Any sort of, and this will be my follow-up so I won't ask anymore, but to me, it just seems like \u2013 will this go on for three years? Is there some sort of plan that this is going to reduce cost structure? And again, there's five or six different plans out there and you guys are definitely keeping busy, I'm just trying to figure out what is the time line and the magnitude of this? Are we talking about 100 basis points of margin? Are we talking about 400 basis points of margin? Are we talking about over a three-year period? Are we talking about over a five-year period? Just some sort of \u2013 something to grasp on would be helpful? It seems like you are doing a lot.","Jim Snee","Yes we are doing a lot, we're doing a lot of good things. I mean, this is not going to be a one-hit wonder. I mean, this is going to be an ongoing multiyear approach, but the fact is the big driver around our supply chain is it's just announced today. And so we do have to get the structure, the process in place because, I mean, we know that with a fragmented supply chain, it inherently allows for the duplications and inefficiencies I talked about earlier.","So this is going to be ongoing. It's not a one-year wonder, but again, we've got to get the organization in place, up and running so that the focus can be on the process.","Ken Zaslow","And similar for the combination of the Specialty Business as well, is that also a cost-savings initiative?","Jim Sheehan","Yes and this is Jim Sheehan and I would say that the one thing I'd disagree is that there's multiple plants. There's really one strategy around managing our costs. We're really taking this top-down approach that Jim has talked about. So we're setting the standards, we're setting the goals, we're setting the expectations at a very high level.","So yes, the combination of Grocery Products and Specialty is a part of the strategy that Jim laid out all the way back to Investor Day about improving our supply chain. So it is engaging every level of the staff, but it is being driven from the top.","The other thing is that I'd tell you, Ken, is that it's in the early stages and I think you've seen some of the results already. You could look at the financial statements and see where we've taken reductions and costs out of the staff, out of the expenses. But would we get into the broader levels, supply chain, how we go-to-market, that's when you'll start to see the bigger savings. As Jim said, I look at this and this is not well defined, but I look at this as probably a four-year project and then it's restructuring the way that we look at things. So there will be a savings that will go on well beyond this year.","Jim Snee","And Ken, going back to your question around Grocery Products and Specialty Foods, I mean, just focus on the fact that there's a lot of shared resources in those businesses both from an operational and support perspective. They operate in similar channels. The brand or the business management is very similar. And so again, it goes back to the alignment and utilization of resources from a cost side. And then as I mentioned in my comments, over time, we think that there'll be some revenue synergies as well.","So probably doesn't get you where you want to be, but I think understand it's early and this is a high priority for the organization.","Ken Zaslow","I appreciate it. Thank you guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hi I think Ken did his best on the savings question, but I've got to say that I'm not used to seeing big announcements like this without some sort of restructuring charge and restructuring savings kind of quantification and maybe that's just because \u2013 maybe four-year time frame, Jim and Jim, I'm just not used to that and I'm wondering why did you consider \u2013 or why did you choose to announce it this way? Is it just because it's too soon and we're going to get something in a few months? Or is it just the nature of this is we're going to get the process right and then we're going to get the savings as we go along?","Jim Snee","Robert I think your latter comment is spot on. For us, this goes back to our need to optimize the supply chain. I mean, if we think about what we have become over time in terms of the number of production facilities that we have, the number of items, the number of supply ingredients, the number of co-packers that we now utilize, those have all been very thoughtful additions to support our business over time. But I mean, we just need to get the organization aligned because it is somewhat fragmented today. And so it's exactly what you said, is the focus is getting the structure and the process in place because it doesn't exist in an aligned manner today. So in terms of major, I'll say, restructuring charges, we don't have that on the horizon. From our perspective, we believe that this is going to be about alignment and the top-down approach, which is going to be a different way of thinking about this supply chain.","Robert Moskow","Okay. And I think, Jim Sheehan, you said that we should be able to see the administrative cost that came out in the quarter. Can you help us quantify exactly how much it is though because there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here including advertising down?","Jim Sheehan","Yeah, advertising is down $25 million. So that would be, out of the $50 billion that\u2019s down in SG&A, $25 million of it is advertising. There are other changes, but it has created a reduction in expenses already in 2017. And as Jim said, we\u2019ve been really focused on getting the structure right and it will continue to progress as we go into 2018.","Jim Snee","Hey, Rob, the other thing I would remind you of is some of those general corporate expenses, we have made investments back in our business, one of the earlier callers had a question around our digital efforts. So I mean, we\u2019ve been able to fund some strategic investments with the savings we achieved also.","Robert Moskow","But you\u2019re comparing us to 14-week period a year ago. Is SG&A kind of unrelated to the extra week? Or is there a relationship between those \u2013 would SG&A be higher on a 14-week period a year ago?","Jim Sheehan","It has a minor impact.","Robert Moskow","Minor impact.","Jim Sheehan","Minor impact.","Robert Moskow","And can I ask a question about bacon specifically. You\u2019ve been raising price \u2013 you\u2019ve raised prices twice, it seems like the whole category raised prices. But then belly prices started falling like literally the day after you talked about it on the last earnings call. So do you have any insight as to what the category is going to do next in response to the falling belly prices?","Jim Snee","Well, I mean, it did just what you described. I mean, after we talked about it, it did decrease. But as of late, we\u2019ve seen some increases. We\u2019ve seen the market going back up. And so we\u2019ve \u2013 in Jim Sheehan\u2019s comments, we try to give you the outlook as to what we think the belly market is going to do. But I mean, it\u2019s been a very volatile market, there\u2019s no doubt about it. And that\u2019s, I mean, we\u2019re watching it closely. I mean, we\u2019re pulling all available levers and of course working closely with retailers to make sure that we\u2019ve got a mutually beneficial outcome.","Robert Moskow","Got it. All right, thank you.","Jim Snee","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Jeremy Scott with Mizuho.","Jeremy Scott","Hi, good morning.","Jim Snee","Hi, Jeremy.","Jim Sheehan","Hi, Jeremy.","Jeremy Scott","Just to square up the last 10 minutes or so. You still have that 16% to 20% margin target by 2020 and so that would bring you to about a three-year period, and would I have to \u2013 I assume that \u2013 can I bucket this into the cost-led realignment of the supply chain; number two, the organic recovery of turkey and the value-add portion of Refrigerated Foods; and then third, M&A? And how would you piece each \u2013 how would you apportion each of those as you move from 14% to the bottom end of that range?","Jim Snee","Yeah, Jeremy, I mean, we think about it in perhaps a slightly different way. As we look at our business, I mean, obviously, we know that we\u2019re competing in a number of advantaged areas. That will allow us to continue to grow the top line and so we talked about our Mexican portfolio, our foodservice business, what\u2019s happening with SKIPPY and peanut butter \u2013 or SKIPPY and Justin\u2019s in the nut butters category, our International business and of course what will be coming with the acquisition of Columbus. That is a going to support, obviously, the growth of the top line, a very strong focus on innovation.","I referenced in my comments the great progress that we\u2019ve made against our 15% by 2020 goal since we\u2019re now at 14% and of course a lot of that is driven by the great work we do with consumer and operator insights. We know that we\u2019re going to continue to be good stewards of our capital, invest for growth whether it\u2019s internal, our value-added expansions for Dold and dry sausage, the accretive acquisitions that we\u2019re making. And then, as you described, I mean, some of the efficiencies that we need to continue to gain and the supply chain structure, the supply chain organization, is going to be a part of that journey to get us to that margin goal.","Jeremy Scott","Got it. And just a follow up on turkey and the basis of the recovery shape that you\u2019re expecting in 2018. Do beef supplies need to thin out for JOTS to truly recover?","Jim Snee","Now we\u2019re looking this. We\u2019re at this looking at this right now as purely a turkey issue. This is our own industry issue and we need to make sure that others are following suit to get us where we need to be. But I would tell you, if we think about some of the value-added items, our lean ground turkey continues to take share from the beef category. So I mean, we\u2019re making progress on the value-added side. This really is a supply chain, commodity-driven issue.","Jeremy Scott","Got it. And just quickly, what are you expecting for full year interest expense?","Jim Sheehan","About $16 million.","Jeremy Scott","Got it. Thank you.","Jim Sheehan","And that obviously takes into account the Columbus acquisition.","Jeremy Scott","Right, thanks.","Jim Snee","Yes.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.","Akshay Jagdale","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the CapEx, and I only have my model going back to fiscal 2000, so bear with me. But I mean, this is, by far, the highest CapEx rate percentage of sales, however, you want to look at it. So can you give us a little more color on what\u2019s maintenance and what the other buckets are? I mean, it\u2019s good to see companies getting more and more aggressive with the balance sheet and allocating cash. So maybe you can just give us some buckets and maybe talk about the broader sort of balance sheet strategy, right? That would be helpful.","Jim Sheehan","Certainly, good morning, Akshay. This is Jim Sheehan. We talk about \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about the past that we\u2019re probably looking at the range of $80 million to $100 million of maintenance in this year, which is in an unusual level.","The CapEx that we\u2019re discussing includes the bacon expansion at Dold, that\u2019s $139 million project. It\u2019s on the early stages, so we probably have another $100 million left as we look at it; the Melrose plant, there\u2019s another $100 million that we have budgeted in 2018 to finish that project, $40 million in Austin; value-added capacities, those projects that are focused on various other high-margin products expanding the capacity make up about another $85 million of it. So is that helpful?","Akshay Jagdale","Yeah, super helpful. And just put it into sort of the broader context. Obviously, over the last several years, we have seen the company get more aggressive on M&A, which has been great, but you have kind of a good problem where you keep generating a ton of cash and I see this as a \u2013 the first time we\u2019ve seen a pretty significant step-up in CapEx. So maybe you can just help us understand, should we expect this type of increase for the next couple of years?","And related to the questions about the supply chain realignment, maybe over the next couple of years, you\u2019re not investing in bacon and some of these plants, but maybe you need to invest some cash to generate those savings. So just, overall, like what is the right rate of CapEx over the next couple of years? And why now sort of a big pickup?","Jim Sheehan","I will do my best here. The first thing that I would like to focus on is the discipline we have when we make an investment. And I think some have heard me say before that I look at investment of capital, the allocation of capital, between CapEx and M&A really being determined by the best use of the capital. You\u2019re right, we\u2019ve had a lot of acquisitions recently, $1.3 billion, but we continue to have a very strong cash flow. And the acquisitions are enhancing that cash flow. So from the standpoint of concern about the cash flow, we\u2019re very confident about our cash flow.","Part of our \u2013 part of the working capital that\u2019s coming up this year or the CapEx requirement is just a matter of timing. If we would have started these projects a little bit earlier in the year, it would have been split on a more balanced basis between 2017 and 2018, but capital projects that are this large quite often have their own schedule. We do not see the $425 million as the new run rate, but as the business increases, to go back and to look at the historical spend, we\u2019d probably understate it to some degree as we\u2019ve done additional acquisitions, that\u2019s going to increase the amount of maintenance, the amount of CapEx that\u2019s required.","Akshay Jagdale","That\u2019s helpful. And just one on Refrigerated Foods, if I may. So I don\u2019t know if you broke this out, but maybe you can remind me again what the EBIT expectation for that segment is? I know you mentioned it, but I may have missed it. The reason I\u2019m asking is I really would like you to maybe dissect that between what are the acquisitions adding, you know, in my estimate around $70 million from the one that you\u2019ve already completed including synergies and then maybe another $25 million from the one you are about to close. But just trying to understand sort of how much of it is acquisition-related just so that we get a sense for the base business excluding acquisitions. What do you need to do to get to your guidance, right? That\u2019s essentially what I\u2019m trying to get at. Thank you.","Jim Snee","Sure, Akshay. As you think about earnings for Refrigerated Foods, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to be low single digits in 2018. From an acquisition perspective, with the guidance that we\u2019ve given in 2018, Fontanini will be $0.03 to $0.04. The full year impact of Farmer John will probably be $0.01. I mean the headline here again for Refrigerated \u2013 those were important factors, but the headline still really comes down to value added, being able to offset the decrease in some of the commodity profits. And so where we\u2019re at with the Refrigerated Foods business is we believe it\u2019s never been fundamentally stronger. And what we\u2019re doing on the acquisition side only strengthens it. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about and how we\u2019re modeling that to the low single-digit earnings for 2018.","Akshay Jagdale","And just one last one on that and I really appreciate you giving the incremental color on this. The commodity profits, there is a view, there is some concerns that you \u2013 your commodity profits represented a greater percentage of the total segment earnings over the last couple of years. I know you mentioned 2017 was modestly above the long-term average that you presented at Analyst Day. But just can you be a little bit more granular there because there is this view that if the pork processing commodity margins go from $30 a head on average over the last couple of years to $10 or 0, that there could be significant declines in your base business. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get at. I mean you have obviously come out and said that that\u2019s not going to \u2013 I mean that volatility doesn\u2019t translate into your earnings, but I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of that. So if you could help on the commodity piece and what percentage of earnings it\u2019s been, that would be super helpful. Thank you.","Jim Sheehan","This is Jim Sheehan again. I guess, the first thing I\u2019d want you to focus on is our acquisitions, none of which have a commodity component to them. So our acquisition strategy is reducing our dependence on those commodity \u2013 that commodity profitability. In 2017, our \u2013 we have talked about in Investor Day that it was about 15% of Refrigerated Foods, but the additional acquisitions will reduce that percentage because Fontanini, which is in our plan in right now and eventually Columbus will both push that percentage down. We\u2019ve said that it\u2019s going to be lower, moderately lower than last year.","Jim Snee","And Akshay, I would point you to Nathan. I think you guys can have a conversation to follow up, if that\u2019s okay.","Akshay Jagdale","Perfect, I will follow up. Thank you.","Jim Snee","Thank you.","Operator","And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Snee for any additional or closing remarks.","Jim Snee","Well, I want to thank all of you for joining us today. I want to offer my sincere appreciation to all of our inspired people who make inspired food each and every day. And I know that they will continue to challenge themselves in 2018 to hit the key results that we\u2019ve set for ourselves going forward. I want to wish all of you a very happy Thanksgiving.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"11480":["Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call May 21, 2014  9:00 AM ET","","Executives","","Jana L.

Welcome to the Hormel Foods Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Call on the 21st of May. Throughout today\u2019s recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions)","I will now turn over the conference to Jana Haynes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jana L. Haynes","Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods\u2019 conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6.30 A.M. Eastern Time. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at www.hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.","On our call today is Jeff Ettinger, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jody Feragen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jeff will provide a review of the operating results for the quarter. Then, Jody will provide detailed financial results for the quarter. The line will open for questions following Jody\u2019s remarks. As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit your question \u2013 yourself to one question with one follow-up. If you have additional queries, you are welcome to get back in the queue.","An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 10.30 A.M. Central Time today, May 21, 2014. The dial-in number is 1-800-406-7325 and the access code is 4679596. The audio replay will also be posted to our website and archived for one year.","Before we get started with the results of the quarter, I need to reference to the Safe Harbor statements. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the company are fluctuations in the costs and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products. Please refer to pages 28 through 35 in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 26, 2014, for more details. It can be accessed on our website.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Good morning. We announced record second quarter earnings this morning of $0.52 per share, up 13% over last year. Operating profit increased by 14% with four of our five segments registering gains this quarter. In terms of the top line, we generated record sales of $2.24 billion, an increase of 4% over last year with a 1% volume decline.","I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products segment profit increased 16%, aided in part by a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013, which included SKIPPY peanut butter acquisition cost. Dollar sales were flat versus last year. We have now left our acquisition of the SKIPPY peanut butter business. so we are no longer providing quarterly segment sales without SKIPPY peanut butter sales.","Higher pork, beef and avocado input costs, squeezed margins in our Grocery Products segment. To mitigate these higher costs, we increased prices during the second quarter on our SPAM family of products, Hormel chili and Dinty Moore stew.","These products, along with Hormel Compleats microwave meals, all experienced year-over-year sales declines. We also increased prices on our Wholly Guacamole products. Sales gains in Grocery Products were led by SKIPPY peanut butter, Hormel bacon toppings and the HERDEZ line of products within our MegaMex Foods joint venture.","We are excited about our new SKIPPY Singles peanut butter items launched this quarter. These six packs of single-served, one and a half ounce cups are offered in SKIPPY Creamy and SKIPPY Natural Creamy varieties and are excellent for on-the-go meals or snacks.","Segment operating profit for Refrigerated Foods was up 38%. Higher pork operating margins and growth in our foodservice area, more than offset margin pressures due to higher raw material costs. Sales for Refrigerated Foods increased 10%, led by retail sales of our Hormel Black Label bacon, Hormel REV Snack Wraps and Hormel Country Crock side dishes.","We also enjoyed sales growth in our Foodservice businesses, including such items as our Hormel FIRE BRAISED Meats, Old Smokehouse Pecanwood Smoked Bacon, and Natural Choice deli meats. Segment volume was flat compared to last year driven by reduced commodity sales, as we increased internally utilization of raw materials in our value-added products.","Our Foodservice team continues to focus on meeting the needs of our customers with our latest innovation, Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon. This product delivers a crisp, delicious, pre-cooked bacon that performs in taste like it was cooked from raw.","Segment profit at Jennie-O Turkey Store increased 2%. As we discussed on our call last quarter, the unusually cold winter along with abnormally high propane and natural gas prices, negatively impacted our live turkey productivity in margins, because turkey\u2019s average at 22-week growing cycle. these higher cost turkeys were marketed in our second quarter and will continue to work through our system. We have also experienced lower bird weights impacting volumes throughout our system to Jennie-O Turkey Store segment reported second quarter dollar sales, 1% lower than last year with a volume decline of 5%.","Other macro conditions including lower corn costs and higher turkey commodity prices, along with growth in our value-added product sales allowed our Jennie-O Turkey Store team to generate at least a modest increase in operating profit during the second quarter. For example, our investment in Make The Switch media campaign drove heightened consumer interest in the featured product, Jennie-O fresh ground turkey tray packs and ground turkey chubs.","Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 26% and a sales decrease of 12%, largely driven by the expiration of the agreement in July of 2013 allowing Diamond Crystal Brands to sell certain sugar substitutes into foodservice trade channels. Our Specialty Foods scheme was able to generate gains in our nutritional products business during Q2.","Our International & Other team turned in another strong quarter. segment profit increased 34% and sales grew 23%. this is the first full quarter in which we are including our SKIPPY operations in China. Strong export sales of SKIPPY peanut butter and fresh pork along with growth in our China operations, drove the positive results.","Looking ahead to the second half, we expect elevated beef, pork, turkey, and avocado costs to continue to squeeze margins on many of our value-added products. Pricing actions taken this quarter will partially mitigate margin pressures, but will likely impact sales growth. on the other hand, the addition of the SKIPPY peanut butter business has added additional balance to our portfolio, moderating some of these overall input cost pressures.","We anticipate pork raw material supplies that tighten significantly later in our third quarter, impacting our great food segment. Our team has done a good job preparing for these potential raw material challenges. due to anticipated lower hog supplies, today, we notified our Fremont, Nebraska employees that we will reduce our harvest operations to four days a week beginning in June.","We will work closely with our employees and customers to keep them up-to-date on any additional changes that may impact them. The overall impact of tighter pork supplies on our industry remains to be seen. We continue expect the year-over-year sales and profit growth from our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment, our growth will be at more modest level than initially anticipated.","Finally, we are enjoying significant growth in our international segment and look for this to continue going forward. Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2014 guidance range of $2.17 to $2.27 per share, but expect our full year earnings to be toward the lower end of this range. The elevated input costs due to tighter supplies of many of our raw materials are transitory in nature and will normalize over time. Until then, we believe our experienced team will navigate these challenges and continue to deliver growth.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information, relating to the second quarter.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 totaled $140.1 million or $0.52 per share, compared to $125.5 million or $0.46 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $2.24 billion, compared to $2.15 billion last year, a 4% increase. Volume for the second quarter was 1.22 billion pounds, down 1% from the same period last year.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 7.4% of sales, down from 8% of sales last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher last year due to SKIPPY related transactions and transition costs, totaling approximately $9 million, and primarily reflected in the Grocery Products and international segments.","For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.3% and 7.6% of sales. Equity in earnings of affiliates was $3.6 million in the second quarter versus $7.2 million last year. The decrease is largely the result of higher input costs at our MegaMex Foods joint venture.","Advertising expense for the quarter was $34.8 million, compared to $26.1 million last year. The increase was the result of the new Make The Switch ad campaign for Jennie-O Turkey Store and advertising for Hormel chili and SPAM luncheon meat.","Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. We expect interest expense to be $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2014. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34%, versus 31.5% last year. For fiscal 2012 rate was lower due primarily to the benefit of settlements with various foreign and state tax jurisdictions.","For fiscal 2014, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 34.5%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was $263.9 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was $270.4 million shares.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31.9 million, versus $31.3 million last year. we expect depreciation and amortization to be $125 million to $128 million for fiscal 2014. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $215 million unchanged from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $40 million, up nearly $17 million over last year. For fiscal 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $140 million to $150 million.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Rodney?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Farha Aslam of Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Good morning, Farha.","Jody H. Feragen","Good morning.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","","Two questions, the first one on your core business. could you just give us more color on the REV Wraps, and now that it\u2019s been in the market for a while, how it\u2019s performing, and the second one is on again, on your core business on the Compleats side, it looks like your shelf-stable microwavable meals just are soft and any actions you\u2019re taking to turn that around.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Thank you, Farha. In terms of REV, we\u2019re really quite pleased with the progress of that relatively new product line. We\u2019re hitting just about the one-year anniversary of it being available broadly in the marketplace. We\u2019ve already hit our trial goal with the product and we\u2019re very close to hitting our repeat purchase goal as well.","To give you a sense of scale of the product line, I mean the IRI reported sales, whether you look at the last 13 weeks or last four weeks and extrapolate out on a full year basis, we\u2019re at a pace right now of $50 million to $60 million, so that\u2019s really a quite nice introduction.","As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, it\u2019s not presently contributing to Refrigerated Foods segment profit in any meaningful way, because this is an investment time for that brand both in terms of advertising and slotting, but we\u2019re very pleased with the progress thus far.","Compleats is a slightly different story, where we continue to see sluggish sales, when it comes to that product line. There are certainly some products within the line that are doing well, including our new Compleats breakfast items. but overall, I would say that is a watch out for us. Our team is earnestly looking at different ways to either present the products in terms of the packaging, or in terms of what should be in the product line, pricing strategies, you name it, but we recognize that we need to restore growth in our Compleats product line.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","Great. And then as a follow-up, you have a very strong balance sheet, and M&A is very prevalent in the space right now. Could you give us some commentary on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of transactions, what\u2019s of interest to Hormel, and any thoughts you\u2019d have in terms of international versus domestic?","Jody H. Feragen","That\u2019s a lot of questions. Let me try to answer them. First of all, we like to look for acquisitions that would add to our strategic platforms, certainly, those that are in growing categories and we certainly like number one or number two. We like them to be accretive to the segment profits, as well as accretive to the company as a whole. And we\u2019re always looking for something where we bring more than just the checkbook to the closing. Certainly, anything that offers the opportunity to expand in the international area would be equally, or if not more appealing.","So that\u2019s kind of some of the things, if you look back at the SKIPPY transaction, that\u2019s really what we got with that, so certainly looking for some of that. As far as transactions, where there has been a lot of them some expected, some unexpected. So I would say there\u2019s probably some divesting of orphan brands like SKIPPY was, and then probably some consolidation, so a mixed bag there.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.","And anything that\u2019s of particular interest to you?","Jody H. Feragen","I have nothing to comment on right now.","Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hi, thank you.","Jeff Ettinger","Good morning, Robert.","Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Good morning. I\u2019m just wondering if you Jody, whether you feel like this is the cut-in guidance, is it going to be enough? because as I look at the back half of the year, the back half still requires quite a bit of operating profit growth in order to be delivered. You\u2019ve talked about the impact of the PED virus hurting your access to supplies, rising costs. And I think Jeff; I think you said that these price increases will partially mitigate to higher input costs. So it sounds like the back half is tough. You have a very tough comp in fourth quarter. What are the things that are going to help you deliver the back half?","Jody H. Feragen","Bob, I think there are some \u2013 certainly some unknowns and we\u2019ve done our best job of making estimates of what those impacts are going to be for us. I will tell you that the macro industry conditions, relating to the hog supplies probably is hitting us a little later than we originally anticipated, but we\u2019ve done our best job in factoring that. We have a few levers we can pull as far as making sure that some of the businesses have the appropriate investments to drive their business.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I guess the only thing that I could add is, I mean at a segment level, to add to Jody\u2019s comment, I mean we think Refrigerated Foods is still in a position to be a strong contributor in Q3, given the delay and impact that we just discussed. And then, by Q4, we expect Jennie-O Turkey Store to be in a position to be providing positive growth, because they worked, by that time, they worked through these weather related issues that we\u2019ve referenced.","Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay. Is your outlook for Q4 for Jennie-O, is it any lighter than it was before, or is your fourth quarter the same as it was, because before you were talking about fourth quarter being a very strong quarter for turkey.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","The only remaining challenge that that group will be confronted with is that the grain picture is not as positive today as it was when the year started. So then that all comes down to how successful they are at balancing that against other production costs or pricing actions. but at this point, we do expect it to be a very solid quarter for them.","Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And the spike in commodity turkey prices that happened recently is that a net positive for you in fourth quarter or is it kind of neutral?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","It\u2019s a positive, but it\u2019s not a massive positive and we really don\u2019t sell a lot of commodity turkey meat in the scheme of our overall operation, obviously, it\u2019s a focus on value-added. But clearly, we would acknowledge that that\u2019s a positive for the group.","Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Hi, Akshay.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","","Hi, first question just on SKIPPY. Can you give us a little bit more color on how the business is performing in the U.S. and internationally?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. We\u2019re very pleased with how SKIPPY has been performing. The most recent quarter was a high single-digit sales gain in the U.S., so that\u2019s very strong. I think we\u2019re doing that on the basis of some of the distribution gains, we\u2019ve referenced in the past and having more effective promotions on the product line. And then we expect to complement that by fall with a new ad campaign to really kind of again, remind the SKIPPY consumers about this great brand.","In terms of the outside of the U.S. sales, I mean we\u2019re just now kind of getting China online in terms of, we really don\u2019t have the comps there. The non-China comps were up as well. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with where SKIPPY is in both the U.S. and international markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And just a follow-up to that and more broadly, can you give us an update on your marketing plans for this year? You\u2019d started off with a pretty significant increase in marketing and if I remember correctly, the budget last year was around $100 million and you were expecting it to be up almost 30% this year. Can you just give us an update and let us know if anything has changed per se in that particular plan?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes. we do expect to still have a significant increase year-over-year in terms of our marketing spend. It won\u2019t probably be at the 30% level, it may be more like 15% to 20%. For example, we\u2019ll be coming out a little bit later with the SKIPPY campaign. We really want to make sure we got the messaging right, and we think the timing it to the back-to-school time is more effective than say an earlier summer launch, so that is one budgetary change we\u2019ve made. But overall we do expect to be in the kind of might be the 115 to 120 range in terms of those expenditures.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","But there the only change here is you sort of delayed some of the investments on SKIPPY, it\u2019s a timing issue, correct?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, SKIPPY I mean, once we do come out with it we\u2019ll certainly put a solid effort against an effort that will then overlap into fiscal 2015. So yes there is a timing change at least in relation to SKIPPY.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay and just on this commodity cost pressure issue and your view that it\u2019s temporary, can you give us a little bit more color on what product categories and more importantly, from a modeling perspective, I mean where does that flow through? It seems like Grocery Product is probably the division that\u2019s hit the most by it but you also have a significant value added presence in Refrigerated. So can you give us a sense as sort of where you\u2019re seeing more of the weakness from a segment perspective? And then just a little bit more color in terms of what products are getting impacted and are you taking more pricing now and as such when that flows through the margins should normalize?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Actually I would agree with the characterization that I think the Grocery group probably has the most franchises that are impacted by what the cost pressures we\u2019re experiencing right now. Our outlook would be that when it comes to say the pork prices, that we do think this will \u2013 it\u2019ll be several month process but we don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a systemic change in the cost picture in the pork industry. The beef price increases everybody kind of saw coming and certainly is a little bit more of a systemic challenge, I think in the long run they are expecting to build beef herds back but that\u2019s not going to happen overnight.","We mentioned avocados pressures those are kind of related to the drought in California, although we don\u2019t source significant avocados from California. It is a Global Market ultimately and so when those supplies tighten up or expected to tighten up when prices go up we\u2019ve experienced cost increases even from our supplies in Mexico, Peru and Chile, as well.","We clearly the value-added items within the Refrigerated Foods group are also being impacted by the cost increases. Our Foodservice team has been more successful to date in adjusting pricing to match up against new cost reality, but our retail Meat Products group is catching up and should be in a position to be back in a balance before the year is over.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So just to be clear, what changed internally from an input cost and sort of margin expectation? Is it just that the cost escalated more than you were expecting and as such, there\u2019s just a lag, or is it that the pricing is not as effective and that is not, you\u2019re unable to pass it through?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","It\u2019s really on the cost side. We talked about the impact of our operations in terms of the sort of expected four-day work week in June in Fremont, and so clearly from a hog intake standpoint that we\u2019re expecting the impact to our organization to be sort of kind of late third quarter early fourth quarter. But the price impact of what\u2019s going on in the country in terms of pork supplies was very pronounced during the second quarter and very sharp and that\u2019s always probably the hardest scenarios when we get a quick, deep increase in cost. Trim costs, selling costs, you name it, they\u2019ve rocketed up and those have been very difficult to price against.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just one last one for Jody. Can you give us a little bit color into the cash balance that went down pretty significantly this quarter? It seemed like it was working capital related, but it was a little bit unusual at least from my expectations. Was that something you were expecting, or can you give us a little bit more color into what drove that?","Jody H. Feragen","Sure, you\u2019re right. Working capital was a big use of cash for the quarter. We saw a pretty significant inventory build, part of that was driven by just those rapidly rising costs that were going into our products, so not necessarily more tonnage, but higher costs. And then also driven by, I think, some of the comments that we\u2019ve made about preparing for these potential holes in the hogs where we\u2019re taking certain of our valued primals and having them be in storage so we have enough supply for later. So those would be the biggest drivers on the inventory. We did see a reduction in our payables, specifically related to the timing of the tax payment. So that was expected.","And then really from a free cash flow standpoint, our CapEx spending is up year-over-year and that as we messaged even from the beginning of the fiscal year, we\u2019re making certain investments in productivity improvements, we have new vendoring operation that\u2019s kind of just the cost of doing business that will be much more efficient with that. And then adding some capacities certainly the new bacon one product resulted in some expenditures to get that product launched, so a mix of some not repair and maintenance, but ongoing upgrades to existing facilities, as well as some new expansions.","So those would be the biggest. I would expect by the end of the year that we will get our inventories down at some more normalized levels, but really trying to work through these difficult times that we\u2019re expecting.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, thank you. Good morning. Maybe first to kind of get a little bit more on the PED side, just trying to get a sense of if the impact of summary, you announced the closing of our reduced work weeks in one of your plants. If the impact is as you expected it would be, if it\u2019s been more pronounced and a longer tail and characterize how the evolution of PED has shaped up relative to your expectations.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. For our operations, Adam, it came a little bit more slowly than maybe we had originally feared, but clearly at this point based on our conversations with the producers with whom we have contracts, we expect tightened numbers now for the summer and that\u2019s what led us to go at our four day work week. Clearly a number of other processes in the industry had already made that move. There were other regions of the country where the impact of the illness that hit earlier, and so I think their tightening of numbers had already occurred.","The other thing that everyone in the industry is monitoring is sort of is the recovery side from it and I think everyone would tell you at this point it\u2019s not a 100% recovery yet. That\u2019s what you seek to accomplish when you have an outbreak like this, but the entities that once they\u2019ve kind of had the exposure to it and they get back into operation, they are not in many cases hitting the 100% level and so that\u2019s a little bit of a wildcard for us as we head into the latter part of the year or even early next year, in terms of what kind of numbers we might see.","Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, and so it\u2019s really at this point too early to think about how long this tail can be, your discussions with your suppliers for the next few months will be the big determination on what the pork supply looks like in the first half of your fiscal 2015?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, definitely an impact into Q4, but yes, kind of early to tell for 2015.","Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay and that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe switching gears, following-up on Farha\u2019s question, obviously, your balance sheet is a great asset and in a great position; however, with the ownership of the foundation where it is, it kind of constrains you a little bit in your capital allocation. Can you talk about any perspective repurchases of shares from the foundation, or there would be any authority or interest in that regard to just give you a more balanced, more flexible capital allocation process?","Jody H. Feragen","Well, that would obviously be up to the foundation, if their interest is in selling any shares. We certainly do have authorization that would allow us to do any repurchases of shares. We made some small purchases during the quarter and we continue to assess what our expected uses for cash flow are and balance that with what kind of ROI we get on the investment and our internal stocks. So I\u2019m not in control of what the foundation wants to do with their shares.","Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right, fair enough, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Diane Geissler of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Hi, Diane.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","I wanted to ask about the turkey business. Is there any way to quantify what you think the impact of some of these sort of, I guess, call them one-off really terrible winter in the propane prices spiking. I\u2019m assuming that you had hedges in place, but that maybe you came under like a force Majeure, where your suppliers said that we don\u2019t have it and therefore, you have to go on to the spot market, was that a factor? And then I guess you said 22 weeks, so should we assume it will impact your margins all the way into the first quarter of 2015, or do you think that it will be limited to 2014?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, on the propane side, yes, we did have some forward positions in place and yes, we did get impacted by force Majeure clauses, as they had pipeline issues and other issues this winter, so that was \u2013 that certainly exacerbated an already difficult situation when it came to just share market pricing, because we don\u2019t forward by all of it clearly. so we did have to scramble and cover some of that on the open market.","In terms of your second question on timing, 22 weeks, but the bite from the winter, really obviously, took place in the primary winter months kind of, December, January and February, even maybe a little March. So now, we don\u2019t \u2013 we really don\u2019t expect the impact from that to trail all the way into our fiscal 2015, in fact, even by the Q4, we should be in a better position when it comes to that impact.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Can you quantify the propane impact, just in terms of if it had been delivered on a hedged basis, versus you buying in the spot market?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I really can\u2019t give you that detail. I can give you that, just in terms of this overall for Jennie-O, we provided guidance at the beginning of the year that we really had expected and hoped that Jennie-O would be in a growth position really, frankly quarter-after-quarter in fiscal 2015, and you can see from the results that what\u2019s happened is it\u2019s been basically flat, where it\u2019s not like we lost a lot of ground, they still have really solid operating margins, but as basically, propane is one of the deltas that have driven it from a good gain to flat. But there\u2019s other ones such as the feed, not being quite as favorable as we thought that has been a factor as well.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Can I just ask what you\u2019ve actually communicated to your employees at the plant for furloughs like how long they should expect to be furloughed or has it ended?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. so we just did that this morning. So we wanted to be on a consistent basis with public information, talking to them about an impact starting in June. We talked about being closed on Fridays within that plant, depending on the hog flow in a given week; there may be opportunities to make up some additional hours on the Monday through Thursday schedule.","The summer in the past has sometimes been a time where people are looking to take vacation, or you have some scheduling differentials anyway. so what we\u2019ve said is kind of indefinite. We certainly anticipate that it will certainly last at least a couple of months, but we\u2019ll just kind of have to see on a rolling basis, as to when we think we have the numbers back to be in a position to restore that plant to full hours.","Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Larson of C.L King. Please go ahead.","Eric J. Larson \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Hi Eric.","Eric J. Larson \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","I have a very specific Jennie-O question, and it relates to your energy issues up there. I know there are a number of sort of natural gas pipeline projects going on in Wisconsin. and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re anywhere close to any of those gas lines that you could potentially put the CapEx into, and convert your grow-up facilities from propane to natural gas. Is there any distinct possibility that something like that could happen where you wouldn\u2019t then have to be so tied into specifically propane?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","It\u2019s a great question, Eric and indeed, the team is actively pursuing that. We actually were pursuing it even before the propane shortage, just because natural gas was looking attractive, obviously at a time before that. It\u2019s a somewhat gradual conversion for us, just fairly in-depth process, we\u2019re on kind of a maybe 20 farm a year schedule in order looking at a conversion in that regard. so there won\u2019t be an immediate solution to anything, but definitely a good point there in terms of a better long-term position for those facilities.","","Eric J. Larson \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay, good. I\u2019m glad to hear that you\u2019re actually within striking distance, where you can actually do some conversions, which over the long run, it\u2019s easier to hedge natural gas and everything else, and I think it would be a lot more reliable supply. The second follow-on question that I have, when you talk about the favorable turkey commodity markets, and I know that you have moved a tremendous amount of your volume away from those commodity markets into your further value add, is that still in general, can that be a significant swing factor quarter-to-quarter as to the performance of the commodity markets?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, I mean it\u2019s still relevant. I mean we certainly still sell a number of the dark meat items on a commodity basis, either in international marketplaces, or in some cases to other manufactures. so I don\u2019t want to discount and pretend that that\u2019s not a factor at all. It definitely can be a relatively big swing, but clearly the emphasis for Jennie-Our, the 75% to 80% of the portfolio are the value-added items and we\u2019ve really taken pains to try to match up our overall production within the system to those value-added items.","The fact that we were short weights this last quarter again, kind of dampened our ability to take advantage of those commodity markets on a more broad basis, because again, we needed to grab as many pounds as possible to make sure we were supporting the value-added items.","Eric J. Larson \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Sachin Shah of Albert Fried. Please go ahead.","Sachin Shah \u2013 Albert Fried & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. I just want to talk to you about your kind of acquisition strategy. There has been kind of a lot of speculation out there, what companies you may be interested or not interested in, so maybe, you can just highlight, maybe in a summary of just your acquisition kind of strategy and what you guys are looking for to deploy capital.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I think Jody addressed that earlier. I mean we clearly have been active in the acquisition community over the last dozen years, completing over $2 billion worth of deals that have helped the growth of our company. We clearly are in a position, we have the financial wherewithal, and I think the team capabilities to do other deals in terms of general spaces, I mean you can get online this afternoon and watch the Bank of Montreal conference and we\u2019ll have a slide in our deck that talks about different areas where we\u2019ve made acquisitions in the past. But we really don\u2019t provide any specificity about potential targets going forward and that\u2019s something that the team keeps on a proprietary basis.","Sachin Shah \u2013 Albert Fried & Co. LLC","","Okay. Any just maybe follow-up comment on the deal activity in the space right now, I\u2019ve seen a few transactions already in 2014. So, just maybe some color on your thoughts on what that means for the sector, industry and use specifically.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes. I don\u2019t know that I have a perspective that would be any better than an investor who is following the space. Clearly, there have been some deals announced recently. I\u2019ve been in the shop now nine years and there has been an ebb and flow of deal during that whole timeframe, there\u2019s fairly notable changes in the industry, I think that\u2019s just part of what happens in modern business.

We announced third quarter earnings this morning of $0.42 per share, up 2% from last year. Segment operating profit increased by 5% with 4 of our 5 segments registering gains this quarter. Q3 sales were $2.2 billion, an increase of 8% over a year ago on volume growth of 3%. All 5 segments generated sales increases over last year.","I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products segment reported an operating profit increase of 32% and a dollar sales increase of 25% for the third quarter. Excluding sales of Skippy peanut butter, sales for Grocery Products were flat for the quarter.","We were very pleased with the smooth integration of the domestic Skippy franchise into our Grocery Products organization. Skippy peanut butter sales were strong this quarter, driven by improved distribution. Sales of Dinty Moore Stew, Hormel Mary Kitchen hash and Hormel bacon toppings also grew nicely during the quarter. Sales of our SPAM family of products and Compleats microwave meals were down in the quarter.","Segment operating profit for our Refrigerated Foods segment decreased by 26% as spiking core input costs squeezed operating margins. Refrigerated Foods sales were up 2%. On the retail side, we enjoyed strong sales of Hormel party trays, Hormel Natural Choice deli meats and Hormel Cure 81 hams.","We're excited about our new Hormel REV Snack Wraps. The Rev products were rolled out nationally during the quarter and a new advertising campaign began in late July. This product meets the needs for a quick, high-protein snack that can be eaten on-the-go.","Our Foodservice team continues to outpace the industry with higher sales in the quarter, led by sales of branded products such as HORMEL PECANWOOD bacon, HORMEL FIRE BRAISED Meats and Hormel Natural Choice deli meats.","Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had a solid quarter with segment operating profit up 17% and sales up 4%. Continued growth in sales of value-added products and an improved product mix offset higher grain prices and lower commodity meat prices during the quarter. Jennie-O Turkey Store foodservice and deli value-added products delivered sales gains in the quarter. Retail sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store bacon and ground turkey chubs also enjoyed solid growth in the quarter.","Our Specialty Foods segment reported an 8% gain in operating profit on a net sales increase of 5%. This segment profit increase was driven by strong sales of sweeteners, nutritional products, ready-to-drink beverages and ingredients.","The agreement allowing Diamond Crystal Brands to sell SPLENDA sweetener into the foodservice trade channel ended up being extended 1 month and ultimately expired on July 31, 2013.","Our International & Other segment delivered another strong quarter with operating profit up 34% on a sales increase of 31%. Higher exports of our SPAM family of products and fresh pork, improved performance by our China operations and the addition of the Skippy business all contributed to the nice results. We remain excited about the growth prospects that Skippy brand brings to our International group, both in China and in other parts of the globe. We anticipate completing the acquisition of the China sales and the Weifang operations by the end of the fiscal year.","We believe we are positioned to bring a strong finish to fiscal 2013. Our Refrigerated Foods value-added products should experience improved margins, driven by a decline in pork input costs along with the benefit of earlier pricing actions.","Our Grocery Products segment has plans in place to help drive sales growth of their traditional, microwave and Mexican food products. And we also have solid momentum with the sales of Skippy peanut butter that is expected to continue in the fourth quarter.","Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment began turning the corner in the third quarter and should maintain their momentum in the fourth quarter.","Specialty Foods will likely have a down quarter in light of the discontinuation of the SPLENDA contract, but the team is working hard to minimize the decline.","Our International & Other segment has delivered outstanding results through the first 3 quarters of 2013 and we expect similar performance in the fourth quarter.","Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our adjusted fiscal 2013 guidance range of $1.88 to $1.96 per share. The strength of our balanced business model should allow us to achieve another growth year as we close out fiscal 2013.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning. For the third quarter of fiscal 2013, net earnings totaled $113.6 million or $0.42 per share compared to $111.2 million or $0.41 per share a year ago. Net earnings for the first 9 months of fiscal 2013 totaled $368.9 million or $1.37 compared to net earnings of $367.4 million, also $1.37 per share a year ago.","Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $2.2 billion compared to $2.0 billion last year, an 8% increase. For the 9 months of fiscal 2013, dollar sales improved 6% to $6.4 billion.","Volume for the third quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, a 3% increase over fiscal 2012. Year-to-date volume was 3.7 billion pounds, also up 3% compared to last year.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 7% of sales compared to 7.2% last year. Year-to-date selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.5% compared to 7.4% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 7.5% of sales for the full year.","Equity and earnings of affiliates for the third quarter was $1.3 million versus $9.8 million last year. The decrease is due to lower earnings at our MegaMex Foods joint venture, which experienced a higher earn-out expense on the Fresherized Food acquisition, unfavorable exchange rates and higher input costs.","Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million compared to $3.2 million last year. Year-to-date interest expense is $9.4 million compared to $9.7 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2013.","Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.7% versus 33.7% for the same period in fiscal 2012. Year-to-date, our effective tax rate was 33.5%, unchanged from last year. We expect the effective tax rate to be about 34% for the full year of fiscal 2013.","The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 265 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 271 million. We repurchased 953,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter, spending about $38 million. We have 10 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31.8 million, up from $28.9 million last year. For the 9 months of the year, depreciation and amortization was $93 million compared to $88.6 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $120 million to $125 million for fiscal 2013.","Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $23 million compared to $36 million last year. For the first 9 months of the year, capital expenditures totaled $69 million compared to $94 million last year. For fiscal 2013, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $110 million to $120 million.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Akshay Jagdale from KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question on Refrigerated Foods. Can you just give us a little bit more insight into the weakness? I mean, this quarter tends to be historically one where you can have some of your lower margins, but the cutout itself wasn't as weak as your results would imply. I think you mentioned something about bacon. Can you just help us with what part -- components of maybe your cost basket went up so that we can keep track of it going forward and be aware of what happens? So just trying to understand what happened because it definitely surprised us and it seems to be unique relative to some of your peers.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay, Akshay. I mean, the weakness for Refrigerated Foods was clearly the most pronounced in the earlier part of the quarter, ending up prompting us to come out with our guidance adjustment that occurred mid-quarter. At that stage, we were seeing some continued weakness in processing margins, but the bigger culprit had been the spike in some of the raw material costs, particularly bellies for bacon and trim costs for a number of our products, pepperoni and other items within the portfolio. As the quarter went on, the team had an opportunity to, particularly on the bacon side, price against with the new reality of what the cost situation is. Belly costs are still at historically very high levels, but they have moderated some from the peak. And we expect now, as we kind of head out of the summer season, they should start to return to more normalized levels. Overall, for Refrigerated, I mean, those are the big challenges. I mean, it wasn't all bad for the quarter in terms of their -- what we look at for their business performance. Our large Foodservice group for Hormel is part of Refrigerated Foods and they really had a very fine quarter, growing sales at a solid rate and really doing a nice job introducing some other newer products, their FIRE BRAISED meats and their PECANWOOD. This half also does represent somewhat of an investment time for us with the REV brand. We're very pleased with where we're at with that brand. We've achieved the distribution goals that we had set for the team. We have the ad campaign kicking in. Our early sales results are very promising. But anytime you roll out something new on that scale, I mean, we're not going to be bringing bottom line contributions for that brand to the team this year and probably even into next year somewhat, but we're heading in a good direction with that.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just on that point, Jeff, can you help us understand sort of where you are with the REV like ACV, number of SKUs, anything you can give us? And how do we parse out that positive from their results if the volumes are obviously down, so it's hard to tell what impact REV has had even on the revenue side? So maybe you can help us because our channel checks also tell us some -- that the launch, at least initially, has been pretty encouraging. So maybe you can just give us a little bit of a sense of, one, how it's doing and maybe -- and just talk about the impact it's having already.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. In terms of ACV, we're really in a solid shape with that. We're in the 70% to 80% of the U.S. that has accepted the item and most of those stores are actively scanning it. Sometimes you'll get an acceptance from a retailer, but in terms of their shelf reset time frame they just have certain windows. They get those things done. So we're still catching up on a few retailers, but we're in a good position to support our ad campaign. In terms of the number of SKUs, there are 8 offered in the line. Most retailers are taking kind of 6 to all 8 in that range. We'll be coming out with 4 additional items later this fall and heading into the winter. And in terms of just the sense of scale, I mean, we're not -- we probably won't get into reporting item-by-item sales. But just to give you a sense of magnitude for the quarter, it was in the $4 million to $5 million range. So I mean it's still building. Clearly, our long-term expectations for the product would be -- are quite solid, but that's about the size of it right now.","Jody H. Feragen","I guess, Akshay, I would like to follow up on the volume comment you made about Refrigerated and their volumes is really being impacted by discontinuing the feed business that we talked about last quarter. So that's not all just retail and foodservice volume that's impacting the decline there.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one on Skippy. Are the lower peanut costs already flowing through your P&L or is that still not flowing through? And how are you managing sort of that lower costs that might be flowing through relative to your investments because it's still pretty early in the stage of owning that asset and I just want to know like where you are in terms of your planning on investing behind that brand and perhaps how that's going initially.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. I mean, a decent amount of the lower costs would be flowing through right now. And now it looks -- seems favorable in terms of what we're seeing for peanut crops going forward. In terms of investing in the brand, I think I talked about that at the last quarterly call and I think we talked about it a little bit in the Investor Day that when we bought the brand, it was with the thought in mind of really kind of rejuvenating it with the Skippy consumer in the marketplace. And so one of our approach is to potentially do that in the marketplace would be to anticipate an advertising campaign. The earliest that would occur is next fiscal year and so we'll kind of let you know, probably on the next call, the November call, what our outlook is in terms of advertising support. But we're -- the team is actively looking at both possibilities right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Farha Aslam from Stephens Inc.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","First of all, just a continuation of Akshay's questions regarding Refrigerated Foods. Looking out into the fourth quarter, we've recently seen hog prices rally a bit. So when you look at that, is that a net positive for your Refrigerated Food business because you do raise 15% of your hogs internally. And can you price for the hog price increase better into the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. How should we think about that?","Jody H. Feragen","I'll take that, Farha. I would generally say that we would prefer lower hog prices, and we would expect hog prices in the fourth quarter to be lower than they were in the third quarter. Still probably year-over-year, an increase. The live production side doesn't really play that much into it since we take those values into our further process businesses at market.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then going into International, I mean, that turnaround in that International business is pretty, pretty material. Do you expect that China will continue to perform? And your thoughts on that other business, which is becoming pretty meaningful in your P&L.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Farha, I'm really quite encouraged by International. And not only, as we mentioned, has it had all 3 solid quarters this year, but this will be the third consecutive year of really solid, both top line and bottom line, growth for International. I think our strategy of focusing on the Asia base market has proven out well and so we have good solid business performance in Korea and Japan, our partnership with San Miguel in the Philippines and then the more majority-owned China ventures. China, in particular, we do feel we've now gotten to the point where we have sufficient scale in that business, that now it can generate a solid profit. And we're look -- the team out there is looking forward to bringing Skippy on board, so that will be our third plant facility we'll be running in China. And we'll kick that business well over $100 million once the Skippy contribution is in there, which we expect to occur in the next fiscal year. So overall, International, I would agree with your assessment that it's become a more and more meaningful component of our overall performance and it's one that I think we've articulated in the past we have solid expectations that it will grow at a faster rate than our overall company average.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey from Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I just was wondering about the supply of hogs. As we think about the fall, this PED virus that used to be impacting hog supplies. Is that showing up in any particular way in your geographies more or less than we are seeing from nationwide impact? Some folks are thinking it will impact the supply 2% to 3%.","Jody H. Feragen","Tim, this is Jody. We're really not seeing any impact on the supply here in the Midwest. Actually looking at seasonally high numbers for this last quarter for us, so maybe it's not as impactful here.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","That's good news. And then I don't know whether you'll be willing to kind of think about further add in the fall, but historically, at least for the last 2 years, you've run some pretty big margin numbers in Jennie-O Turkey Stores. Is there any reason to think that, that seasonal pattern should change or steady as she goes?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, without giving a percentage target, I mean, our expectations for Jennie-O's performance is that this year's fourth quarter will have better segment profit results than last year's fourth quarter. So I mean, that should support what you're saying.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Terrific. And I know you're not going to give first quarter guidance, but that's been kind of a big quarter. No reason to think that, that would change relative to seasonal patterns for the last couple of years?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","We're really not in a position to do anything earlier than 2014 yet. But in terms of just sales momentum, I mean, the value-added items that Jennie-O has created, both the new or innovative items and some other traditional items, are connecting well in the marketplace. And we don't have any reason to believe that, that won't continue heading into next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Two questions. One is if you hold your current margins -- current situation or current environment steady, how much would your margins move up in the Refrigerated Foods with the new product innovation?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, I mean, that's 1 contributor, certainly. We -- as we innovate, the team's goal is always to have margins that are accretive to the overall division. And certainly, the targets we have in place for the REVs and the other items that they've been introducing do meet those requirements. The Refrigerated Foods has really a significant opportunity, frankly, just to get back towards some of the performance levels that we enjoyed a couple of years ago. I mean, we had 2 consecutive years of around 7% net and these last couple of years have been more like 5% with this most recent quarter even dipping below that with the struggle we had in periods '07 and '08. So we think there are some things on top of the innovation as we head into a different environment that will be favorable for Refrigerated Foods.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","What about just innovation? Would it add 100 basis points? If you just kept everything stable, how do you think about that because you have a lot of new products coming out, so I just was trying to figure out if it's the REVs and all the new products. Is it 100, 200 basis points of just contribution just from the new products? Or how do you think about that? Separating the environment out from what you guys can actually do yourselves.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I'd be really speculating. Clearly, I haven't looked at it from that standpoint. I mean, I look at it from the standpoint that clearly the -- whether it's the Foodservice group, the meat products group, et cetera, within Refrigerated Foods or even some of their subsidiary organizations like Farmer John or Burke, I mean, our expectation is that they grow their top line commensurate with our 5% target. And to the extent that they -- the innovative items are contributors to that, that those should be better for margins than the traditional items. But I guess, I don't have it reduced back to the algorithm you're looking for.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And my follow-up question is, on turkey, is how bound are you to your turkey margins at the high end of 15% because it seems like the commodity meat business is probably at the bottom. You're seeing 10% cuts. And then obviously, the corn curve should be -- and soybean meal for that matter should all be encouraging. So is 15% a real boundary? Or does it just kind of -- that was just a comfortable number to start with and we'll see where they actually go from here.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, that number really -- I mean, I think what we did historically in the old days, if you will, we were looking at Jennie-O and sort of the 8% to 10%, 7% to 11% range. We reassessed it based on both the improvements they've made to the branded portfolio and a lot of the efficiency gains that they've made in the total system and came out with the new kind of longer-term guidance range of 11% to 15%. But no, that's not necessarily viewed as a ceiling. We'll certainly give a little more specificity related to what our expectations are for Jennie-O when we get to the November call, but it's not -- I wouldn't take that as the absolute max.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you, just first off, have you quantified what your expectations are for increased grain prices in fiscal '13 and JOTS just on a year-over-year basis in absolute terms?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","No, we really haven't given a specific number related to that. I mean, obviously, you've got timing, you've got hedge positions that will effect that. We've kind of indicated each quarter, thus far, this year clearly that total feed costs of the system for Jennie-O has been up every quarter year-over-year. We're starting to get into the mode. We're all still waiting to see where this crop ends up. I mean, if you look at -- based on futures market, if that turns out to be the reality, then clearly we should start heading downward in terms of what the feed cost impact would be to Jennie-O. But even then, there'll be some delay to that effect.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Well, I guess my point is that you guys have had a pretty good year in operating profits in Jennie-O despite the fact that grain has just been really out of control. And I'm just -- know you're not in a position to talk about '14 yet, but obviously I have to think about it. And so I'm just trying to understand the magnitude of that. Maybe you can help me with this because I know that -- it seems to me that the holiday turkey business has pretty consistently been a big business in the fourth quarter and I think there's a little carryover into the first quarter. And so anything that's marketed now would have old grain prices in it in terms of the cost basket, is that not correct?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","That is correct.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then could you just tell me, as a percentage of sales, roughly how big that business is today? Because you've done so much work on the value-added side, I'm assuming that's a smaller and smaller percentage of your total sales. Is that...?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Right. It's not a huge percentage of the sales and it's certainly not a huge percentage of the earnings. I mean, the whole bird business has never been a big moneymaker for either the manufacturer or the retailer. There is an impact to the first quarter of any year for Jennie-O related to whole birds. Frankly, there's probably a bigger impact of the fact that franchises such as our Fresh Lean Ground Turkey franchise often will have -- kind of leap out of the gate in January kind of people with New Year's resolutions and so forth. And that's a peak time of the year for that very solid product line for us. In terms of trying to get back to -- you mentioned about kind of grain impact, I mean we're pleased with where Jennie-O is for the year. But I mean, it is true that for both the first 2 quarters, I think their year-over-year adjustment was around $18 million down each quarter. And that was part trying to catch up to the grains and that was part that the commodity turkey markets were not as favorable. To one of the earlier questions, I mean, at the moment, those both look -- the outlooks for both of those things look more favorable right now heading into next year. But that's something we'll be in a better position to quantify when we provide earnings guidance in November.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I wanted to ask on your commentary on the lower contribution from the affiliates for MegaMex. You cited 3 things. I think it was higher payout for the Fresherized Foods, currency and then higher input costs. I'm assuming you detailed those in the order of impact. And if so, is that payout for Fresherized Foods I'm assuming it's kind of one and done in the quarter and you're completely free of the terms of that agreement, is that correct?","Jody H. Feragen","Diane, this is Jody. The Fresherized earn-out goes for 3 years, so it ends in fiscal 2014. And the way we handle it from an accounting perspective is we evaluate their performance against their earn-out criteria and make adjustments on a quarterly basis. The great news is that the Wholly Guacamole brands have really outperformed. So we have this short term impact to that business because of recording the expected payout that will be made in 2014. So...","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So we'll look forward in the third -- sorry. I'm sorry, talking over here.","Jody H. Feragen","We'll see an impact in the fourth quarter, too. Hopefully, they'll have other parts of their business that are able to overcome it, but this quarter was a little bit of a catch-up.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So are you accruing today for a payment in '14? And then once '14 rolls around, you're done or do you have to accrue again in '14?","Jody H. Feragen","There'll be some accrual in '14, but it won't be -- well, depending on how the business performs, we'll see where it goes. But I would expect it to be somewhat less than 2013. This quarter ended up being a bit of a catch-up.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","It was a catch-up? Okay.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Totally done by the end of '14.","Jody H. Feragen","Totally done in 2014. And then they also. . .","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moscow from Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to dial in a little deeper into the expectations for fourth quarter because if you do the math here, it looks like operating profit needs to grow like about 15% to hit your guidance. And then when you look at consensus, Jeff, for fiscal '14, I know you don't want to get into guidance, but it is -- the expectations are for a very strong year. And as you go down the list of all the other food companies that have reported, they are talking about weaker volumes at retail, again a weak consumer environment. So maybe just dial in a little bit more about what the drivers for fourth quarter are going to be even if the consumer environment is rather weak. And then maybe you could just touch a little bit on fiscal '14 because I think it's rare that consensus has such a high bar already set for you. And then in the context of a weak consumer environment, is it achievable?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, first of all, in terms of -- our best read on consumers are our own products, I guess. And throughout the more challenging economic times of the past few years, that's been somewhat mixed. I mean, obviously in the aggregate, we have enough products that are connecting with enough groups of consumers that we've been able to drive our business forward both on a top line and bottom line basis. That's our current picture as well. There were elements of the business in terms of retail sales that were a little bit softer this quarter. But I don't put a lot of stock frankly on one quarter. I mean, I just see things go up and down kind of quarter-to-quarter in the past on certain businesses. Overall, I think the portfolio of items that we have, that we offer for sale into the retail channel whether through Jennie-O or Grocery Products or Refrigerated Foods are in a good position to be able to continue to generate growth, both in the fourth quarter and beyond. And then on top of that, obviously, we have Foodservice and other commercial-type sales that also are contributing to our overall results. So overall, I mean, the way we see making the numbers for Q4 is kind of as we've outlined from a segment standpoint that we would expect somewhat of a dip from Specialty, albeit Specialty is one of the smaller units in terms of total contribution to the company. And so our expectation right now is that all 4 of the other units are in a position to have good solid quarters. And that then adds up to our ability to support the grains we've provided here a couple of months ago for the full year.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up on Refrigerated just for fourth quarter. Again, the drivers here are -- you've taken the pricing that you need to take, especially in bacon. And do you -- are you saying that you think the input costs might trend sequentially lower in the quarter, and that might provide a bit of a benefit because there has to be a big sequential benefit in order to hit the guidance.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, that definitely is a part of it. I mean, we're seeing it somewhat already on bellies. We've seen it much -- on a more pronounced basis in pork trim and that's the key input for some of the items. So that definitely should be a part of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale from KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just 2 follow-ups, one on REV. It was very useful to get a sense of how big it is now. But Jeff, can you just give us a sense of sort of the optimism about this product? I mean, could it be like a Compleats type of product where it went from 0 to a couple hundred million in a short period of time? And what kind of expectations do you have for this product? It seems pretty unique because it's in the lunchable aisle and it's really a differentiated product that took probably years to develop. So can you just help us like frame what would be sort of the best case scenario for this and perhaps over what period?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. Well, I think we've talked about it in the past. Our innovation track record and even in achieving our $2 billion challenge has been achieved mostly through kind of a lot of incremental gains. Some of our are better new product franchises have been even in the $50 million to $100 million range, although you cited Compleats correctly as being higher than that. Given the kind of advertising we're putting against this, given the capital investment we made, I think it's certainly fair that we at least expect this item to be in that type of range. But I would not at all put that as the ceiling. We'll just have to see what consumers reactions are to the items. We think, over time, if assuming the initial REV Wraps connect as well with consumers as we think they can, that this can be a platform for other types of products that are more oriented toward a younger audience, toward on-the-go, immediate consumption-type items. And so we could have a very significant franchise in this. But I really don't have a number for you that's beyond kind of that number I just gave you in terms of what historically has been a bigger product for us.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, that's very helpful. Just -- I get this question a lot, so I'm posting it to you. I mean, I feel like your company every year keeps moving away from commodity products, if I may, and more towards value-added. Can you help us sort of understand from your perspective like what percentage of your sales or earnings what you would call commoditized today? And how much is that really changed over the last few years? The reason I asked that today is because you obviously pre-released a lot bit about and lowered the bar because of the commodity piece of your business, so at least relatively commoditized piece. And kind of surprised me the magnitude of that sensitivity there. So can you just help us? And again, not trying to get into like numbers exactly, but just give us a sense of how you think about that dynamic.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, we're clearly over time -- I would agree with your assessment that we're trying to create a portfolio that is less vulnerable to certain commodity movements. And so we still do have a hog supply chain. We still do have a turkey supply chain. Frankly, even if you get to the point where you sell next to nothing of the meat on a commodity basis, you still could have some cost-related inputs that can fluctuate fairly significantly. But in doing that, I mean, between portfolio diversification, buying into a category like peanut butter that has a different raw material, like guacamole, like salsa, we think those things have helped us. And then the more you develop products that are not frankly just a piece of meat, but are a meal that have other components that are a REV Wrap, et cetera, again your vulnerability to any one commodity moving on you becomes less. So I do think we have over time improved the portfolio in terms of its vulnerability to these kinds of things. But as you correctly point out, I mean, it's still out there. Bacon would be a good example. I mean, if you're in -- if you process hogs, you have bellies off the hogs. Bacon is actually a very on-trend, popular item with consumers. By and large, if you're just talking about kind of a pound of raw bacon, that's never a high-margin, big moneymaker for the manufacturer. I mean, there's a lot of competition within that category. That 1 pound of bacon is not particularly differentiated. So quarters like this last quarter, I mean, it hurt us that the belly cost spiked as much as they did and it took us more time to catch up to those. But that's never an area that in the long run we're looking to drive results. Now flavored bacon flavors like PECANWOOD or Applewood or precooked bacons or bacons for a particular foodservice application, than that could be a contributor to the kind of higher margins we're looking for. So in terms of that percentage, I mean, I think we've said before, when you look at both the pork and turkey supply chains, we're probably in the 75% to 80% of the volume goes out in a value-added form. You're always going to have a little bit of a mismatch with some of the -- what comes off the animals in terms of what the American consumers are looking for. But the goal beyond just -- is it in any kind of value-added form is just keep moving up the value-add or keep finding more innovative ways to direct it to consumers.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And just one follow-up for me. So why is Jennie-O Turkey much more stable than, let's say, a pork portfolio if the percentage from value-added is similar in both cases? Can you -- I mean, it just seems like it's more value-added and it's more differentiated in turkey. But is that -- can you put a thing on so why your turkey business just continues to march up in margins and on the pork side every now and then we tend to get these negative surprises.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, I mean, Jennie-O Turkey Store, I mean, whole birds would be one example. It's certainly a category that's sort of supply chain-based category. We mentioned earlier they're a little bit lower margin. But otherwise, if you look at turkey products kind of sold in the U.S., it tends to be more of a specialized niche, one that the team up there has done a really nice job of developing the right products and being the only one out there advertising these products to the consumer. And so I think that has provided them with some insulation versus, say, a pork supply chain in terms of their ability to deliver more consistent results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I forgot to ask on the Foodservice. Your group saw pretty good growth in environment. I think if you listened to the restaurant companies when they reported their second quarters, I mean, the traffic trends have been pretty bad at both casual and QSRs. So congratulations for outperforming that. But I guess question is really what are you hearing from your customers? What are their expectations for the second half of the year? Do you think that there are -- there's some pent-up demand on the customer side because really the restaurant guys have struggled here over the last year and so we should expect to see improvements there and maybe improvements for Hormel? Or what are you hearing from consumers about where they're shopping, retail versus dining out?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. I mean, on the QSR side, at least on a domestic basis, we tend to be less of a player with QSRs. Part of that is maybe by design in terms of we just kind of found our model of creating unique items that are designed for giving operators less what a really large chain is looking for. But it's in part, I think, also -- I mean, there's been a little change in this. But by and large, the fast-food channel is sort of chicken and beef focused and we're a turkey and pork supply chain business. I think our leader of the group articulated in Investor Day their strategy to also really work on the noncommercial side of the Foodservice business and so they've had some very nice success in the college and university environment, in the health care world and so forth. So they're seeing better growth through that segment than what the overall industry is experiencing. That being said, I mean, we are -- I think the sort of secular comments we're hearing is a little bit of optimism coming out of them for the upcoming quarter for this segment as a whole, and our group feels it's well positioned to continue to have really solid quarter in Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Really, just more of a comment. Wanted to thank...","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","He disconnected, I guess. We'll have to go on to Jonathan Feeney.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Unworthy substitute, I must admit. I wanted to dig in a little bit more on Turkey Store business. As Akshay said, it just seems to hang in there and seems to be so much -- I mean, is it just dramatically less of a commodity business right now because of the branding and value-added you've done? And specifically, how much has the mix of business changed from 5 years ago versus from what you consider near to that the whole bird business commodity mix back then? So just 5 years ago versus where that is today. If you could give me sort of a ballpark estimate for thinking about that? Then I have one follow-up.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","True. Yes, I mean, clearly, the predominant results driver for Jennie-O Turkey Store are their value-added branded products that they sell at the retail deli and foodservice. The mix has -- I don't have the stats for you. Maybe Kevin can follow up with you on that. But clearly, it has changed over the 5-year time frame. Not only have we changed by virtue of those items, but I think if I'm remembering correctly, I think there's been 2 occasions over those 5 years that we've actually tightened our basic processing within the turkey business to make sure that we're staying fully in balance and that we're just supporting the value-added items and not throwing off a lot of additional commodity meat. So that's improved the percentage as well. And then on top of just sheer -- not having as many numbers, I mean, the team's done a nice job at driving other efficiency gains that have led to those results.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","It doesn't sound like it's dramatically different. It just sounds like of the value-added business then, you've just gotten -- been more effective at it. Is that a fair characterization?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, and the advertising has helped. This year is a little bit less significant campaign, but the last 2 years prior to this, we've -- $20 million-plus each year in terms of trying to drive business with really nice results. The past campaigns have featured burgers and turkey bacon and both of those, over the long time frame, are way up. I mean, well into the double-digit increases.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And my follow-up question, Jeff, is a while back you used to have this great -- like 10 years ago, in your presentation, you used to have this great pyramid where the top of the ladder you had high value-added items and you sort of -- the idea was to push people off that pyramid in terms of margin structure. Across the Refrigerated Foods and turkey business, I mean, could you differentiate -- have those margins at the top of the ladder just gotten bigger in the value-added space and that's why? Or you've done better across-the-board? Or is the mix of business in both Refrigerated and turkey just so much less in that commodity piece than it, say, was 5 or even 10 years ago that you're sustaining these higher margins?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I think the biggest impact would be the moving -- if you do that pyramid as having different floors, if you will, we've moved more items up more floor levels. I mean, the percentage of portfolio that's a higher level of value-add that has the higher differentiation and therefore more defensible margin position is greater in both the Refrigerated Foods group and in the Jennie-O group.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is actually a question for Kevin Jones.

Please note that during our call, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as organic volume and organic sales.","I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. ","Jim Snee","Thank you Nathan. Good morning everyone. Hormel Foods is an uncommon company, unique in our industry. We have a tenured management team who is able to quickly adjust to dynamic and volatile market conditions, a balanced portfolio of branded products sold through the retail, food service, deli and international channels, a direct sales force that is able to build and maintain relationships to help our customers grow their businesses, a reputation for bringing industry-leading innovations to the marketplace, and an increasingly agile and efficient supply chain. ","Our financial position and business fundamentals remain strong. This enables us to deliver growth organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our leadership position as a global branded food company allows us to take a long-term perspective as we navigate near-term uncertainty related to the various market conditions.","Our third quarter results demonstrate many of the qualities that make us uncommon. This morning we announced earnings per share of $0.37, a 5% decrease compared to last year but in line with our expectations. The decline in earnings per share was driven by a higher tax rate. Pre-tax profits grew 1% as excellent results from refrigerated foods offset declines from grocery products. Net sales declined 3% due to the divestiture of CytoSport. On an organic basis, sales were flat on a volume decline of 1%.","Looking at the segments, refrigerated food sales increased 1% on a volume decline of 1%. Segment profit increased 13% driven by higher value-added profitability. Lower operational costs and higher commodity profits played a smaller role in the profit improvement. Refrigerated foods achieved record third quarter net sales, value-added sales, segment profit, and value-added profit. This was quite an accomplishment by the refrigerated foods team. ","Our Hormel food service division had another solid quarter. The team continues to leverage their direct sales organization to grow brands such as Hormel Bacon 1, Hormel Fire Braised, Natural Choice, Fontanini, and Old Smokehouse. I remain impressed with the innovation this team continuously delivers to the food service industry. They are also making excellent progress filling the new capacity for precooked bacon and Fontanini products.","We remain very confident in our ability to grow the Applegate brand. Our food service team is making great progress growing Applegate with healthcare providers, colleges and universities. These operators appreciate the point of difference the Applegate brand provides for the needs of their patrons. For example, the Applegate Blend burger is filling a need in the college and university segment as students look for more ways to enjoy natural and organic alternative protein products. ","The new Hormel deli solutions division continues to pursue its vision of helping retailers create the deli of the future. While the Columbus brand and our prepared foods portfolio of products are showing solid growth, the lower margin behind-the-glass category continues to decline. Consumer preferences are changing as shoppers are looking for more convenient options such as grab-and-go products like our Hormel Gatherings party trays and our authentic line of Columbus charcuterie. While this shift away from the behind-the-glass category presents a near term challenge to sales volume, I\u2019m confident the ongoing shift benefits the consumer, the retailer, and our company over the long term. ","As category leaders, we took price increases across many of our branded value-added products when we started to see sharp increases in input costs. During the third quarter, we were priced high relative to others in many retail categories which created higher elasticity than we would typically expect. When higher input costs did not materialize as forecasted, we realigned our pricing to more closely match the commodity market. ","Once again, refrigerated foods has demonstrated an ability to generate growth in volatile market conditions. The long term growth of this segment continues to be driven by value-added products, disciplined pricing, and a clear focus on innovation. While we have seen how rapid changes in input costs can create noise in its quarterly results, the clarity, focus and alignment refrigerated foods demonstrates will continue to deliver sustainable growth.","Grocery products volume declined 10% while sales declined 11%. Organic volume in sales increased by 1%. Segment profit declined 30% year-over-year due to the divestiture of CytoSport, higher avocado costs for our Holy Guacamole business, and lower earnings from our Skippy peanut butter spreads business. ","Similar to what we experienced in 2017, avocado costs increased by over 100% during the quarter. A smaller California crop and strong global demand are driving the avocado market prices. In response, the MegaMex team is actively managing promotional tactics and will be evaluating pricing as the new crop is harvested during September. As always, we continue to focus on growing the Holy Guacamole brand through effective brand building, advertising and innovation. ","Our Skippy spreads business was negatively impacted by the price decline we took last quarter in response to a competitor\u2019s deflationary pricing. While we are disappointed in the category dynamic, we remain focused on building the Skippy brand through revenue growth management, effective advertising, and continued innovation.","A key reason for acquiring the Skippy brand was to deliver out-of-the-jar innovation to the category. The recent launch of Skippy PB&Jelly Minis has been met with great retailer and consumer acceptance. This innovative item sold in the frozen section is versatile, portable, and perfect for today\u2019s busy families. We have now reached national distribution and trial and repeat rates continue to improve. I\u2019m very optimistic about the success of this product line.","While Skippy spreads and Holy Guacamole had a difficult quarter, the balance of the grocery products portfolio performed well. Many of our center store brands such as Spam, Dinty Moore, Herdez, Black Label Bacon Bits, and Hormel Compleats all had a great quarter. I fully expect all of these brands will show growth for the full year.","Jennie-O turkey store volume decreased 4% while sales decreased 5%. Segment profits declined 9% due to lower value-added sales. As we discussed last quarter, we are reactivating promotional activity to gain back lost retail distribution. While we continue to lap distribution losses, we have had a few small wins. We expect the process of regaining distribution will go well into 2020. Over the last few months, we have made changes to the Jennie-O organization to bring in several experienced leaders from other parts of the company who are charged with restoring growth through new and bold ideas for this business. From an industry perspective, we continue to see lower JOTS placements but cold storage remains at elevated levels. Turkey market prices have not materially changes since last quarter.","International volume and sales were flat. Organic volume and sales increased 2% while segment profit was up 1%. Our team in China delivered strong results driven by our food service business in addition to growth from the Skippy and Spam brands. Exports continue to be affected by global trade uncertainty related to African swine fever and tariffs. ","Similar to the prior quarter, the uncertainty in the protein industry is related to the outbreak of African swine fever. On our second quarter call, we discussed our view that commodity markets would start to increase on higher demand for pork from China. While we have not seen consistently higher prices, we have seen higher volatility and expect that trend to continue.","As we evaluate the global impact of African swine fever, we are still confident that pork markets will eventually increase. At the appropriate time, we will take the necessary price increases to manage our profitability, which may create short term margin compression as pricing generally lags input cost increases. ","Taking all factors into account, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance of $1.71 to $1.85 per share. We are also reaffirming our sales guidance of $9.5 billion to $10 billion but expect to be on the lower end of the range given market prices have not increased as we previously expected. I have confidence in our teams\u2019 ability to adjust to the changing market conditions and deliver our full year outlook. ","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter and our earnings guidance, in addition to key assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2019.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you Jim. Good morning. Net sales for the third quarter were $2.3 billion. Organic sales growth in three of the four business segments was offset by declines at Jennie-O turkey store. Pre-tax earnings were $261 million, up 1% from last year. Net earnings were $199 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.37, down 5% due to a higher effective tax rate. ","The significant increase in the tax rate was driven primarily by lapping the one-time gain from re-measuring the deferred tax liability last year. The tax rate was higher than we anticipated because of the lower volume of options exercised in the quarter. The full year tax rate is now expected to be between 18.3% and 20.3%, up from the previous estimate of 17.5% to 19.5%. ","SG&A excluding advertising was 6.5% of sales compared to 7.3% last year. The decline was due to the impact of the CytoSport transaction and lower employee-related expenses. ","Net unallocated expense declined $10 million driven by lower interest expense and universal stock option expenses in the prior year. Advertising for the quarter was $32 million, down from $40 million last year. Advertising investments are expected to be lower primarily due to the sale of CytoSport. ","Operating margins were 11.2% compared to 10.9% last year. Strong results in refrigerated foods and favorable SG&A led to the improved performance. ","Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $573 million, down 23%. The primary driver was increased levels of working capital as we build inventory in anticipation of higher raw material costs. This thoughtful approach to building inventory should mitigate some of the input cost volatility as markets rise.","For the quarter, capital expenditures were $67 million compared to $103 million last year. We expect to spend approximately $250 million in 2019. Weather delays and changes in project scope impacted the projected capital spend. ","We paid the 364th consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15 at an annual rate of $0.84 per share, a 12% increase over the prior year. This completes our 91st year of consecutive dividends. Share repurchases in the quarter were $107 million, representing 2.7 million shares. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises and based on our internal valuation. Our balance sheet remains strong and allows us to fund strategic investments to grow the business. ","Fundamentals in the turkey industry are mixed. Bolt placements are down 4% year-to-date. Breast meat and cold storage is above last year and the five-year average. Turkey prices remained above $2 for the quarter, a 10% increase from last year. Whole birds were $0.07 above the prior year but remain below the five-year average. Feed costs for the quarter were similar to last year. Avocado prices are expected to decline through October but remain above last year. We will have better visibility as the Mexican crop is harvested in the next few weeks. ","Pork input costs in the third quarter did not dramatically increase as we forecasted last quarter. Cold storage reserves in China, uncertainty caused by global trade dynamics, and robust hog production likely contributed to lower markets. The USDA cutout traded between a wide range of $72 and $89 per hundredweight during the quarter, never reaching our forecasted level. Hog markets exhibited similar behavior, trading between $68 and $85 per hundredweight. Belly prices for the quarter were significantly below the forecast, trading in a $49 range between $127 and $176 per hundredweight. Trim briefly met the forecasted highs before dropping 40%. ","The third quarter clearly demonstrated our teams\u2019 ability to manage through extreme volatility in pork commodity markets to deliver results in line with our expectations. The guidance for the fourth quarter assumes higher prices for our key inputs with potential for volatility like we experienced in the past quarter. The overall fundamentals still support a sustained high cost environment in pork markets beginning as soon as the fourth quarter due to African swine fever. Hog supplies in China, Southeast Asia, and now regions in Europe are being affected. The exact timing and magnitude of the impact remains uncertain. We will provide a detailed view of market assumptions and the outlook for fiscal 2020 on the November call.","We are making significant progress on Project Orion and our One Supply Chain initiative. For example, we are in the process of opening two new distribution centers in the coming months. On a combined basis, we will save over 3 million miles in our grocery business alone. Project Orion will unlock more opportunities for cost savings similar to this project. The team is focused on implementing major phases related to finance, HR, and supply chain during fiscal 2020. ","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the Operator for the question and answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","We\u2019ll take our first question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. ","Erica Eiler","Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. First, as we look at SG&A here, down nearly 15% this quarter, I was just hoping to better understand what the SG&A expense run rate was ex-CytoSport, what\u2019s driving that performance and how you\u2019re thinking about the expense opportunities going forward. ","Jim Sheehan","Good morning. We think that the run rate will be generally lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year primarily because of the CytoSport sale. ","Erica Eiler","Okay. Then given a lot of moving pieces in your business, from CytoSport to Skippy, Jennie-O, African swine fever, just wondering if there are any early thoughts you can provide on fiscal \u201920 at this juncture. Any puts or takes we should be thinking about would be helpful.","Jim Snee","Yes, it is early for 2020 given the uncertainty and the volatility that we\u2019ve seen in the markets, but as we think about all of the different business segments, refrigerated foods continues to be very well positioned and they\u2019ve demonstrated their ability, their long term ability to grow in volatile markets across food service, deli, retail. Grocery products, although we had some noise in the quarter with avocadoes, we remain positive on many, many of the brands, and of course we could have some input pressure there but I think the longer term brand story and the insight-led innovation have us poised for growth.","JOTS continues to be a work in progress, as I said in my prepared comments. We\u2019ve had some small wins but we do expect the recovery to spill over well into 2020. We think the business is stabilized and now we do need to get back to growth. ","International is obviously a wild card, uncertainty based on African swine fever and tariffs, but we\u2019re optimistic about the business that we have in China. We feel like we can reflect pricing to accommodate any of the input costs that we have, and then also the Spam and Skippy businesses that we\u2019ve developed are very strong. ","Then any conversation about our business has to finish with a strong balance sheet, so we are poised for M&A. We\u2019re always ready to make acquisitions when the time is right. But it\u2019s early for 2020 given some of the uncertainty in the marketplace, but we are confident in our ability to grow over the long term.","Erica Eiler","Okay great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc.","Ben Bienvenu","Thank you, good morning. I want to ask a clarifier question about the guidance for this year. Jim, you said that you expect full year sales guidance to be towards the lower end of the range. The earnings guidance for 4Q is quite wide. Would you expect EPS guidance to reflect your commentary on the sales guidance? ","Jim Snee","No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair assumption, Ben. I think from a top line perspective, it is how we\u2019re pricing, and as we mentioned the prepared comments, as markets did not materialize the way we thought, we did realign pricing in the quarter to make sure that we remained in very competitive positions. I think the sales guidance is one thing and it is different from the earnings guidance.","Ben Bienvenu","Okay, great. A follow-up on the pricing. Can you help us think about how you think about using trade promotion spend to reduce the pricing increases that you had put in place versus actual list price reductions, particularly in an environment where input costs are as volatile as they\u2019ve been over the last several months?","Jim Snee","The interesting thing is it is unique and different retailer by retailer, and we\u2019ve talked about that over the last several quarters, about how that\u2019s important to engage our direct selling organization with the customers to understand what the optimal solution is for their customer base. We do move promotional dollars or trade dollars around to make sure that we\u2019ve got them priced properly on a net basis. We work closely, of course, to make sure that the shelf price is reflective of where it needs to be, but again depending on the situation, we\u2019re willing to invest the trade dollars but it is a customer by customer decision.","Ben Bienvenu","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research LLC.","Heather Jones","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to a comment you made about raw material, I think you were talking about cash flow, use of cash. I was just wondering if you could flesh that out more, which segments are you building raw materials, and any practical limitations. I mean, do you have the capacity to build substantial raw material inventories that could cover portions of 2020 or is it more limited to a quarter? Just wondering if you could help us understand that more.","Jim Sheehan","Certainly. The inventory\u2019s really being built in the refrigerated, GP and international areas. Are there limits? Yes, there\u2019s a supply limit as to how much you can build inventory. We take a look at the trends that we believe are going to take place and we build selectively in certain commodities and certain finished goods.","Heather Jones","Okay, thank you. My next question is on Jennie-O. You mentioned that the recovery is going to spill over into 2020. In your efforts to regain distribution, I would assume you have to be somewhat sharper on price. I was wondering, is the anticipation that that would be only for a year or so, or how long do you think you would have to lock into pricing to regain the distribution? Basically, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what kind of lag could we see in Jennie-O recovering with broader protein markets over the next year or so.","Jim Snee","I think as we said, Heather, this does remain a distribution issue. Our velocities where we\u2019re in distribution remain very strong. We have had some small wins, as I said in my prepared remarks, so we are gaining some momentum. We\u2019ve turned on advertising in select markets and we\u2019ll have the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness before expanding. ","I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have brought in some additional experienced sales and marketing leaders from other parts of the organization to really jumpstart that business, but it\u2019s still going to take time, so as we\u2019re thinking about it, it\u2019s probably going to be mid-2020. You\u2019re right - there are some investments that have to be made to regain distribution, but we\u2019re prepared to make those investments and really, the big thing is that we do feel like this business is stabilized and it is time for us to get this business back to growth. ","Heather Jones","Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Just digging a little bit more into the outlook for the fourth quarter, it is a wide range on the earnings side. Jim, I appreciate the comments that the sales and earnings don\u2019t necessarily align at the lower end of the range, but just help me understand the range of outcomes that get you towards the low and high end of the range. Presumably the bigger variable is pork raw material costs, but just help me think about the range of outcomes you\u2019ve laid out in your outlook.","Jim Snee","Sure. You hit it right on the head, Adam - it is all about the input costs, and that will impact pricing and of course the elasticity that comes along with the pricing moves. If we get some additional false positives like we had in the second quarter, that could be problematic, but the run-up in input costs, as you know, it does create that short term margin compression. But we\u2019ll be aggressive with our pricing as category leaders, that\u2019s what we do, but we know that pricing does lag the input costs.","You\u2019ve hit it right on the head - that is going to be the primary driver for that range, and we do believe that the range is warranted given some of the volatility that we\u2019ve seen in the third quarter.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. I was hoping to understand a little bit more, digging into 2020 the things that are in your control. Maybe on Project Orion specifically and some of the supply chain initiatives, can you quantify how much those actually benefited the quarter on a net basis, how much they\u2019re benefiting 2019 on a net basis or what your run rate exiting the year looks like, to think about potential savings into 2020 before we then layer on a sales or raw material input cost view?","Jim Snee","Sure. If we go back to my earlier comments starting with the segments, from a 2020 outlook, the food service business continues to be hitting on all cylinders. We feel really good about the belly business, the retail business, whether it\u2019s our Hormel retail business, the Applegate retail business. We\u2019re optimistic about all of them. We know that there could be some of that short term noise, that margin compression as a result of input costs, but refrigerated foods has really been on a nice run and we expect that to continue.","Grocery products, the work that the team has done there around brand building with center-of-the-store brands has been really, really impressive. We do think that the avocado crop that\u2019s coming in, we\u2019ll have a better read on that, probably some more favorable input costs that will give us some relief there. That\u2019s outside of our control, but what\u2019s in our control is our ability to make sure that we\u2019re building that brand through promotion and advertising and innovation, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. We do feel good about grocery products.","Probably the one that\u2019s outside of our control the most will be international, based on what happens with African swine fever and tariffs and really the global trade uncertainty. Part of it is in our control with our ability to run our business in China, but there are going to be some market impacts. Then the JOTS piece is going to be in our control and our ability to execute the business, or execute distribution gains. We\u2019ve got to get that done, continue to get that done in the fourth quarter and into 2020. ","From a supply chain perspective, we\u2019re not going to get into the 2020 outlook for that, but we\u2019re committed to the savings number that we gave this year, the $75 million. We\u2019ve had a lot of success with a lot of projects. We referenced in Jim Sheehan\u2019s comments the fact that we\u2019ve got our new grocery products DC opening that will save us 3 million miles, and there is a corresponding financial benefit. We\u2019re evaluating our refrigerated foods network, and we\u2019ve had a better global view of plant for performance. So there is a lot of benefits that we\u2019ve seen from not only our One Supply Chain but Project Orion, and we expect that to continue over the next several years.","Adam Samuelson","If I could just sneak one quick follow-up, the capex reduction for this year, there was some timing but there\u2019s also allusion to project scope changes. How much of that, I think it was a $100 million reduction, really comes in next year versus the actual cost of the programs or the projects goes down?","Jim Snee","The majority of that is timing. We had a really wet spring here in the midwest and we\u2019ve got a very big project going on at Burke, so that\u2019s shifted some of those expenses back. But the one thing I want everyone to know is that there is not a lack of commitment. Our commitment to capex spending and investing in our value-added business is as strong as it\u2019s ever been.","Adam Samuelson","Okay, I appreciate the color. Thanks. ","Operator","As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, to join the queue it\u2019s star, one on your telephone keypad.","Next, we\u2019ll go to Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group.","Eric Larson","Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Either Jim can answer this question. We\u2019ve seen a lot of hog supplies on the market, particularly June and July, etc., and again a lot of volatility with lean hog pricing. My question is have farmers anticipated ASF? Do you think there\u2019s been expansion in the herd industry because of ASF or not? What might be some of the dynamics that you see going on? Obviously we\u2019ve got corn prices back down sharply as well, soybean meal as well, but what might be the mentality for hog expansion that we see out there for the next 12 months, and what\u2019s happened recently, do you think?","Jim Sheehan","Well, I think some of it is a reaction to the additional hog processing capacity that\u2019s in the industry right now, and anticipating that capacity increasing, they\u2019ve increased their production. We certainly do see that hogs today are about $70. They\u2019re a relatively cheap input. There\u2019s cheap input, as you said- the grain is at a low cost basis right now, so I think there are encouragements to increase the hog production. It\u2019s in line with what expectations were, but I think probably the biggest driver was that there\u2019s been probably two years or more of discussion about the additional capacity coming online. They\u2019ve had time to react, and those hogs are available to us.","Eric Larson","Okay. Then just a broader follow-up, it\u2019s to your comments, Mr. Snee--Jim, about your supply chain efforts. It\u2019s a multi-year project, so you\u2019ve quantified what you thought your supply chain savings would be this year. Without getting into specifics, this something that is a multi-year project, is there a way to try to quantify what that might be, or are you in a position you can talk about that?","Jim Snee","I think when we get into our fourth quarter call, we\u2019ll obviously give a little more color and clarity. The other variable as we continue down the path with Project Orion, we\u2019ll have more opportunities that will reveal themselves. But the part about this being a multi-year project, I don\u2019t even know if I would refer to it as a project. This is a permanent part, a permanent structure that we have in our organization that we\u2019ve needed. I cited a couple of specific examples. As we think about just having that global view of plant performance, better meat utilization, and even some of the softer things about how we\u2019re better prepared to approach training and recruitment in an environment where workers are harder than ever to come by, it\u2019s important that we have one standard approach to how we\u2019re doing things, so the benefits of the One Supply Chain initiative have been very impressive and far reaching in the organization on a number of different fronts. ","Eric Larson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thanks. A couple questions. The price increases that you took in May, are they all reversed now or is there any residue of that pricing still in the market?","Jim Snee","Hey Rob, good morning. It really depends on the category. If you think about what happened in bacon, for example, that pricing does tend to realign itself more frequently, so we\u2019ve seen realignment down and the market now has taken another run back up. It has moved a couple of times since we last talked, but we know that that\u2019s what we have to do to remain competitive. In terms of pepperoni, the pricing that we took there was realigned because the trim market did not at all sustain what we thought it was going to do, and remains low today. On our grocery products front, the Spam pricing that we took, that held, but that really was less related to raw material, more other inflationary measures. So it\u2019s really been a mixed bag across the different categories, but we feel good about the pricing actions we took and the corresponding realignments.","Robert Moskow","Got it. Then a follow-up - the grocery division, I haven\u2019t seen the margins dip below 11% in a quarter, I don\u2019t remember the last time. I think you\u2019re kind of hinting around here that, hey a lot of it is transitory related to the crop availability and all that, but why wasn\u2019t the crop availability this big of an issue in second and first quarter for avocadoes? Like why is it suddenly hurting the margin to this degree, and then as we look forward, how quickly can we assume that a normal crop in September will adjust the margins higher?","Jim Snee","That\u2019s a great question. The secondary crop impacts our supply situation primarily in Q3, and if you go back to 2017 not on an overall GP margin structure, but if you go back, we had a very similar situation in 2017. At that time, we were very aggressive with our pricing, and this time we re-evaluated and thought we were going to be in a better position to just wait to see what the next crop looks like. So this secondary crop primarily impacts us in Q3 and then in early Q4, we start to get a better read on the primary crop. Early indications are that that\u2019s more favorable, so that will have some impact in Q4 but then we\u2019ll have the primary impact again in Q1 and Q2.","Robert Moskow","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. It\u2019s August, so I\u2019m going to ask question number three, here. You talked about Project Orion and the supply chain efforts, and I get that; but I think you also mentioned finance, HR, as well as supply chain as areas where you\u2019ll be evaluating more productivity. Can you be more specific on what that means?","Jim Sheehan","Certainly. We will be implementing a single instance of all of our ERP systems across finance, HR, and the supply chain, meaning that all operations will be operated on a common platform. We\u2019ll create great efficiencies in the operations. We\u2019re also focusing on automation and robotics within certain processes, so those are things that Project Orion brings to us. It\u2019s going to make us a more efficient company in many aspects, and obviously the other issue is the quality of information and the decisions that we can make based on that data. Where before we\u2019d have to mine through multiple systems to get information, this will provide a common platform. The information will be readily available and we can do analysis across all aspects of the business.","Robert Moskow","Very good, thank you.","Operator","Once again ladies and gentlemen, to ask a question, it\u2019s star, one on your telephone keypad.","Next we\u2019ll go to Thomas Palmer with JP Morgan.","Thomas Palmer","Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Wanted to first kick off talking about the price elasticity that you saw on pork products. Was it as you expected? Do you think it was a little more severe because you were out of line with the industry, and what insights does that give you as you think about potentially layering on new price increases in the coming year?","Jim Snee","We saw greater elasticity than we thought, especially in bacon and pepperoni. It really was the fact that the markets did not perform on a continuous basis, so we reached some points of elevation in the belly market and the trim market that really put us into action on the pricing front. What changed was we took pricing, some of the others in the category didn\u2019t, and then the markets didn\u2019t sustain, so when that happened we were priced higher than the category, which created those higher than expected elasticities. That\u2019s where our pricing realignment came in. ","Once we got our pricing realigned, we felt like the elasticities were in line with what we expected. Bacon is back on track, we think pepperoni is, and then we did talk a little bit about the grocery products pricing that we held with Spam. From Spam\u2019s perspective, volume was relatively flat and sales were up 4%, so if anything, that outperformed the elasticity we expected ","So as I said earlier, it really was a mixed bag across all of the different categories where we took pricing.","Thomas Palmer","Okay, thanks for that. I just wanted to circle on the avocado side. It sounds like you elected not to take pricing in part because you think that at least a portion of this severe inflation you\u2019re experiencing is temporary. If you do decide early in the fourth quarter as you get the read through, how long does it take to implement pricing? When does that start to materialize in terms of the P&L impact from a COGS standpoint that either the crop is favorable or not? Is this come the first quarter we would see both pricing and COGS basket changing for the new crop, or is the timing different than that?","Jim Snee","Got it. You would expect to see impact tail end of the fourth quarter, really into the first quarter either way. From a pricing perspective, if we do choose to take pricing, it\u2019s very consistent with the other retail pricing dynamics that we see and expect it to take approximately 60 days to get into the marketplace. The team will have a pretty good read on it in short order, and we\u2019ll be able to make the right business decision. ","Thomas Palmer","o","Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Good morning. I have a question about the grocery products margin. Was there any part of the margin decline there that can be attributed to the sale of the CytoSport business, or is that entirely explained by avocadoes and peanut butter pricing?","Jim Sheehan","From a margin standpoint, it\u2019s really about the avocado prices and the peanut butter.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Okay, so nothing at all from CytoSport?","Jim Sheehan","No. As we\u2019ve stated, CytoSport would have about a $0.04 impact for the back half of the year from a P&L standpoint, but from margins, it\u2019s really driven by the avocado costs and the peanut butter.","Jim Snee","Yes, the existing businesses that we have.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Okay, thanks. My second question is with this global protein shortage resulting from ASF, is there any reason to believe that this wouldn\u2019t improve the demand for turkey heading into next year?","Jim Snee","I think that\u2019s a fair assumption. We need to see how this all plays out through this global trade uncertainty and how the global supply reorganizes, but I do think there is a point of view out there that says poultry products, turkey in particular, could benefit. We\u2019ll see how that materializes the balance of this year and into 2020, but I think that\u2019s a fair assumption.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","I show we have no further questions. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional comments or closing remarks.","Jim Snee","Great, thank you. Thanks to all of you for your participation and interest this morning. While our team continues to navigate near term uncertainty, I remain very certain in our teams\u2019 ability to deliver our key results and finish 2019 in a very strong manner. Thank you.

Welcome to the Hormel Foods\u2019 Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, May 24, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nathan Annis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Nathan Annis","Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods\u2019 conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6:30 AM Eastern. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our Web site at www.hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.","On our call today is Jim Snee, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Sheehan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim Snee will provide a review of each segment's performance for the quarter, and our outlook for the remainder of 2018.

Discussion on non GAAP information as detailed in our press release located on our corporate Web site. Please note that during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as organic net sales and organic volume.","I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.","Jim Snee","Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report on our second quarter results this morning. Our team successfully navigated through macro and commodity headwinds this quarter to deliver record earnings per share of $0.44, up 13% and in line with our expectations.","Our balanced business model allowed us to mitigate double-digit increases in freight, a dynamic park environment and continued oversupply in the turkey industry. The benefit from tax reform also contributed to our record results. Second quarter sales were also a record for our Company, and we are encouraged by many positive trends across our portfolio. Total Company sales for the quarter were up 7% on a 3% volume increase. The increases were driven by the recent strategic acquisitions of Ceratti, Columbus Craft Meats and Fontanini.","On an organic basis, volume decreased 1% while sales were flat. Many value-added brands in each segment grew, but the gains were offset by lower results from Jennie-O Turkey store, CytoSport and our contract manufacturing business. Recent third-party consumption data supports the growth we are seeing across many of our brands and household penetration figures also suggest solid momentum, especially with millennials.","In terms of segment performance, refrigerated foods grew segment profit 18% despite a difficult freight environment and a 25% decline in commodity profits. The strength of our value-added portfolio in both retail and food service coupled with lower input cost allowed us to generate strong growth. Sales increased 14% on a 6% volume increase, primarily related to the acquisition of Columbus Craft Meats and Fontanini.","Our Hormel Natural Choice franchise showed very strong growth this quarter. The Natural Choice brand has been gaining share in the retail marketplace and with food service operators since its introduction in 2006. Over the past few years, the brand has evolved with the change in consumer preferences towards all-natural. We have broadened our offerings in the lunch meat category, while expanding into bacon, pepperoni and handheld snacks.","This past quarter, we fully converted our rev product line to an all-natural formulation and re-launched the products under the Natural Choice brand. The results to-date have been impressive. We have increased our distribution, grown household penetration and improved in-store velocities. Natural Choice is a great example of how a strong brand combined with our culture of innovation to drive growth and expand over time.","Food service sales of Hormel Bacon One fully-cooked bacon, Hormel fire braised meats and Caf\u00e9 H products, all generated excellent growth this quarter as we continue to partner with and deliver innovative solutions to operators who are facing time and labor challenges. We have successfully integrated Fontanini's manufacturing and logistics into our global supply chain, and are in the process of integrating the sales and marketing functions into our Hormel food service division. In addition to the Fontanini integration, the reorganization of our various deli businesses into refrigerated foods is well underway, and we are in the early stages of integrating the Columbus craft meats business. Both the Fontanini and Columbus acquisitions are on track and meeting expectations.","Our international segment delivered sales growth of 22% on a volume increase of 14%, primarily related to the acquisition of Ceratti. Organic sales growth of 8% was driven by improved business in China, our SPAM sales in China continue to gain momentum, placing us ahead of our distributional expectations. International segment profit growth was 6% as improved profitability in China was partially offset by higher advertising expenses.","Jennie-O Turkey store earnings declined 34%, while sales declined 4%. Lower whole bird pricing and volume drove the lower results this quarter. Jennie-O lean ground turkey and our Oven Ready brand continued to perform well. As a reminder, our grocery products and specialty foods teams merged as of the beginning of this fiscal year, and we now report consolidated results as grocery products.","For the quarter, our core grocery products portfolio continued to remain healthy and vibrant, delivering low single-digit sales growth, led by establish brands such as SPAM, Dinty Moore and Hormel chili as well as emerging brands such as Wholly Guacamole and Herdez. The gains in our center store portfolio were not able to offset the decline in sales from CytoSport and our contract manufacturing business.","Total grocery rate product segment profit was down due to increased promotional activity and lower volumes at CytoSport, and lower earnings from our contract manufacturing business. The CytoSport business is facing numerous headwinds. Our team understands the various dynamics in each of the key channels. Our challenges lie primarily in our convenience store and specialty channel businesses. We are having success in the food, drug and mass channel, which will continue to be an area of focus for us as we work to grow the MUSCLE MILK brand.","While this business is not where we expected to be, the move into the grocery products segments will provide more branding and marketing resources and I expect that shift will return CytoSport to growth.","Turning to our second half outlook. We expect a strong finish in many of our businesses. We expect grocery products to continue their strong momentum in our core portfolio into the second half and return to growth. For Jennie-O Turkey store, we still expect earnings to decline in the back half compared to last year. Beginning next quarter, the commodity pressures we felt in our value added businesses last year will be annualized but we will not lap the declines in the whole bird business until the first quarter of 2019. Our successful Make the Switch campaign will return this summer supporting our lean ground turkey and other value-added businesses.","Signs of supply reductions are encouraging and we see Jennie-O Turkey store returning to growth in the first half of fiscal 2019. The outlook remains positive for our international segment as we continue to capture the benefits from our new plant in Joshing China. To-date, we have been successful exporting pork around the world. However, given the uncertain impact of the tariffs on the pork industry, we are expecting modestly lower sales and margin in our export business. Favorable performance for our China meat business should offset the potential impact on export sales.","Our view of refrigerated foods has not changed from the first quarter. We expect our value-added businesses in retail and food service, and the acquisitions of Fontanini and Columbus, to offset declines in commodity profits and freight headwinds. Jim Sheehan will provide insights into our view of the hog and pork industry, and where we continue to see volatility.","This quarter, we saw a double-digit increase in per-unit freight costs, due to both the lack of availability of trucks and an increase in diesel fuel surcharges. We continue to work with our customers to find mutually agreeable solutions to offset these increases. Rising freight costs will continue to have an impact in the second half of 2018 and into 2019.","Taking all these factors into account, we are reaffirming our sales guidance of $9.7 billion to $10.1 billion and our earnings guidance of $1.81 to $1.95 per share. As we think about the second half, we see a slightly higher cadence in the fourth quarter as we were dealing with the run-up in key input cost last year.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and key assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Volume for the second quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, a 3% increase compared to last year. We had record sales for the second quarter of $2.3 billion, a 7% increase. Organic volume decreased 1% and organic sales were flat.","Net earnings were $237 million, up 13% compared to last year. Refrigerated foods benefited from our strategy of growing value-added sales through innovation and acquisitions, as well as the benefit of declining input costs. As Jim reported, refrigerated foods\u2019 profits were up 18%, while commodity profits declined 25%. Commodity profits reflect the fresh pork and provision sales less the cost to procure and process hogs. Commodity profits in the quarter were below the long-term benchmark of 15% of total refrigerated foods profits.","Excluding advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.1% of sales compared to 6.9% last year. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A was flat on a dollar basis. Advertising expense this quarter was $37 million compared to $30 million last year. We expect to increase advertising by approximately 20% in 2018. We are currently advertising key growth brands, including SKIPPY, SPAM, Jennie-O and Natural Choice.","General corporate expenses increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses, including healthcare. As you think about the remainder of the year, the universal stock option award made to our 20,000 employees will impact corporate expenses in the third quarter. This represents approximately $0.01 per share. Operating margins were 13.1%, a 130 basis point decrease compared to last year. The decline is primarily a result of lower margins at Jennie-O and CytoSport along with higher freight costs.","Our effective tax rate was 20% compared to 33.2% last year. The lower tax rate provided $45 million benefit compared to the prior year. As we continue to assess tax reform, we have narrowed the range for our full year tax rate to be between 17.5% and 19.5%. Year-to-date, we have generated operating cash flows of $443 million, up 58%.","The increase was related to higher earnings and improved working capital as we communicated at Investor Day one of our priorities is to improve our cash conversion cycle. For the last 12 months, we took three days out of our cash cycle as all three components improved. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $87 million compared to $39 million last year. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $425 million in 2018.","Projects include the replacement of our Melrose plant, the bacon expansion in Wichita, upgrades to the Austin plant, numerous capacity expansions and ongoing investments for food and employee safety. In the quarter, we paid $99 million in dividends at the annual rate of $0.75 per share. This marked our 359th consecutive quarterly dividend.","Total debt is $810 million. This was split between short-term loans, which we plan to pay off this fiscal year, and long-term debt. We remain in a strong financial position to fund other investments. We repurchased $20 million in stock this quarter at an average price of $32.95 per share. Input costs for the second quarter were mixed. Hog prices were 9% lower than last year. As we communicated in prior quarters, our expectation is for low single-digit increases to hog prices in the back half of our fiscal year. We will continue to focus on three factors; export demand, domestic demand and total hog supplies, compared to industry capacity.","Exports continue to be strong, and USDA forecast exports to be up 5% in 2018. We are watching export demand carefully. Domestic consumption remains very strong. Retail pork prices remain steady, and we continue to see pork clearing the market at current prices. We expect hog supplies to increase 3% to 4% this year. We continue to believe total hog supplies are well masked to industry capacity over the long-term. We remain vigilant in our assessment of the industry, and will make the necessary changes to ensure we are sourcing pork for our value-added products at the lowest possible cost. We continue to procure more raw materials externally, offsetting the 3% decrease in our existing hog harvest facilities.","Deli prices were 20% lower than last year. We expect deli prices to remain volatile but in line with 2017 levels for the back half of the fiscal year. 72% pork trim prices were 5% below last year. We expect trim markets to be lower than 2017 levels and the back half. 50% beef trim was 7% lower compared to last year. We expect beef prices to be lower than 2017 levels. Market costs for beef were higher compared to last year. We expect beef cost to be higher year-over-year in the back half. We're starting to see the early signs of a recovery in the turkey industry. All placements have shown low single-digit declines in recent months. Industry harvest levels have decreased and turkey breast meat in cold storage is now below last year. Inventory of whole birds remains elevated at 14% above last year.","Turkey breast meat prices increased during the quarter. Breast meat is currently trading around $1.84 per pound compared to $1.55 per pound at the beginning of the quarter. We expect moderate increases in turkey prices for the back half of the year. Whole bird prices are 19% lower than 2017 levels, and we do not expect a material change in pricing until the first quarter of fiscal 2019.","Regardless of our market projections, the one constant in the current market is volatility. The second quarter demonstrates our ability to manage through volatility. Rapid changes in markets can affect results in the short term, but we have the capacity to adjust and continue growing earnings for our shareholders.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer\u2026","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Akshay Jagdale of Jeffries. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually [Lubi] on for Akshay. I wanted to ask question on turkey. So you mentioned that you're seeing some encouraging signs in the turkey business, it seems to be making your outlook for Jennie-O in fiscal \u201919 somewhat more positive. I\u2019m wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on what exactly you\u2019re seeing out there, and maybe what changed the most since the last quarter. I think you might have tempered expectations a little bit last time around.","Jim Snee","Our Jennie-O Turkey Store business, they are continuing to navigate difficult industry conditions, but we are seeing signs of supply reductions. And we talked about the industry harvest, which is down 3% year-to-date. We are seeing pork placements down low single digits, which is a good metric. The cold storage inventories, we\u2019re seeing breast meat down 3%. On the other hand, we are seeing whole birds up 14%.","As we\u2019re thinking through this, fairly those are some positive indicators for the business. But because of that run up in whole bird inventories and the decrease in the whole bird market, that\u2019s still going to have an impact on the back half of this year and into early 2019. But we do think these indicators are going to continue. And then of course through the work that we're doing on the value-added business with our Jennie-O lean ground turkey our Oven Ready turkey items, we believe that we\u2019re still well-positioned to return to growth in the first half of 2019.","Unidentified Analyst","And then if I could ask the question on the freight cost situation. So I know freight cost continue to be a challenge. And I think last time around, you had mentioned that you were starting to look at some measures to mitigate some of that impact. I\u2019m wondering if you could just give us a progress update on how that's been going. And to the extent that you are looking at pass some of that on, how have those conversations been going with some of your customers? Thanks.","Jim Snee","As a reminder, freight is has been a headwind. We expect it to continue in the second half and into 2019. And we\u2019ve been working to solve it a few different ways. We did talk about working with our customers to find mutually agreeable solutions. And we\u2019re thinking about minimizing miles, maximizing weight, how many days a week do you need delivery. And I will tell you that our customers are very open to those discussions.","Of course, we\u2019re working internally to make sure that we are as efficient as we can be. And then there are situations where we are taking pricing as well when we\u2019re unable to find those mutually agreeable solutions. So it is a variable plethora of things that we\u2019re working on. But again the big message here I think is that it's going to continue to be a headwind back half of this year and into 2019.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheim. Your line is now open, please go ahead.","Rupesh Parikh","So maybe to start out, as we look at your guidance range for this year, you guys reaffirm guidance. But you still kept a pretty wide range. So I was just curious, as you look at that range, what factors could drive the high-end versus the low end of the range?","Jim Snee","The reason we kept the range where it is, we know that there's still volatility in the marketplace; and volatility in terms of what's happening in the pork industry; volatility in terms of what's happening in the freight industry; and so we felt that it was very appropriate to keep that range. From our perspective, as we think about the second half of the year, refrigerated foods is poised to have a strong second half.","Our value-added business will continue to offset what we expect to be commodity declines; Jennie-O Turkey store going to continue to be up against industry oversupply pressures, and whole bird pricing. Our international business and we talked a little bit about what could potentially happen with tariffs in pork, but our business in China is doing quite well. And so I mean there's a number of things out there that can set us up for a strong second half and that's what we're expecting in our business.","Rupesh Parikh","And then switching gears to CytoSport. So you mentioned in your prepared comments some of the challenges in the convenience and specialty channels. So I was curious as you look at the challenges there is that more -- is that category challenges, or is something changing from a competitive perspective? And what the plans are to improve performance within those two channels?","Jim Snee","From our perspective, it's really a competitive issue. And we called out the C-store in the specialty channel, because that's where our challenges are. In the C-store business, we are still recovering from a third party recall in 2016. We thought we had some signs of life in the first quarter that didn't play out into the second quarter, so we know that we still have work to do to get our distribution back in line.","Our brand teams are working on consumer messaging, and making sure that we have the right pricing. The specialty channel is something that is less competitive and probably more structural as sales in that channel continue to migrate online. We're working to move more of our sales online through our digital experience effort that we have going on.","And so the other thing I would tell you is, at the beginning of year, we did merge specialty foods into grocery products. And we believe that that is going to offer the appropriate level of branding and marketing support. So we do expect results to improve in the back half. But I would tell you that that\u2019s mostly due to easy comps. Our bigger concern for the business is really getting it back to a healthy and sustainable growth level.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Ken Zaslow","Just two questions. One is can you give us an update on the cost savings program, where is that right now, what is your technology to be able to capture the synergies, where are you on that? That's the first question. Thank you.","Jim Snee","So we told you in Q1, Ken, that we're working to get the structure and process in place. We've had Glenn Leitch heading up our supply chain now for all of four months. And we are making progress in that area, and our focus is on progress. He's been very busy working on a number of different things, operational consistency, labor utilization, looking at our broad co-packer network. We had a question already around fright, and he has been active in that space. And so we are still in, I would say, the structure process and progress mode, and we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. But we are still not where we need to be in terms of the methodology.","Ken Zaslow","How long will that take before you have parameters in -- even if you don\u2019t give us the details, when will you guys have inside into what you will accomplish by when, and if that will impact 2019?","Jim Snee","I think we have insights into what we\u2019re achieving. So we know what we\u2019re capturing. I think the issue for us is we want to make sure that those numbers, whether they are being reinvested are going through to the bottom line that is still a work in process for us. Cost savings, as we\u2019ve told you, is not new to us, it\u2019s something that we've had throughout our business for a very long time. We are just trying to take a more global approach to it.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","I guess my first question would be around refrigerated, and maybe just trying to get a little more color on the performance and the expectation with organic volumes still down year-on-year. Is that just a function of your lower harvest levels internally? And I mean the price mix was up year-on-year despite pork price declines, especially deli price declines. I am just trying to think about how that mix really evolved between some of your more commodity products on the sell side and the value-added, some other pieces in there?","Jim Snee","I mean we\u2019ve said for some time in refrigerated foods, the focus on the long term trend really is for growing our value-added sales. And we know that there's going to be some short term noise with changes in markets and commodity profits. And I think we\u2019re still seeing that play out. Some of the new capacity has come online much slower than announced. But we\u2019re still worried about controlling what we can control, and really that's driving our value-added business. And we\u2019re doing that with Natural Choice, Bacon 1, the strategic acquisition of Columbus, which is doing very well. And that's the refrigerated food story going forward.","And so we\u2019re pleased with that business. We are and we did say that the volume growth was driven by those acquisitions. And so we\u2019re pleased that those strategies are playing out as well.","Adam Samuelson","And then on the acquisitions, I mean, can you talk about how they were doing themselves organically between Columbus and Fontanini. And as we think about just where those have been performing?","Jim Snee","I would tell you that both of those are meeting our expectations, and both of them are showing growth year-over-year. They\u2019re in different stages of the integration process. Fontanini, we\u2019ve got the operations piece integrated, and we\u2019re ahead on the sales and marketing integration in the food service. From a Columbus perspective, we are starting the systems and operations integration here the next several weeks. And then the sales and marketing integration is a work in process but that will be up and running for fiscal 2019.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Farha Aslam of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Farha Aslam","My first question is really focused on a broader pricing question, I mean, as you look to cross the various parts of your business. How successful have you been in terms of implementing pricing for freight, packaging and commodity? And could you share with us your ability to price in the current market environment to protect margins?","Jim Snee","Just as a reminder, there\u2019re different ways that we price in both the food service and retail channel; in our food service business, we probably are on 30 day lag; on the retail side of the business, probably more like 60 days. And we feel like we are still in a very strong position to be able to take pricing when appropriate. And we think what happened to our business towards the tail end of last year really supports that position. If you think about how we were faced with significant input cost increases, in six of our seven largest inputs, we took pricing on Wholly Guacamole, SKIPPY, chili, stew, hash.","And it\u2019s not easy but we were able to get that pricing through. So it's not easy but it certainly is achievable. And then I think you can see how that plays out as we wrap up the second quarter, some of the items that we\u2019re talking about that showed growth were Wholly, chili, stew, and hash. So we believe that we have the appropriate pricing power when necessary. On the freight side of the business, wouldn't say that we\u2019ve recaptured all the freight costs. But I think the fact that we\u2019re going at it in a myriad of different ways is the right way to do it.","Farha Aslam","And then a very specific question. Could you address the contract manufacturing? Is that declined simply your purposeful exit of lower margin business? Is that something that will continue to be a factor for Hormel, or is this contained in the current quarter?","Jim Snee","Well, our contract manufacturing business is -- it\u2019s not a strategic play for us. It is and I think we\u2019ve been pretty open about it. It is more of a capacity play for us. And I think we all see what\u2019s happening in the contract manufacturing environment. It\u2019s a tough competitive environment. We experienced that this quarter. And we know that it's going to continue to be a challenge. Our goal in all of it is we want to fill up our capacity with our value added sales, and that\u2019s our number one goal. So it has an impact this quarter, and we do see it ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year.","Farha Aslam","So not a significant factor longer term?","Jim Snee","I am sorry?","Farha Aslam","So not a significant factor longer term, it\u2019s a quarter specific issue?","Jim Snee","More of a quarter specific issue, we do see it adding ebb and flow over time.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Heather Jones of The Vertical Group. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Heather Jones","I was wondering, did I hear you say that you expect deli prices to flat year-on-year, flattish year-on-year for the second half?","Jim Sheehan","That\u2019s correct, Heather.","Heather Jones","And just for this last year, the second half, you had -- not you, but the deli pricing in general was up dramatically, and inventories are much higher this year. Just curious as to why you all are expecting that?","Jim Sheehan","It\u2019s an average. We\u2019ve see a lot of volatility in the deli prices and on average, we see them relatively flat to last year. They are lower right now than last year. So again, these are all markets that have been very volatile that's our best estimate at this time.","Heather Jones","And on your food service side, you mentioned a 30 day lag. And from what I understand, and if I\u2019m misunderstanding please correct me, before I understand, those tend to be cost pass through. But on the retail side, pricing is sticker on the way up and the way down. But I was wondering, given the environment out there on the consumer side. What have you been experiencing thus far and the ability to keep pricing at the retail level, given some pull back and some of the input cost you mention, like trim and deli and avocados? And have you so far this quarter, and all of you\u2019ve experiencing success with keeping pricing in place?","Jim Snee","Heather, on the food service side of the business, I think you talk about it being a cost pass through, and we do see some of that. But I would tell you in our food service business, we really believe we have some stickiness in the pricing as well. On the retail side of the business, we have been able to hold on to the price increases that we saw at the end of last year. And then also, we've seen strong volume growth in many of those brands that we took pricing on. So the Wholly Guacamol, chilis, stew, has items, we have retained pricing and we\u2019ve seen some nice volume growth.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from the Eric Larson of the Buckingham Research Group. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Eric Larson","Just a question on the turkey side of the business, again. I think you dialed up your -- last year you took your advertising off of Jennie-O and some of the major programs. And I think you\u2019ve now reinstated that and that what we\u2019re going to -- again negatively impact to your second, your two --. What do we need to see -- we saw cold storage come down for turkey in most recent months that just came out. And what do -- is it just cutting back of supplies here again Jim that we still need to see and maybe fewer pull placements? What is it that\u2019s gets this extended lot longer than we\u2019ve thought declined in the Turkey business back on track?","Jim Sheehan","Eric I would look for a couple of things. We\u2019re seeing of the harvest level go down 3% as we talked about, that's a good indicator. The pull placements, if I were to give you a number, it\u2019d probably be 5% to see a 5% decline in pull placements would tell us that we\u2019re getting there. Breast meats, in general on a $2 breast meat, the market becomes healthy again. What\u2019s the real drag now is this whole bird situation, which whole bird inventory is still up 14%, the market I think is at $0.87 right now, $0.84 somewhere in there. And that pricing is going to drag on until the first quarter. So we certainly see some good indications that things are turning the right direction.","Jim Snee","And Eric you're also correct. I mean we are going to be back with our very successful Make the Switch campaign. We know and we've seeing the results that can deliver. And we are focused on the value-added portfolio at Jennie-O with our lean ground turkey Oven Ready product. So all of things, in concert, is really what lead us to have our view that we\u2019ll see growth in the first half of 2019.","Eric Larson","And then just another follow up, I know you touched base on already. I guess, the issue with CytoSport that you said it's a competitive issue again. And I guess what surprised me was that it was just -- it seemed like, like your first quarter, you really did have maybe some improvement in that whole dynamic. And it just seemed to reverse very quickly and oddly again. Is it a particular one player out there that's doing this? I mean, I guess we're -- I'm lacking the seed just going on there.","Jim Snee","There is one very aggressive competitor in the marketplace. In the category itself, I mean, we saw -- the most recent report, we saw some share growth. But we saw a sales decline, because we had to be very aggressive and take on that competitive activity. And so I mean you're right. In the first quarter, we did feel like maybe we'd turned the corner, but the second quarter did not continue that trend.","And we know that we still have to work to get our distribution line. We've got a great distribution partner with Pepsi, but we haven't solved it yet. And so we are working on a lot of fronts in terms of distribution, messaging, pricing, branding. It's all hands on deck and we do believe the transition from specialty and grocery products will help over the long-term.","Eric Larson","Okay, thanks. I know there\u2019s other questions so I'll get back in the queue. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","A handful of questions here, you mentioned the price increases on stews, Wholly Guacamole and SKIPPY. But for your grocery products pricing in the quarter, unless I'm doing the math wrong, was it down organically?","Jim Sheehan","Yes, it was, Rob. It was mainly driven by CytoSport. So remember, we've got the consolidation of specialty foods, which is now CytoSport and also grocery products.","Robert Moskow","So ex that, do you think your pricing was up in like your traditional retail grocery division?","Jim Sheehan","That's correct, Rob. I would say our grocery products core was up low single digits in sales.","Robert Moskow","In sales, okay. But pricing unclear\u2026","Jim Sheehan","And pricing, yes. Exactly, yes.","Robert Moskow","And then you do have some steel can cost exposure. I was trying to do some math in my earnings preview. Can you give us a sense of when that will start to flow through, and whether you would need more pricing again?","Jim Sheehan","For the steel impact on our business, it runs probably 1% to 2% of our cost of goods. We have not seen a pricing impact. We don't expect to see pricing impact for the balance of this year. And at this point, it\u2019s looks like it\u2019s going to be on product coming from China. Our supply chain is not dependent on the product coming from China. The soonest that we would see increases, just on a regular increased basis, would be in calendar 2019.","Robert Moskow","And a different just a question, seed cost for turkey. I thought those seed costs would start to raise -- ride higher -- that doesn\u2019t appear to be in your outlook though?","Jim Sheehan","No, we have higher seed cost in the second half. We\u2019ve seen some volatile pricing because of the weather in South America strong demand. There has been delayed planting in the U.S., so the main driver is higher soybean deal. And we are hedged for half two and some of 2019 between 25% and 75% through derivatives and forward purchases.","Robert Moskow","And then last versus last question. One of your protein competitors was talking about a slow start to the grilling season this year, because of cold weather in April. Has that impacted your business at all? And do you think this was a one month thing and it comes right back again?","Jim Snee","We haven\u2019t seen that kind of impact, Rob. Our value-added business in our refrigerated foods segment continues to be healthy. And I mean, one of our impact there might be, I would suspect, that it is a short-term impact and then it comes back.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Benjamin Theurer of Barclays. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Benjamin Theurer","Just a quick question. Basically following up on what you've laid out about a year ago with your priorities. And one of that was that you\u2019ve mentioned that you\u2019re considering divesting non-strategic assets. Now, taking a look at the performance at the CytoSport, I mean, you\u2019ve for sure got the question in the past. But just considering the ongoing challenges in sales, it\u2019s basically dilutive in a certain degree to the category here. Is that something which is on the table and under discussion to get potentially sold at some stage if you're not going to be able to turn the business around? What's your take on that more from a medium-term strategic approach on that business?","Jim Snee","The finest pork business is on trend, it\u2019s a great addition to our portfolio and we still like the business. Have we had some headwinds and challenges? Some in our control, some outside control absolutely. I think, from a more holistic approach, I mean we are still committed to reviewing our entire portfolio and making sure that it's a good healthy strategic review. And for those businesses that no longer make sense, we will take the appropriate action. So we haven\u2019t backed off that strategic perspective. But I would say at this point CytoSPort is still very positive business, very on trend and a great addition to our portfolio.","Benjamin Theurer","And then on the second topic, actually goes into the same direction more of that medium term strategic outlook on -- if you have any update on your planning for the supply chain modernization? What\u2019s focus next steps? And where do you think challenges might arise over the coming quarters on that integration target?","Jim Snee","So as I said, we had Glenn Leitch in a role now for about four months and he has been busy with a number of different initiatives, getting into operational consistency across all of our facilities as we break down the different silos going from a business unit approach to one global supply chain, looking at labor utilization, efficiencies. We\u2019ve got a very broad co-packer network and looking for opportunities for improvement there. Freight, obviously, has been probably a disproportionate amount of the time that they\u2019re working on. As we again work on minimizing miles, maximizing weight and working with our customers.","He is also looking at ways to mitigate moderate volatility throughout the supply chain. Inventory management is a key focus. So there certainly are a number of things that he's working on. And for us, the base thing is that they\u2019re finding and going to continue to find efficiencies that we wouldn't have found without having this one supply chain across our organization.","Benjamin Theurer","And if you then -- you\u2019ve just mentioned it that would be just in regards to that. What were issues? Why, what -- you mentioned that inventories went up, so that was basically because of the acquisitions and it\u2019s just not optimized yet at the acquired assets? Or is there some sourcing issues, and then you have to work with longer inventories? So just to get an idea, because you\u2019ve mentioned in cash conversion cycles a focus, and obviously inventory is an important part here. So just to understand what drove the increase in inventory, aside from the acquisition -- the issues on acquisition asset level, that's basically the question?","Jim Snee","The main driver was the acquisition of the businesses. We've taken three days out of our past cycle. We identified that as one of our priorities. So we've been very pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making on the number of days of inventory we\u2019re holding, turning our receivables quicker, and also taking advantage of our ability to manage our accounts payable better. So we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we've made on the improvement in the cash conversion cycle.","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll now take a follow-up question from Ms. Heather Jones of The Vertical Group. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Heather Jones","Just had a quick question on turkey. So you mentioned whole bird and those inventories are relatively heavy. On the value added side, the strength you\u2019ve had in oven and ground turkey. Are you starting to see a return in profitability in that piece of the business close to what we had pre-AI before all distortion of AI and all? Are margins there getting close to what they were historically, and it\u2019s just the whole bird piece that\u2019s weighing things down?","Jim Snee","So we expect to see margin improvement on the value-added business as we continue to move through the cycle. I mean, it is what you said. I mean, the whole bird impact right now is really is weighing the business down.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take a follow up question from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Please go ahead.","Ken Zaslow","Two questions, one is on the -- you discussed the turkey outlook for 2019 a little bit. Can you frame the other businesses and how you think about it? And I think last quarter you guys implied that you guys would be largely back or approaching your long-term growth rate. Is that still a fair assumption? Is there anything that changed in your outlook for 2019?","Jim Sheehan","As we think about 2019, Ken, we always tell you we haven\u2019t started the formal process yet. But we\u2019re still very optimistic about the earnings power that we feel like we've created through the strategic acquisitions, the CapEx investment that we\u2019re making and the focus on those strategic imperatives.","For refrigerated foods, continued strong fundamentals and growing our value-added sales, both in retail and food service. The impact of the new deli group, as a growth vehicle for refrigerated foods, will play a positive role. In grocery products, we expect continued momentum in the core grocery products portfolio, and we\u2019re going to continue to be working to get CytoSport back on track in that GP model also.","JOTS is going to be an ongoing recovery in turkey, and then our lean ground turkey, our Oven Ready products, the whole value added initiative. So we do see that return to growth in 2019. And I'm still very optimistic about our international business. The new plant in China is adding the much-needed capacity. The business is healthy. Our branded exports are very strong. The addition of Ceratti in Brazil is going well with good volume growth. So we\u2019re optimistic about the business going forward as we head into 2019.","Ken Zaslow","And the acquisitions, can you remind us how much accretion there would be from each of them? I think you said one but not both of them. Can you just talk about the accretion contribution in 2019 from both of them?","Jim Sheehan","We\u2019ve said Columbus was going to be accretive by $0.02 in 2018 and Fontanini -- Ceratti was going to be basically $0.01\u2026","Ken Zaslow","And it was up 2019, I thought there was a nickel from\u2026","Jim Sheehan","2019 Columbus will be accretive $0.06 to $0.08 and Ceratti will -- we haven\u2019t really said anything yet.","Ken Zaslow","Is there a reason that wouldn\u2019t be accretive by the nickel region, is that a fair parameter to start with?","Jim Sheehan","We\u2019re still evaluating the business, it will be accretive. We haven\u2019t identified what the final accretion will be.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take a follow-up question from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","So operating profit -- in refrigerated, acquisitions added 13% to the quarter. Can you give us a sense of how much profit it added, was it close to 13% as well?","Jim Sheehan","Well, I mean, obviously, it had a very positive impact on the business, both Columbus and the Fontanini. So I mean, still a very positive impact for refrigerated. Refrigerated was up without them but it did have a -- it was an addition.","Robert Moskow","And then just the last one. I think you and Jim have been very cautious in your commentary about what savings to expect from this supply chain consolidation, and you've mentioned efficiencies. But the word reinvestment keeps popping up. Are you finding that as you dig deeper into the supply chain that there is a lot of need for reinvestment in labor, logistics and things like that?","Jim Snee","From our perspective, the areas that are going to need investment is, automation clearly, is one of them. And as we think about what's happening with the labor force, going forward, we're just -- it's an issue we're going to have to deal with, and automation will be an area that can help us. From a distribution perspective,","I do think that we're going to have to continue to evaluate our distribution structure as we have changes into the business with some of these acquisitions and where it may be, where their supply chains are located. But a lot of that is just normal course of business. We don't see a significant change to our maintenance CapEx level. We see our investments really coming -- continuing to come to drive our value-added capacity needs. But the supply chain is doing some great work to make sure that we're properly aligned for the future.","Operator","Thank you. It appears there are no further questions, at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Jim Snee","Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased with the record earnings announced, and I'm confident in our strategic priorities and our direction, as well as our ability to continue to proactively manage the challenges facing us for the balance of this year. We have an experienced and talented team in place that will allow us to overcome these challenges, deliver our key results and continue to drive growth for our shareholders.

We announced record second quarter earnings this morning of $0.67 per share, up 29% over last year. Segment operating profit increased by 29% with all 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We also generated record sales of $2.3 billion, an increase of 2% over last year on a 5% volume increase.","In terms of segment performance, Refrigerated Foods grew segment profit 52%, driven by strong performance by our value-added businesses and lower pork input costs. Segment sales were down 8% this quarter despite a 1% volume increase. Lower sales were primarily due to pricing decreases on items such as bacon, driven by declining pork market values. Additionally, the dissolution of our Precept Foods joint venture announced at the beginning of the year impacts Refrigerated Foods segment sales by approximately 2.5% each quarter in fiscal 2015.","We enjoyed strong sales of many of our value-added items during the quarter, including retail sales of HORMEL pepperoni, HORMEL GATHERINGSTM party trays and Lloyd's Ribs. Foodservice sales of HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, OLD SMOKEHOUSE bacon, and HORMEL pizza toppings also delivered solid growth.","We launched a new AUSTIN BLUES competition-style barbecue meats line in the Foodservice channel this quarter as we continue to drive innovation in the category.","Grocery Products segment profit increased 1% on a 1% increase in sales. Segment results were aided by lower pork input costs along with strong sales growth from SPAM luncheon meat and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips. Sales volumes of SKIPPY peanut butter grew this quarter, benefiting from our new advertising campaign, however, dollar sales decreased as a result of the category price decline earlier this year pressuring segment margins. Sales of HORMEL COMPLEATS microwave meals were lower this quarter.","Grocery Products continues to drive sales by leveraging our iconic brands in new and innovative ways. We recently kicked off the coast-to-coast SPAMERICAN Tour with our food truck travelling to popular events across the country this summer, featuring SPAM creations by Food Network Chef, Sunny Anderson.","Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit increase of 11% and a sales increase of 32%, largely led by the recently acquired CytoSport business. During the second quarter, we announced that we will be closing the Benicia, California CytoSport manufacturing facility in June and moving portions of the production to our Century Foods operation in Wisconsin and to a third party facility near Benicia. The planned closure of the facility negatively impacted second quarter segment results by $4.5 million. The team continues to achieve additional distribution of our MUSCLE MILK protein-rich products, delivering gains in the club, food, drug and mass and convenience channels this quarter.","International and other segment profit increased 2%, while sales fell 7%. Improved joint venture results were mostly offset by lower exports, a result of port issues and a strong U.S. dollar during the quarter. We did experience higher sales of SPAM luncheon meat gift packs, which are popular gifts in South Korea during celebration of the Lunar New Year. Meat sales in our China operations were also up, primarily driven by growth in the Foodservice business.","Jennie-O Turkey Store increased segment profit 41% and grew sales 15%. Results were driven by robust sales of value-added products and lower grain and fuel costs as compared to last year. Sales growth was led by Jennie-O lean ground turkey and Jennie-O rotisserie turkey.","The Midwest began experiencing significant outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in late March. To date, approximately 55 farms have been impacted that were to supply Jennie-O Turkey Store with turkeys. While we experienced modest financial impact from the outbreak in the second quarter, Jennie-O Turkey Store is estimating a loss of approximately 15% of second half sales. This sizeable estimated loss of volume is not only due to bird losses over the past month, but also takes into account the fact that many of our barns remain empty under quarantine. Due to lack of internal turkey supply, we will be purchasing some additional meat from external sources but at a higher cost. We are also planning for lower sales as we are forced to rationalize some business.","As a result of the turkey supply shortages, on May 5, we regrettably announced a temporary layoff of our second shift employees at our Faribault, Minnesota facility. We look forward to welcoming our team members back when bird numbers and production levels return to normal.","Our team is working closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control the spread. As always, employee safety and food safety are top priorities in our organization, and we remain focused on safety even as we work through these unprecedented challenges. Looking ahead to the second half, operating margins of Jennie-O Turkey Store will be significantly challenged due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain, reducing expected segment operating margins in the back half to the 10% to 12% range.","Refrigerated Foods should continue to benefit from strong value-added sales and lower input costs, although segment earnings growth is expected to be less robust in light of difficult comparisons to last year's third quarter. We look for Grocery Products to deliver strong segment profit growth in the back half, benefiting from lower input costs, and softer prior year comparisons.","Specialty Foods is positioned for strong performance in the second half as the team has realized synergies, achieved distribution gains and ignited innovation in the recently acquired Muscle Milk business. We expect our International segment to deliver growth in the second half as well with improved export sales and solid results from our China business.","Based on our assessment of the impact of avian influenza on Jennie-O Turkey Store to date, and given that Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments delivered excellent results in the first half, we are maintaining our fiscal 2015 adjusted guidance range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, but expect full year earnings to be near the lower end of this range.","Our balanced business model provides Hormel Foods the ability to navigate challenges, such as this year's unprecedented turkey supply shortage and continue to deliver consistent growth over the long term.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $180.2 million, or $0.67 per share, compared to $140.1 million, or $0.52 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $2.28 billion, compared to $2.24 billion last year, a 2% increase. Sales excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport and MegaMex products were down 3%. Lower pork prices, the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture, lower exports and the price reduction on SKIPPY peanut butter products were the primary drivers.","Volume for the second quarter was 1.29 billion pounds, increasing 5% from the same period last year. Tonnage was up 1% excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport and MegaMex products. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 8.3% of sales, up from 7.4% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher this year due to employee-related expenses along with higher advertising expense. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.5% and 7.8% of sales.","Advertising expense for the quarter was $39.5 million, compared to $34.8 million last year. The increase was due mostly to advertising expense at CytoSport for the MUSCLE MILK brand, which was acquired last August. Equity and earnings of affiliates was $7.9 million in the second quarter versus $3.6 million last year. The increase is largely the result of prior year incentive expenses related to the Fresherized Foods acquisition not repeated this year, and also savings associated with the exit of the international joint ventures last quarter.","Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34.6% versus 34% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015 full year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 270.4 million.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33 million versus $31.9 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015. Total long term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $27.3 million, down $12.7 million compared to last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $165 million to $180 million.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Hanna for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Hanna?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Adam","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, I guess the first question in Jennie-O, I want to understand \u2013 it seems like, Jeff, the details you gave about a $0.09 to $0.12 or so EPS impact in the second half from AI guidance and the full-year range maintained despite moving towards the low end. First, help us bridge what got better in the rest of the business as you think about the outlook that has allowed you to maintain the EPS range.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the first half has been a very strong half for us. Q1, as you recall we were able to raise the guidance range at the conclusion of Q1. Q2 was also a very strong quarter for us. And honestly, but the for the avian influenza incident, we would be talking to you today about raising the guidance range. So, clearly that provided some momentum. I also have the expectation that the other four business segments will generate positive results year-over-year during the second quarter and we'll then be able to offset much of what's going on at Jennie-O for the half.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, that's great. And maybe at Jennie-O specifically, I want to \u2013 the guidance \u2013 is it \u2013 I mean does it reflect kind of the status quo today? I know no more \u2013 no further cases of AI in Minnesota or in your facilities or does it give you some cushion for some further outbreaks? And how do you think about the impact into 2016 at this point as you still have to get the barns repopulated and potential volume impact as it slips into next year?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We did attempt to bake in at least some sense of, okay, if there's some added percolation going on, there where there might be another outbreak or two and indeed, if you look at it over the last two weeks, we had one fairly significant barn complex encountered the disease. So, we have tried to factor in that somewhat, but also are expecting that the thing should slow down during the summer. The fall is a wildcard in terms of if and when it comes back.","In terms of next year, and we really are not in a position to give you any quantifiable new range for Jennie-O or for the whole company for that matter. We're just beginning our planning process. But I do believe it would be fair to say that at this point, the outlook for the first half of the year for Jennie-O Turkey Store should be somewhat subdued based on the issues that you've raised. I mean, it is going to take them some time to get back into full production. I just \u2013 I can't tell you whether that 10% to 12% range though that we gave you for the second half is the right range for the first half yet, but it probably will be something short of what we experienced this year.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And maybe just quickly on that point. The repopulation of the barns, can you walk us through the timeline there? Just help us think through how long it will take to get your volume back to where it was in March?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I can't really give you any precision with that because we're in somewhat new territory. We're working with the government on that. It's going to depend in part upon the continuation of no outbreaks for a timeframe. We do understand that there's recently in Wisconsin the repopulation of a chicken-based facility, so it wasn't one of ours, but \u2013 so the process is at least beginning. But I really can't give that to you with great precision, I mean other than to tell you, obviously once we do get the poults in barn, I mean it's 22 weeks after that before we would be bringing them to the manufacturing facility for our tom based turkeys.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Great. Thanks very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Could we talk about your Refrigerated Foods business? The results there were exceptional. How sustainable are the results in the second quarter? How long do you think the hog commodity tailwind is going to benefit you? And how are you thinking of product innovation in that segment?","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Wow, you loaded a lot of questions into one there, Farha.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","That's all one, yeah.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","She is counting it as one. The hogs, we expect supply to be up 5% to 6% for the year, so I would assume, particularly given the extremely high comps that we had last year due to the disease issues in the industry, that we'll see some reasonable hog prices, so that's a good thing. Domestic demand seems to be pretty robust at this point in time. We do see that exports have fallen a bit so we'll keep an eye on that.","But it's really our value-added businesses that are driving the results for Refrigerated Foods. They didn't have a big benefit from any pork operating margins this quarter. It really was the value-added side of the portfolio that was delivering for them. They came in above our guided range, but we'll continue to monitor given the amount of volatility that can occur in that segment. So, I'm not willing to call that this is the new norm going forward.","And innovation?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I just would mention \u2013 I mean we received notice here recently that both the REV product and our WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis were named IRI Pacesetter Top 100 New Items from kind of the last 12 to 18 months of introduction. Our Foodservice group has really enjoyed some excellent results with their BACON 1 product and also their Fire Braised meats, so innovation still is a key component to what we're seeing for success for Refrigerated Foods and our other segments.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Great. And then in terms of CytoSport, that acquisition was expected to be roughly $0.05 accretive to EPS this year. Is it on track, is it ahead or behind pace?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, the first quarter was probably slightly behind. The second quarter, if you look at operating results, we were very happy with the results. They did have the additional $4 million plus charge as we made the decision to close the Benicia plant. Over time, that should enhance operating returns and heading into next year then hopefully, we'll be able to increase on that. But we're still comfortable with that number.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","So still around that $0.05 number?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","For this year.","Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Diane.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","I wanted to ask on the Turkey business, so could you give us an idea about given where things stand today, and obviously can't know about future outbreaks if that happens, but what you expect industry production volumes to be this year down kind of year-on-year for the full year?","And then I was also curious to know, do you expect sort of ramped up CapEx to maybe, I don't know, fortify your positions around the barns or whatever to protect from potential future outbreaks? I know we don't get high path AI very often, I think the last outbreak was over 10 years ago. But I guess I'm just curious \u2013 it seems to have decimated turkeys and I guess table egg layers. And so, I guess the question is should the industry be spending more to defend against potential future outbreaks and would that include you as well?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Both good questions. On the expected turkey volumes. I mean, I can tell you the USDA has not modified their number from the 3% to 4% increase that they expected for the industry. I mean, given our experience and given that we're sort of tied for one of the lead players in terms of volume in the industry, I guess I have a hard time seeing how those numbers happen if we're going to be short 20% in terms of at least turkeys coming into our system and about 15% net of the meat we're going to have to buy. So, I don't have an adjusted total industry number for you, but I guess I'm skeptical as to the industry's ability to hit that 3% to 4% gain number.","In terms of ramped up CapEx, I think the theory that you've laid out is probably correct. We're still a little too early to know exactly what might be required. But in talking with APHIS and just kind of studying, okay, what are better ways to potentially prevent this in the future. And also given the fact that there seems to have been airborne introduction this time, and so that may cause some added fan and ventilation requirements that will be different than what we've done in the past. I think it probably would be safe to assume some additional level of CapEx spending, but I don't have any ability to tell you whether \u2013 what the delta is versus normal either for Jennie-O or for the total company heading into next year.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Is the AI outbreak covered under any insurance plan you might have, business interruption or any other \u2013 or is it seen as sort of an act of God and is non-insurable?","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","It's a non-insurable event, although as it has been in the press, the government helps farmers with birds that they have to euthanize.","Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Eric Larson with Janney Capital Markets.","Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Eric.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Good morning.","Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Jeff, just kind of a strategic question with Jennie-O. I mean, obviously your production is highly concentrated and it is highly efficient obviously with your manufacturing facilities in the upper Midwest, Minnesota. Is there any thought that maybe you should geographically diversify some of your production over time? I mean maybe via an acquisition somewhere that gives you \u2013 maybe try to get off the Mississippi flyway or some other thing. I mean, does this prompt some different thoughts strategically how you might run the business?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I guess I would concede that this is \u2013 given this unprecedented and rare incident that's kind of exposed a little bit an Achilles' heel to the strategy of being very centralized. It had been a tremendous advantage in the past in terms of just knowledge of feed within an area and growing practices, the ability to move meat from plant to optimize products and so forth.","And indeed, all of our facilities are either in Minnesota or Wisconsin. So, whether this is something that then prompts a change in that, we're still on the triage mode right now and I guess that's something on a strategic long-term basis I'll be talking with the team about. But it's a valid question.","Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay, thanks. And then just back to the Refrigerated division again, it's very impressive to see the fact that your hog prices are so low, but you're able to hold your pricing at retail with your value-added products. Can you give us a rough idea of what percent of your Refrigerated volume today would be, quote, value added? And I don't know how you want to define that necessarily, whether it's your all marinated products and flavored products. And is there a way that we can think about that, that helps us \u2013 because it looks like it's a longer-term positive margin shift for you that's become more apparent in the last 12 months.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","So, I think we've discussed before that about 70% of our Refrigerated Foods portfolio would be considered value-added. But understand included in that 70% would even be things that have pricing that's more market-driven such as bacon and hams and our marinated fresh meat. And even on the Foodservice side, some of the contracts they have for items are driven by market forces. So, yeah, the team has performed well, they have a focus on providing great value for our customers, but also making sure that there's a margin left for us.","Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Mario.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","In terms of M&A, how is the company's acquisition pipeline relative to recent quarters? And then secondly, does the increased company resources focused on avian flu limit the company's interest in pursuing M&A, at least in the near-term?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I guess from a pipeline standpoint, I mean, we're \u2013 I don't have anything different to report than normal. I mean, we certainly have a track record of generating growth through M&A along with our product innovations and doing a better job with our traditional items. And we continue to look for both family-owned businesses and institutional properties that might come out, but I don't have anything to report specifically on that.","In terms of AI, clearly it is a time-consuming challenge, particularly for the Jennie-O Turkey Store team, but it's not having any impact in terms of our overall team's ability to seek out M&A opportunities, nor would it have any issues in regard to our ability to finance such a transaction.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then, just as a follow-up, I guess maybe stepping back a little bit, there's been a pretty significant or increasing industry focus on ZBB and overhead reductions. So, how do you feel about Hormel's overall overhead spending? And do you anticipate any changes to the company's strategy regarding that?","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Well, I do not plan to announce any special cost reduction initiative. I think that's kind of the culture that we live by day-by-day. We always run a pretty lean operation with a lot of processes in place such as Jeff signing off on any salaried employee that's being added to the payroll. So, everything gets a pretty difficult look. We do \u2013 I would argue that we already have been doing zero-based budgeting for many years, but we just didn't call it that. So, I'm pleased with the initiatives we have underway with the constant look at expenses and keeping things in line.","Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Lubi J. Kutua - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning. This is actually Lubi on for Akshay. Just with regards to your Jennie-O outlook for the second half, can you just talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about the cadence between third quarter and fourth quarter? I mean, will it be fairly evenly distributed, or do you think things sort of get progressively worse before stabilizing again?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, they're both significantly challenged and to a pretty close level, is our best shot at it right now. And we're short the birds already in terms of what's been going on over the last several weeks, so we're in it.","Lubi J. Kutua - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you. And then, could you provide us maybe an update on how SKIPPY performed during the quarter domestically and internationally, and also REV Wraps? Thank you.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. SKIPPY on a domestic basis, we were pleased that we returned to volume growth and expect that to continue going forward. We did see with the price decline, our net sale number was down. And as I mentioned in the introductory comments, that did squeeze our operating margins a little bit on SKIPPY. We're happy, thus far, with the performance of the ad campaign. We've been able to see demonstrable results in advertised markets that were enhanced over the non-advertised markets. And we also continue to look for new product innovation, and we'll have some things to show the marketplace later this year in that regard in terms of the SKIPPY brand.","Outside of the United States, so far, our experience in China has been \u2013 it's kind of an up and down quarter-to-quarter business. The second quarter wasn't particularly strong this last quarter, but in visiting with the team, they're very comfortable that they will see overall growth in terms of the SKIPPY international portfolio for the second half of the year as they have programs in place to generate that.","In terms of REV, we're kind of making a little bit of a transition with that product. We, upon advice of some of our trade customers, we've changed the case, we've changed the product packaging somewhat. We're trying to attain a price point that we think is going to be able to stimulate the next wave of growth for that item. And so, second quarter kind of was the transition quarter for that. The new products are now in the marketplace and then we're complementing that with a new ad campaign that just launched at the very end of April. And early reads on that are positive, but we'll be able to give you that full report when Q3 is done.","Lubi J. Kutua - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Rachel Nabatian with Credit Suisse.","Rachel N. Nabatian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Rachel N. Nabatian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So I wanted to ask about the normalized margin range for Refrigerated Foods. With demand for protein being quite strong and pork input costs going longer due to the rising supplies, isn't this pretty much an ideal scenario for the Refrigerated Foods division and maybe even Grocery? And do you think that we can assume that margins can stay at the high end of this normalized range for quite some time?","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","I think I addressed it earlier, but never hurts to reemphasize. We're certainly pleased with how the value-added portfolio within Refrigerated Foods delivered for this quarter. But given the fact that we have pork operating margins, as well as a component of commodity sales within that portfolio, we're still sticking to our 5% to 8% range, and when we see that, that's been sustained for a period of time then we'll take a relook at it. The guidance we've given is for over the longer term and through different types of market cycles. So I would expect that the value-added piece should still keep going. Grocery Products definitely should benefit from lower pork input prices particularly on the SPAM family of products, and that should help drive their results in the back half.","Rachel N. Nabatian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. And then the pork packing margins that we track has been very good so far this year. Can you just remind us how this \u2013 how the pork processing trend (33:38) flows through your Refrigerated Foods business and how maybe excess supply might benefit that business later on in the year?","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","So, it's all in \u2013 the pork packing margins, or the pork operating margins, as we call it, are included in the Refrigerated Foods. And, yes, they were \u2013 they have been lower than last year. Part of that is due to the \u2013 what they call the dropped credits, the parts of the animal that traditionally are sold overseas. And with the port issues and the continued strong dollar, we've seen those values go down. So, I think that's impacted the whole industry. I would expect that some of that may pick up in the back half, as we work through the port issues. I'm not recalling the last part of your question.","Rachel N. Nabatian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Oh, yeah, I was just wondering if maybe there was too much supply, if that might be a benefit for the processing operations.","Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Usually, we like to see \u2013 low hog prices are the best thing for our operating divisions.","Rachel N. Nabatian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, this is Jeff. I just wanted to conclude by saying we're very pleased with the record second quarter earnings we were able to announce today.

Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.58, up 18% from a year ago, on sales of $2.3 billion, a 7% increase over last year. We generated segment profit and sales growth in 4 out of our 5 segments.","For the full year, the company earned a record $1.95 per share, representing a 5% increase. We provided adjusted earnings guidance in June where we said we would earn between $1.88 and $1.96 per share for the year, and I am pleased to report we finished at the upper end of that range.","Sales were $8.8 billion, an increase of 6%. I will now take you through each segment.","Our Grocery Products group contributed significantly to our Q4 results, with segment profit up 17% and sales up 23%. Sales for Grocery Products in the quarter grew 1% excluding Skippy products. For the year, segment profit was up 18% and sales were up 30%. Excluding sales of Skippy peanut butter and Don Miguel products, sales were up 2% for the year.","Sales of our Hormel Compleats microwave meals grew nicely during the quarter, enhanced by the introduction of our new Compleats breakfast meal items. We were also pleased with Skippy peanut butter sales this quarter. Our direct sales force has done a nice job generating distribution gains of Skippy peanut butter products domestically.","In our MegaMex foods business, sales gains were led by HERDEZ sauces, tortillas and snacks. Our Refrigerated Foods Q4 operating profit increased 30%, with sales up 4%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was up 2% and sales increased 1%.","We enjoyed solid sales of Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel Natural Choice lunchmeat and LLOYD'S Ribs in the retail channel. Our Hormel REV Snack Wraps are enjoying broad consumer acceptance, driven in part by a national advertising campaign started in late July. We are also excited about the recent reformulation and packaging updates of our Hormel Country Crock Side Dishes, introduced just in time for the holiday season.","Our Foodservice group provided nice contributions with its value-added products led by sales of Hormel Natural Choice deli meats and HORMEL FIRE BRAISED Meats.","Hog costs were unseasonably high this quarter, but pork operating margins were improved as compared to last year's challenging operating environment. Retail bacon pricing actions taken last quarter helped drive improved Refrigerated Foods margins during the fourth quarter as well.","Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment continues to build favorable momentum, delivering increased segment profit of 25% on a sales increase of 7% during the quarter. For the full year, segment operating profit was down 7% and sales increased 3%. Results at Jennie-O in the quarter were driven by continued growth in value-added sales, along with performance gains and expense reductions in the live production supply chain. These gains more than made up for year-over-year higher grain costs and lower commodity turkey meat prices. Sales of Jennie-O Turkey Store retail fresh turkey chubs, turkey breakfast sausage chubs and turkey bacon were robust, while fresh Turkey tray pack sales were down during the quarter.","Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 34% and a sales decrease of 14%, driven by the expiration of the agreement allowing Diamond Crystal Brands to sell certain sugar substitutes in the foodservice trade channels.","Full year results for Specialty Foods showed operating profit up 7% on 1% higher sales.","Our International & Other segment capped off an excellent year by posting another noteworthy quarter with segment operating profit up 82% and sales up 38%. Strong export sales of SPAM products, along with the addition of the Skippy export business drove the positive results. Our China operations also continue to augment segment sales growth.","For the full year, segment operating profit was up 43% and sales were up 23% for our international team.","Earlier today, we completed the acquisition of the Skippy peanut butter business in China and welcomed the Weifang China team to the Hormel Foods organization. Our team in China is fully prepared to integrate this business into our current sales and distribution operations within China, leveraging all available synergies in short order.","Moving into fiscal 2014, we intend to again grow both sales and earnings. We expect our Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and International & Other segments to contribute to the earnings growth. Our Specialty Foods segment will likely register an earnings decline as we rebuild after the expiration of the contract representing a significant portion of our sugar substitute business.","We do expect more favorable grain and turkey commodity costs heading into 2014, as well as more normalized pork operating margins. We will also benefit from a full year of the Skippy peanut butter brand in the hands of our Grocery Products and International teams.","We plan to continue building the REV brand with advertising support in 2014. We will also focus advertising dollars on our Jennie-O Turkey Store Make The Switch campaign, and we intend to launch the first national advertising campaign in over 10 years to support the Skippy brand in the latter half of 2014.","Headwinds to our outlook for 2014 include high beef input costs and potentially volatile hog costs due to concerns in the marketplace about the PED virus affecting supply. The impact of the virus on the industry overall remains to be seen. We plan to maintain hog harvest levels flat to a year ago, but we'll closely monitor hog prices as the year progresses.","Our balance model continues to smooth out volatility in our earnings stream as evidenced by our track record of increased earnings in 27 of the last 30 years. We believe our strong brands in niche categories and our focus on innovation to deliver products valued by consumers, put us in a position to deliver strong results for years to come. After taking into account all of these significant factors, we have established our fiscal 2014 earnings guidance range at $2.17 to $2.27 per share.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Net earnings for the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter totaled $157.3 million or $0.58 per diluted share compared to $132.6 million or $0.49 per share a year ago. Net earnings for the 12 months of fiscal 2013 totaled $526.2 million or $1.95 per share compared to net earnings of $500.1 million or $1.86 per share a year ago.","Dollar sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.3 billion compared to $2.2 billion last year, a 7% increase. For the full year, dollar sales were $8.8 billion, a 6% increase from last year.","Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, up 3% from fiscal 2012. Year-to-date, volume was 5 billion pounds, up 3% over last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 6.3% of sales compared to 7.4% of sales last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.2% of sales compared to 7.4% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.3% and 7.6% of sales for fiscal 2014.","Equity and earnings of affiliates was $2.1 million in the fourth quarter versus $10 million last year. The decrease is the result of lower earnings at our MegaMex foods joint venture, which experienced higher incentive expense on the Fresherized Foods acquisition, unfavorable exchange rates and higher input costs. The incentive expense will be completed in 2014.","Interest and investment income was $2.5 million for the fourth quarter compared to $1.7 million last year. Year-to-date, interest and investment income was $5 million compared to $6.5 million a year ago. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million compared to $3.2 million last year. Year-to-date interest expense was $12.5 million down from $12.9 million last year. We expect interest expense to be about $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2014.","Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33.9% versus 33.1% in fiscal 2012. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 33.6% compared to 33.4% last year. For fiscal 2014, we expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be between 34% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 263.9 million and 264.3 million shares respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for both the fourth quarter and full year were 270.2 million shares. We repurchased 592,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, spending $25.2 million. For the full year, we spent $70.8 million purchasing 1.7 million shares. We have 9.4 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.","Total debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, even with last year.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $38 million, even with last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $107 million compared with $132 million last year. For fiscal 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $140 million.","We announced a 12% per share increase to the annual dividend, making the new dividend $0.80. This represents an 18% increase over the 13% increase last year and marks the 48th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31.9 million compared to $30.9 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $125 million compared to $119 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million to $128 million in fiscal 2014.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","[indiscernible]","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Robert, you're cutting in and out of us, I'm afraid.","Operator","And in the meantime, our next question is from Diane Geissler with CLSA.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the role of innovation in your product portfolio. So you've done a lot of work on jobs over the last couple of years, Compleats, the breakfast launch, REV, I think you mentioned some work that you're doing on Skippy, and also just in terms of your advertising budget. Can you just give us an idea about sort of innovation, the things you've launched into the marketplace over the last 3 years? What percentage of sales are they at this point and what is your goal there? And then if you could talk a little bit about your advertising plans, you did mention them, but if you -- just in terms of, as a percentage of sales or year-over-year increase, I'm just trying to get a feeling for the role of innovation in your top line generation and also just the product portfolio in total?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure, Diane. So we track our innovative items on a little bit longer time frame than the 3 years. We still count items that we've created since the year 2000 as being innovative and we feel in the food industry, the longer tracking, given how long it takes consumers to change preference, makes sense, and we still see significant increases on items we introduced 7, 8, 9 years ago. So that being said, I mean that figure, we hit our $2 billion challenge last year. We complete this year north now of $2 billion. So it's about 1\/4 of our total sales come from these items that were new to the markets since the year 2000. In terms of our philosophy of what we advertise, it kind of varies. Clearly, in the area of new product innovation, we have strongly gotten behind the REV launch with the significant campaign this summer and with plans to reinitiate advertising as we head into the new calendar year next year. We're excited about that product line. It's off to a great start. Sell-through to consumers through the retail channel for REV thus far this year are nearly $30 million, and it's only been a national distribution for 4 months. So we think that item is building some very nice momentum. But we also do advertise some of our traditional products. We'll have a SPAM campaign in the upcoming year. It'll be more digital and print-oriented. We did talk about that we want to initiate advertising for Skippy, and so in the second half of the year, you should see something for the Skippy products. And then Jennie-O Turkey Store will back on air, having a stronger campaign. They expect to be featuring turkey tacos, using their lean ground product, and that's anticipated to be on air starting in January.","Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay, And I guess, so what the [indiscernible] questions, I'm just trying to get a feeling for if you think that the innovation is accelerating? And is the advertising responding to that? Are you accelerating your advertising as well?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I'll use REV as the example for that. And we're still kind of in the scheme of food in the early days of REV. But it was a launch that took us several years of consumer research to prepare for. We put a big effort against it in terms of gaining distribution quickly, and then a strong ad campaign. That frankly, had not been the norm for a lot of our other innovative items. They had tended to be maybe more niche items or simpler line extensions. Maybe 1 other exception that would be Natural Choice, we built from nothing and did put advertising against. So we're certainly hopeful that the strong campaign for REV within a couple of years here is going turn it into a solid profit contributor for the Refrigerated Foods group. And is that a model going forward? If we have another exciting big idea item like REV, then we would be prepared to support it.","Operator","And our next question is now from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, far be it for me to question a big quarter beat like this, but I have to ask about the SG&A being down $12 million from a year ago. Jody, you didn't mention it in the opening remarks, and I'm just kind of curious like why would it be down and why not spend more in fourth quarter if there's anything to pull forward to set yourself up for a much stronger fiscal '14?","Jody H. Feragen","Sure, great question. The primary driver of lower SG&A this quarter was advertising expense. And as much as we'd like to think you could turn that on a dime because it takes a little more planning than that and the primary cuts were at the Jennie-O. And we've talked about them of facing a difficult year all year. They had more muted advertising. We -- Jeff indicated in the previous answer, expect that to get back to more normalized levels. But that would be the SG&A explanation.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","The other piece, Robert, I mean, what -- the item we're going to feature next year for Jennie-O, the lean ground franchise, always takes off during diet seasons, so through January through March, April time frame, so we wanted to coincide the next big push on advertising with that launch.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So is it fair to say that you pushed back the advertising for Jennie-O? Maybe you're spending more in fiscal '14 than you normally would? Or you just -- you've always had a plan to spend heavily on Jennie-O in '14?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","So Jennie-O, I mean, years ago, we really didn't advertise it with a lot of muscle at all. And then in the last maybe 5 to 6 years, we've really seen the benefit as we built out that franchise and branded set of items to being really, frankly, the only turkey brand on air. So we've had very significant campaigns in '11 and '12, heading into '13. We knew we were going to be confronted with some macro challenges in that unit and so we kind of had planned the year to be a little bit quieter year on the advertising front, with the thought that, yes, even months ago, that '14 should be a year we get back on strongly, and that is the plan now we intend to execute.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Last question, follow up. I'm a little confused on what I should be rooting for in terms of commodity turkey prices. If commodity turkey prices are lower, I guess, it's a benefit to your value add in Jennie-O. But then I kind of wanted turkey prices to go higher in '14 because I thought that would help the commodity part of your business that's leveraged to that. So what would be the best scenario for turkey prices next year?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, Jennie-O Turkey Store is primarily a vertically-integrated operations. So it's pure cost-based. We're less concerned about what the market price of any given turkey component is in terms of our inputs. So in terms of rooting for anything in particular, the dark meat portion of the bird is still the portion that would be most susceptible to going export or going in a commodity form. So the breast meat market really kind of doesn't matter in that regard. We tend to value-add almost all that product. So all else being equal, higher commodity turkey prices will get us better returns in the export and commodity markets for those dark meat components and that would be a benefit to Jennie-O and that's part of why we are expecting a good strong year out of Jennie-O on 2014 versus what they were confronted with early in 2013.","Operator","And our next question is from Jonathan Feeney with Janney.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the contribution from Skippy on the quarter and looking forward to next year. So it looks like the disclosure you've given us as a percentage of volume, percentage of sales, it was just down a couple of points in contribution versus the last 2 quarters. And I'm wondering, is that a stronger performance sequentially, at least, revenue-wise in the Grocery Products business? Or is that a change in the contribution from Skippy or maybe some seasonality? And looking forward, what -- I know to the -- I guess, maybe the easiest way to ask it is, can you give us a sense how much profit Skippy is going to contribute in 2014 to the -- or has contributed this year to the Grocery Products lines for modeling purposes going forward?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay, so the Skippy change, in terms of sales momentum, we're very pleased with where it is, both on a domestic and the international markets that we were controlling at this point in the year. We're dealing with year-over-year comparisons that we didn't own it a year ago so, I mean, a little apples to oranges there. But we -- our sales team has done a nice job of gaining additional distribution of Skippy, of gaining better features. So we're really -- the mission in 2014, frankly, on the domestic side is rejuvenating the brand with the Skippy consumer. So it's those sales execution elements, and it'll be the advertising element, and we think our expectation is that should be strong. And then when coupled with what we're looking at now, that we own the China facility and overseas, our overall expectation for Skippy returns in 2014 are consistent with the guidance we provided when we bought the business. So kind of around a $0.15 contribution is the midpoint there, and that is inclusive of the ad campaign that we referenced for the second half of 2014.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, but no sense on how much operating -- I mean, let me ask, is it above or below average operating profit for the Grocery Products business margin?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Now it's -- I mean, in grocery pricing, we've gone through some changes in that with the MegaMex business getting bigger and that's [indiscernible] down a percentage. If you look at the sort of old Grocery Products of 16%, 17% returns, Skippy is kind of right in there with the advertising we're looking to do.","Operator","And our next question is from Tim Ramey with Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I wanted to ask a little bit more about the big surge in international demand and whether there is an opportunity to enter China, with SPAM sort of on the heels of the Skippy product line there.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Very much so, Tim. So our strength in international, from a sheer volume standpoint, still is more of the traditional market, so the Philippines and Okinawa and Guam and many of the other territories. Two real opportunity markets for us for SPAM going forward are mainland Japan and China. We introduced SPAM to China. It's been about 4 years ago, but then we had a hiatus for 12 to 18 months when there were some trade issues that kept us from shipping the product in there. But we're back building distribution there. We do think it is leverage-able with Skippy, they're both shelf-stable items sold into that retail channel that makes us a bigger player with the retailers in those areas, and Skippy is already in a lot more markets than SPAM is in China. So we do intend to work to try to piggyback those 2 together, going forward, in that market.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Does SPAM enjoy the kind of the positive cult status that it does in, say, Korea, in China? Or how is that product regarded? Are people even aware of what it is?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, pretty low awareness, candidly, Tim. I mean, it's -- you get more of that in Japan. So even though in mainland Japan we've not pushed the item, a lot of Japanese have traveled either to their own southern island of Okinawa or to Hawaii or many places. So the familiarity with SPAM in Japan is quite a bit higher. In China, it was pretty much a new brand and a new product, and so it's one that will just stay gradual building.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Andrew Strelzik","This is Andrew Strelzik for Ken. So you had a nice step-up in Refrigerated Foods margins this quarter. Obviously, you've introduced and had success with some of the higher-margin, new products, and pork margins have only gotten better since the end of the quarter. So I'm wondering if you think we are entering -- I understand there can be volatility around the pork margins, but if you think we're entering a period where there's a step-up in the base Refrigerated Foods margins from some of the new products and some of the other initiatives?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, back in 2010, 2011, we did enjoy operating margins more in the low 7% range, the last 2 years have been more in the 5%. So we -- our game plan is certainly to start migrating back to where we were and hopefully go beyond that at some point. And you've identified some of the drivers. Definitely, the new product innovation, the REVs and the FIRE BRAISED in the Foodservice group. Over time, we hope we'll migrate of those margins upward.","Andrew Strelzik","And you highlighted a potential volatility in hog and pork prices for 2014. Would you anticipate needing to take more pricing? Or do you think that you pretty much covered what you would expect in terms of volatility there?","Jody H. Feragen","Andrew, this is Jody. I think we're pretty comfortable with the pricing we have to date, given the market conditions to date. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty as it relates to the hog markets, and we'll have to reassess as we go. Some of our contracts are based -- more tightly linked to input costs, so those kind of have automatic adjustments that go with them. So we'll continue to monitor it. Like Jeff had indicated, we continue to have the opportunity to improve the margins in the Refrigerated Foods area.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Farha Aslam with Stephens.","Eric Gottlieb - Stephens Inc., Research Division","This is Eric Gottlieb for Farha. I have a question on turkey, and then I'll follow-up on chili. So last year, you took down your harvest levels 1% to 2% because of the grain cost. I just want to know what kind of plans you have for coming year, given the grains are down.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","We do intend to increase production modestly in 2014 to support our value-added needs. After cutting production for the past 2 years, even the small increase will still leave us below our 2011 harvest levels.","Eric Gottlieb - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then the other question on turkey is, I've read reports of a shortage of heavier turkeys at one of your competitors. Is there anything that Hormel that would -- are you experiencing that as well? And what will bring that on?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","We're really not. I guess, we don't know what transpired within that organization, but we were able to fill all of our fresh whole turkey orders. And, really, from what we've read in terms of other industry players, they seem to be also in a position of filling orders. So I think that was limited to one operation.","Eric Gottlieb - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then moving on to chili. I noticed you've faced a little bit tougher competition from some of your competitors. Are you planning to support and advertise that brand? And how is the competitive dynamics working there? And then I'll pass it on.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. It definitely has been more competitive in the latter half of the year, and chili may be one of the brands that we are seeing that is seeing some slowdown in terms of the center of the store sales that you're kind of hearing about from some of the other players. We don't have any television or traditional media ad plan for chili for the next year, but we will have strong promotional support in-store, a major push against the Super Bowl season and also, following up with that some of the other major drivers of kind of gatherings. Our Hormel chili is a particularly -- a strong usage, sort of out of the bowl dips and other types of items, and so it lends itself to March Madness and grad parties and you name them. So we definitely will have strong efforts to promote it on that basis.","Operator","And our next question is from Eric Larson with CL King.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just some clarification on the Skippy contribution, Jeff. You mentioned, I think, $0.15 for fiscal '14. Is that the incremental contribution or would that be the total contribution? And obviously, if it's incremental, what was the contribution in fiscal '13 for Skippy?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","So $0.15 is the total contribution. When we made the acquisition, we described our expectation for 2013 as being a modest accretion. It probably came in a little better than we had initially anticipated, but we haven't given a precise number and we really don't want to get into a kind of product line by product line profit numbers. So we gave you the $0.15 initially, and we're standing by it. But that's probably the last time we're going to give a specific number and cents per share for one line item in the franchise.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, yes. I would just -- it just was confusing. I wasn't sure if it was incremental or a total contribution, so...","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Very valid question, yes.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That helped. The outlook, if you look at your hog, your cut-out margins, obviously, we -- they're improving. They've gotten better. They're pretty volatile as well. But you should -- how are you looking at how it unfolds really kind of -- first half should have relatively easy comparisons for the year, and then it gets a little bit more difficult. Would that be the proper way to, from a 30,000 foot level, look at your earnings stream for refrigerated on the cut-out margins next year, Jeff?","Jody H. Feragen","Eric, this is Jody. I couldn't have said it better myself. Certainly, right now, we're experiencing favorable -- more favorable cut-out margins. It'll all depend on the volatility in the marketplace. So that's -- we're not looking for that to be a big win or a driver for us next year. So for the full year, kind of flattish.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So first question is on innovation. Can you just give us a little bit more color on the REV launch? You mentioned some numbers, but just give us some color on what you're seeing -- hearing from consumers on that, that might make you feel good or bad about it? And also, on the Compleats breakfast launch, that's under the radar, I would say. And more importantly, how do we track that in your results? Because it's -- the REV numbers are in the Refrigerated Foods segment, I believe, and the volume numbers there are negative because you had been cutting some SKUs or some business there that's non-core. So how do we track that? What are your expectations for these 2 product lines? And if you can just give me some -- give us some color on how things are going on those 2 particular product lines, that would be great. Then I have a follow-up.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. Okay. We feel very good about the REV launch thus far. Our retail team did a great job gaining distribution in-store in time for our July ad campaign. We then saw a great lift from the campaign itself, enhanced trial, our repeat numbers are strong. And so it's off to a great start. The initial line had 8 items, we've added 4 more already and with probably a few more to come in the upcoming years. So it seems like it's well poised to be a great contributor for us. Now that being said, I mean, I think we talked about it at Investor Day. I mean, this kind of a launch is an investment. So in terms of any sort of bottom line return coming from REV, I mean, we're -- that's probably 2015. I mean, we're in the mode that we're -- we think this warrants making this investment but it's not driving bottom line results right now. Compleats breakfast, since that's more of a -- kind of a line extension to an existing line, there's more of an expectation that, that should be able to contribute right away. It's off to a decent start. It's not as robust maybe is what we're seeing on REV, but it's gained a good distribution and the consumers seem to be enjoying the products. And so between those and some of the newer pasta items we rolled out during -- earlier part of last year, both -- which are avail-ed by new technology that we have in place in our Dubuque plant, we feel good about the Compleats franchise. We've had some nice results in the last couple of quarters. And then your question about the -- kind of how to tie it into refrigerated and why is refrigerated down, Jody has a good answer for you on that piece.","Jody H. Feragen","So, sure, Jeff, thanks. So actually, you'll remember, I think we talked about it in the third quarter call. We exited some low\/no margin feed business in the Refrigerated Foods, and that's a huge driver of those volume decreases. So we'll start seeing some more normalized levels and comparisons when we enter the back half of 2014. So follow up with Jana on any additional questions regarding that.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So just to wrap up on that, so I understand that, on the REV, the profit will come in '15. But we should start to see some positive volume trends as you report them in the Refrigerated Foods as a result of that launch, correct?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, I mean, you really will need to look at net sales. Because, I mean, REV is not a particularly heavy item, so it's -- it doesn't drive nearly as much volume as it does unit and dollar sales.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on a -- follow-up questions on turkey. Can you update us on grain costs now that we're -- we have some visibility on the harvest? What's your expectation on grain costs? And more importantly, where should we think about modeling turkey -- Jennie-O Turkey margins for next year? You have 11% to 15%, I believe, normalized range. And I think, on the last call, you said 15% is not really a ceiling per se. I would expect that, given where grain costs are, you should be at or above the 15%. But any color on that relative to grain costs would be helpful.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","We certainly do expect that grain costs will become increasingly more favorable as the year goes on. I mean, even in the most current quarter, it actually were slightly higher year-over-year. But as we blend in some more of the corn that's now in the $4 and $5 range, we're certainly in a better position with that. In terms of our expectation for the unit, clearly, would add up to somewhere in the upper end of that range. We're looking at kind of a low double-digit increase for Jennie-O for the year. Now that's inclusive of advertising. So we want to make sure the momentum of that product line continues going forward. And so we -- arguably, we'll be reinvesting a little bit of the benefit we're gaining on the grain picture in to making sure we maintain that momentum of the new items.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Tim Ramey with Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Jody, I wonder if you could give us a little bit of windage, at least on the top line segment numbers. Because, for instance, it would be tempting to model Jennie-O sales flat to down, given the input costs, but I think that's probably wrong. And I'd love to be righter than wronger. Any thoughts there?","Jody H. Feragen","We all want to be righter than wronger. Tim, we challenge all our business units to deliver at a minimum 5% top line growth. Jennie-O does have the added complexity with the commodity sales. But as Jeff had indicated, we're increasing our harvests slightly to accommodate some more value-added sales. So I think if you model the 4% to 6% range, you would be right in there.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And any thoughts on Grocery Products, given -- is the Skippy China going to go in there? It's in international, I guess.","Jody H. Feragen","Right.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Right. So, China is in international. But our -- your expectations for Grocery should be in the higher 5% to 10% range for 2 reasons: one is a full year Skippy, so they had 3 quarters of it this year. And frankly, the quarters we lap, we expect to have some growth. I mean, we've made some nice distribution gains. And then top of that, we can -- we have some nice momentum in the MegaMex side of the business. We're introducing a lot of new items under the Herdez brand, and so we expect some solid results on top line from that group as well.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And since I'm on a roll, I assume Specialty down because of as -- because of the contract.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes. Yes, that's the expectation. They'll improve as the year goes on. The team is working hard to find new areas of business to grow in the future. But you saw the quarter they just had. That's what they're confronted with, at least early in the year. And they'll gradually improve from there.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","These are, I think, going to be for Jody first. Equity earnings, can you just update us on what the expectations are for next year? We've had a down year now, significantly down. But just can you help us understand what you're expecting for '14 and why?","Jody H. Feragen","So for -- 2013 really was impacted by the required accounting for an incentive\/earnout-type payment on the Fresherized Food acquisition. And as that business has had spectacular performance partially aided by some favorable avocado costs, we needed to really do some catch-up on making sure that we were accruing. For 2014, it will still -- we'll still have expense related to that incentive payment, but it should be somewhat less. And I think the rest of the business should perform to cover that down. So I would not expect to see year-over-year decreases in the realm that you've seen in the last couple of quarters.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So just sort of flattish operating -- is the contribution on the P&L should be similar to what we've seen?","Jody H. Feragen","I would expect improvements.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as far as modeling goes, you gave us expectation for interest expense, the income line which, obviously, is mark-to-market for the rabbi trust mainly. Is that -- you just assume no change from where we are currently, right?","Jody H. Feragen","I would not move it too much either way. Most of the rabbi trust is invested in more fixed type return items to take out that volatility that we saw back in the late 2000.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, and just one more. On D&A, the guidance that you gave, $125 million to $128 million, that includes how much in deal-related amortization for Skippy?","Jody H. Feragen","Akshay, why don't you follow-up with Jana on that? That's a little more granular than I'm prepared to address right now.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, just one last one on Skippy. Can you -- you mentioned you're doing this advertising campaign which was -- you had mentioned it on the last call. But relative to your initial guidance, I mean have you -- can you just give us an update on sort of how is the domestic Skippy business perform relative to your expectations? And how has that sort of played into your view on advertising and how much you supported and when you supported?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","It's performing well. It's performing well on a top line basis because we are gaining distribution and doing a better job with sales features. It's performed well on the bottom line basis. So that was my comment earlier where it did a little better than the modest accretion we had expected for 2013. In terms of advertising, when you make an acquisition, I mean, you only have so much information. Our thought process going into it was we think -- we thought it was a wonderful brand that hadn't been communicated in quite a while and that we thought that was going to be a leverage point for the business, and our team still thinks that. They're in the process, right now, of really landing on the right messaging. You should be looking for that campaign in the second half of the year. So that's when they feel they will be ready to go with it. But otherwise, it's consistent with what our expectations had been for the brand.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. My model for fiscal '14, I'm assuming 40% profit growth in Jennie-O. And I think, Jody, you said something in -- low double digits is more appropriate. So there's a big gap between what I think is possible just based on the grain costs, right? Because I thought grain costs would be down like $100 million based on how much corn you buy. Am I assuming the benefit's coming too early? Or am I just overestimating the size of the grain benefit for turkey?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, let me give -- I'll give you a few reasons, at least, that would come to me. One is, we won't see a full year of the kind of grain costs that you're seeing reflected in the current cash markets. I mean, one, because the timing of bringing turkey to market; and two, because of the continual hedge program that, in some cases, lock you in a little bit higher than what the current market is. Another reason would be we do have some sales within the Jennie-O organization, particularly on the Foodservice side that are on formula-based contracts. So that if the grain goes down, then the price does go down in some cases there, so that's not just all falling to the bottom line. And then the last reason I would cite would be the enhanced advertising campaign. So we are kicking back in to a level more like what we had done in our stronger years of 2011, 2012. And so we are investing some of the expected grain benefit into advertising.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That makes sense. And in the All Other segment, when you add the Chinese Skippy business, how much contribution should we expect for fiscal '14 from that? Is it material?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, it's material. I mean, in international, we've had wonderful growth in that group. We've said that, against our 5 and 10 algorithm of company-wide of 10%, company-wide segment profit growth that we expect international group is going to be able to do better than that. And I would expect that again in the upcoming year, both with the momentum they already had on their business and the fact that they now have control over the Skippy China piece.","Jody H. Feragen","And Rob, international did benefit from Skippy in 2013 as well because of -- the North American part of that portfolio as well as exports into some of the Asia countries, but not China.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right, because you had exports in '13. But I'm just wondering now that you're running the domestic business in China, is that -- is there a significant amount of profit in that business to take into account when we model it for '14?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","It'll help international's results.","Operator","And it appears there are no further -- excuse me, there is a question from Eric Gottlieb with Stephens.","Eric Gottlieb - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just one follow-up. The guidance you provided, would that include the closing of the Chinese Skippy business or no?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes. It's all in, yes.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. So I will turn it back to management for any closing remarks.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you, all, for joining us today, and have a wonderful Thanksgiving.","Operator","And that does conclude your call for today. Thank you for your participation.

We are pleased to report record earnings and sales for the third quarter. Earnings for the quarter were $0.41 per share, up 14% from earnings of $0.36 a share a year ago. All 5 segments registered gains in segment profit. Total dollar sales topped $2 billion, an increase of 5% over a year ago on solid volume growth of 4%. I will now take you through each segment.","Our Grocery Products team delivered an operating profit increase of 32% and a dollar sales increase of 21% for the third quarter. You may recall that we began including Don Miguel sales in our Grocery Product segment results this past quarter. Sales for Grocery Products grew 3% excluding Don Miguel in the quarter. Among the contributors to sales growth in this segment were our SPAM family of products, Hormel Compleats microwave meals and our MegaMex portfolio.","For the SPAM family of products, our advertising campaign featuring Sir Can-A-Lot and the publicity around the 75th anniversary has contributed to the nice sales increase. We were pleased to see growth by our Hormel Compleats microwave meals in Q3. We are in the process of introducing additional new Compleats meals that feature cheesy pasta. We also introduced some other new microwavable items in the quarter, including SPAM meals and Hormel sandwich makers. These new items have performed well in limited markets so far.","Sales of our Mexican food products continue to grow, led by Wholly Guacamole Dip and by salsas and tortillas under both the Herdez and CHI-CHI'S brands.","Segment operating profit for our Refrigerated Foods group increased by 7%, with higher sales of our value-added products were able to offset lower pork operating margins. Sales were flat overall, but value-added sales continued to grow.","On the retail side, we enjoyed strong sales of Hormel Natural Choice Deli Meats, Hormel party trays, Hormel bacon and Hormel Pepperoni. Foodservice sales were also higher, led by sales of branded products such as Hormel Natural Choice Deli Meats, Hormel premium hams and premium bacon.","The Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had another solid quarter, with segment operating profit up 12% and sales up 7%. Continued growth in sales of value-added products and an improved product mix more than offset higher grain prices and lower commodity meat prices during Q3. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store retail tray pack fresh turkey and our turkey burgers are still on the rise. We will be building up on last year's highly successful Make The Switch advertising campaign with a new TV commercial this fall, this time featuring turkey bacon and sausage. Stronger sales of whole birds also aided results this quarter for Jennie-O.","Our Specialty Foods segment had a very good quarter, achieving 18% growth in operating profit on a net sales increase of 11%. Segment profit gains were driven by higher sales of nutritional products, private label canned meats and ingredients.","Our All Other international segment delivered another strong quarter, with segment operating profit up 55% while sales increased 2%. Higher exports of our SPAM family of products and fresh pork were the primary drivers for this segment.","Moving into the fourth quarter, we do anticipate seasonally lower hog costs as we get into fall. Pork operating margins have thankfully returned to positive territory lately, and we expect these margins to remain positive though lower than a year ago during the fourth quarter.","Jennie-O Turkey Store's Q4 margins will be impacted as we cycle in higher grain costs. Our team at Jennie-O will continue to push for value-added sales growth and efficiency improvements in order to mitigate the impact of grain inflation. We also expect strong contributions to our earnings growth from our Grocery Products and International teams based on their solid momentum from the third quarter.","Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share. The strength of our balanced business model and the vibrancy of our branded value-added portfolio should support continued sales and earnings growth as we close out fiscal 2012. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2012, net earnings totaled $111.2 million or $0.41 per share compared to $98.5 million or $0.36 per share a year ago. Net earnings for the 9 months of fiscal 2012 totaled $367.4 million or $1.37 per share compared to net earnings of $356.9 million or $1.31 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $2 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year, a 5% increase. For the 9 months of fiscal 2012, dollar sales were up 5% to $6.1 billion.","Volume for the third quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, a 4% increase over fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, volume was 3.6 billion pounds even with last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 7.2% of sales compared to 8.2% last year.","Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.4% compared to 8% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 7.5% of sales for the full year. Interest and investment income was $844,000 for the third quarter compared to $139,000 last year. Year-to-date, interest and investment income was $4.8 million compared to $2.6 million a year ago.","Interest expense for the quarter was $3.2 million compared to $5.6 million last year due to lower debt levels and lower interest rate. Year-to-date, interest expense was $9.7 million compared to $19.4 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012.","Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 33.7% versus 29.3% in fiscal 2011. Last year's tax rate for the third quarter was favorably impacted by the resolution of tax matters with various federal and state tax jurisdictions. Year-to-date, our effective tax rate was 33.5% compared to 33% last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%.","The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 263 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 269 million shares. We repurchased 302,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter, spending $8.6 million. We have 1.6 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $28.9 million, down from $30.6 million last year. For the 9 months, depreciation and amortization was $88.6 million compared to $92.9 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million for fiscal 2012. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $36 million compared to $20 million last year. For the 9 months, capital expenditures totaled $94 million compared to $63 million last year.","For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be $120 million to $130 million.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Ian?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Farha Aslam.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I'd like to focus my questions really on Jennie-O. But the segment continues to perform very, very well particularly, I mean, your price mix this quarter was very strong despite the fact that commodity turkey prices have been quite weak. Do you anticipate turkey for that division to continue to have positive price mix going forward given the weakness that you've seen in commodity turkey?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well at this stage, I mean, we're just going to talk through the end of this fiscal year. Clearly, we were very pleased with Jennie-O's quarter in the third quarter. Not the huge gains year-over-year that we saw in Q1 and Q2, but to be expected given both the pressures on the grain side and the pressures on the commodity meat side. They do have excellent momentum in terms of their value-added products, and we expect Q4 to be more similar to Q3 in terms of their operating results.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I know you don't want to talk specifically about next year, but we have to address the current grain situation. Kind of how do you think that is going to affect that division going forward? Could you share with us a little bit about your grain positions and do you anticipate feeding wheat to your turkeys, and is that possible?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I can't get into the latter question. In terms of what the outlook is, clearly, that will be part of the planning process for next year. I mean, it is important to know in terms of the aggregate and looking at grain cost for the Jennie-O organization that you have -- there's an effective hedge positions. There's an effect in terms of the time to market for the turkeys, which, for the Tom turkeys is 22 weeks, so there will be some lag effect in terms of the price increases that you've been seeing in the -- cost increases you've been seeing in the marketplace. But no, clearly, that will be one of the major goals of that unit will be to do the best they can to balance off these significant cost increases on the grain side with the momentum they've been showing in value-added products and with the efficiency gains they've been able to generate in their business.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And then my final question would be regarding your cash position. It -- I mean, you have net cash on the balance sheet. Do you think you're going to focus on M&A? Are you focusing on working capital? Would you increase your dividend? Can you just share with us your priorities of cash?","Jody H. Feragen","Farha, this is Jody. I certainly will. Obviously, first is to invest in our business, and we've done a lot more of that through internal investment with our CapEx spending this year. A portion of that was related to some general replacement, but we've also invested in some capacity expansions, as well as technologies that are driving new product introductions. We continue to focus on finding strategic M&A deals that would fit with us from both a strategic standpoint as well as being accretive, and those would be both domestic and international. And then certainly, we have our continued obligations to our shareholders with our dividends as well as share repurchase. So all those factor into our cash position. We have invested in some working capital, and I would expect that to decrease as we go forward.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you're making no changes in your cash allocation, given the rise in grain prices?","Jody H. Feragen","We'll probably -- just the nature of Jennie-O is, they\u2019re holding higher grain prices that will be reflective of their inventories. We like to focus on making sure we have the appropriate quantity of inventories.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Diane Geissler.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I guess inquiring minds want to know why you kept the range so wide for the full year at $1.79, $1.89. Your commentary on the fourth quarter suggests you expect the fourth quarter to be up year-on-year, but the bottom end of the range, which is something around $0.42 versus last year's $0.43. So I guess I'm a little conflicted about what you're trying to say about the fourth quarter and why there's still such a wide range, a $0.10 range given that you only have one quarter left.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","True. I guess our philosophy on that, Diane, was we really have been trying to operate on an annualized basis. We moved away from giving quarterly guidance about 3 or 4 years ago. And as reflected in both the release and in my comments at the beginning of the call, we do think we're tracking well towards that annual operating plan. Our team is aligned against that plan. Our incentive programs are based on the achievement of the results within that annual plan. And so at this point, we just felt that, that was the number that was important to focus on both for external audiences and the internal audiences to what we're trying to deliver. And there certainly are opportunities depending on what happens during the quarter to be on the lower or upper end of that range, but we felt it\u2019s still a comfortable area to have out there.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. I appreciate the clarification there. And then, on the Grocery Products, you're sort of one of the few kind of packaged food companies that's actually showing some volume lift. So congratulations on that, x the Don Miguel. Can you just talk about -- it sounds like Compleats was doing well, I mean, that's kind of a higher-end product. SPAM seems like more of a value-oriented product. Can you talk about what you're seeing with the consumer base, what retailers are saying about the state of the consumer?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. I mean, for our items, we're really -- we were very pleased with the breadth of the success of the Grocery Products results during Q3. SPAM would probably traditionally be looked at as more of a value item, with some of the excitement we've been able to build around that brand, both in-store and with our advertising and public relations effort. We're very pleased with the sales growth there. We've been working hard to restore growth to Compleats, and so that was -- it was very encouraging to see the upward trend in that market. And then very good results from the Mexican portfolio. I mean, the portfolio -- so forgetting Don Miguel for the moment, even the core items that had been part of MegaMex prior to that were up for the quarter, and so that's exhibiting good center of the store performance. And then Don Miguel and Wholly Guacamole are actually sold in different sections of the store, albeit still part of the Mexican portfolio, and Wholly Guacamole in particular had a very strong quarter. So it's -- so we're -- we have a lot of items that are connecting well consumers overall. I would agree that in talking with retailers, that's not the universal picture, that there are certain categories that they're still experiencing some difficulty in terms of volume comparisons. But we focus on the categories we're in and trying to partner with them to figure out ways to keep connecting more with consumers with those.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. So despite continued weakness with consumers, you don't see any reason to sort of back off your long-term sales growth target of 5%?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Certainly for -- I mean, again kind of going into the next quarter, we think the momentum Grocery Products has should continue into Q4, and then we'll kind of give whatever clarification we see out there as we provide 2013 guidance at the November call.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Akshay Jagdale.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on turkey. I know you don't want to talk too much specifically about '13, but can you just help us frame fiscal '13 in the context of perhaps fiscal '08 when I guess there\u2019s some parallels being drawn there because of the increase in grain costs. But I would just like to get your perspective generally for the turkey industry and your business going into '13 relative to, let's say, '08.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I guess the best I can give you on that, Akshay, is we do believe there are significant changes in our own operating philosophy and performance between 2008 and what we expect to have in 2013. We've been able to grow the brand significantly through the advertising campaign. One of the hallmark franchises that is supported by that campaign and has leading position in the marketplace would be our Fresh Product line. Because of the strength of that, we've added on a new line in our Pelican Rapids facility, that's one of the capital investments that Jody was referencing in her earlier comments. And so clearly, we wouldn't have added that line if we didn't think we have significant new business to be able to support that line. On top of that, the team has just done a very good job all across-the-board in terms of driving efficiency gains, whether it's at the farm level, bringing the product into the plant or in through the supply chain. So we'll provide you with what we see is our best picture for that segment and for the total business when we do get to the November call, but I do expect that, that will be a -- it's still going to be a significant jump up from 2008 levels.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one on the consumer in general. I thought it was interesting that you're Compleats business did well this quarter. I don't remember it being on the positive side as much as it was this quarter for a while. Is there -- I mean, do you and your business and your product segments see a bifurcation in sort of the consumer where your SPAM business is doing well, but now it looks like Compleats is starting to do well again. I mean what are you really seeing from a consumer standpoint in terms of demand?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Oh, I mean it's been interesting really ever since the recession began to see the consumer dynamic against the franchise. It doesn't -- at least for our portfolio, it doesn't split neatly into value consumers versus more affluent consumers because we've seen great strength of items that you might consider value items, such as SPAM or initially Hormel chili. But we also have had excellent results from our party trays and Natural Choice items, which are probably aimed at a little bit more premium consumer. Compleats is kind of in the middle in that regard. It's not -- I don't know if it's regarded as an ultra value item nor as a premium item. What we have found is the packaged meal kind of sub-segment has been a little bit more of a struggle since the recession began. We've seen that both in Hormel Compleats and in our Hormel Refrigerated Entrees. So the effort then becomes, okay, how do you gain more households and how do you connect more with those items? And so it's a -- for Compleats, it's been a multifaceted approach of new advertising, new package designs, kind of segmenting the line into the red, blue and green varieties, new flavor varieties that some that are already in the market and the others that we're coming out with, such as our new cheesy pasta items. So it's -- the mission is just to keep growing that franchise, and we really don't see any reason why that can't happen. I mean, it still has very low household penetration. It's a convenience item in a convenience world. With our balanced model of being able to deliver both protein and packaged food, we're the ones delivering the simple, one-step product that has the protein component and other components in it. And so we're still very high on the line in the long run, and we're very pleased with the Q3 results.","Operator","Your next question is from Jonathan Feeney.","Mark E. Williams - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is Mark Williams Michael on for Jon. I wanted to ask about your -- I was surprised by the management of profit expansion in Grocery. Can you just talk about the drivers there and what drove that?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","We've -- the Grocery portfolio, if you look at it over the last 3, 4 years has had a swing, a couple of hundred basis points over a longer haul off and on; based somewhat on inputs and somewhat on mix. They've had some fairly significant stresses on the input side in prior quarters, and those improved during the most recent quarter. And then over time, we have seen the solid growth of some of the key items that's been helping a lot as well. SPAM is a great item for us, as well as the Mexican portfolio.","Mark E. Williams - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And would you -- could you please provide just your outlook on the turkey supply and pricing dynamics and what you see going forward?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. Well, it's probably somewhat in flux. When we last talked, grain was at a quite different level than when we're talking 3 months later. And so I would imagine the other participants within the industry are probably looking at that and making decisions as to what they think they're appropriate production levels are. They're clearly -- there have been a couple of expansions in the industry that are probably going to go forward. I mean, they were already in the midst of building plants and adding onto farms. But beyond that, I would assume every business has to kind of assess, okay, what's your profitability picture with this kind of a grain environment. At Jennie-O Turkey Store, we\u2019ve tried to keep supplies tight. It really fits well with our emphasis on the value-added branded items. And in terms of that outlook, I mean we would anticipate -- we'll continue to maintain that kind of tightness. We need enough meat to support the growth of the value-added items, but we're not looking to have a lot of surplus meat to sell on the commodity market.","Mark E. Williams - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great. And my last question pertains to the pork cutout margin. As you noted, that has expanded some in recent weeks. Do you see that as a temporary phenomenon driven by maybe some farmer that can afford the cost of feed that are sending their hogs to slaughter or do you see that as a more durable driver?","Jody H. Feragen","This is Jody. I'll try to handle that one. Yes, thankfully, they have turned to be positive from quite negative averages over the previous quarters. Hog supply seasonally is stronger in the fall, just kind of the nature of that industry. So we would expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. And we would expect the spread between the hog cost and the USDA cutout to be positive, probably not as positive as it was in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Tim Ramey.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Jody, the -- I don't know, did you say how -- what your hedge position looks like now relative to either corn or hogs?","Jody H. Feragen","I think -- we hedged our grain input for Jennie-O, and as we indicated on the call last quarter where our range is typically the 25% to 75%. And for fiscal 2012, we're planning in the middle, if you will.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. Are you experiencing -- I mean, certainly the Minnesota farmers are experiencing a better crop than on average. How is that impacting you? Is that helping basis or how do you think about that?","Jody H. Feragen","I -- we have seen some tightening of the basis, so I don't know that it's been as big a benefit as maybe in prior years. But you're right, the crops up here do appear better than the ones that have been noted in the southern part of the states.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","They're also not in yet, and so often basis can really swing more on true delivery and what kind of spread there is. The other wild card to basis this year is going to be traffic on the Mississippi River and if there's some constriction there in terms of ability to ship, that could make a difference as well.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Christine McCracken.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","I know you don't want to talk about the forward outlook, but I'm just wondering with the increases that we're seeing in grains and then presumably, in the proteins, I'm wondering if you're having conversations with your customers relative to pricing. How far in advance do you have those discussions especially as you look at annual contracting and expectations for '13?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, to the extent we engage in annual contracting, which would be limited more to certain areas of the Foodservice business, then yes, we're clearly reflecting our best expectation of what markets are going to be both for the protein and for the input. That's not a huge percentage of our overall business, though. In terms of retail pricing, absent the market-based items, whole turkeys and bacon and fresh pork, we really don't have any current announcements to make in terms of pricing. But clearly, that will be one of the team's overall assessments that we have to make as we complete our planning process here is what do we see as the likely cost input level for different commodities and for different products, and what are we going to do to either mitigate those or in terms of pricing reflect those in the area of pricing.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Are you getting the sense that -- how quickly could you adjust? Is it kind of 30, 60 days kind of pricing adjustment or is it longer? I'm just wondering when we look back at when we\u2019ve seen this kind of cost sensation in the past, it's always been about the past year of pricing, resistance to pricing and how quickly we can get it through. I'm just wondering if you get in front of it this time.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes. I mean, on a -- from a retail standpoint, 60 days is probably not a bad rule of thumb in terms of the kind of notice and making sure you honor your features and so forth. But you have to have -- again, absent those market items that move on a more aggressive basis. There's a lot of things to weigh in terms of timing. One example you probably -- that's been talked about in the marketplace has been a little level -- some level of liquidation on the beef side. So I mean, in the short run, the cost inputs on beef may not be up at all. And so that we wouldn't obviously be then walking in and looking for price increases related to those items until it was needed to be reflecting the cost. But that's all part of what we'll need to weigh when we establish our plan.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","All right. And just one more technical question. Receivables were up in the quarter. Anything specific behind that, Jody, or...","Jody H. Feragen","No, I wouldn't say there was anything specific behind that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Zaslow.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So just going over Refrigerated Foods a little bit, your profitability was a little bit higher than we expected and despite the whole wheat, fresh pork margins. But it sounds like it was driven by the value-added side of it. So if the improvement in fresh pork is going to be a little bit more sustainable, and assuming that your value-added portfolio is not going to decrease, it's going to continue going the same -- in the right direction, why wouldn't your refrigerated profitability in the fourth quarter, at least the margin structure, continue on this path given that you have this similar tailwind on the improvement in the fresh pork and assuming that's -- the value-added stays the same?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","There's some logic to that. The comp of the pork cutout from last year was really quite favorable in Q4, and although it's improved this -- from negative, it's still a lot lower than what last year was. But I would agree on the momentum side in terms of the value-added products. We were very pleased with a wide array of the retail items being up for the quarter and having really good years. So overall, that is the game plan for Refrigerated Foods is to drive growth through their Foodservice and Meat Product segments and to then respond as well as they can to what happens in the cutout arena.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But even in the third quarter, the profitability was higher year-over-year but the fresh pork was obviously much lower year-over-year.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","That's correct.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But is there something more going -- I mean, it seems like there's something maybe going on a little bit more structurally, is that a fair point, that maybe we shouldn't be looking to fresh pork margins as much anymore? It just seems like it was the fresh pork margin for the quarter for -- to say this bluntly as possible is dismal at best. So I'm just trying to figure out, you guys did not have that impact on your earnings, and just trying to figure out why is it more sustainable than we should kind of think of it more like what has happened on the turkey side since '08 as well.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, I mean, this hasn't been from our doing, but what does seem to have changed structurally is that we're even having to talk about cutout margins. Because I mean it used to be they were just kind of a fairly benign, you didn't expect to make much money in that part of the business, but that was part of the assets you had to invest in order to control your own supply. They've been very volatile over the -- not just this year, over the last several years. So on any given quarter, I may have to ask Kevin to do a little follow-up with you on that. But a lot of it can be well what are the comps -- the first 2 quarters of the comps were just breathtaking. I mean they were extremely positive the year before and then swung to extremely negative this year. We've had good value-added results all year long. I think those were shrouded by that huge swing in the first half and then they were able to kind of emerge and, at least, deliver some growth in Q3. And we're hoping to see somewhere along those same lines in Q4.","Jody H. Feragen","And I guess to follow up to Jeff's comment, fourth quarter of 2011, I think the pork P&L margin was close to $8, and we're not certainly seeing those today. So we've got more difficult comps than last year.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","You will have the same comp comparison though in third quarter now, relative comp comparison. I'll take it offline. It just seems like it was a much better result and it seems like there's something underlying it. I'll take it off-line, no problem.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ann Gurkin.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I thought you could help me understand something. I guess, what is the potential or likelihood that you could get in your term tailwind from lower pork input prices? I mean, I guess have you locked those prices or is there opportunity to take advantage if there are a number of hogs brought to market and if we see these prices decline near term, what is the possibility of that positively helping you all?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","We haven't historically taken a lot of positions on the pork side in contrast to what Jody explained on the cost side for grain inputs for Jennie-O. It certainly -- that's one of a number of things the team can assess over time as to whether they think we ought to treat that differently given certain market dynamics. But it's -- we don't have anything to announce in that regard right now.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","But could you potentially have a tailwind here in the near term?","Jody H. Feragen","Input costs are lower traditionally, that helps some of our value-added franchises. But there's a lot of moving parts that go along with it.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then in terms of Foodservice, any change to how you approach that business over the next 12 months?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","No. I mean, we really like our strategy in regard to Foodservice. With the core Hormel Foodservice unit, it's all about their branded items and finding solutions for operators. They continue to do a great job of connecting with both the commercial and noncommercial segments with those items. And then our -- we also have strong Foodservice components within both Specialty, Jennie-O and international. And those were experiencing reasonable results as well.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Mark Warner.","Unknown Shareholder","This is a bit of an odd question, but with the lack of demand perhaps for Europe for pork products or beef products, you all have an alternate source for the pork especially from maybe South America or somewhere else where it would be cost efficient for you all to use that in your processing versus growing your own swine, turkey, et cetera?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Really -- I mean, I can't really talk to what the industry would think of that. I can just tell you though that that's not our model, both for Jennie-O and for the Hormel operation. They're domestic-based operations that we have either ownership positions or long-term contracts in place to provide our plants with the domestic source, and that's how we intend to continue to run the business.","Kevin C. Jones","Mark, this is Kevin Jones. Could I bother you to tell us who you're with?","Unknown Shareholder","I'm just an individual investor, but I just know enough about farming even though I'm not a farmer to know that if this situation continues here -- I'm actually in the horse business, and I know the cost of feed price is going up. So my concern as a stockholder is, long term, if you all are looking to maybe expand that model and try to get proteins from elsewhere because I've seen what's happened to feed prices feeding horses.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alan Brochstein.","Alan Brochstein","I just -- Jody, it seems like every quarter you get the same question and give the same answer on capital. The only difference is it just -- your cash balance is getting bigger and bigger. And I was wondering on that front, you talk about the potential for acquisitions? Are there -- have you had any serious discussions, is that something that we can expect in the next 3 to 6 months?","Kevin C. Jones","Alan, can I just interject? Could you please help me know where -- I missed your last name.","Alan Brochstein","I'm sorry, it's Alan Brochstein, Kevin. I've visited you 2 years ago. I'm with AB Analytical. Sorry about that. Did you hear the question, Jody?","Jody H. Feragen","Oh, yes, I did. And I really can't comment about any acquisition at this point in time.","Alan Brochstein","So given that, that remains a long-term strategy but it seems like for the last few years, your acquisitions really haven't used that much capital, what is your thought about a one-time dividend to shareholders given how high your cash balances have gotten?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I wouldn't disagree with your comment about not using a lot of capital. But we have had some very beneficial acquisitions over the past 2 years. Just tonight, in fact, we're going to be celebrating the retirement of Bill Burke. We bought the Burke operation 5 years ago. That's been an outstanding addition to our Refrigerated Foods portfolio. We've created our MegaMex venture and made 2 other acquisitions there, the Don Miguel and Wholly Guacamole lines. We added Country Crock to our portfolio of Refrigerated items, and those have all been really great additions. And we -- we're always active in looking in multiple areas for potential things that could fit the growth model of Hormel Foods. But acquisitions, at least from our experience, by their nature, they don't just kind of come when you want them. They can tend to come in spurts, you put a lot of feelers out there and up to whether there's a meeting of the minds as to timing and price and a lot of things. So we intend to continue to pursue various ways to grow our business. The acquisitions is one of them, new product innovation is another and we continue to have success there. We do have to spend money to add onto our plants and buy new technology to support growth as well, as I mentioned at our Jennie-O facility. So I think we've mentioned on past calls, I mean, if at some point we're sitting and our cash position is mounting to $1 billion and we're -- and it's just not going anywhere, then maybe we'll have to make a different assessment as to how we've handled our cash management practices. But we're not ready to push that button at this time.","Alan Brochstein","All right, well, maybe I can ask one more final question, and maybe it's too technical, but you guys have a modifier on your short-term bonuses that -- by the way, I think you guys have an exceptional compensation plan as an aside. But this modifier basically penalizes you or would -- it takes into account your -- the capital that you use. As I read it, I don't think that there's any penalty for holding cash. Is that an accurate assessment or should I follow up with that off-line?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","That's correct. We all -- we have modifiers in place both for segments and for the total company. We manage total cash on a total company level, so the modifier at the segments clearly would not have that be a factor. And at the total company level, our assessment has been that there just -- there's a very tight number of people that really have any decision-making authority over cash, and that it just really wouldn't be an appropriate element to have in there for the total company to be weighed off of.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up from Diane Geissler.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just -- pricing has had a pretty good strategy with being sort of short to the market in the chicken business, and that's been -- they've done some pretty good margins on the value-added side. Just wondering what is your outlook for turkey? I mean, you talked about you didn't want to have a lot of commodity meat exposure, but is that a strategy that you think you could pursue, let other people raise it at $8 a bushel on corn and then you buy it on the commodity market and value-add?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, it's not something we're looking at on a broadscale basis because you make long-term commitments and put assets in place. But in any given year, I mean yes, there\u2019s a certain level of fluctuation that within your system you can tolerate. And I think that is indeed -- that would be part of the equation that the Jennie-O team would be setting next year is if you have any incremental questions as to how many eggs or poults to put in the system if you can do better buying from someone else at certain times of the year, that's something they definitely should entertain.","Operator","Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to Kevin Jones for any closing remarks.","Kevin C. Jones","Thank you for all of your questions and your interest in our company. Please feel free to follow up with me with any follow-up questions that might occur to you. This is Kevin Jones again. And otherwise, everyone, have a great day."],"11919":["Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) Q2 2012 Earnings Call May 23, 2012  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Kevin C.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, May 23, 2012.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Jones, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Kevin C. Jones","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2012. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6:30 a.m. Eastern Time. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at www.hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.","On our call today is Jeff Ettinger, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jody Feragen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jeff will provide a review of the operating results for the quarter, then Jody will provide detailed financial results. The line will be open for questions following Jody's remarks.

It will also be posted to our website and archived for 1 year.","Before we get started with the results of the quarter, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making.

[Operator Instructions]","Now I will turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to announce a record quarter for both earnings and sales. Earnings for our second quarter were $0.48 per share, up 20% from a year ago, 4 of 5 segments contributed to these results. Sales increased 3% during the quarter and again, we're up in 4 out of 5 segments. Total volume declined 2%, though much of the decline was due to reduced sales of commodity meat in both our Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments.","This quarter once again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced model, as the strong performances by our Jennie-O Turkey Store and All Other International segment and year-over-year gains by Grocery Products and Specialty Foods, more than made up for the softer results by our Refrigerated Foods segment. I will now take you through each segment.","For Grocery Products, segment profit increased 10% on a 1% sales increase. We again experienced softness in center of the store sales during Q2, but we did see some improvement in comparison with the first quarter. Sales of our SPAM family of products grew during the quarter, aided by our fresh round of advertising, featuring a new animated character, Sir Can-A-Lot. It is noteworthy that this product line is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and is still growing, both in the U.S. and abroad. Sales of our Compleats microwave meals were soft, along with the category.","Our new product packaging and several new product varieties have still not been fully reflected in retail stores. We will continue to advertise our Hormel brand, which features this product line, along with Hormel Natural Choice deli meat and Hormel pepperoni. We are pleased with the growth of our MegaMex food product line led by Wholly Guacamole refrigerated dip and [indiscernible] Salsa. We have also rolled out some new varieties of our Wholly refrigerated salsas. Our Refrigerated Foods segment reported a 25% decline in operating profit due primarily to unfavorable pork operating margins. The company overall did benefit during the quarter from lower pork raw material cost for our value-added products, benefiting foodservice and meat products within Refrigerated Foods.","Sales for our Refrigerated Foods segment declined 1% in the quarter, reflecting lower sales of commodity pork. The team reduced harvest level during the quarter in order to limit our exposure to the unfavorable pork operating margin. Sales of retail value-added products grew, led by Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Hormel party trays, Hormel sliced pepperoni and our Di Lusso Deli products. Foodservice sales were also higher, with solid gains from Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Caf\u00e9 H ethnic products and Hormel premium bacon.","Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had another outstanding quarter, with segment profit -- operating profit up 50% on a sales increase of 7%, driven primarily by expanded sales of our retail value added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store's results also demonstrate efficiency gains throughout its farms, plant and supply chain. Sales of our Jennie-O Turkey Store fresh tray pack items and turkey burgers were particularly strong, as we continue to benefit from our Make the Switch advertising campaign late last year.","Our Specialty Foods segment operating profit increased 9% in the quarter as pricing actions taken earlier this year offset higher raw material cost. Sales by our Specialty Foods segment grew 12% during the quarter, led by private label canned meat, ingredient sales and bulk and nutritional products. In our All Other International segment, operating profit grew 52% and sales increased 11%, due primarily to strong exports of fresh pork product and sales growth in our SPAM family of products. We also saw improved results at our Purefoods-Hormel joint venture in the Philippines.","As we stated in our fourth quarter conference call last year, we anticipated a more difficult operating environment in 2012 and for comparisons to be more challenging in the first half. Our strong performance in Q2 brings us back to even in terms of earnings per share at the halfway point of the year. Heading into the second half of the year, our Grocery Products, Specialty Foods and International segments are positioned well to contribute solid earnings growth. In particular, we expect continued strong performance from our international team, which is benefiting from a positive export environment and from their branding and marketing efforts.","The run of gains at Jennie-O Turkey Store has lasted longer than I originally anticipated and the recent decline in commodity turkey values, coupled with higher grain inputs, may slow these gains going forward. We do plan on running a new advertising campaign later this year to help drive the continued growth in the sales of our value-added turkey products. We look for our Refrigerated Foods segment to improve in the back half of the year through improved margins and sales of our value-added products, even as pork operating margins remain below typical levels. Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2012 earnings guidance range of $1.79 to $1.89 per share.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen, to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning. Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 totaled $127.9 million or $0.48 per share compared to $109.6 million or $0.40 per share a year ago. Earnings for the first half of fiscal 2012 were $256.3 million or $0.95 per share compared to $258.4 million or $0.95 per share last year. Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $2.01 billion compared to $1.96 billion last year, a 3% increase. For the first half, dollar sales increased 4% to $4.05 billion. Volume for the second quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, down 2% from fiscal 2011. Year-to-date, volume was 2.41 billion pounds, down 2% compared to last year.","Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 7.4% of sales, down from 8.2% last year. Year-to-date, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.4% compared to 7.9% last year. SG&A expenses are expected to be around 7.5% of sales for the remainder of the year. Interest and investment income was $2.3 million for the second quarter compared to $2 million last year. Year-to-date, interest in investment income was $3.9 million compared to $2.9 million a year ago.","Interest expense for the quarter was $3.3 million compared to $7.2 million last year. For the first half of fiscal 2012, interest expense was $6.5 million compared to $13.8 million a year ago. With lower debt levels and decreased interest rates, we expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2012. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5% versus 33.9% in fiscal 2011. The year-to-date effective tax rate is 33.5% compared to 34.4% last year.","For fiscal 2012, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34.5%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 269 million. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock during the second quarter, spending $31 million. We have 1.9 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $29 million compared to $31 million last year. Year-to-date depreciation and amortization totaled $59.7 million compared to $62.3 million a year ago. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $115 million in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $28 million compared to $19 million last year. For the first half, capital expenditures were $58 million compared to $36 million last year. For fiscal 2012, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million to $130 million.","As we mentioned last quarter, we integrated the sales of Don Miguel Foods, part of our MegaMex Foods joint ventures starting with our fiscal third quarter. Our retail sales force has responsibility for representing this expanded Mexican foods portfolio, and we will report these sales in our Grocery Product segment. Profits will continue to be accounted for through equity and earnings in the Grocery Products segment. As a result, added sales from the Don Miguel integration for the second half of 2012 are estimated to be $80 million to $90 million.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Farha Aslam from Stephens.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Could you just provide us some more color around the turkey business, in terms of -- for the full year, what do you think volumes and kind of sales and operating profits will do for that division?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Volume will probably continue to trend slightly down because it's based primarily on the total number of turkeys we're bringing into the operation, and we said we are running a tight operation this year on that basis. We would expect net sales to be up somewhat as pricing has -- we've had to take pricing in the past and that will continue to roll through in the second half of the year. In terms of earnings, the unit, obviously, has done very well thus far this year. They will be facing more pressure in the form of increased grain costs in the second half and the commodity markets have gone down somewhat in terms of the commodity meat sales. So those will pressure their ability to continue to deliver the very large gains that we've seen thus far. But overall, we think that business is positioned well and with the ad campaign we mentioned and continued spending against the value-added line, we still have a positive outlook for Jennie-O for the remainder of the year.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So you expect profits to be up year-over-year in that division by \u201913 would you say?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, clearly for the year, based on the strong start, they're going to be up. We're not going to give a specific segment-by-segment amount in terms of exactly what we're looking at for Jennie-O, but we talked early in the conference call at the end of last year about them holding their own. They've done more than hold their own thus far. They may have enough momentum to be able to continue to generate positive gains. But the floor we would see would be to be able to at least hold their own at last year.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, Jody, on the corporate expense, it's kind of down almost half year-over-year. I was wondering what drove that and if you could just give us a color on what it's going to be for the full year as well as what interest expenses for the full year.","Jody H. Feragen","I gave that as part of the script, Farha. So let me pull back to make sure I state it correctly. But our general corporate expenses were positively impacted by our insurance experience, if you will. Our medical and pension accounts ended up being more positive this year versus last year when we had some unfavorable trends. For your other question -- and for the full year, we expect it to be more around the 7.5% in net sales for total SG&A. And then interest expense, we're looking at the $12 million to $14 million. Really, we're down in the level of debt that we have and the interest rate is much lower on the bonds that's outstanding.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Christine McCracken from Cleveland Research.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","I just wanted to dig a little bit into your -- what appears to be export strength in your All Other segment. It does seem like things have slowed a little there. I'm just curious if you could detail and\/or provide any color around pockets of strength. I think you mentioned your Philippines joint venture. But specifically, if you have any other color around that segment that could help us understand what you're looking for over the balance of the year.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, general export, the one area we've seen a little bit of a slowdown would be Korea, given that last year they had foot and mouth issues and their herd has come back to about 90% of where it was. Even with that, our numbers year-over-year for the quarter were pretty favorable or down slightly in Korea. We more than made up for that with the rest of the Asian markets and when it comes to fresh pork. And then in terms of some of our partnerships, you correctly referenced the San Miguel Philippine partnership as being very favorable for the quarter. We continue to improve our results in China, albeit it's still not a large contributor to the bottom line, but it's heading in the right direction. So we're comfortable with our Asia focus and it's a combination of pork items, both fresh and processed. And then SPAM is a very important product in the Philippines and Korea or Okinawa. We're working to make it more important in Japan through our ad campaign there and we're back in China working on trying to build the marketplace in China for SPAM as well.","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Just as a follow-up, when I think about this business going forward, prices have softened a little, but it seems like your volumes probably see a pickup as a result. Long term, is this a business that you think can continue to grow at this pace? Obviously, it's hard to make long-term estimates based on kind of what we're seeing globally, but it seems like pork's still a popular item around the world. Is that something you expect to continue?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, Christine, your question focuses on international, I'm assuming still?","Christine McCracken - Cleveland Research Company","Yes, yes.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. Yes, yes, our expectation for International is that it would continue to grow at rates that are higher than our company-wide goals, which are the 5% revenue and 10% earnings growth. They've certainly been delivering on that strongly the last couple of years and based on the various branded franchises we have in place in different markets right now, we look at that very favorably.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I have a question. How did the quarter rate versus what your internal budgeting had been looking for coming into it? And then to the extent that it was either ahead of plan or on plan, why the conservatism on the full year outlook? Certainly, you were significantly higher than consensus. So maybe we were just all wrong versus your budget, but just trying to figure out if there's something, a particular headwind that you're concerned about, is the grain prices in turkey or pork cutout or why keep the guidance where it is?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","We talked at the beginning of the year about how we expected the first half of the year to be difficult and that we would see most of the gains -- and we provided a guidance range that clearly was going to be, hopefully, our 27th up year in our last 30 years. When all said and done for the half, we're at even. We probably did a little bit better in the second quarter than I originally anticipated and a little bit worse in the first quarter, with refrigerated experiencing a lot more significant challenges with the processing margin. You identified a couple of things that are certainly watch-outs going forward in terms of the pork operating margins are still poor right now. The center of store volumes, although improving sequentially, are still not to where we'd like them to be. But we feel we can more than offset those with the positive momentum going on in specialty with our other grocery items, with our Foodservice and meat products, with Jennie-O's branded items. And so as we sit here today, we net out that to hit our guidance range, we'll have to have continued up quarters in the high-single digits to low-double digit range. And we think that's probably a reasonable range right now for the remainder of the year.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And has the pork operating margin improved since the start of the third quarter?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","It's bounced around. It improved some initially, and the very current picture is not very pretty right now.","Diane Geissler - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So would you say there's really no discernible trend yet on pork cutouts?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I would agree with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Ramey from D.A. Davidson.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just to take another cut at the Jennie-O Turkey Store question which, obviously, these results have just been stunningly good. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks you thought the gains have been strong and the gains would slow. If that's -- I just want to verify that, that's exactly what you mean rather than things will start to have tough comps or down comps. If you continue to think that we're going to have up numbers in Jennie-O Turkey Store at least, I for one, have been way too bearish on that.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, through the half, their segment profit is up 22%. Our best look right now, I would say that they should not be continuing at that kind of an increased rate for the remainder of the year. However, we do believe at this point that they should be able to still generate a positive second half year-over-year, and it will be somewhere between that as an up end and flat as a down end.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And I guess, just thinking about it, seems early to be starting to think about fiscal '13. But at some point, these numbers become comps. We thought they were going to be difficult comps in 2012 and you've been able to continue to generate great returns there. Has your thinking changed about -- I mean, should we be thinking about Jennie-O Turkey Store as a 19%, 20% EBIT margin kind of business now?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I think I would agree that, that's probably above the high end of where we think our run rate would be on an annualized basis. They ended last year at 14%. They'll clearly do a little bit better than that this year. Obviously, we've not done any budgeting yet for 2013. Well, looking at the crystal ball as you are, clearly, their comps will be challenging again for next year. I would say, at least, as where we sit here today, that frankly, Refrigerated Foods comps will be not as challenging and so that could be an area where we would make that up. And then ultimately, it's the same old story. It's that -- what are the value-added franchises within all these business units doing and as long as we can continue to drive growth there, we should be in good shape, long term.","Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And Jody, did you say anything about your -- if you did, I missed it. The length of your corn forward purchase commitment at this point? Your general view on, do we want to be long or short?","Jody H. Feragen","Our traditional hedging policy is 25% to 75%. Last year, 2011, we were probably on the high side of that range, this year we're probably more in the middle side of that range. And obviously, we look for input from the business units to secure positions that they think they can live with in the marketplace. So we do have some for 2012 and some for 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to talk a little more about Jennie-O. You had pretty fantastic flow-through of the incremental sales to your margins, something like 100% incremental margins. And you mentioned a couple of buckets of drivers of that, including shift to value-add and some cost efficiency programs. Could you go a little bit deeper into the kind of what drive -- what drove what proportion of the incremental margin in the quarter?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I guess the best I can do with that, on the value-added side was that our kind of the star performer in terms of being able to continue to generate not only net sales growth but volume growth was the retail area. That retail, fresh tray pack franchise that, frankly, we acquired back in 2001 from the Turkey Store and that our team's done a great job of growing ever since, is very robust right now. It's been well supported by the ad campaign that we ran the last 2 years and that we're intending to run again this fall. And so that's been a key driver on the value-added side. And that being said, both the foodservice and deli sides of the business have really been holding their own in a challenging environment, where price often has to be pushed, but they really done a nice job of maintaining volume there. In terms of efficiencies, they really are kind of across-the-board, that's by far the most vertical part of our business all the way from breeder hatchery operations, to feed mills, to owning our own barns, in many case. And also partnering with family farms in the area in terms of grow out. We've been able to really push improvements throughout that aspect of the supply chain through our plant operations and through our logistics area and those are all paying off for Jennie-O in terms of offsetting a lot of those other green input increases.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Would you normally expect the incremental volume in the retail piece or any of the buckets of the end markets to drive full flow-through to profits or shouldn't be there's some sort of variable margin associated with the typical sales growth story?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I mean, not having the benefit of the model you're running, I will say that, in general, our philosophy in the company is not only convert commodity to value add, but to move value add up a value chain that ultimately does widen the margin. As we innovate with new products, we look for higher returns on innovative new items and there may be a category that has a lot of competition and has been around a while. So in the long run, we do think the flow-through ought to be quite good. I don't know whether dollar for dollar is a realistic expectation.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you just give us a sense of what the breakout of the mix is now of value-added versus the commodity meat within that division?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","At Jennie-O?","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I mean, on a dollar sales basis, Jennie-O is close to 80% value added. On a tonnage basis -- now assuming, we internally, frankly, count the whole bird part as more of a commodity aspect of the business. It is branded but it behaves more on markets and so forth. So assuming that volume is in the commodity volumes, then the volumes are probably closer to 60% value added and 40% in the other category.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just lastly, I know that this is a much smaller piece of your overall business but can you comment at all on what you think has been driving some of the pressure in the fresh pork business? Some industry participants have talked about pink slime as having some negative spillover effect, perhaps some change in exports, perhaps some change in some of the competitive activity, any perspective you can add as to why we're seeing the magnitude of margin pressure we are in this business would be helpful.","Jody H. Feragen","So I don't know if you're talking about the pork operating margins. But generally what we've seen is real softness in the domestic market for pork products. Some speculation that it's retailers holding the price and consumers not buying into that franchise. And then for the price of hogs, I'm still mystified as why they continue to drive up in this type of an environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rohan Patkar from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is Akshay Jagdale, actually. My question was on the pork processing side actually, just -- what's your impression of what happened that resulted in lower packer margins? And just a follow-up to that, how are you thinking about those factors as we move forward?","Jody H. Feragen","Well, we certainly did not expect that for the second quarter, the pork operating margins would be negative. And as I indicated before, it seems to be a combination of softer domestic demand on the cutout side and more demand for the hogs that run up prices on that side of the business. Going forward, outlook for the year would be that those pork operating margins would remain below the levels of last year, but improving in the fall as we get into a traditionally more robust season for production on the hogs side.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So that -- just to be clear, so that improvement in margins will be a result of better domestic demand? Is that sort of a seasonal factor that you're applying?","Jody H. Feragen","My seasonal factor was related to the production of hogs. So more hogs on the ground in the fall as we traditionally see, but still thinking that pork operating margins will be below last year's level.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But demand will be -- you are assuming that demand will get better?","Jody H. Feragen","Probably expecting the cutouts to be below last year as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow from BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","In terms of the center of the store, can you talk about what you think the drivers have been to why -- you guys are not the only packaged food company to actually talk about the center of store being a little sluggish. Can you talk about what you think the macro environment is that's keeping it from happening -- from accelerating? And then what are you guys doing to compensate for that and to drive center of the store -- consumers back to the center of the store?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. Yes, I mean, everyone kind of has theories on it. We certainly believe there has been some effect related to pricing, that a lot of manufacturers have been confronted with steep increases in raw materials in the types of products that go center of the store. And that have therefore had to push pricing. And we're no exception to that. So at some point, if you take a couple of rounds of price increases if there's at least some short-term resistance to those levels, those could be being reflected. Tied in with that would be, we are seeing a change in terms of promotional behavior and response, where, say, the kind of deals that many retailers would do 10 for 10s, 10 cans of something for $10, et cetera, that those just are not receiving the response they used to. At least, that's been our experience. I think when you do have a cash-strapped consumer, they still like the items, but they're just not willing to load in the pantry at that kind of a level, so that creates year-over-year comp challenges. We definitely feel there has at least been some weather effect, I would concede that, that only make sense with items that seem to be more -- like in our case, canned chili, that had a not-so-great half. This year's winter has been very benign. The year before was very cold. A lot of weekends lost to the Foodservice trade where people ate at home. In terms of what we're doing to combat it, a lot of it is just that day-to-day work you do through your sales organization with the retailers. But on top of that, advertising is clearly very important. We're going to be advertising a really wide array of our products during the second half of the year. So on the Hormel side it's -- Compleats will continue to have a campaign, as well as Natural Choice. We'll be advertising SPAM, and SPAM seems to be responding well to it. We even saw that during the second quarter. Jennie-O Turkey Store will have a new campaign and then our MegaMex venture has 3 different brands that they advertise. And MegaMex is still generating positive volume even in this environment.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So my one follow-up is, why would marketing ebb and flow? Why isn't it not more consistent throughout a year? I guess, that's my follow-up.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. I mean even though I mentioned to you the second half programs we're running, these have all been set well in advance. And we kind of set a program, it depends on seasonality of products, it depends -- in the case of the Hormel brand, we try to do it on a complementary basis so that maybe in the winter, we're running pepperoni more, that's more for kind of cooking up and heating up at home or having snacks. Natural Choice, for example, is the third Hormel brand that we're advertising. That's sandwich meats mostly, and that's more of a summer item. So I mean we'd love to have the kind of budget where we'd be on all year. And someday maybe we'll work our way up to that, but I'm using it in a prudent fashion. We lay out an advertising calendar well in advance and there is some seasonality to that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess my question is that you've seen in the Refrigerated Foods business a normalization of margins back to your historical range of 5% to 7% even at the low end. And then you have the turkey business, which is really elevated here. I know you're saying that, that's not sustainable. But you're still saying that it is going to be well above what you had thought was a normalized margin of, I think it was like 9% to 10%. So what is it about the turkey business today that you think is different about the refrigerated business so that we can hold on to these -- hold on to margins maybe in the teens instead of going all the way back down to 9% to 10%?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, on the refrigerated side, I would argue that we're on the low end of where we belong and in that area and that we need to, through better macro conditions but more importantly, through added value-added sales in foodservice and meat products, eventually get our way up to that higher end of that range. On the turkey side, internally, our expectation has to be a little bit higher in terms of returns to that business because of the verticality. I mean, we have a lot more capital invested at Jennie-O, and that's what you're hopefully getting for that investment is better overall returns. But clearly, at least for now, we seem to have hit on a good formula of driving efficiencies in the operation, most of which I don't expect to just vanish. I mean these are systemic changes that they have made that should be positive going forward. And then supporting branded differentiated items through advertising and other programs with the retailer that should continue to allow those franchisees to grow. After these couple of years, I mean, I think as we head into 2013, we'll probably assess, okay, is there a new guidance level range for where we would expect Jennie-O to be? But we're still kind of in the middle of this year now and so I don't really have that for you yet.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. But the pieces you're putting together here on Jennie-O, that would justify a higher normalized margin -- is the level of investment that you've made in terms of creating value added -- that's different from 5 years ago? Is it also maybe just the consumer is still in the early stages of per capita consumption on value-added turkey and that's changed versus 5 years ago or am I in the right direction?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, those are important. The export picture is a lot more favorable today and has steadily been that way, but increasing over the last few years. So that definitely provides some added value in a system where you're still -- a lot of the dark meat is going outside the United States. So that's a positive. The more years that go by from the acquisition, I know it's now been 10, but there's times that you find opportunities to consolidate your facilities, to utilize your raw materials better, to purchase better and so forth. And those have been kind of rolling forward as well through their system.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Eric Larson from CL King & Associates.","Eric Larson","A couple of questions. The first one is probably for Jody. Jody, just for clarification, the first half of this current fiscal year, MegaMex was accounted for only as an equity -- the only P&L item was equity earnings. Is that correct?","Jody H. Feragen","Well, it's a little more complicated than that. MegaMex, the core products that were in the original joint venture have always been sold by our consumer product sales force. So those sales have been included in Grocery Products. So that would be the Herdez items, the La Vic items, the CHI-CHI items, and I know I'm forgetting something. As MegaMex acquired additional businesses, Don Miguel and Fresherized Foods, some of the products that Jeff talked about, they were included only in equity of earnings because they were being sold outside the Hormel CPS organization. We have now integrated Don Miguel to take advantage of some synergies, particularly our sales force. So those Don Miguel sales, starting in this third quarter and going forward, will show up in the Grocery Products top line, but not -- but still be accounted for in equity and earnings. Fresherized Foods at some point in time, we'll look to see if that fits within our Consumer Product Sales organizations to see if there's anything there. But right now, it's Don Miguel and the traditional MegaMex items.","Eric Larson","Okay. What were the Don Miguel sales for the first half, I would assume you're not going to restate any of that, so you'll have that positive impact on your top line in Grocery for your first half next year. So what was roughly your sales for the first half in that business? Don Miguel?","Jody H. Feragen","I would tell you that the $80 million to $90 million range that I gave you for the back half is about what they delivered in the front half.","Eric Larson","Okay. That's fair. I thought maybe you had maybe mentioned that and I may have missed it. The next question is, when you look at your commodity costs outlook for turkey, obviously in the very short run, if you're short, you're getting penalized because of the [indiscernible] both in corn and soybeans. That will probably change for corn going forward, soybeans is probably going to be higher. But I guess the real question is, what is the mix of those 2 commodities that you feed your turkeys? Is it 50\/50? Is it 40% soybean meal, 60% corn? What is roughly the mix of feed to your livestock?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, it varies by season and what we're trying to accomplish. But just to give you a rough estimate it would be more like 2\/3, 1\/3 corn to soy meal.","Operator","And our next question is from Ann Gurkin from Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a question on Jennie-O. How has the selling been for the Thanksgiving holiday? Is that meeting expectations?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes. We're in good shape with it. It does cause volume changes in our sales numbers because it's really -- we make it up to the customer as to when they take delivery. And this year, some of them are taking delivery a little later than they did last year, so we actually have a little more inventory than we have in the past. But it's committed, so we're in good shape for that.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","And then Jody, continue to see cash build, which is a good thing. Any updates on potential acquisitions or use of cash or anything there that you could help us with?","Jody H. Feragen","I don't really have an update, but I have said in the past, obviously, we look to invest in our businesses and continue to look at strategic opportunities in the acquisition area. Anything that's a market leader or something that provides scale, something that's accretive from a margin and sales standpoint. We have made a commitment to higher capital level -- CapEx spending this year with some expansion of facilities actually adding some more capacity in our value-added areas. We've made a commitment to our shareholders on dividends, and we continue to perform very well in that area. And then opportunistically, looking at share repurchase.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I would just add, I mean, we're very happy with the couple of Mexican acquisitions we have made in the last couple of years. So about this time last year, we talked about Wholly Guacamole, it's just been a great addition to the franchise. And Don Miguel continues to grow nicely also for MegaMex.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back for any closing remarks.","Kevin C.

We are pleased to report a strong finish to fiscal 2015. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were a record $0.74 per share, up 17% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, down 6%. For the full year the Company earned and adjusted $2.64 per share representing an 18% increase over fiscal 2014. On an adjusted basis, all five segments registered earnings growth this year.","Sales for the full year were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 1%. Lower sales for the quarter and the year were primarily due to turkey supply shortages in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and price deflation in the pork markets impacting sales within our Refrigerated Foods and International segments.","I will now take you through each segment. Grocery Products operating profit was up 57% in the quarter. Normalized input costs and improved productivity drove the gains. Sales grew 4% this quarter led by SKIPPY peanut butter, DINTY MOORE stew, HORMEL chilly, and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips.","For the year, adjusted segment profit was up 23% and sales were up 4%. We are especially pleased with the sales growth of our SKIPPY peanut butter products given a price decrease in the peanut butter category earlier this year. We continue to build momentum in our snacking portfolio with excellent results from our WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis along with positive early reads on our most recent innovation SKIPPY P.B. Bites!.","Refrigerated Foods' fourth quarter segment profit increased 27%, with sales down 5% and volume up 2%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was up 26% and sales decreased 6% on a volume increase of 1%. Results in the fourth quarter were driven by nice increases by our affiliated foods businesses, higher pork operating margins, the addition of the APPLEGATE business, and an improved product mix.","Our Refrigerated Foods team had a heightened focus on margin expansion this year and has made nice strides. Lower dollar sales reflect price reductions on some items compared to last year's record high pork markets and the dissolution of Precept Foods the latter of which we will have lapped after this quarter.","Our Foodservice group continues to deliver innovative solutions for foodservice operators with notable growth on items such as our HORMEL Fire Braised meats and HORMEL pizza toppings.","On the retail side of the business, HORMEL pepperoni, HORMEL refrigerated entrees and HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays delivered sales gains this quarter. We have owned the APPLEGATE business for a few months now and we are pleased with its performance constrained partially by the availability of pork and turkey raw materials during the quarter. The APPLEGATE team remains on track to deliver results consistent with our initial guidance for this business.","Jennie-O Turkey Store fourth quarter segment profit declined 23% on an 18% sales decrease. For the full year, operating profit was up 1% and sales decreased 2%. Results were impacted by high pathogen avian influenza as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales. We have now completed the repopulation of all of our turkey barns. We've not experienced any new outbreaks thus far into the fall migration of wild birds. While we have been able to purchase some turkey meat to partially offset flock losses, turkey breast prices remain at a record high due to overall industry shortages.","Our team continues to work closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control future outbreaks, and with our customers as we managed through the turkey breast meat shortages. We have made many adjustments and are prepared to minimize any future impact to our operations in the event that the virus returns to our area as the migration season progresses.","Our Specialty Foods segment reported an adjusted operating profit increase of 155%. Muscle Milk sport nutrition products sales increased nicely though the gain was not enough to offset some reductions in contract packaging sales, leading to a net 3% decrease in overall segment sales this quarter. Full year results for Specialty Foods showed adjusted operating profit of 48% with sales up 22%.","The positive fourth quarter segment profit results reflect synergies captured within the CytoSport and Century Foods supply chain and a beneficial comparison to last year CytoSport acquisition related costs of $9.3 million. The CytoSport acquisition is meeting our valuation expectations.","We have decided to explore the sale of a portion of our Diamond Crystal Brands business. While the business is still performing acceptably, we feel it no longer fits within our strategic priorities. We will pursue a sale over the course of the next few months allowing us to redeploy capital and investments that better support our growth goals.","International's fourth quarter operating profit increased 3% on flat dollar sales and a 5% higher volume. Results were driven by strong SPAM luncheon meat exports and continued growth of our China business muted by soft demand for fresh pork exports in certain markets. For the full year, adjusted operating profit in the International segment was up 4% on flat sales. In October, the leader of our International segment for the past few years, Jim Snee was elected to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer and was appointed to our Board of Directors. Jim is only the 10th President in our Company's 124-year history. In his new capacity, Jim will be responsible for all five reporting segments. While the finance functions including M&A, R&D, legal, supply chain, and human resources will continue to report to me. Jim's vast experience in both our Refrigerated Foods segment and our emerging growth markets internationally position him exceptionally well to take on these additional responsibilities.","I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our long-term segment margin guidance and 2016 outlook.","James Snee","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning to all of you. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect renewed revenue growth as the year proceeds. Grocery Products should benefit from improved pork and beef input costs this year especially as compared to the first half of 2015. Along with positive sales trends for our key product lines including WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips, SKIPPY peanut butter, and our SPAM family of products, we have made significant improvements in manufacturing efficiencies over this past year, giving us the confidence to raise our long-term Grocery Products segment operating margin guidance from 12% to 14% up to the 13% to 15% range going forward.","Our value-added businesses and Refrigerated Foods should benefit from favorable raw material costs and the segment is positioned to start the year with strong earnings momentum. We expect modestly lower pork operating margins and hog prices in 2016, and plan to increase pork production by 1% to 2% over fiscal 2015. While Refrigerated Foods clearly benefited from favorable market conditions in 2015 our team has also made significant progress in their efforts to improve product mix and drive sustainable margin improvements. Given these advancements, we are increasing our long-term segment profit margin range from 5% to 8% up to 7% to 10% going forward.","We look for Jennie-O Turkey Store to return to growth in the back half of the year if there are no significant recurrences of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Volumes will remain constrained in the early part of the year as we continue to rebuild our system after significant bird losses last spring. In addition to lower volumes, Jennie-O Turkey Store is also facing difficult comparisons to fiscal 2015's strong first half performance. We expect turkey breast meat prices to remain elevated until the industry can see the impact of the spring bird migration. Lower grain input costs will be a tailwind in 2016. In terms of long-term segment profit margin guidance, we are modestly tightening our guidance range for Jennie-O Turkey Store previously at 13% to 17% narrowed to 14% to 17%.","We expect the Specialty Foods segment to deliver increases through the growth of our MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products. Protein nutrition products remain on trend and promising new products in our innovation pipeline for this category should continue to drive success. Our long-term segment margin guidance for Specialty Foods remains at 8% to 11%. Though we are encouraged to see their upward migration within this range, the range does include contributions from the Diamond Crystal Brands business. If a sale occurs, we will provide an updated guidance range for this segment.","We look for the International segment to achieve year-over-year improved results through increased sales of our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products along with expansion of our China business. We are maintaining our long-term International segment margin guidance at 14% to 17%. From a total Company perspective, in light of the improved ranges mentioned, we are increasing our operating profit margins range from 9% to 12% to a new range of 10% to 13% reflecting our current business structure, product mix, and typical market volatility. Deporting our brands remains the top focus for us.","In 2016, we are planning a double-digit increase in advertising support over the prior year. We will focus advertising dollars on REV's snack Wraps HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays, HORMEL pepperoni, our SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter, MUSCLE MILK protein rich products, and in the back half of the year, we expect to reignite our Jennie-O Make The Switch campaign. The MegaMex joint venture will also continue to provide significant marketing support to the wholly and [Herdez] brands of Mexican food products. We also plan to reinvest in our business through higher capital investments in fiscal 2016. We expect to complete the construction of our new plant in [Zhanjiang], China and start production there by the end of 2016.","Here in the U.S., we intend to increase capacity for our HORMEL bacon products and Jennie-O fresh turkey tray pack items. Additionally, we plan to expand our research and development capabilities through the construction of a newest new facility to support our team's constant focus on food safety, quality, and innovation. After taking these significant factors into account, we've established our fiscal 2016 earnings guidance range at $2.85 to $2.95 per share.","At this time, I will turn the call over at Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015.","Jody Feragen","Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. On a GAAP basis, net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $187.2 million, up 9% over last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.69, a 10% increase. Excluding non-recurring charges adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $199.9 million, up 17% from net earnings of $171.3 million last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.74, up 17% compared to $0.63 per share a year ago.","As Jeff mentioned, we made the decision to sell a portion of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. This business has now been classified as held for sale and asset impairment tests were performed as part of the evaluation process. The fourth quarter included pre-tax non-recurring charges of $21.5 million relating to a goodwill impairment charge for this business and that is reflected in our Specialty Foods segment. We also had a positive $8.9 million adjustment due to a reduction of a contingent consideration liability related to the CytoSport acquisition. This adjustment was due to an updated evaluation of the earn-out targets associated with the acquisition. The CytoSport earn-out agreement requires aggressive financial targets to be met and sales got off to a slower start than anticipated in the earn-out. To be clear CytoSport continues to meet the base business case used in our valuations.","For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were $2.64 representing an 18% increase over last year with all five segments contributing to the earnings growth. Sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.5 billion for the same period last year, a 6% decrease. Sales were down 10% excluding the incremental impact of APPLEGATE and MegaMex products not included in last year's results. Lower pork prices, turkey supply shortages due to high path avian influenza and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture were the primary drivers of sales declines compared to last year.","For the full year dollar sales were $9.3 billion down less than 1% compared to last year. Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, down 2% from fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales for the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. For the full year, volume was 5.1 billion pounds up 2% over the prior year.","Selling general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 7.9% of sales compared to 6.5% last year. For the full year, selling general and administrative expenses were 8% of sales compared to 7% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8% of sales for fiscal 2016.","Advertising expense for the fourth quarter was $29.6 million compared to $22.4 million last year. Full year 2015 advertising expense was $145 million compared to $114 million last year.","Equity in earnings of affiliates was $8 million in the fourth quarter versus $5.7 million last year. The increase is largely the result of improved earnings at our MegaMex joint venture.","Interest expense for the quarter was $3.8 million compared to $3.4 million last year. Year-to-date interest expense was $13.1 million up from $12.7 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $14 million for fiscal 2016.","Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35.2% versus 34.1% in fiscal 2014. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 35% compared to 34.3% last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 34%.","The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 264.3 million and 264.1 million respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 270.9 million and 270.5 million shares respectively. We repurchased 400,000 shares of common stock spending $24.9 million in the fourth quarter. We have 7.8 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.","Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million unchanged from last year. During the fourth quarter, we paid down $165 million of the $350 million short-term debt associated with the APPLEGATE acquisition. The remaining $185 million is expected to be repaid in fiscal 2016.","Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $47.3 million unchanged from last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $144.1 million compared to $159.1 million last year. The primary driver for the lower capital expenditures was our decision to delay the addition of capacity for Jennie-O fresh tray pack products in the face of lower turkey supply in 2015. We plan to move forward with this project in 2016 assuming there are no significant recurrences of avian influenza. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million as several projects in process during 2015 are completed in 2016, including the construction of a new plant in China and other projects Jim mentioned earlier.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $34.4 million compared to $32.9 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $133 million compared to $130 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2016.","As Jim mentioned earlier, we have established a fiscal earnings guidance range at $2.85 to $2.95 per share for 2016. This guidance includes a full year of contributions from our Diamond Crystal business. When a sale of the business occurs, we will provide updated earnings guidance. Fiscal 2016 also includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. We have assumed the 53rd week will contribute approximately 1% of the earnings increase over last year in our guidance range. We announced a $0.16 per share increase to the annual dividend making a new dividend $1.16 per share. This represents a 16% increase on top of a 25% increase last year and marks the 50th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend rate.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question, we'll hear from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","Hey, yes, thanks. Good morning everyone.","Jeffrey Ettinger","Good morning.","Adam Samuelson","So I guess more detail on the margin, so let's say in the quarter and in the outlook the normalize ranges that you provided. Maybe in the quarter can you provide a little more clarity on, and especially in Grocery and Jennie-O, the very sharp year-over-year margin improvement that you saw, and maybe give a little more color on the drivers there? Was it simply timing of raw materials, manufacturing efficiencies, mix, a little bit more granularity there? And then on the long-term target, I appreciate you updating the long-term ranges, but I'm just trying to think about where you are today and especially Grocery, Refrigerated, and Jennie-O still running near at the high-end of the ranges that you've laid out and thinking about the contributors to earnings growth going forward, if you still think your margins are near the high-end of the normalized range? Thanks.","Jeffrey Ettinger","Thanks, Adam, this is Jeff. So in terms of the current quarter, on the Grocery Products side, what we feel we're seeing is a return to normalized margins in terms of some of the raw material inputs coupled with some systemic changes in our overall operations environment, while we feel we have added efficiencies that will stick and we attribute that to the strong quarter they just generated and also that was why we have now increased that earnings guidance range by 1% on either end for the Grocery Products group. ","In the case of Jennie-O Turkey Store, you'll recall we provided our best shot at what our second half adjusted guidance range would be in light of avian influenza and it pulled the range down to the 10% to 12% range. We certainly did see better returns in that in the fourth quarter on the aggregate for the half that turned out to be closer to 14%. They were able to do better on some of the dark meat-based items than we originally anticipated and they did a nice job of obtaining as much efficiency as possible in their operations. ","In the case of Jennie-O Turkey Store, you will see, we really are not changing the upper end of the guidance range, but we did tighten up the bottom end like partially to their success and being able to achieve what they did this quarter. ","The only other thing I guess I would add in terms of the long-term target ranges is clearly the Refrigerated Foods group with their performance this year broke out of the previous range and we were at a 5% to 8% range and they exceeded 9% this year. We have confidence in that business unit\u2019s ability to maintain margins and grow them over time from that level, and hence we've raised that guidance range to the 7% to 10% range. ","Specialty Foods have seen improvement within the range as Jim indicated in his comments, but the overall results for the year are still within the guidance range we had previously provided, so we're leaving that unchanged especially with the DCB issue still lurking out there. ","Overall, what we felt it added up to was a 100 basis points change in the total Company margins and so we're looking at now 10% to 13% as being what we think we can look at going forward versus the 9% to 12% we had previously provided.","Adam Samuelson","It's very helpful, Jeff. And maybe just on Refrigerated piece, as you think look about the 200 basis points increase in the range there, would you attribute that to any particular part of the business? Bacon comes to mind as an area that's been seems to be particularly strong this year or really just manufacturing efficiencies and value-added mix, any more color there?","Jeffrey Ettinger","It's been a strong performance all the way around and we think it's a sustainable progress with these brands. Bacon is clearly a shining spot for that group both on the meat products and foodservice side. While both of those value-added units had excellent results beyond just the bacon franchise as we mentioned some of the brands that did well in the release, pepperoni and party trays and entrees for the Refrigerated Foods retail group and then on the foodservice side pizza toppings and Fire Braised meats and other items. The affiliated part of Refrigerated Foods which is our Farmer John, Burke, and Dan's Prize operations, all had excellent years and contributed nicely to the results and they too as I mentioned with Grocery we've tried to attain some long-term efficiencies Refrigerated Foods certainly has not been quiet in that respect also. And so it all really adds up to that new level that they are now able to attain.","Operator","And next we'll move on to Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc.","Farha Aslam","Hi good morning.","Jeffrey Ettinger","Good morning.","Farha Aslam","Could you share with us your pork margin, basic pork margin estimates for this year and also if that's factored into your guidance and then the longer-term outlook what's kind of in your longer-term guidance?","Jody Feragen","Sure. I guess everybody is pointing at me Farah. I have to take the pork's operating margin question. So certainly they were stronger than we expected in the fourth quarter and moving into the first quarter of 2016, they are pretty robust. I would expect as the year goes on that those will trend downward and we'll see modestly lower pork operating margins. Supply seems to be robust. Demand at this point in time is robust as well so that's basically what we factored into our business model going forward. Really this was the first quarter where we saw pork operating margins for Refrigerated business unit being a contributor to the year-over-year results and that's really been an improvement on their mix and the value-added products.","Farha Aslam","And just as a follow-up. Could you talk about the recovery in the turkey business and the timing of that recovery?","Jeffrey Ettinger","What we're seeing in terms of the supply challenges, fortunately it's been a benign fall thus far and there is obviously close watch even in terms a wild bird testing to make sure that we're not encountering the renewed presence of high pathogen avian influenza and kind of knock on wood thus far, we've not seen that. We were able to completely refill our barns, but as we talked about before, the primary turkey for most of our value-added items is our tom turkeys. It's a 22-week market cycle and so we will not been fully back to normalized volumes throughout the earliest of second quarter of fiscal 2016. That being said, the team has done the best job they can with making sure that we have the product allocated fairly among our customers in terms of what is available. And then ultimately as Jim indicated, if everything continues to go well and we don't have any further outbreaks, we should be in a position by second half of next year to renew our successful Make The Switch advertising campaign and restimulate growth for Jennie-O Turkey Store brand.","Operator","And next we'll move on to Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital.","Patrick Chen","Hey good morning. This is Patrick Chen in for Ken. A quick question about pork exports, we understand that China has opened its borders again to a couple of processing plants including yours. Just wondering what the broad implications are for your pork exports, your pork margins, and input costs for other parts of your business? Thank you.","James Snee","Good morning, Patrick, this is Jim. Last year 2015 was a struggle with the pork exports especially in our International business. One of the bigger contributing factors was when Russia banned the imports from the European Union that supply had to go somewhere and it did find its way into the Asian market in general at similar favorable currency rates, and so more supply, favorable rates really were almost a perfect storm against us last year. Certainly the opening up of the China market and the approval of our plants, while we don't export pork directly into the China markets because of their ractopamine or lack of ractopamine requirement, what we do think it'll do though is really maybe redistribute the supply of the available product. And so as we're looking into 2016 for our pork exports in the International business specifically, we think sometime in the second quarter, the back half of the year, we'll be able to return to more normalized levels of our export business which is still a very important part to our overall International business.","Patrick Chen","Great, thank you. I'll pass it on.","Operator","And next we'll move to Heather Jones with BB&T Capital Markets.","Heather Jones","Good morning.","Jeffrey Ettinger","Hey Heather.","Heather Jones","I had a question first on your pork business. Talking about, it sounded like you have a pretty bullish outlook on the fresh pork side. And one thing that we've been hearing from a number of companies in the industry is that, you were looking at the USDA cutout? Just how that's trending? Is there seem to be a widening gap between what USDA is reporting on that cutout and what company are seeing on a blended basis? And I understand you guys have not a value-add, but just wondered if you're seeing a similar trend, so that maybe the USDA cutout is not as good proxy as it used to be for just trend for pork prices?","Jody Feragen","I'm not familiar with where your data is coming from, but one of the contributing factors could be the fact that the drop credits that are not included in the cutout have significantly declined from normalized type level, so that could be causing some of it -- those are credits or items that aren't traditionally sold in the U.S. or byproducts of the productive process.","Heather Jones","Yeah, I was talking about on the cutout specifically, but it sounds like you're not seeing same things. On your Jennie-O business, what do we understand Hormel is backwards integrated back to the greeters where it's quite a bit your competitors not, so it sounds as if Hormel's Jennie-O's volumes may return to normal borrowing another operate quicker [indiscernible] overall industry will return to normal from the volume perspective. It's what we understand basically on our conversations. And I guess my question is, I understand the difficult comparisons for the first half, but as we're thinking about late Q2 and Q3, I know a lot of your business is valued-added and more fixed price contract type of thing, but the part that is on the market, should we see some benefit from you guys having your volume return to normal quicker than the overall industry and there is still being benefit from some elevated pricing?","Jeffrey Ettinger","Well, Heather. Let me I guess make sure we're on the same page in terms of the verticality of the Jennie-O operation. We don't actually engage in the breeder stock, we do have our own hatcheries, so we do have a direct egg source. Our egg experience from what we're seeing in the industry maybe a little bit better than the overall industry number, but that's as close as I can get to being able to compare ours to others. In terms of that the second half outlook, we've frankly been the leader when it comes to branded value-added products for some time. I mean we're the one that's advertising. We're a local company that creates innovative new products. We have a dedicated team that focuses on the sale those items into multiple channels, and so definitely if we have the supply in place, that team is primed and ready to renew our momentum of growing the value-added businesses indeed. I mean before this thing hit in the first half of this year, all three of our groups the Retail deli and Foodservice at Jennie-O Turkey Store, their value-added sales were all up double-digit, so they were really on a roll here and we would expect during the second half of this year, if we have the meat supplies available and can turn the advertising back on to renew that kind of growth.","Operator","And next we'll move to Diane Geissler - CLSA.","Diane Geissler","I just wanted to ask on Diamond Crystal. So you obviously took a charge there, I'm assuming that's in anticipation of potential sale. Can you help us just how big is that business and what are its topic contribution then so as we model out this year, we can kind of get an idea for what the potential dilution to your EPS would be?","Jody Feragen","So I don't think we specifically called out any profitability numbers on that business and we will provide you the appropriate guidance when we do have a transaction to talk about. From the sales perspective, it's about $250 million to $260 million, without a margin structure that's generally lower than the guided range that we have further Specialty Foods segment. We'll try to help you when we have something to talk about.","Diane Geissler","Okay. I appreciate just given quantification on the size of the business. And then Patrick ask about China, so you talked about the plant additional CapEx this fiscal year to finish the construction there. How do you think about the timing in terms of obviously for SPAM etcetera that's been a product that you had introduced [indiscernible] poll. Can you just kind of talk about what your plans are with regard to when the plant is up and running and how long you think it will take to get products, kind of out of the door and under shelves and just kind of the maybe a longer-term 12 to 24 months outlook on your business in China. Thank you.","James Snee","Thanks Diane and this is Jim. Our business in China really has been performing exceptionally well here over the last couple of years. That team is really hit their strides. In terms of needed capacity, the sooner we complete this plant the better offer going to be. We are expecting the plant to be completed in the fall of 2016, so if we think about the September timeframe, and as a reminder that plant will be a combination of Refrigerated meats and also our in-country SPAM production as you mentioned. So that plant in the capacity that's going to be made available to our business in China. It's really going to keep us on the path of sustained growth that we've been able to deliver here the last couple of years. Business is very well developed both in the retail and foodservice channels, not only on the meat side, but with our SKIPPY business, and so as we think about it going forward we're exceptionally well-positioned to continue to grow the business in me instantly and were very excited about the synergies that will get within country production a stamina and being able to leverage them against what we've learned through the SKIPPY business. And so as we think about it going forward we're exceptionally well-positioned to continue to grow that business in meats and SKIPPY and we're very excited about the synergies that we'll get with the in-country production of SPAM and being able to leverage them against what we've learned through this SKIPPY acquisition integration, so lots of the letter great things coming out of China.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And next we'll move on to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank.","Mario Contreras","So I wanted to clarify on the guidance for fiscal 2016, on the 53rd-week mathematically would expect that to add 2%, so given it's not going to add 1%. I'm just curious is that related to timing or some of that extra week profit going to be reinvested back into the business?","Jeffrey Ettinger","Okay, Mario, this is Jeff. Our business is the hybrid business between the store grocery channel and in the protein base channels, and I guess the way we assess it is yes on the protein side when you have meat coming at you in the system, you should anticipate frankly a full extra week, you'll have full cost and frankly should deliver full margins. When it comes to the Grocery side of the business which impacts not only our Grocery product segment, but also our international piece is significantly Grocery base. Our experience in the past has been, non-buying programs or those types of items, you really don't get a whole extra week. A lot of them are on monthly programs and so forth and so we're just trying to provide the guidance based on what our best experience has been. I would say though there is a certain element of reinvestment going on. We've have [stuffing] up ad spend on an annualized basis, and this current plan no exception to that. We have a number of brands that we're excited about that we think we can continue to build momentum in the marketplaces, so there is a little bit of element in general of us making sure we're reinvesting in our brands.","Mario Contreras","Okay, thanks for that. And then just one additional clarification there, corporate expense was a bit higher than its historical trend? Was there anything unusual there this quarter and what type of run rate do you think would be appropriate going forward that line item?","Jody Feragen","I would expect that, well in the fourth quarter we really had some higher employee related expenses as we took a look at all of our incentive programs and made adjustments there. We also had some higher legal expenses for some activity that was going on there. On a normalized level, I think he could look at possibly 5% increase over where we finish this full year. That ends up being a spot where lots of miscellaneous adjustments, so it's little harder to forecast. ","Operator","And next we'll move on to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hey there. A great year, great two years in a row, so here is a question about turkey. I literally just bought our turkey at Stop & Shop $75, $3.12 a pound. I mean it seems like a shockingly high priced.","Jody Feragen","Probably Jennie-O.","Robert Moskow","First question, would it be cheaper the Jennie-O. The second question, I look at your pricing back half of the year, there was no pricing despite the fact that the industry is sort of volume constraint and I'm trying to think about next year for Jennie-O. What is the pricing kind of flattish and for next year, will it continue to be flattish? And then I'm still not quite sure, I understand the cautious guidance for the first half for '16 for Jennie-O if fourth quarter came in loudly above what I had forecasted and I understand the volume constraints, but can you give us an order of magnitude on the first half profit guidance for Jennie-O?","Jeffrey Ettinger","I mean first of all, when whole bird pricing, I mean it's a relatively small percentage of the overall results of the business and you're also dealing with something that's very retailer specific and retailer dependent. I mean it ranges from apparently you hadn't experience where the retailer was certainly seeking to attain some margins out of their whole turkey sales, all the way to kind of the more historical treatment. Frankly there is a lot of retailers usually there is a lot sweeter and so you'll see a price out there and you might think that's breathtakingly low sometimes, that's not necessarily what our value was into them. It's up to the retailer to decide how to price the product.","James Snee","In the aggregate we came up with as many whole birds as we could for this year given the shortages we were fronted with and allocated them out on a national basis. In terms of your question about pricing in general and the guidance, fourth quarter is traditionally our strongest quarter, most favorable feed conversions and so forth in your birds. You do have the added bump if you will of the Thanksgiving sales rolling through. We know we're going to be short product again in Q1. We're certainly going to try to perform as strong as we can. We're going to be comparing against a very robust performance by Jennie-O Turkey Store in Q1 and Q2 in fiscal 2015. So we're comfortable that Jennie-O will be a solid contributor to the guidance range that we've provided you on an aggregate basis with most of it coming in the second half of the year.","Robert Moskow","Okay, but pricing like -- there is no pricing in Jennie-O right now and I imagine no pricing next year either and in the capacity constrained environment, I would have expected pricing to be higher. Is it because of those contracts in place with retailers or is there something else?","James Snee","It kind of runs the game, Robert. In some cases you're dealing with product shortages. In a significant enough shortage position, you may end up having a raise of price of what you have left. There are other aspects or other portfolio that you are on more of a contract basis or on a committed basis, so it's just kind of ends up blending out to the position you're seeing. Clearly there have been a steep increase in the commodity turkey pricing, but I think as we've talked about in the past, even in years and we're not sure of turkeys, we're not really a net seller of breast meat at commodity meat markets, and so these very lofty $4 and $5 rates that you're seeing on the commodity breast side that's not something we're able to enjoy in our sales. ","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Jeff for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeffrey Ettinger","Well, thank you very much. I just want to conclude by saying that I'm proud of the excellent quarter and full year performance by our team as we achieved record earnings for a 10th straight quarter. It's an extraordinary experience of our employees throughout the Company and that's such a key factor to our ability to consistently deliver strong results for the Company. On behalf of this team, I want to wish all of you Happy Thanksgiving, and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","And that will conclude today's call.

As previously announced, Jody will be retiring as CFO at the end of the fiscal year, so this will be her last earnings call. Jody has been a dynamite CFO. During her tenure, our team has delivered exceptional returns to our shareholders. She was instrumental in helping to complete over $2.7 billion in strategic acquisitions that have transformed our portfolio, and she oversaw close to $1.6 billion in dividends delivered to our shareholders.","Jody also led numerous initiatives across the accounting, treasury, information technology, corporate development, and Investor Relations areas that have made our company better. Jody will be missed around the office and we wish her well in her well-earned retirement with her husband, Dwayne.","Hormel Foods is fortunate to have a very strong bench of talent throughout our organization and the accounting and finance area is no exception. Jim Sheehan will assume the CFO position upon Jody's retirement with a deep knowledge of all areas of finance and accounting, emanating from his experience at Hormel Foods as Controller, Treasurer, and in numerous other roles. We have the utmost confidence in Jim's leadership and capabilities in this new role.","Now on to the results. Earlier today, we announced record third quarter results of $0.36 per share, up 33% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, up 5%, while volume was up 1%. Three of our five segments reported sales, volume, and earnings growth. Refrigerated foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store, and International, all posted excellent results.","Grocery products enjoyed modest top line growth, though earnings were flat for the quarter. The specialty foods segment saw declines in sales and earnings due to the previously announced divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands in May.","I would like to take this opportunity to reconfirm that our long-term goals of 5% sales growth and 10% bottom line growth continue to be a appropriate for our company. While we recognize any given year may deviate from these goals, we believe they are achievable over the long run due to our proven ability to build strong brands that resonate with consumers, innovate in categories where we compete, make strategic acquisitions and achieve balanced growth in various market conditions.","For the past two years, we have also provided segment margin ranges. These ranges were intended to offer enhanced clarity to our business. Unfortunately, we believe they have added elements of confusion as they have not always been aligned with our primary performance goals of 5% topline and 10% bottom line growth, and they were not intended to be quarterly ranges. In light of this, we have decided to curtail the practice of providing segment level ranges going forward. However, we will provide an updated total company margin target during the fourth quarter call that we feel is achievable over the next three to five years. This long-term total company margin target will be consistent with and supported by our company growth goals.","I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee, who will take you through each segment.","Jim Snee","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning everyone.","Refrigerated Foods third quarter operating profit increased 24% with sales up 9% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated foods benefited from the addition of the Applegate business, favorable market conditions, and great results from our food service business. In addition, prior year results did include $8.6 million in Applegate transaction costs. Our food service value-added products showed robust growth, led by brands such as Hormel Bacon 1 Fully Cooked Bacon, Old Smoke House Bacon, and Hormel Fire Braised meats.","We also saw sales growth from many of our retail products, including Hormel Natural Choice lunch meat and Hormel gatherings party trays. Jennie-O Turkey Store third quarter segment profit increased 59% on a 20% increase in sales. Production volumes returned to normalized levels during the quarter, which enabled the food service and deli teams to deliver strong volume, sales, and margin gains. We also saw nice retail sales growth in Jennie-O Turkey bacon.","Our retail division at Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to gain back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak last year, even as competitive activity has heightened in the broader ground meats category. International sales and operating profits both increased 5%. Strong exports of fresh pork, SKIPPY peanut butter, and SPAM luncheon meats all contributed to the increase in sales and earnings.","Our China business posted strong earnings growth as SKIPPY peanut butter products more than offset declines in processed meats. Higher pork costs continue to pressure the domestic retail China business. Grocery product segment profit was flat for the quarter as earnings from value-added products did not offset increased advertising expenses and acquisition transaction costs related to the Justin's deal.","Sales were up 3% aided by the inclusion of Justin's specialty nut butters and strong sales from SKIPPY peanut butter, SPAM luncheon meat, and Wholly Guacamole. Our grocery products team continues to deliver exciting and innovative new products such as SKIPPY pb bites and the Herdez Guacamole salsa. Both recently introduced products are exceeding our expectations in the marketplace.","Specialty foods segment profit decreased 13% and sales decreased 25%, primarily due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands and reductions in contract manufacturing sales. Our CytoSport team posted strong growth for Muscle Milk protein beverages and powders once again this quarter. We continue to be pleased with the new Muscle Milk protein smoothies, which have been well received by consumers.","Now, as we look forward into the fourth quarter, we expect refrigerated foods to continue growing sales and earnings through increases in value-added products in both the retail and food service channels. Our early view on fiscal 2017 shows a roughly 2% to 3% increase in hog supply. With the majority of new industry capacity coming online starting in the summer of 2017, we expect to see favorable market conditions through most of fiscal 2017.","Jennie-O Turkey Store is positioned to show strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter and continues to be focused on regaining distribution. Lower grain input costs should continue to be a tailwind in the fourth quarter.","As we announced in the second quarter call, we are excited to be back on air in the second half of the year with our very successful make-the-switch campaign. We expect this advertising campaign to help improve distribution and growth of our Jennie-O ground Turkey product.","We expect continued growth in our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products to drive fourth quarter results for the international segment. Grocery products is expected to show strong sales growth driven by the inclusion of Justin's and positive momentum in SKIPPY peanut butter and Wholly Guacamole dips.","The Muscle Milk brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories and we expect that to continue. We're also very excited about the innovation the CytoSport team will be delivering in the fourth quarter.","The specialty foods segment will not show year-over-year sales and earnings growth due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business.","And finally, we continue to focus our marketing and advertising efforts on brands such as Hormel Pepperoni, Applegate, Hormel Black label bacon, Hormel Natural Choice, SPAM and Jennie-O. These marketing and advertising efforts are supplemented by the great work being done by our direct sales forces in both retail and food service channels. And we are extremely proud to report that just this week Hormel Foods was ranked number one in the 50 best companies to sell-for ranking by Selling Power magazine. This is a huge honor for the company and is further confirmation of the strength of our brands and sales teams.","So as a result of a strong third quarter performance, one-time gains from various discrete tax events and continued confidence in our business, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.56 to $1.60 per share to $1.60 to $1.64 per share. And our early look into fiscal 2017 shows us once again growing sales and earnings. We will have more precise guidance for you on our fourth quarter call.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter.","Jody Feragen","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone.","Net earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled $195.7 million, up 33% compared to $146.9 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.36, also a 33% increase. Sales for the third quarter totaled $2.30 billion, compared to $2.19 billion for the same period last year, a 5% increase.","Four of our five segments delivered revenue increases. Specialty foods sales declined due primarily to the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands. Volume for the third quarter was 1.22 billion pounds, up 1% from the same quarter last year. Tonnage was negatively impacted by the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture.","The Jennie-O Turkey Store results for the third quarter included a $9.6 million mark-to-market loss on hedges due to temporary ineffectiveness. Advertising expense for the quarter was $52.6 million, compared to $33.9 million last year, as we continued to invest in our brands across all five segments.","Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 28.6% versus 35.6% in fiscal 2015. The rate was favorably impacted by $14 million of one-time discrete tax items associated primarily with an international entity restructuring. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 32% and 32.5%, including the one-time discrete items from the third quarter.","Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 529.7 million, compared to 528.5 million shares last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 542.2 million shares compared to 541.2 million last year. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock, spending $38.6 million in the third quarter. We have 14.3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.","Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66 million, compared to $41.8 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.6 million compared to $33.3 million last year. We paid our 352nd consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15, 2016, at the annual rate of $0.58 per share. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Savannah?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Akshay Jagdale from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jody, congratulations. You'll be definitely missed.","Jody Feragen","Thank you, Akshay.","Akshay Jagdale","Yes. So, I wanted to ask about refrigerated foods and just the pork operating environment in general. For next year, I know it's hard to pin down what other people's plans are, but regarding your plan for total company growth in EPS next year, what does that assume for capacity utilization rates for the industry? Because that's an important factor next year, right? So that's my first question.","Jody Feragen","So pork operating margins for this year were a bit higher than we had initially expected on our Q2 call, really supported by great supply of hogs, which provided favorable pricing on that environment, and then continued strong demand supporting the cut-out. As far as fiscal 2017, we just started our process. We would expect them to be somewhat similar to fiscal 2016 at this point in time.","Akshay Jagdale","Okay. And Jeff, on the commentary on the long-term guidance and the change, I mean, I know you've been extremely responsible and have managed the company exceptionally well, so I trust this is the right thing to do. But I'm just trying to make sure that apart from telling us things differently, the management -- you're not changing any incentives, et cetera. There's business as usual there, right? I mean, I think what you are trying to indicate is by providing more and more clarity before, you were trying to help people, but it's starting to maybe hurt the volatility maybe in the shares. But I just want to make sure nothing is changing from a management compensation and sort of how you day-to-day manage the business now, right? Like you've grown earnings consistently over time by improving the margin mix and making good acquisitions. Everything is essentially the same in that regard; you're just changing the way you're going to be communicating with the Street, correct?","Jeff Ettinger","Appreciate the question, Akshay. Really, our company's focus is on meeting the five and 10 goals. We found that providing the individual segment operating margin ranges seem to sometimes distract from these goals. And honestly, we've not proven to be overly accurate in estimating the margins for each segment. Things come up, the Jennie-O AI issue, the DCB divestiture, et cetera, and you're dealing with variables of both sales and earnings for each business unit when you get into a margin like that.","I'd point to our performance at Jennie-O Turkey Store this quarter is a good example of why we believe the segment margin percentages may be a less meaningful measure. On an operating percentage basis, you could look at Q3 and say oh, that was a bad quarter for Jennie-O Turkey Store because its operating margins fell, but this would obscure the fact that Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered a $20 million improvement in segment profit for the quarter. Honestly, we're seeking to deliver sales and earnings dollars and not specific percentages.","Jim Snee","And Akshay, this is Jim, if I could piggyback on Jeff's comments. I think we want to be clear that we are still providing segment specific guidance when it comes to their expected contribution to those overall five and 10 goals. I think what we've learned is that some of the discussion around segment margins can be very short-term focused versus our goal of focusing on some of the long-term measures such as these corporate growth goals. And so it will be business as usual, be holding the business units accountable the same way we have in the past. There are no incentive changes, so we will be managing the business in the same way we have.","Akshay Jagdale","Okay. And just one last one on sort of timing of -- this goal has meant -- the long-term goals are truly meant to be long-term and we understand that. But help me understand -- so you've been outperforming those pretty consistently almost every year, but more so in recent years because of some favorable conditions, if I may. So when might you be expected to potentially underperform those? And specifically referring to -- are you worried about this capacity coming on in the pork -- in pork processing that we hear about? Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Jeff Ettinger","That's a great question, Akshay, and I think it's -- in any given year, top or bottom line numbers can significantly overperform and we've seen that over the last decade, right. We've had years where we've overperformed on one of those variables and underperformed on the other. But, we are focused on the long-term aspect of that.","In terms of what's happening in the industry, we've talked frequently about our balanced model. And so, we do believe that for every action, there's a reaction and so as these additional capacity comes online, there's excess supply and things that will happen on the input cost side of the business. And so, we believe that our balanced model will allow us to weather any storm if you will. And I think that's supported by the fact that we've had 27 out of 30 years of earnings growth and this year obviously will be 28 out of 31. So that's our position.","Akshay Jagdale","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Farha Aslam of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Farha Aslam","Hi. Good morning. Congratulations, Jody.","Jody Feragen","Thanks Farha.","Farha Aslam","My questions focus more on the quarter. There was a lot of M&A acquisitions and divestitures in this current quarter. Would you be able to give us kind of volume or sales regarding the acquisition of Applegate and Justin's and the impact of the divestitures of Diamond Crystal Brands as well as kind of what the impact of the Justin's transaction costs were on the quarter?","Jeff Ettinger","DCB we have provided on an annualized basis that was in the $250 million range and the quarters were relatively consistent. Jody can provide you a little color on the Justin's transaction cost.","Jody Feragen","So we've had -- didn't consider them material to be a call-out specifically for the quarter, but they amounted to between transaction costs and step-up in inventory accounting, they amounted to about $3 million. Grocery products really a lot of their segment margin change was a significant increase in advertising for that segment.","Farha Aslam","And then just on the Applegate and Justin's sales contributions or volume contributions in the quarter?","Jody Feragen","I don't have those offhand, but we guided that Justin's in fiscal 2017 was going to be about $100 million. I'd say we only own -- had them for a part of the -- Applegate is basically we're lapping that now, coming in the fourth quarter, so I don't have those specifics with me.","Farha Aslam","Okay. And then my follow-up is on the $9.6 million mark-to-market in Turkey. Would you be able to elaborate on what caused that? Do we get take back in subsequent quarters? Just more color on that mark-to-market impact.","Jody Feragen","So we're probably one of the few companies that actually uses these special accounting treatment for hedge accounting, which allows you to put the mark-to-market gains or losses in any quarter on your balance sheet and then it's recognized as it flows through cost of goods when the Turkeys come to the plant basically or as the feed is consumed. What happens when you technically become ineffective, which is a regression analysis comparing futures prices to cash markets and because of some anomalies in the cash markets this quarter, you can have them go ineffective and you recognize all the gains and losses in your P&L. So we believe a one-time impact. It's recognizing some losses that would have been recognized through the future, but they're just hitting all in one period, which kind of skews Jennie-O's results. So Nathan's really well acquainted with hedge accounting so if you want a follow-up primer on that he'd be a great one to talk to.","Farha Aslam","Just bottom line, we essentially get that back as you won't have that loss in future quarters.","Jody Feragen","Absolutely, it's a timing.","Farha Aslam","It's just timing. Thank you very much. That's very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone and let me add to everyone's congratulation, Jody, on the retirement. Maybe my first question is on the top line and less so about the quarter specifically, but more about getting back on track with that 5% revenue growth target. Were it have been and relative to continue to be in a fairly deflationary protein price environment for at least the next 18 months, which to me would suggest that to get anywhere close to that 5% and maybe it's more like 3% to 4% organic, volumes are going to have to carry a bigger portion of that total mix.","Can you talk about the volume trends that you're seeing in the business today because you look at in grocery and refrigerated specifically and there doesn't seem to be a tremendous amount of organic volume growth and maybe I'm interested in kind of your thoughts if you maybe leaned a little bit too hard into the value-added premiumization of some of these categories that's come at the expense of volumes. Thanks.","Jeff Ettinger","I mean our ultimate goal is to sell a higher mix of branded value-added items which kind of absent the switches of market conditions should over time make our net sales be a stronger growth vehicle than volume inherently. There clearly are franchises within the company that are more responsive to markets or bacon pricing or pork pricing or [indiscernible] would be more along those lines. But, most of the grocery portfolio is less that way. Jennie-O Turkey Store has been able to hold their pricing on a stronger basis. We have a lot of franchises that we're really excited about that we think are at least 5% growing franchises, many of which did quite well this quarter and so we kind of talked in past calls that we were a little disappointed with our top line but had felt it was trending in the right direction and indeed Q3 showed an acceleration of that trend and we look at that favorably now heading into next year.","Adam Samuelson","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up on the margin outlook commentary that you gave earlier. I appreciate with drawing the segment, specific segment margin guidance, but if you're going to get corporate margin expansion either your higher margin businesses are growing faster than the core are you getting aggregate margin expansion across the entirety of the portfolio. Can you talk about which pieces of that kind of split you're most excited about, maybe by business or within the portfolio specifically?","Jim Snee","Sure. Adam, this is Jim. I think on the sales side of the business, we see positive momentum in brands such as Muscle Milk. Certainly Jennie-O and the work that they've done with the ground Turkey business there and getting back on air that make the switch. The addition of the Justin's business, the SKIPPY brand, Wholly Guacamole, Herdez coming out of our MegaMex joint venture. From a food service perspective we're really positive about the work that team's been doing. Our Bacon 1 Fully Cooked Bacon, Natural Choice out of refrigerated foods. So there's a lot of excitement and momentum that we believe will continue in 2017.","Adam Samuelson","All right. Great. That's very helpful. I'll pass it along. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Mario Contreras of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Mario Contreras","Good morning.","Jeff Ettinger","Good morning.","Nathan Annis","Hi, Mario.","Mario Contreras","So I wanted to follow up on the comments around fiscal 2017 guidance. Can you just clarify -- I know maybe it's early, but the assumption of growth, is that off of a reported basis or would that be off of a 52nd week comp? And then on top of that, can you give any color around which specific segments would be more likely to contribute to growth? Thanks.","Jim Snee","So Mario, this is Jim. And it would be on a reported basis as we look into 2017. And we recognize we've had many consecutive quarters of great results and obviously a key concern is whether we really can grow in 2017. So I talked in the last question about the sales side of the business and the positive momentum that we're seeing. Another thing that obviously we believe in and it served us well is our balanced business model. So we've got a favorable outlook on key inputs, such as pork, beef, grains. That really is going to combine with the sales momentum that will allow us to submit a plan to our Board of Directors that will show growth in earnings in 2017. And clearly we'll give you a more precise look and range in November on the call.","Mario Contreras","Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just an additional question on Jenny-O. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the competitive environment there and then focusing on your market share. Are you feeling like you're getting placement on the shelves at an appropriate pace relative to your peers? Thanks.","Jim Snee","As I commented, obviously the supply ramped up throughout the quarter and that's really the best position for the Jennie-O Turkey Store business to be in. And as we look across the business, there was strong food service performance, strong business in the deli area of the business. The retail distribution has continued to be a battle but the team is having success. The trays continue to do very well and we recognize that there is competition in the meat case but this is not unusual. There's been other times in the Jennie-O Turkey Store history where they faced this type of competition and we do believe that we're seeing the growth that we deserve. And we believe that the brand and the product lines continue to be on trend with consumers and over time we'll continue to get expanded distribution and share.","Mario Contreras","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Rob Moskow","Hi. Thanks and congratulations again, Jody. Just some clarity on the fiscal 2016 guidance. The EPS bump of $0.04, my math is that $0.03 comes from the tax rate and maybe a $0.01 comes from operating profit being better than you expected for the year. Is that a fair assessment as to how you're looking at it, or is all of the bump from the tax rate and the tax outlook? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Jody Feragen","No, I would look at the bump from Q3 tax impact as about $0.02 and then we have the negative hedging impact in Jennie-O that partially offsets it by another -- by my math, another $0.01. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter will be similar to what our ongoing rate has been. So getting to a full year effective tax rate with the lower one in the third quarter overall it's not going to be driven by taxes.","Rob Moskow","Right. Okay. So your view is -- well, it still helps the year, though.","Jody Feragen","Yes, it does.","Rob Moskow","But operating profit, it's a guide up on operating profit as well.","Jody Feragen","Absolutely.","Rob Moskow","Okay, good. And then, the follow-up I had was on, I guess Jim's comments about it being a battle in the meat case. I think you said that you were trying to expand your East Coast distribution and capacity in Turkey. Is that what you're really referring to, Jim? And maybe a few more specifics as to how much you've expanded your abilities in the East Coast and what the outlook is?","Jim Snee","Sure. I think our challenge has been clearly we're just ramping up supply. And so we have talked about the geographic expansion that we did have to put on hold last year and early this year. And so that's part of the solution, Rob. I think what we're talking about here is regaining even some of the existing distribution that perhaps we weren't able to supply last year. So it's really a combination of both those things. And there's no doubt that there is competition in the meat case, but I guess I would just reiterate that it's not unusual, we've been there before and for us the bigger issue, the bigger message is that this product line, Jennie-O ground Turkey, is on trend with consumers over the long-term.","Rob Moskow","Is there any way to quantify like what your distribution percentage is today compared to history and help us -- it will help us model out why the growth will continue.","Jim Snee","Sure. Nathan, you want to --","Jeff Ettinger","It also may depend, Rob, this is Jeff, on what products you're talking about. Clearly, we've talked about trade pack quite a bit. It has a certain share position. It has the unique element that it competes not only against other ground Turkey brands, but significantly against ground beef. But there's a lot of other pieces of both the retail and deli component of Jennie-O. They would each have their own set of numbers in that regard.","Rob Moskow","Yes. That's what makes it hard for us to figure out where it's going. So if there's something that we can focus on to help make the case on distribution growth being a driver, tray pack may be -- is tray pack 30% of the story, 40% of the story? Can you help us in that regard?","Jody Feragen","Why don't you take a follow-up with Nathan because I don't have that at our fingertips right here.","Rob Moskow","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Ken Zaslow","Good morning, everyone. Jody, congratulations and well deserved.","Jody Feragen","Thank you.","Ken Zaslow","My first question is just housekeeping. When you talk about growth in 2017, you said sales and EPS. I just want to make sure, you're also talking about operating profit growth and it's not just a tax or corporate expense benefit in 2017. Is that a fair assessment?","Jeff Ettinger","Yes.","Ken Zaslow","Okay. Then my second question really is when I look at the grocery products business, can you talk about how that -- for the current quarter, how that actually matched or -- it underperformed our expectations. I'm trying to figure out how you guys thought about that business in terms of operating profit and what you see is the outlook for that business, given the lower input cost and somewhat surprising kind of compression on the margin side.","Jim Snee","Sure. Ken, this is Jim. Again, from a sales perspective or brand perspective, clearly very pleased with the work the team did on continuing to grow the SPAM franchise. The SKIPPY business, the introduction of SKIPPY pb bites continues to go well. Our Mexican foods portfolio also continues to perform well. As we mentioned, we did have some increased advertising cost but that's -- from our perspective, a positive to support the ongoing and future brand growth. And there's no doubt, we have a couple of areas in the units that are work in process. The chunk meats category, which it's not a huge part of the portfolio, but that's become competitive and our team is working on really taking a different approach with the product offerings that we have there.","Again, we talked about Compleats being down and we're working very strategically to expand the availability of some of the value tier offerings and really increasing the sales or unit rates. And so for them it was a mixed bag, but I think we still feel very positive on the outlook for grocery products going forward. I think one other thing to consider for this quarter, it would be more of a product mix issue. Some of the canned items are not typically high sellers at this time of year. But overall, feel very positive about the transformation of the portfolio and where GP's headed.","Jody Feragen","I would just add to Jim's comment that we saw quite a run-up in trim, which is an input on a lot of the grocery products items. So while they experienced favorable cost of goods in a lot of areas that was one area that did negatively impact them.","Ken Zaslow","I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeremy Scott of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott","Hi. Good morning and congrats, Jody, on the retirement.","Jody Feragen","Thanks.","Jeremy Scott","A couple questions on Applegate. Can you talk about the volume performance for this brand since you've taken over. Have some great penetration in some of the upper scale retail channels that are still growing. Just wondering what the outlook for Applegate here on the volume side and what it's been in the past year.","Jim Snee","Jeremy, good morning. This is Jim. I think just as a reminder, when we took over the Applegate business, clearly we knew that there were some raw material or supply issues in terms of supporting that business. And then, those were compounded with the outbreak of Avian influenza. So in the short-term, the team has worked really hard to get raw material supply back in place and we feel good about where we are today. So that certainly made the volume growth a battle for the team and so we had to regain some lost distribution. But the growth, we've seen some growth, we've seen some increased distribution.","From our perspective, we love the brand, we love what the future holds for the brand and again, on a short-term basis it's clearly on target to deliver what we said it would deliver at the time of acquisition.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. Just on the follow-up to a previous question, how do you view -- when you start to lap Applegate in the fourth quarter, where do you see volumes trending? As we look now at a more organic basis for refrigerated foods.","Jeff Ettinger","He is saying all of refrigerated foods.","Jeremy Scott","For all of refrigerated foods.","Jim Snee","I mean I think, again, as we think about the different parts of the refrigerated foods portfolios, our meat products team continues to be focused on the value-added items and they're doing a nice job. Our food service business continues to outperform the industry and we expect that to continue. The Applegate business will continue to show growth that we've got returns of supply. So overall we feel good about that portfolio as well.","Jody Feragen","I would just add that as we transition particularly when you look at Applegate that is a more of a sales driven business than a volume driven, and as we continue to value-add the portfolio, volumes become a little less meaningful as you compare to prior quarters or years that may have had more of a commodity element.","Jeremy Scott","Got it. Can you touch on some of the competitive activity you're seeing at retail and do you plan to ramp up promotional activity as a response in the coming quarters?","Jeff Ettinger","Are you talking about any particular part of the grocery store or our business or -- ?","Jeremy Scott","I would say in some of the higher traffic channels like sausage and frozen breakfast.","Jeff Ettinger","Yes. I think, Jeremy, our position on that is clearly we're focused on the effectiveness and our ability to not only deliver a return for us, but for the retail partner. And so we continue to look at categories individually and where there's opportunity to be effective with additional spending. We certainly will take advantage of that. But can't tell you today that there's a significant specific plan in any one given category.","Jeremy Scott","Got it. And then, last question. In the past you've been able to repurchase shares as the M&A pipeline thinned out a bit. What is your opportunity to scale up buybacks over the coming years and can you walk us through your thought process there and some of the hurdles.","Jody Feragen","So, really we kind of look at our share repurchase as being an opportunity to offset stock option exercises. We still believe that using that as a compensation element is appropriate to drive our business. So we're constrained because of the ownership of the Hormel foundation at about 48% to 49% these days. So we've agreed that they should be under 50%. So that would be the biggest constraint. Obviously, took advantage of some pressure on our stock this past quarter to be in the market and acquire some of those shares.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. At this time we have no further questions. I'll turn it back over to Mr. Annis for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeff Ettinger","Thanks, Savannah. This is Jeff Ettinger. I'll go ahead and conclude the call for us. So, as some of you may have heard we actually celebrated our company's 125th anniversary recently here in July. This provided us an unique opportunity to bring many of our company's employees together to celebrate the occasion. After visiting with these employees from across the company I've never been more optimistic about our company's future and our ability to deliver growth. I'm very proud of our team's performance this quarter and I look forward to continued excellent results going forward. I want to thank you all for joining us today.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

It can be accessed on our website.","Additionally please note the company uses non-GAAP results to provide investors with the better understanding of the company\u2019s operating performance by excluding the impact of certain non-recurring items affecting comparability. Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. Please note that during our call, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as adjusted earnings. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee.","Jim Snee","Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. As a global branded food company, we remain focused on our long term strategy we call our formula for success. This includes building strong brands, developing innovative new items, making strategic acquisitions, and creating intentional balance.","We had strengthened our competitive position in the past three years through intentional actions such as evolving through a broader global branded food company, accelerating our foodservice business, modernizing our supply chain and divesting non-strategic assets. Today these actions leave us with the better business, a strong balance sheet, insisting cash flows and the ability to make a transformational acquisition when the opportunity presents itself.","Many of our businesses continued to exceed expectations and demonstrate our strategy is working. We\u2019ve recognized progress is not always linear. So we are focused on executing against our plans in the marketplace, while delivering the longer term results our shareholders expect.","This morning we announced second quarter earnings per share of $0.52. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.46, a 5% increase compared to last year. Three segments delivered volume and sales growth resulting in a volume increase of 1% and sales of increase of 1%.","There are many bright spots I want to highlight as we look at our top line results. First our foodservice business across the company had a very strong quarter, delivering mid single-digit sales growth. Products such as Hormel Bacon 1 cooked bacon, Hormel Fire Braised meat, Austin Blues authentic barbeque and Jennie-O foodservice business all delivered strong growth. Each year food service becomes more and more important to us as we find new and innovative products that deliver value to operators.","Next our portfolio of grocery products had a solid quarter with growth coming from offering such as the SPAM family of products, Herdez salsas, SKIPPY peanut butter, Dinty Moore Stew, Black Label bacon beds and Hormel microwave meals. These brands, along with many others in our portfolio, continued to demonstrate growth is occurring in the center of the store.","We issued record value added sales within refrigerated foods as we continue to convert lower margin commodity products into higher margin value added products. And that result is a double-digit decline in commodity sales and an increase in value added sales. Once again, this is consistent with the long term trajectory of refrigerated foods and reflects the clarity, focus and alignment this team exhibits.","Looking at the segments. Grocery products had a strong quarter as sales increased 2% on a 3% volume increase. Segment profit increased 12% due to higher volume and margin across many of our brands, including SPAM and Dinty Moore, in addition to lower expenses for CytoSport. We completed the divestiture of CytoSport on April 15.","During the quarter, we took a measured and calculated response to a competitor's price decrease in order to defend our SKIPPY peanut butter franchise. Our responsibility as a branded food company is to elevate the category through brand building and innovation. We believe competing on the basis of price alone is not how branded food company should operate. Throughout this process, our commitment to use revenue growth management techniques to optimize our promotional strategies has been very well received by our retail partners. We continue to be encouraged by our new Skippy PB&J Minis. Our market test was successful, and we are currently rolling out the product nationwide. In addition, our current pipeline of out of the jar innovation for nut butters is very robust.","Refrigerated foods sales increased 1% on flat volumes. While segment profit declined, it was driven by a 65% decline in commodity profits and rapidly increasing input costs such as bellies and trim. Brands such as Hormel Bacon 1, Fire Braised, Austin Blues and Black Label all had an excellent quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the new Hormel Deli solutions division, especially the performance of the Columbus brands, and our prepared foods portfolio of products. Our Applegate and Natural Choice brands continued to grow as consumers look for better for you options that fit their lifestyles.","International volume declined 7%, sales declined 9% and segment profit declined 31%. The key driver to the decline continues to be lower fresh pork exports volume and pricing caused by global trade uncertainty related to tariffs.","We also experienced higher freight costs, primarily relating to flooding near Fremont, Nebraska, which affected our ability to ship export products. We saw continued growth in our China business led by key brands such as SPAM and Skippy. Jennie-O Turkey Store volume increased 2%, while sales were flat. We delivered growth in our foodservice business led by our Jennie-O slice Turkey products. Segment profit declined 45%, driven by start-up costs at our Melrose Hulbert plant, higher feed costs and lower retail sales. The Melrose plant is now the most automated production facility we own, and certain automation components are new to Hormel Foods and the industry. Within one week we switched from a highly manual plant to an automated plant and the process took more time than we expected picking up to full speed. The extremely cold weather compounded the problem as we were unable to move forward into the facility during certain days. The additional start-up cost this quarter was $0.01 earnings per share. We are now very close to hitting our efficiency targets, and expect lower net production costs in the years to come. The lingering effects of two voluntary recalls for lean ground Turkey during the first quarter led the loss retail distribution. Throughout the recall event, we have maintained a close watch on key brand health metrics and are pleased to report all measures show the Jennie-O brand is strong. Starting in the third quarter, we will reactivate promotional activity and advertising in order to gain back our loss distribution.","We continue to work with the Turkey industry on the issue of salmonella. Our efforts across the entire supply chain have helped decreased levels of salmonella in our facilities. We have also maintained our leadership role of educating consumers on how to safely handle and prepare raw Turkey. From an industry perspective, we continue to see lower placements, but cold storage levels remain at elevated levels. Market prices are starting to show modest increases.","As we think about our first half, excluding the onetime gain on the CytoSport divestiture, strong results from Grocery Products and favorable SG&A were offset by higher than expected plant start-up cost as Jennie-O Turkey store and margin compression in International and Refrigerated businesses. Overall, the business finished below our expectations for the first half.","As we look forward, the biggest unknown in the protein industry is related to the outbreak of African swine fever in China. As I could take the opportunity to walk you through the dynamics of the African swine fever, our expectations the actions we are taking and the expected impact on our financial results. This will give you a deeper understanding of our business results and context for our guidance.","First, the best industry information shows that China has lost between 150 million and 200 million hogs. This is equivalent to more than the entire pork production in the United States. In addition, China is the largest pork producer and consumer of pork in the world. Second, due to the losses of hogs in China, we have seen hog prices in China increased by approximately 28% during our second quarter. Prices will likely continue to move higher as cold storage stocks in China are drawn down. Finally, the United States will play a vital role in filling the global supply gap. In a response to the higher demand and increased exports, domestic prices have already increased and will likely increase further.","We started to see the market effects of ASS in our second quarter. We saw rapid increases in key input costs for hogs, the USDA composite cut out, bellies and trim during the quarter. We expect all these markets to increase in the coming months. And Jim Sheehan will provide our high level assumptions for the markets during his comments. In response to these input cost increases, and the cost increases we expect to come, we announced pricing action on the majority of our pork-related products portfolio across Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and International. Depending on the category, our announced pricing generally takes 30 to 75 days to become effective on shop of the retail. As such, most pricing actions will be effective in the back half of the third quarter. Within foodservice, we're able to adjust pricing every two weeks, which allows us to stay closer to any market changes.","Our prior experiences, such as with PEDB in 2014, suggest our brands can operate and grow in both low and high market conditions. However, the speed at which markets move can cause short-term margin expansion and compression as our prices lag input cost changes. Second quarter demonstrated this dynamic as near term margins were pressured. We expect similar periods of margin pressure as markets move higher in the back half of 2019.","We do expect short term volume declines, but they will vary by category. We have taken proactive actions to maintain volumes such as adjusting our promotional activity, and shifting our advertising to support key brands. Once again, we will be leveraging our direct sales force to communicate directly with our customers on how ASF will affect our categories.","Pricing discussions with customers are never easy, but finding the right solutions for our customers truly differentiates our company. Animal health issues are not new to us, in fact, this will be our third situation in the last five years. Each event comes with its own unique challenges and issues. ASF will be different than PEDV in 2014 and different than high path avian influenza in 2016. But the lessons we learned in those events will be important as we managed through ASF. I'm confident our experience management team will continue to guide our company forward and our dedicated team of employees will help deliver our key results.","Turning to our guidance for fiscal 2019. Higher forecasted input costs and the lag in pricing are expected to impact Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and International earnings in the second half. We have also lowered our expectations for Jennie-O as we reinvest to gain back our retail distribution. Our guidance also includes a positive $0.02 net impact to the year for the divestiture of CytoSport. Taking all factors into account, we are lowering our full year guidance to $1.71 to $1.85 per share and our sales guidance to $9.5 billion to $10 billion. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter and our earnings guidance in addition to key assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2019.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Volume and net sales for the quarter grew 1%. Volume was 1.2 billion pounds as growth from Grocery Products and Jennie-O Turkey store offset the decline in International. The record sales of $2.3 billion was due to strength in Grocery Products and record value added sales in Refrigerated Foods. Net earnings for the second quarter were $282 million, up 19% from last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.52, adjusted earnings per share was $0.46, up 5% increase.","The CytoSport transaction was closed April 15th. Gain was $0.06 per share and recognized a net unallocated expense and taxes. The second half impact earnings for 2019 is a reduction of approximately $0.04 per share. Full year sales for CytoSport were expected to be approximately $300 million. SG&A excluding advertising was 5.7% of sales compared to 7.2% last year. The decline was driven by the one-time benefit from the CytoSport sale and reduction in selling expense.","Advertising for the quarter was $35 million, a decline from $37 million last year. Advertising investments are expected to be down modestly due to the sales of CytoSport. Operating margins were 13.3% compared to 12.9% last year. The increase was primarily due to lower SG&A and stronger results from grocery products. The effective tax rate was 11.1% down from 20% last year. The gain from CytoSport sales drove the decline. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be between 17.5% and 19.5%.","Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $366 million, down 18%. The decrease is due to higher levels of working capital, primarily from building inventory and anticipation of higher raw material costs. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $48 million compared to $87 million last year. We expect to spend approximately $310 million in 2019. Weather issues delayed the expansion of the Burke facility, which will shift capital spend into 2020.","We paid the 363rd consecutive quarterly dividends, effective May 15 at annual rate of $0.84 per share, a 12% increase over the prior year. Share repurchases in the quarter were $23 million representing 562,000 shares. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises and based on our internal valuation. We received $474 million from the CytoSport transaction. We used the proceeds to pay $375 million of short term debt related to the purchase of Columbus Craft Meats.","Net debt is negative. Company remains in a strong financial position to fund strategic investments. Domestic hog supply and production are balanced. Industry expansion continues as global demand increases. The supply shortage in China, caused by African swine fever, should drive domestic prices higher. We expect to operate in a high cost and volatile environment for multiple quarters. Hog markets increase year-over-year, rising more than 50% throughout the second quarter. USDA composite cutout value increased 20%. The company\u2019s grain-based contracts and balanced approach to hog procurement provided some projection against the rapid market increases during the quarter. Prices for bellie and lean trim increased as much as 40% during the quarter before declining in the last few weeks.","The guidance range for the remainder of the year is based on the following market expectations. The range reflects our view of the impact of ASF in China without an outbreak in the United States. We expect hog prices and the USDA composite cutout declined 10% to 30% from the current price levels, while maintaining a high level of volatility. The last time markets were at this level was 2014 during the domestic PEDV offering.","Bellie prices have historically been the most volatile of our key inputs. We expect costs to rise to a new price range of 30% to 40% higher than the current range. Our guidance includes continued volatility within the expected range.","Being trim markets are doubled from February to around $80 per 100 weight, we expect 10% to 20% increases compared to the current prices. Although there are various opinions on the impact of ASF on future pork markets, we feel providing our outlook provides better insight into our guidance.","Turkey pork placements were down 4% from the last six months and down 5% year-to-date. Fresh meat and cold storage remains elevated, 7% above last year. Compared to last year, Turkey breast prices were up 28% and whole bird prices rose 6%. Meat cost was higher by 7% during the quarter. We continue to make excellent progress on Project Orion, a strategic initiative to streamline and transform how we operate as a global branded food company. This project will generate efficiencies across the entire company and represents the next step in the execution of our long-term growth strategy.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Michael Lavery from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Michael Lavery","Can you just give a little more color on your pricing actions relative to cost increases? And you said that it had cost increases and expected costs increases in line. You gave a little bit of color on what some of those expectations are. But how much are you leaning in on pricing? Would it color all of that? Would it more than color all of that? What\u2019s the right way to think about where you land from a margin standpoint?","Jim Sheehan","Sure. I\u2019ll go ahead and start around pricing, and then I\u2019ll let Jim talk a little bit more about some of the market conditions. As we saw the run up in markets, in the second quarter, we were quick to react and took some very proactive pricing actions across the number of our key categories that\u2019s obviously are pork related. What was interesting in the quarter is we saw the quick run up and then we saw a moderation of pricing. And so when we say expected pricing going forward, we do project that pricing will return to the levels that we saw in Q2, in some cases maybe a little higher. The other thing to remember Michael, and we've talked about this a lot is that lag in pricing. So again depending on the channel foodservice little closer to the market, when you think about Refrigerated Products that\u2019s all further out, and then GP, Grocery Products are shall stable portfolio is really what takes the longest to be reflected.","So we feel good about the pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken. For us, it\u2019s really that volatility that creates the compression or in some cases expansion, but it\u2019s really getting to the new level. Once we get to a new level that becomes little more stabilized than that\u2019s when we get margins back to normalized level. So it\u2019s really the volatility that creates the disruption. And I\u2019ll turn over to Jim maybe for a little more market clarity.","Jim Snee","Certainly. Michael, we expect to see volatility as these prices continue to grow. To give you an example of challenges, the belly market for instance in the second quarter had a low of 120 and a high of 215. And it wasn\u2019t a consistent line. You\u2019d see increases and then you see sudden drops and that creates a lot of difficulty in getting the timing of the pricing correct. We expect those challenges to continue. We expect that volatility for us to create a challenge in the pricing as we go forward.","Michael Lavery","Even if it\u2019s volatile, you have, obviously, some visibility on costs. What about on the consumer side? Do you have a sense of their ability to bear further pricing? And what depending limits there are to where you start to see real meaningfully you left diseased, but -- and how may that compared to five years ago with the PEDV?","Jim Sheehan","I think this is going to be a little bit difference in that PEDV. It was probably a more short-lived. I mean all the prognosticators are saying that this could be a little longer term. So I think there are some key learnings that are very applicable and there are some things that are little bit different. Any time you take pricing, especially in the short-term you do have an impact on volume. We\u2019re talking about a number of different categories. So the volume impact, the elasticities are very different across all of those categories. The most recent reference point we have, of course, would have been the fourth quarter of 2017, where we had a significant run up in key markets. And again, we put our elasticity models to work. And the good news is in many cases, we were able to outperform what was projected. But we've done all the homework and understand that there will be some volume implications as we take pricing.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead.","Ben Bienvenu","I appreciate, Jim the color on your outlook for the individual promos as well as your outlook on hogs. You alluded to some comments around duration, but with what you know now, what is the duration of volatility that you're expecting? And or for what period of time are you thinking about elevated price is sustaining?","Jim Sheehan","Yes, I mean, that's part of the uncertainty that we're dealing with. There's a point of view that says you could see this being a multi-year event. And that's really what we're preparing for. But, I think in the short term, especially, it's really interesting how the dynamics and the information is changing so rapidly. So as we're talking to others in the industry, you hear points to view where the markets getting ready to run very soon. And then you talked to others who say, maybe freezer stocks in China are a little higher than anticipated and it's going to take some while to clear them. So there's really a lot of uncertainty around when, how much, how fast, how long, what happens in the competitive landscape, who decides to export, who is focused on value-added. So with all that uncertainty, we're giving you our best estimate. But we really want to focus on is the certainty and what we know to be true. And that's really our ability to price to new market level. And then, as always, we're going to do what's in the best interest of the company, the customers, consumers, food service operators. So we really need to focus on the things that we can control, and then really just do our best to try to understand the uncertainty that's in the marketplace.","Ben Bienvenu","On the Jennie-O business, some operational challenges that you mentioned in the quarter, and some go-forward investment around regaining retail distribution. What does that timeline look like for getting back to some of those distribution points? And then, I'd love to hear kind of what you guys think about the Turkey outlook with a little bit more detail as well as kind of the magnitude of the cost of re-establishing those retail distribution points?","Jim Snee","Sure. I mean it starts with the fact that the impact of the voluntary recall was that, that we lost distribution. The other thing that we've had to understand is what's happened with the brand and so what we know is that the brand strength is still very strong among consumers and where we have product on shelf, which is still quite expensive, because we're the number one brand, our velocities are good. The velocities haven't decreased at all. So obviously, having the number one brand really does matter. So as we think about the back half of the year, I mean we see this as an entire back half play in terms of regaining distribution, even though we have the number one brand, it doesn't happen overnight. And as you mentioned, there will be some impact with the investments that we need to make. But we feel confident that by reactivating promotional activity, really engaging with our advertising and going customer by customer. We're still very positive on the JOTS business. As we think back to this business where it come from, it's clearly the best performing acquisition, we've ever made, the combination of Jennie-O and Turkey Store. So we are not resting on our laurels or looking back, it's really about how we are going to carry this business forward. And we have some work to do, but when we gain -- when we regain the distribution, we know the brand is strong and we know that the velocities are there, in that lean ground space.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So, first on your cash balance. So clearly, it continues to build on the sale of CytoSport, so just curious how you guys are thinking about deploying that excess cash?","Jim Sheehan","I think that the focus is the same and it\u2019s investing and growing the business.","Jim Snee","Yes, Rupesh. And I would tell you, as we mentioned in our comments, that we're in a really good position, should we find obviously the right acquisition and we referenced a transformational acquisition. So we've talked about the level that of the size of the deal that we could do, we would be comfortable with, that still holds true. The key is, as always we've got a number of deals that we're looking at, that we're reviewing that are in the pipeline. It's getting them to the finish line. And then the other part is, in terms of having the one deal that fits that price range can sometimes be difficult. So as Jim mentioned, it is this constant view of how do we reinvest and grow in the business whether that's through value-added capacity expansion or through external strategic acquisitions. I mean, our team is as focused as ever on both of those.","Rupesh Parikh","And then on the Refrigerated Foods segment, so there is another big decline in commodity profits. So I was just curious, if you can just give us a little more color on what's driving that decline and whether the company is now worse off or better following the Fremont plant sale?","Jim Snee","Yeah I mean we're better off than we were three years ago. I mean, as we've said, this is a better business today. The moves that we've made to really strengthen our earnings power put us in a really strong position. The Refrigerated Foods piece is, it's the fifth consecutive quarter of steep declines in commodity profits and even though we had record value-added sales, it still wasn't enough to overcome that. And then, of course, to tell you the combination of the margin compression from the run-up in markets, but as we think about the portfolio, especially in Refrigerated Foods, I mean it is as strong as it's ever been and well positioned for future growth.","Jim Sheehan","Rupesh, one area I'd point you to is that the hog markets increased about 50% year-over-year in the second quarter, where the composite carcass value, the basis of what we purchase from the WholeStone Group increased about 20%. So I think that's consistent with the strategy of reducing the level of volatility in this transaction.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","So I just want to discuss a little bit, you lowered the fiscal '19 guidance by $0.06. That includes a net $0.02 benefit from the CytoSport divestiture. So $0.08 kind of pre-that and I presume the corporate -- I mean, seems like corporate actually will light this quarter. So maybe the operations are little bit more than that. But can you allocate that the change in outlook to the businesses, if at all? Obviously the Jennie-O business has gotten more challenged and you've got the input pressures on pork that spread throughout the portfolio, but how should we think about the change in outlook by operating segments?","Jim Sheehan","Well, Adam, I'll start on the discussion around that -- unallocated being down, it's down because of the CytoSport transaction, some benefit in the interest income, but it's also down because our general administrative expenses and some selling expenses, the amount that we've allocated to the businesses is less than what our actual spend is, it has to do with we allocate those expenses on a fixed amount based on our budgets and really we've done a very nice job of managing those expenses. So that's really a reduction and it's consistent with what you're seeing in SG&A, where you're seeing a reduction on our SG&A costs.","Jim Snee","Yes, then as we think about the businesses, Adam, I mean, the key takeaway is that our first half was lower than expected, but the majority of that gap is in the second half due to ASF and the business at JOTS. So as you think about each segments, Grocery Products, will have a slight decline. As you think about higher trim markets and we haven't talked about the Skippy pricing yet, but that will have an impact in the second half of the year. For Refrigerated Foods, we expect continued strong results from our brands across all the channels, but there will be a lag in pricing. So we would expect to see a slight decline in Refrigerated Foods in the back half. And really the same holds true for International through the ASF and tariff issues. And then as we've talked about JOTS, because of the reinvestment in lean ground and we're still not seeing improvement in the markets like we'd like to see. So we are seeing some improvements, but they continue to be slow. So it's a little bit across the board and but the majority of the gap is in the back half.","Adam Samuelson ","And then, I guess my second question is more just about the competitive in the U.S. pork market. As we think about the prospect of higher pork exports, do you feel that puts you in any sort of competitive disadvantage where some of your bigger packer and processed meat competitors are a bit more vertically integrated and more tied to the export market, might have more visibility in terms of product flow before you fully see that is from thinking specifically in the event of the U.S exporting cold carcasses to China and the net impact that would have on belly and trim markets. But just broadly this does not having a bigger export business today put you at a competitive disadvantage given the market landscape?","Jim Snee","Yes, what I would say that Adam is, you've got short-term issues and then long-term strategies. And so there are different operating models that will certainly be able to capitalize on some of those short-term opportunities, better than we can. But -- from where we sit, we're in the business we want to be and we know that there's going to be that volatility, less supply, increased costs, and as we've talked about, it's that lag that hurts us, that compresses us in the short term. But we know and we've demonstrated our ability to price to the new market levels with the businesses, the brands, the portfolios that we've chosen to participate in. And so advantage, disadvantage, I guess it really depends on the business you want to be in and how you want to run short term, long term, but we feel good about where we are. We just really need to get through the ups and downs of the markets and then we'll be fine.","Operator","We'll take our next question is from Jeremy Scott from Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott","If you can offer any color on how your customers in each of your channels are addressing the looming supply disruption. I think one thing we're hearing more from restaurant operators is that there's an elevated urgency to lock up price or even lock up volumes. So -- and then, I guess on the other hand, we're hearing how operators are adjusting menus and features toward other proteins. So I appreciate your comments on pricing elasticity and contract duration. But is there a risk of customers in anticipation of a shortage already making adjustments to their purchase behavior and maybe less willing to absorb a pricing action at this point?","Jim Snee","Jeremy, we feel like we're pretty close especially to the foodservice market. And I will tell you that we have not seen that with our foodservice operators where others are thinking about substitution or trying to lock up supply. I think your -- the first part of your comment is very accurate that when you get into these situations. There is a propensity to want to try to lock up pricing and obviously from our perspective. We go the other way and say that's the last thing we want to do and we want to get closer to the market and that really is what we're able to do each and every day is our pricing in foodservices closer to the market. We have steered clear of long-term pricing agreements. We don't believe that they're actually in either party's interest. Our focus continues to be on creating solutions, right, making sure that we can help them with their pain points around creating great menu ideas for their patrons, making sure that we can help them with their labor, their insurance, their safety issues. So I'm not going to go so far as to say it's business as usual, because it's not -- there's certainly a different mindset. But a lot of what we're doing still plays out in the marketplace.","Jeremy Scott","I appreciate the color you had on your expectations for raw material inflation. Just given all the internal changes in Refrigerated Foods division over the last couple years, I think there's been some hazing this in terms of your net sensitivity to different pricing. So maybe if I can ask on the cost side of the equation, meaning, assuming you take price, what is the earnings sensitivity to let's say a 10% increase in bellies and trim?","Jim Sheehan","The answer that I would give you, Jeremy, as it's more about the volatility in the change, as opposed to the magnitude of the change. So as this process matures, I think you're going to see less volatility in the markets, will be less rumors because people understand the facts around ASF. Right now what's happening again is that you're just seeing wild swings day to day in the markets. Once we hit a level that there is more stability, there are less rumors or speculation going on. We'll be able to manage this fine. So the increase in the price is not the primary concern, it's how much volatility you're getting. For instance, we've seen I think from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. I talked about the volatility in bellies. The price only changed 6% between the beginning of the quarter and the end of the quarter. But as I said, the prices range between 120 and 215 in that quarter. That's difficult to manage. So my advice would be pay more attention to volatility, that's what's going to be -- sometimes it's a benefit and what volatility does it creates noise in a quarter. So for instance, if we've priced up and our input costs dropped the last two or three weeks, it may look -- may make the quarter look a little bit better than it really should or the other way around. Take a look at it on the long-term run as to how we're performing and somewhat ignore the noise of the quarterly movements because of volatility. Hopefully that's helpful.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","I appreciate all the comments about the volatility and the fundamental challenges, but I am a little confused as to your messaging here on your pricing because how decisive have you been able to be with your customers on these price increases that you've taken, like are you telling them that, hey, we're taking these price increases. But in a couple of weeks, we might have to take more based on our outlook or are you saying, hey, there's a lot of volatility. So this might not stick. It's a little unclear to me like how decisive you can actually be in how you're communicating to your customers?","Jim Snee","Yes, that's a great question, Rob. And we have been very decisive with our customers in terms of the pricing that we've taken across multiple categories. Although there is all this uncertainty, again, as I said about the when, the how much, how long, there is a consensus that the markets are going to increase. And so we have been decisive with pricing, in terms of what the markets do and when it's reflected. We have gone a customer by customer and worked on a promotional basis to make sure that pricing is not negatively impacting the categories, but it's important to get that pricing out front and center as soon as possible. So the pricing actions have been decisive, working closely with them on a customer by customer basis as the markets move with that volatility is something that we watch very closely. So hopefully that gives you a little more color on how we're thinking about the pricing.","Robert Moskow","Okay. And then in the grocery division, is it easier in the grocery division to kind of just take the price increase and have it stick because the underlying meat is a smaller component of the overall cost of the product. Is that a fair statement?","Jim Snee","I wish it was.","Robert Moskow","Wow, would you?","Jim Snee","As you know -- we know the pricing conversations are always hard. And so I wouldn't say that it's any easier. It is a smaller component, you're correct. But you've got to have the market data or the industry facts to support your case. And I think that's really I would say that they're fairly equivalent in terms of Grocery Products or Refrigerated Foods.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Ken Zaslow","So couple of questions. One is, when I think about 2020, how much of the turkey issues will be resolved that you will be able to enjoy whatever recovery there is by 2020? And why would you not have any benefit from African swine fever from -- in the turkey operation in 2020? And then my second question would be, when I think about your pricing on the Skippy side, how much elasticity have you had and where do you expect that to go?","Jim Snee","So great questions, Ken. As we think about 2020, you're right, I mean we should see the benefit of a couple of things, one, we will be working hard in the back half of this year to regain that distribution, knowing we have a strong brand, strong velocities. So the retail business, we should be able to see that or as you said, enjoy the positive impact. The foodservice business at Jennie-O Turkey Store had a good quarter and we expect that business to continue to grow and perform well. And then I think your last point on turkey is a very good one also. And we just -- it's hard to project, right. I mean, I do think there is a school of thought that says, if you have the impact of pork, there are going to be other proteins, chicken, beef, turkey that will benefit. So I mean we haven't modeled a lot of that into our back half, just because we know that we have work to do to regain that distribution, but certainly that's a wild card as we think about the impact of African swine fever. And then on the pricing for Skippy, we've taken a price decline and we -- we've worked customer by customer, because our ultimate goal is really to be great stewards of the category. And so we've worked and been very reliant on revenue growth management to help retailers, still try to grow the category. And our focus is continuing on the brand building and innovation, but it's a battle right now, it's a battle in the category. And again, we don't like the idea of competing solely on price. We want to focus on the brand building and innovation. So we're fighting. We've got a great brand and we've got some great things in the pipeline coming to take peanut butter out of the jar. We talked in our prepared comments about being pleased with the Skippy PB&J minis and our ability now to roll those out nationwide. Certainly, that will have a positive impact on the brand. So again, some short-term things that we'll work through, but we know that we'll come out the other side stronger and better.","Operator","We'll take our next question is from Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","My questions are actually -- my two questions are related. So just -- you talked about what your outlook is for hog and belly pricing et cetera for the rest of this year. I just want to think about 2020, you mentioned the 150 million to 200 million hogs, that conventional wisdom as has been lost in China and just that magnitude far surpasses PED. So I was just wondering when you're thinking -- in your early thinking about 2020, would you expect hog prices to take another big leg up then? And if you thought about the elasticity, the volume elasticity on your products, it's become clich\u00e9. But I mean, I think most would agree that this is unprecedented. So like, just wondering how you're thinking about how that affects volume et cetera and your business, when you have to pass on those that magnitude of cost increases?","Jim Snee","Yes. I mean you've asked the question, I think a lot of ways to answer it, Heather, is that, we're in some unprecedented or we expect to be in some unprecedented areas for a longer period of time, than we've seen. And so you certainly -- if demand stays static, you could, to your point, see another run-up in prices. But I do think at a certain level, because of the elasticity and you're going to have demand destruction, or you know to Ken's earlier comment, you're going to have this migration to other proteins. So there's just -- there's so much uncertainty in terms of how you're going to have this interaction with the consumer across other proteins. It's really hard to project, what those ultimate impacts are going to be.","Heather Jones","And I was wondering if you could -- if you could compare and contrast. You mentioned that you've been through three health events in the last five years and PED seems to be the most relevant to this one. Since your business has changed fairly substantially, you've divested Farmer John's, you've divested Fremont, but given your Jennie-O business, and then given your less control, I guess for lack of a better word of the hogs. Do you view the business as better positioned relative to '14, because you don't control the hogs, so you're more exposed to the belly cut-out et cetera, but you're less exposed to the lean -- the run in lean hogs? So just wondering if you could just give us some color on how you're thinking about how the business is positioned relative to '14?","Jim Snee","The business in our opinion for where we want to be is much better positioned, because our goal is not to be a commodity company or commodity organization. And as I've said several times already, this is a better business today through the intentional changes that we've made. Some of the things we're talking about are short term and commodity in nature. Going back to the first part of your question, in terms of what have we learned and clearly from PEDV, what we learned was how important it is to be proactive with your pricing. And so, I mean, I would say that we certainly have led the charge in the industry in terms of being proactive with our pricing. But I think that's important, just because it gets the right mindset into the marketplace and then as things change, we've got other levers we can pull to help customers and consumers, but when it's all said and done, this company, this portfolio is in a much better place than it was in 2014. And as I've said pretty broadly within our four walls is I've never had as much confidence and as much faith in our business, our strategy and our people.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Eric Larson from Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","Eric Larson","I just have a couple. The first one is as a quick follow-up to Rob's question. In that you're quite a bit closer to the market with your foodservice business, does that allow you to adjust prices downward as well, if the market volatility would suggest to you should do that? I think that's a harder plan to implement at retail. But do you have flexibility to work with your customers on the downside as well?","Jim Snee","Yes, Eric, that's a correct assessment. The foodservice channel does give us that flexibility, but it's also very typical. So because we're closer to the market, we take the ups and downs and that's clearly understood in the channel and in the marketplace.","Eric Larson","Okay. Then the final two things are kind of second derivative calls here. You've been very proactive with your pricing in the market. Your competitors are facing the same issues. So are they thought -- are they with you on that? And then equally more important or as important, what are your hogs producers telling? Are they -- is the farming community gearing up to increase production as well? You've got low -- you've got low grain prices, you have this supposed big increase in demand coming, and that's all expectations at this point. But has it changed the way the producers are thinking about what they're going to do for the next couple of years as well?","Jim Snee","Eric, I'll take the first part and then Jim Sheehan can answer the second half. As I said and you agreed, I mean we have been proactive with our pricing and we were the first ones out of the gate. We are starting to see some competitive follow-up, which obviously supports our position and help support the overall pricing models. So it's happening slower than we would have liked. But it's starting to happen. Jim, I'll let you answer.","Jim Sheehan","Yes, I'll speak that. Our producers appear to be in a very good position to meet any demand for increased hog production. We feel that they're in a very good position and we're confident that we will have the supply of hogs if any.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Thomas Palmer from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Thomas Palmer","Just wanted to ask on the Jennie-O side, the lost shelf space, who are you losing that to and as you look to win it back, what's kind of the pitch for displacing it? It's a little surprising. I guess how well velocities have hung in to see this level of distribution losses. So what are your retailers telling you? Who are they giving it to and kind of what's the pitch to win it back?","Jim Snee","Yes, I mean, there obviously are other competitors that are filling that space. And so it again depends on the retailer who's filling the void. The pitch becomes -- what happened to their category, since we've been gone. And in most cases, it's not a good category story for them and so to us that speaks volumes that: a, brand still matter, and b, the number one brand really matters. So there is a reason -- through the voluntary recall. There is a reason that we are off shelf and we understand that. But this idea that the brand is still strong through all of our research is very important. The idea of those places where we didn't lose distribution that the velocities are still hanging in there is very important. So it really becomes all of those things that the story that we're telling to the retailers. But again, it doesn't happen overnight. You don't show up with a magic wand and you're back on shelf. We know that we have to earn the right to be back on their shelves and we'll do that. But once we're there, we know that we'll be able to help them grow their category.","Thomas Palmer","And I also wanted to follow-up on the hog side, you referenced the run-up in spot pricing. I think in the past you've had maybe a little bit less volatility than spot pricing because you're in negotiated pricing in your hedges. Have you decreased that exposure? I mean is this a situation where as those hedges roll off? We look for more inflation inside of the fourth quarter than in the third quarter or should we be thinking about it a little differently than that?","Jim Snee","Probably, the biggest difference you've seen between the first quarter and second quarter and we believe will go into the back half is in the first quarter grain-based contracts were a drag to us. They were more expensive than other formula pricing that we had. It's an advantage to us right now. Those are coming in a little bit lower costs. We still take future positions. We still work with our producers. Of course, when we made the change in the structure of Fremont, we took a look at rebalancing the type of contracts we have and we think we're in a really good position right now. We have a nice balance.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Benjamin Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Theurer","Just a quick one. So, obviously, with the disruption in China, roughly $150 million to $200 million, which you expect and your exposure on the sales side, what have you seen on Chinese demand for different products? Have you seen people switching? Have you still seen the similar demand dynamics as in the past? Sorry I'm little tired. Just to understand how the Chinese consumers reacting and how you feel about demand going forward on the Chinese side, just in order to understand a little bit what the opportunity could be for imported products from ours and how that most likely is going to shake out on a global basis? That would be great to get some color.","Jim Snee","Yes, great question, Ben. So I mean we have seen and you've probably heard that there has been an increase in the chicken consumption in China. But consumers in China are still eating pork and so our in-country business still remains very strong both the retail and foodservice refrigerated meat business. We've also seen and as we mentioned, the strong growth in our SPAM and Skippy business, but I do think that, you hit on something that we're watching very closely is that we are trying to understand the consumer demand and what the impact of ASF is having on them at this point. We haven't seen it flow through in the business, but it is something obviously that's top of mind.","Benjamin Theurer","And then just one quick one on your updated tax guidance, is it fair to assume that the second half is basically unchanged to what the initial guidance was, and that reduction for full year is solely driven by the lower effective tax rate of the second quarter?","Jim Sheehan","That's correct, Benjamin.","Operator","We will take our last question from Rebecca Scheuneman from Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Rebecca Scheuneman","So I was just wondering if you can talk about what percentage of the international business pork exports are? Is that less significant now with the Fremont sale? And I'm just wondering if that will help offset some of the cost pressures we're seeing in the port business because some of the other pork producers are seeing increased margins year-over-year in their pork export business?","Jim Snee","Yes, so a couple of things there, Rebecca. Our transaction with the Fremont facility really has no impact on our ability to supply the international export pork business. I mean, it's still an important part of the overall portfolio. And so when it's down to the extreme that it was this quarter, it impacts the overall business and so obviously we've been in a very intentional, very focused on our ability to grow our multinational businesses, both in China and Brazil. And so we, of course, we've got our plant expansion, our new plant in Jiaxing to support that growth in country put in our first ever SPAM production line that we own outside the United States. And so, I mean that's really what we're focused on in terms of our international business and over time our goal is for our pork exports to become less and less meaningful, and less and lesser part of our international business.","Rebecca Scheuneman","Okay. So you don't expect that a material impact your results for the back half of the year even as those margins improve, it really won't impact anything?","Jim Sheehan","I mean it depends, right. And obviously we've got the impact of ASF but you've also got tariff issues still. I mean, there's still a lot of moving parts. So it could still have an impact on our international group. But again, it's really hard to tell at this time.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to today's presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Jim Snee","Well, I want to thank all of you for your participation today. Obviously, we've covered a lot of ground and talked a lot about the uncertainty that exists in the marketplace. But through all of the uncertainty that exists in the marketplace, as I mentioned earlier, I've never had more confidence and faith in our team, our business and our strategies and their ability to continue to deliver key results for our company. I want to wish you all a safe Memorial Day weekend. And thank you for your time today.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Hormel Foods Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded today, February 20, 2014. And I will now turn the conference over to Jana Haynes, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jana Haynes","Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6:30 a.m. Eastern Time. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at www.hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.","On our call today is Jeff Ettinger, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jody Feragen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jeff will provide a review of the operating results for the quarter. Then, Jody will provide detailed financial results for the quarter. The line will be open for questions following Jody's remarks. [Operator Instructions]","An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 10:30 a.m. Central Time today, February 20, 2014. The dial-in number is 1 (800) 406-7325 and the access code is 4664913. It will also be posted to our website and archived for 1 year.","Before we get started with the results of the quarter, I need to reference the Safe Harbor. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the company are fluctuations in the costs and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products.

It can be accessed on our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We announced record first quarter earnings this morning of $0.57 per share, up 19% over last year. Operating profit increased by 20% with 4 of our 5 segments registering gains this quarter. In terms of the top line, we generated record sales of $2.2 billion, an increase of 6% over last year on volume growth of 2%. I will now take you through each segment.","Our Grocery Products segment profit increased 13%, and sales grew by 20%. Sales for Grocery Products in the quarter were down 2% excluding Skippy products. Sales gains in Grocery Products were led by Skippy peanut butter, Hormel chili, Hormel bacon toppings and the HERDEZ line of salsas and sauces. We are particularly pleased with our team's success in securing increased distribution and feature activity for our Skippy peanut butter products.","While our Grocery Products segment profit increased during the quarter, there were some challenges. Higher beef and pork input costs pressured the margins of some of our core products, and sales of our SPAM family of products and Hormel Compleats microwave meals were soft during Q1.","Segment operating profit for Refrigerated Foods was up 59%, driven by positive pork operating margins and growth in both our foodservice and retail value-added franchises. Sales for Refrigerated Foods increased 6% led by retail sales of our Hormel BLACK LABEL bacon, LLOYD'S Ribs and Hormel REV Snack Wraps. We also enjoyed sales growth in our foodservice business, including such items as our Hormel FIRE BRAISED Meats and Old Smokehouse Pecanwood Smoked Bacon. Segment volume for Refrigerated Foods declined 1% due to increased internal utilization of raw materials and the impact of our exit from the animal feed business in the second quarter of 2013.","Segment profit at Jennie-O Turkey Store increased 1%. While we benefited from more favorable feed cost this quarter, the savings were offset by weaker live production performance due to the sustained extremely cold temperatures we have experienced this winter. The unusually cold weather has also caused national propane and natural gas shortages driving up the cost of these fuels significantly, which will negatively impact our raw material costs in the second and third quarters.","Sales of our Jennie-O turkey Store lean ground turkey chubs and tray packs were strong in the first quarter as we kicked off a new Make The Switch media campaign in January, featuring lean ground turkey as an ingredient in tacos. Overall, the Jennie-O turkey Store segment reported sales growth of 2% on flat volume.","Timing differences of whole bird shipments for the holiday season year-over-year masked some of the value-added sales increases we enjoyed during the quarter. We are pleased with the sustained growth of our value-added turkey products in retail, foodservice and deli as consumers continue to find better food solutions in our portfolio of turkey products.","Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 11% and a sales decrease of 16% driven by the expiration of the agreement last summer, allowing Diamond Crystal Brands to sell certain sugar substitutes in the foodservice trade channels. The decline from the contract expiration more than offset gains in our sugar and Hormel health labs businesses. Our Specialty Foods team is focused on rebuilding its product portfolio and providing sales and operating profit growth as soon as possible.","Our International & Other segment profit increased 32%, and sales grew 24%. Strong export sales of the SPAM family of products and Skippy peanut butter drove the positive results. Our China operations also continue to augment segment sales growth.","As we move into the second quarter, we will kick off national media campaigns and promotional activity to support our SPAM family of products and Compleats microwave meals. We also expect continued positive momentum when it comes to our Skippy brand. Pork operating margins continue to be favorable. Bacon demand remains strong, and we are very pleased with the performance of our Hormel REV Snack Wraps, which are exceeding our expectations with excellent repeat purchase rates.","The PED virus has impacted our internal farm operations and several of our independent hog suppliers. Our Refrigerated Foods team is closely monitoring the effects on our pork raw material supplies. Based on the timing of the virus breaks in our supply chain so far, we anticipate tighter pork raw materials in the summer months. We are taking steps now to ensure we will be able to meet the needs of our customers during this time period.","We continue to expect year-over-year sales and profit growth from Jennie-O Turkey Store, but profit growth will be at more modest levels than initially anticipated due to fuel costs. Finally, we are enjoying significant growth in our International & Other business segment and look for this to continue going forward. Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2014 earnings guidance of $2.17 to $2.27 per share.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter.","Jody H. Feragen","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 totaled $153.3 million or $0.57 per share compared to $129.7 million or $0.48 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the first quarter totaled $2.24 billion compared to $2.12 billion last year, a 6% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.27 billion pounds, up 2% from the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.4% of sales, unchanged from last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be between 7.3% and 7.6% of sales for the full year.","Equity and earnings of affiliates was $4.7 million in the first quarter versus $9.8 million last year. The decrease is the result of unfavorable exchange rates and lower earnings at our MegaMex foods joint venture, which experienced higher input costs. Advertising expense for the quarter was $36.1 million compared to $24.7 million last year. The increase was the result of the new Make The Switch ad campaign for Jennie-O Turkey Store and the national advertising campaign for Hormel REV wrap. Additionally, advertising campaigns are planned for Skippy peanut butter, our SPAM family of products and Hormel Compleats microwave meals.","Interest and investment income was $1.2 million for the first quarter compared to $1.8 million last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. We expect interest expense to be about $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2014. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.3% versus 33.5% in fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%.","The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 263.8 million shares. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270.2 million shares.","Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31.8 million, up from $29.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million to $128 million in fiscal 2014. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year.","Capital expenditures for the quarter total $37 million compared to $22.1 million last year. For fiscal 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million to $140 million.","At the beginning of the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Skippy peanut butter business in China, spending $41.4 million and using our available cash balances for the transaction. The integration of this business into our current sales and distribution operation has been completed by our international team.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Luke?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question today will come from the line of Jeremy Scott of CLSA.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Can you give us an update on the REV product line? How are consumers responding? And how is it performing versus your expectations? And then maybe an update on the Compleats breakfast line as well.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Very good. We're very pleased with how REV is performing in the marketplace. As we exited the holiday season and got into kind of back-to-school time frame for the winter semester at schools, we're seeing good sales response. We're ahead of schedule in terms of our repeat measures on this product line. We continue to have excellent distribution in the marketplace and would expect that our relaunch consumer advertising campaign will also add to sales within the REV line. When it comes to breakfast Compleats, we've had reasonably good success getting the product landed at a number of retailers. It's becoming one of the better selling items of the Compleats line, a few of the varieties, and so we're pleased in that regard. Overall, I have to concede the Compleats didn't fully live up to our expectations for the quarter, but we do between the advertising that's kicking in for Compleats and some better feature activities that we know we have on the books for the upcoming 2 quarters, we expect some improvements on the Compleats line and breakfast Compleats will be part of that.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Great. And I appreciate it's pretty difficult to track, but on PED, can you talk about your exposure relative to the industry? It seems like a lot of the barns affected are from your primary sourcing areas. And then maybe get into how -- what's the volume impact for the summer months and how the margin volatility is going to play into your guidance.","Jody H. Feragen","Wow, that's a lot of questions in one question. Certainly, the industry condition leaves supplies uncertain for, I think, a lot of folks in the industry, and we would expect higher hog prices to result from that. And that's pretty much reflected in what we're seeing in the futures market. Our team has worked hard to identify gaps that we see in our supply chain, along with our internal supply, as well as our producers. And we will look to make sure that we try to secure enough production to make sure that we can meet our customers' needs and the needs of our value-added businesses. Did that answer all your questions? I'm trying to remember what the rest of them were.","Jeremy Scott - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Just what the -- what your expectations for a volume impact may be in the summer months when the shortages really come to -- into play.","Jody H. Feragen","Boy, I don't really have a specific decline number for us because, as I'd indicated, we've been working to fill some of those gaps, so might be even a little early to tell. The benefit is, is that it's moving across the country, if you will, in waves so that it's not all going to absolutely hit one particular period.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question is on Jennie-O Turkey, can you -- you mentioned the fuel cost and just the tough -- the cold weather and the impact that's having on the operating profit. Can you help us quantify that in anyway?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","I guess, the best I can tell you, Akshay, would be that our original expectations for Jennie-O Turkey Store were reasonably solid gains year-over-year in segment profit for most of the quarters. As you saw in Q1, it was a much more modest gain. That's probably more of the mode we would expect now for the next couple of quarters. And then by the fourth quarter, we do expect the division to be in a position to be more solidly up. So you know the fuel costs and live production were somewhat unexpected, and it was some significance we do recognize, so obviously, there are some benefits in terms of total feed costs. They're on a relatively healthy position when it comes to the commodity meat markets within the turkey complex. And we're really quite happy with their value-added growth. I mean, even though the aggregate growth for all of Jennie-O in sales was 2%, as I mentioned some of that was related to some whole bird timing, and so notwithstanding the whole birds, our value-added businesses were up more in the 4% to 5% range. So we're very happy with that.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So the underlying sort of profitability of the business continues to move in the right direction. It's I would -- is it fair to say that this issue should be transitory? And it seems like a couple more quarters is sort of what you're expecting.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on refrigerated, I thought it was a very good quarter if you look at margins on a per-pound basis, probably the best one you've had in couple of years. So was it really that good? And then how do I parse out the -- or reconcile the commentary on the REV wraps and the volumes being down? I know there's a lot of moving parts, but clearly, the REV business is doing well, but will it start to show up in the revenue numbers? Or -- and if so, where? I'll pass it on.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Sure. For Refrigerated Foods, I mean, it was a good quarter. I kind of look at 3 things going well within the refrigerated group, I mean, clearly, the basic cutout margins were a lot more favorable this year than what we had experienced a year ago. Secondly, some of the more kind of market-based supply chain type items, if you recall, we talked about those last year at the Investor Day, is bacon, for example, is being challenging circumstance for part of last year. That complex is in much better shape right now. And then our higher value-added items are all -- are really doing quite well. And again, I -- in terms of the masking effect of the change in feed sales and then some of the internal transfers, I mean, if you just kind of look at the retail value-added franchises, they were up solidly above 5% growth in the aggregate with several items doing well. REV is part of that. We're -- as we've mentioned earlier, we're happy with where REV is showing up, and we do expect to see a time where you'll see that top line reflected as part of the total Refrigerated Foods results.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Eric Larson of CL King.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on the cutout margins, Jeff. For the kind of the upcoming quarters, I think all of us pretty much anticipate you're going to have a tighter hog supply. Is there enough room at retail for the cutout margin -- for the prices to at least be able to offset your higher costs? In other words, can you at least maintain your cutout margin for the -- for, let's say, the next 2, 3 quarters?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","The cutout margins were quite favorable in Q1. In our very current environment, they remain favorable, but -- and we've known from the last 2 years that, that can be mercurial. I mean, it -- and when you add in the effect of PED and what kind of a variable that might be is, I guess we're not counting on cutout margins staying at today's level, but that's where they are today.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, I just didn't -- I'm just trying to get a feel for whether there's enough room in the whole meat complex. Obviously, you've got very high beef prices, and chicken prices have moved up, too, because your supplies have been constrained there as well. So it seems like there's the ability at retail to get to pricing that you need to offset that lower supply. But that's just my observation.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay.","Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And number two, could you talk a little bit about -- more about MegaMex? Obviously, your equity earnings in the quarter were about half of what they were a year ago. And is it just a margin issue with input costs? And are they going to price to try to pick some of that back up in the back half or the final 9 months of your year? Or how should we look at that equity line?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, MegaMex, I mean, we talked last year about an earnout composition related to the Fresherized Food piece, and so really, for the remaining quarters of this year, that was still, on a percentage basis, hold down what ultimately MegaMex will contribute to the company. Otherwise, I mean, you have -- it's -- there are quite a few factors. I mean, there's peso exchange factors. There are some supply factors. We've had some uneveness in terms of business performance. The Don Miguel piece was a little bit softer in this quarter both in sales and in terms of some margin squeeze. On the other hand, the HERDEZ line was really quite strong, and we're happy with the sales of the Wholly -- the fresherized, the Wholly Guacamole item. So overall, we're still very high on what MegaMex is going to be able to do for the company, but we're kind of swimming through some choppy seas in terms of that equity and earnings line for probably the next couple of quarters.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Rachel Nabatian of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Rachel Nabatian","First question is a follow-up to Akshay's. On Jennie-O, are you running the business as well as you thought you would internally? The cold weather and fuel costs are things that we've heard about the commodity chicken operators, but the depths and the expected duration of the negative impact, hasn't been to the same extent as what you have discussed today.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. Yes, I mean, we're -- we think the team up there really does a very good job in terms of trying to anticipate potential challenges. I mean, the whole situation related to propane and we've got into a mode here during January where we were a little bit concerned as to whether we would even get any propane. And when you have live turkeys in a barn, that's a very significant problem. We did survive through that time frame but with much more significant costs than what our initial plans had been built around. We do believe that there'll be somewhat of a transitory effect of those costs as we finally get out of the cold weather and hopefully, the markets return to some normalcy. We're seeing some improvement on the natural gas front already in terms of the market coming back a little bit more normal situation and would expect propane to follow. But overall, I mean, it's -- I would agree that we would have even a stronger quarter at Jennie-O but for those conditions, but I think the team's doing what they can to weather those.","Rachel Nabatian","Okay, that's fair. And then just one follow-up question on REV wraps and protein snacking trends. So I just got back from CAGNY, and almost every presenter had a focus on protein. And then Kraft and Hillshire Brands were introducing meat plates, plates with meat, nuts and cheese or chicken with dipping sauce. And so I guess I just wanted to know your thoughts on this and if you think it's a positive since it'll grow the category. I believe these products are generally next to REV wraps in-store.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. Well, I mean, it's early to tell. I mean, some of those products are just going to get in market this spring. I mean, they've been shown to the retailers, but in terms of actual shelf impact, we obviously believe in the concept that meat or meat and cheese combinations could be a positive element for consumers when it comes to snacking opportunities. And so it's certainly not stunning to us that others have looked at the marketplace the same way and have come up with different offerings. I mean, it's -- I think the offerings that I've seen are really all quite different from each other, so there certainly is the possibility that they could well be complementary and hit consumers at slightly different occasions or maybe a slightly different age audience. But in terms of what we're looking to accomplish with REV, we're happy with what we've seen, and we continue to gain shelf placements even in the environment of others offering -- introducing new items.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Sorry to beat a dead horse here. But if I kind of think about the turkey business, is it fair to say about $20 million over a 3-quarter period is kind of the estimated cost associated with this? Is that a fair number?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","You're talking about fuel alone?","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes. Just from a 3-quarter impact, first, second and third quarter.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","If you're looking just fuel cost by itself, that number is low. But we obviously have other things offsetting some of the fuel, unexpectedly high fuel. But as we -- we use a significant amount of fuel in the operation. So it was north of $10 million for -- on a 1-quarter basis.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So actually, the more interesting question I hope is, all right, so now you had greater pressure from that, which was unexpected. What was better than expected to offset this throughout the whole organization? Because if you're saying $20 million to $30 million is low, obviously, you've had other successes that may not -- were not in your forecast as well. So what actually is exceeding your expectations across your portfolio?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. Refrigerated Foods ended up doing a little bit better than we thought. We knew they were going to have a positive year, but the overall total in terms of their gain year-over-year was more significant than we had originally planned. And we are attaining kind of better than pro forma benefits from Skippy peanut butter in both the grocery and international segment.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. And my final question is on the Compleats, what is the -- I mean, in SPAM, what do you think the progress will be throughout the year in terms of the build? Because it seems like this is again another -- one other piece of your portfolio that has not been as good as we would have expected, but it sounds like you guys are addressing it again.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Ken, I don't have a real clean answer for you on that. I mean, it's been a little bit of a puzzle even internally. We thought maybe we had turned the corner a little bit last year. We had a couple of really pretty strong quarters with Compleats heading into Q4, and kind of later in the year, it was a little softer. And then Q1, clearly, it did not meet our expectations. So we're hopeful that the new marketing effort and the new -- and some of the promotions we have with the customers will get that back on the right trajectory. We think we've introduced some items that consumers like in terms of the breakfast Compleats items. But time will tell here. I mean, I would agree with you that, that's been one of our franchises that's been a little bit more of a struggle for us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Farha Aslam of Stephens Inc.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","A question around the very strong margins in fresh pork and kind of how you think about pricing in your value-added products because it looks like hog costs will go up going into that spring-summer time frame. Are you thinking that you're going to focus on passing along those prices in your packaged meats items? Or are you thinking of more taking a balanced approach and saying, \"Okay, I'm making a lot in fresh pork. Maybe I don't need to take as much on my packaged meats.\"?","Jody H. Feragen","Sure, Farha. This is Jody. We always evaluate where we're at with our cost structure and the prices that we go to the retailers with. And in some instances, like the supply chain items, it's probably a more rapid change. Certainly in some of foodservice areas, we have contracts that have levers that move along with the cost of goods. I would expect that we'll continue to evaluate and look at where we need to take pricing. And if it's appropriate at the time, we'll -- we won't be the only ones with those higher input costs in the industry.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then so your -- sort of how much timing is required for you if we see -- because we see that summer hogs are going to be really expensive. You need to start talking about pricing with retailers now? Or can you -- or is it all automatically or formulaic? We're just trying to understand how you're planning on managing that summer hog hit.","Jody H. Feragen","Sure. From the retail perspective, I would say the team's probably looking at it right now. It'll be dependent on evaluating those gaps in our supply chain and what we think it's going to do to us internally. So I would believe the team is working on it now.","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","And on the grocery side, we actually have gone to our customers and notified them of pricing on such as the beef-based items, such as Hormel chili, Mary Kitchen hash and also on SPAM luncheon meat.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And sort of the degree of pricing that you've taken on those, roughly?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Low to mid-single digit. It varies by item.","Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then this has been -- sort of you've had China with that Skippy business for about a quarter now. Kind of now that you've had it, how do you feel about it? Have you been able to kind of marry SPAM and Skippy in China? And how is that working out?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","It's working out well. I mean, it's interesting. In terms of our quarter 1 results, our international team actually didn't get their hands on the business as quickly to be able to benefit fully from it in the quarter. They kind of by January kind of had the full control, and so they got 1 month worth of full benefit of integration of China. But they're quite happy with what they've been able to do with some of the distributors, not only in China but in some of the other Asian-based markets where we have seen an ability to kind of lever at least the attention level or if somebody can carry both a SPAM and a Skippy as items into the marketplace. So -- and then it's really -- it's way too early in terms of any sort of operating synergies. I mean, we literally have had our team helping the local group there for a very short period of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Akshay Jagdale.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about Skippy. I think last quarter, you said you wouldn't talk about that line item like financially separately. But are you -- it seems like it's going better. So can you give us some more color on what's going better? Is it the peanut cost issue? Or is it just distribution and maybe a little bit more color on what's driving that? Obviously, the sales execution seems to be better, but anything to help us understand the performance of Skippy within the context of the category because the other big brand has had some issues in recent months?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Okay. Well, I mean, the costs have remained benign, so that's been positive overall for the net margin for the business. But probably the bigger factor that has been the consumer reception to our positioning with the item. We -- as we took the item over, we found there were some retailers that had either no Skippy items or pretty scant section even though we could identify there were long-standing consumers within that marketplace. And so they were quite receptive to the notion of us getting back in and becoming supportive behind it. And we coupled that with promotional support. Clearly, it -- especially on a year-over-year basis, if you think about it, this was the quarter that last year the business was for sale. So I don't blame the seller that they probably weren't spending a lot of time promoting the product that quarter. So on a year-over-year basis especially, we certainly drove some added feature activity but our feature spending on this item is now at a level that's kind of commensurate with being the #2 player in the category. It allows us to generate some good solid growth in terms of the top line but also is living up to our performance expectations in terms of margins.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And now you're going to put some marketing behind it and then sort of the innovation piece will come after that. Is that how we...","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Yes, exactly, Akshay. So the timing, I mean, we're looking at back-to-school time for the advertising. I mean, we're still settling on kind of the final new campaign themes and what the media elements will be. But I would -- you should look for it in the later part of our fiscal year as the kids go back to school in the fall. And then the new product innovation -- and we have some closer-end things that will hit the market here soon. But in terms of kind of a more major, what we talked about, sort of the out of the jar type newer opportunities, those definitely are more 2015, probably not even right out of the gate 2015. But we'll follow on soon after when the marketing kicks off.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just one last one on grocery, just can you talk a little bit about the environment. Obviously, the center of the store is quite pressured, and we've heard that a lot in CAGNY. But I don't think it's clear to anybody, really, why the consumers are so strapped especially on their food purchase. And so any -- what are your -- what's your read on that situation?","Jeffrey M. Ettinger","Well, for us, the center of the store was somewhat choppy. I mean, we had items such as SPAM and Compleats that ended up having declines year-over-year. And so certainly, you can look at those and say, gee, we're experiencing some kind of at least short-term contraction of those franchises in this current environment. On the other hand, we had several items that did well, like bacon bits and chili and HERDEZ and Wholly. And so we were, I guess, blessed, if you will, with a lot of niche relatively young items in some cases that are still finding more and more consumers. And so we're maybe a little less than the mode of having a lot of high household penetrations, extremely mature franchises. And so we seem to be able to expand our consumer base even in this current economic environment.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.

We are pleased to report record results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016. Earnings in the second quarter were $0.40 per share, up a robust 21% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, a 1% increase despite lower turkey volumes at Jennie-O Turkey Store and soft export demand in our international segment.","We reached an agreement to sell Diamond Crystal Brands in the second quarter and completed the transaction in recent days. This business, which was part of our Specialty Foods segment, represented approximately $260 million of annual sales. While Diamond Crystal Brands performed acceptably, it did not fit our long-term strategic priorities. As a result of the transaction, there was a small goodwill impairment recorded this quarter to reflect the final sales price.","Our Specialty Foods Group will retain Hormel Health Labs, a provider of nutritional foods and beverages developed specifically for individuals with special dietary needs, which was previously a part of Diamond Crystal Brands. We continue to ensure a smooth transition for the customers and employees of Diamond Crystal Brands. In addition to our earnings release this morning, we also announced the acquisition of Justin\u2019s LLC, a pioneer in the specialty nut butter category. The acquisition comes with the fast growing Justin\u2019s brand of natural and organic products, a strong management team, access to new customers and several manufacturing agreements. The deal is subject to the customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals in the United States and is expected to close within 60 days.","I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee who will provide additional details about the Justin\u2019s acquisition and also take you through each segment.","Jim Snee","Well, thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone. Since Justin\u2019s was founded in 2004, the business has experienced tremendous growth. Looking forward, we expect Justin\u2019s to grow at low double-digit rates from a starting point of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2017 net sales. Justin\u2019s will report into the Grocery Products segment.","Justin\u2019s enhances our scale in the nut butter category complementing our Skippy brand positioning very nicely. The Justin\u2019s brand gives us a great platform in natural and organic specialty nut butter spreads, the fastest growing portion of the nut butter category. Justin\u2019s also further balances our portfolio of brands towards younger, more health conscious and on-the-go consumers with their pioneering squeeze packs, a portable snack that comes in all seven of Justin\u2019s nut butter flavors. We intend to leverage key Hormel Foods resources and supply chain, finance and R&D while leaving their mission and vision unchanged. We look forward to working with the Justin\u2019s team in Boulder, Colorado and finalizing the acquisition in the coming weeks. I will now take you through each segment.","Grocery Products segment profit was up 21% for the quarter. Input cost tailwinds and improved plant efficiencies drove the gains. Sales were up 1% led by Skippy peanut butter, Hormel chili, Wholly Guacamole and our Herdez line of authentic Mexican products. Sales for our chunk meats business and Compleats microwave meals were down this quarter.","Our Skippy peanut butter products had a great quarter. Our traditional jarred peanut butter continues to capture share in the marketplace as our sales team gains additional distribution. Our most recent innovation, Skippy P.B. Bites has had many early successes and key measures such as trial and repeat are meeting our internal targets. The company continues to leverage its iconic brands in new and innovative ways. And this past April, we opened the new 14,000 square foot Spam Museum located in downtown Austin, Minnesota. We invite you to come and visit our new family of friendly museum.","Refrigerated Foods second quarter operating profit increased 13%, with sales up 7% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from strong pork operating margins, the addition of the Applegate business and great results from our foodservice business. We saw growth from many of our value-added products, including retail sales of Hormel Natural Choice lunchmeat, Hormel pepperoni and Hormel party trays. Our foodservice value added products experienced solid growth led by brands such as the Austin Blues line of products, Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon and Hormel Fire Braised meats.","When we announced the Applegate acquisition in 2015, one of our top priorities was to tackle the supply constraints we identified during the acquisition. While staying true to Applegate\u2019s mission of changing the meat we eat, we have secured additional supplies and the team is working to gain back distribution that was lost when supplies were pressured. Applegate remains on track to deliver earnings results consistent with our initial guidance for this business.","Jennie-O Turkey Store\u2019s second quarter segment profit increased 20%, while sales decreased 4%. Results were impacted by the lingering effects of avian influenza as flocks lost in 2015 created shortfalls in operations and sales. Production volumes have now returned to normalized levels and we remain optimistic that avian influenza is behind us. However, the team continues to be diligent and heightened biosecurity remains a top focus. We remain focused on gaining back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak, but we did enjoy growth this quarter in our Jennie-O lean ground turkey, retail bacon and Oven Ready product lines.","Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit increase of 74%. The increase was aided in part by a favorable comparison to expenses last year related to the closure of the CytoSport production facility. Operational synergies captured in the current year within the CytoSport and Century Foods supply chain also contributed to the increase. Muscle Milk sports nutrition products posted excellent results in addition to launching many new innovative items, such as Muscle Milk protein smoothies. The gains made by our CytoSport team were offset by lower contract packaging sales, resulting in a 5% decrease in sales this quarter.","International\u2019s operating profit decreased 33% and sales declined 17%. Weak exports of our Spam and Skippy family of products in addition to soft pork export markets contributed to the declines. Our China meat business had a difficult comparison to last year in addition to pressures from higher pork raw material costs. Our Skippy business in Mainland China experienced nice growth this quarter. We expect input cost tailwinds to continue for Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products. We look for these segments to continue driving year-over-year gains in sales and operating profits through increases in our value-added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store production is now at normalized levels and we are positioned to deliver growth in the back half of the year provided there are no significant reoccurrences of avian influenza. The team is investing in their fourth Make The Switch advertising campaign, highlighting turkey as an alternative to beef. Lower grain input costs should continue to be a tailwind in the second half of the year.","The Specialty Foods segment may show year-over-year sales and earnings declines due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. Positive sales trends in the Muscle Milk brand and incremental sales from new innovative Muscle Milk products will offset some of the sales declines. With the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and to reflect the enhanced margin profile of CytoSport, we are increasing our segment margin guidance for Specialty Foods to 11% to 14%, up from the previously guided 8% to 11%. We look for the international segment to return to growth in the second half through increased export sales of our Spam luncheon meat and Skippy peanut butter products, along with gradual improvement in our China retail meats business.","We continue to reinvest into our businesses through increased advertising and marketing support for brands such as Hormel pepperoni, our Spam family of products, Skippy peanut butter, Muscle Milk protein products and Jennie-O Turkey. As a result of the strong second quarter and continued confidence in our position heading into the back half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.50 to $1.56 per share to $1.56 to $1.60 per share.","At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter.","Jody Feragen","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Net earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled $215.4 million, up 20% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.40, a 21% increase. Sales for the second quarter totaled $2.3 billion compared to $2.28 billion for the same period last year, a 1% increase. Turkey supply shortages and lower exports pressured sales during the quarter. Volume for the second quarter was 1.28 billion pounds, down less than 1% from the same quarter last year.","As Jeff and Jim mentioned, we have reached an agreement to acquire Justin\u2019s LLC. The purchase price is $286 million. The transaction is structured to provide an ongoing cash flow benefit resulting from the tax amortization of the stepped up basis of assets. The net present value of this tax cash flow benefit is estimated to be about $70 million. We expect fiscal 2016 to include about four months of results from Justin\u2019s, with a slightly negative impact to earnings after factoring in the expected transaction costs and fair value adjustments. We estimate accretion associated with the deal to be approximately $0.01 for fiscal 2017. We expect to gain supply chain synergies that will be implemented over the next several years. We plan to finance this transaction with cash on hand and the short-term draws from our credit facility. Following the close, we will remain in a strong financial position to fund any other capital needs.","Advertising expense for the quarter was $48.8 million compared to $39.5 million last year as we continue to build on our brand investment. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.6% versus 34.6% in fiscal 2015. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 529.9 million compared to 528.1 million last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 543.8 million shares compared to 540.9 million last year. We repurchased 160,000 shares of common stock spending $6.4 million in the second quarter. We have 15.4 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place.","Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66.4 million compared to $27.3 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.1 million compared to $33 million last year. As Jim mentioned earlier, we raised our fiscal 2016 earnings guidance range to $1.56 to $1.60 per share. This guidance includes the sale of our Diamond Crystal business and the acquisition of Justin\u2019s LLC. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. We paid our 351st consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 16, 2016 at the annual rate of $0.58 per share.","At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe first, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on volume trends in Refrigerated I think you reported 3% volume growth. Do you have the organic number if you strip that Applegate? I would guess it will actually be slightly negative, which would be a little bit of a deceleration versus last quarter and hoping to really understand kind of some of the mix there for where you are seeing the gains foodservice versus retail on some of the categories?","Jeff Ettinger","I think your overall \u2013 this is Jeff, Adam, your overall math would be correct. It would have been slightly down absent the Applegate added sales. In terms of the differential between parts of the business, I mean we did talk about the foodservice had a really very strong quarter. So clearly, we are a little bit off on some of the retail brands, but it was a mixed bag. They had some nice success with some of their items, such as Natural Choice and party trays and pepperoni, but they did have a couple of the franchises that were down somewhat.","Adam Samuelson","And as you look ahead, any visibility to an improving retail cadence going into the summer? And maybe a little bit more color, Jeff and team on the margin mix implications of that stronger foodservice growth if that\u2019s actually benefiting the margins meaningfully at this point? Thanks.","Jeff Ettinger","Yes. I mean, I think not just for Refrigerated, frankly, we are looking at a more favorable environment for net sales growth for multiple segments next quarter. This quarter was still not quite where we would like it to have been, but it was not at the level of declines that the last two or three quarters had been. So, we are seeing the sequential improvement. And our outlook heading into the second half, for example, you\u2019ve got Jennie-O now with full volumes, so that will be a much more favorable picture. In terms of margins, who we have talked before about the foodservice is a solid contributor to overall refrigerated foods returns. The greater volatility piece more recently have been the processing margins were still quite strong this quarter although a little bit less than Q1.","Operator","We will take our next question from Farha Aslam from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Farha Aslam","Hi, good morning.","Jeff Ettinger","Hi, Farha.","Farha Aslam","First question is on turkey, as your volume comes back how should we think about margins in that business and margins going into next year and longer term for turkey?","Jim Snee","Yes, hi, Farha. Good morning. This is Jim. As we look into the future with our more normalized levels of production, obviously, the team is working hard to regain the distribution that was lost while supply was gone. And clearly, they were able to take advantage of some higher margins during that time. But as we look to the future, we would expect through \u2013 because of a couple of reasons. I mean, because of market conditions, but then also now that we are going to be able or have to sell all of the parts and not be able to take advantage of specific mix opportunities that our margins will return to the more normalized ranges, the guidance that we have provided. And I think we will start to see that in the back half of this year and into next year.","Farha Aslam","And then also your margin outlook for your Refrigerated Foods division longer term, do you anticipate the increased processing capacity that\u2019s coming on in the U.S. hog and pork processing sector to impact margins for Hormel and how do you plan to kind of work around that?","Jeff Ettinger","Farha, this is Jeff. I mean, that will be clearly one of the pieces we assess when we create our business plan for 2017. We are sticking with our margin guidance that we have provided for each of the segments at the beginning of the year with the one exception being obviously we did update the Specialty Foods segment as we said we would once we had visibility of the Diamond Crystal transaction being completed, but we recognized that at this point a number of our segments are performing quite strongly against the guidance ranges we have provided. And when we have a more clear outlook for 2017 and beyond we would provide an update to that.","Operator","And we will go next to Akshay Jagdale from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning.","Jeff Ettinger","Hi, Akshay.","Akshay Jagdale","Hi. First question is on Refrigerated Foods, so the pork operating margins that everybody tracks in May were even lower than what you saw in the second quarter. Is that \u2013 can you help us \u2013 I know it\u2019s difficult to look at those numbers and translate them to yours, but just generally speaking, what have you factored in into your guidance for the back half as far as pork operating margins go? Should they be similar to what we are seeing in the month of May, is that what\u2019s factored in or how should we think about that?","Jody Feragen","Sure. I will take that one, Akshay. Yes, you are right, pork operating margins for May have been down about 40% from the averages in April and that\u2019s probably a little bit faster decline than we originally anticipated. But as we have stated on our first quarter call, we really do expect pork operating margins to be higher for the full year because of the strong start we have had in the first half, but moderating in the back half. So predicting exactly where that\u2019s going to go is not an easy task as you know.","Akshay Jagdale","Okay. And then can you talk a little bit more about Justin\u2019s, the sales number you quoted is much higher than what we see in the measured channels. So clearly, they seem to have a big presence in the non-measured channel. Can you give us a sense of the channel mix? And maybe more importantly talk about why sort of buy this brand when you already have a good brand equity in the whole nut butter category? Why couldn\u2019t you take that and extend it into some other categories that Justin\u2019s is in, for example? Thanks. I will pass it on.","Jeff Ettinger","Yes, thanks, Akshay. This is Jeff and I will start with the question related to the sales number and then Jim is going to talk to the strategy piece. What we described for our anticipated sales for next year, for our full fiscal year, was in the $100 million range, but that\u2019s for next year and the brand is growing at a nice clip. They clearly do have sales outside of the reported channels. I don\u2019t have a precise quantification for you at this time in terms of the percentages. But clearly, that captures a good portion of them was been in the reported sales, but we should enjoy the growth next year.","Jim Snee","And then Akshay, in terms of the strategy of the brand, we have had a lot of success since the acquisition of the Skippy brand. We have been able to obviously gain share, drive innovation, but also a lot of the research that we have done around the brand tells us that it\u2019s not extendable into the space where Justin plays today. And so Justin\u2019s affords us that opportunity to really be more complementary to the Skippy brand in a category that\u2019s a rapidly growing category. We know that it attracts a younger, more health conscious on-the-go millennial consumer. And the growth that the business has seen over the last several years, clearly, we are earlier on the growth curve than we have been with some other acquisitions, which we are quite frankly excited about.","Operator","And we will go next to Heather Jones from BB&T Capital. Please go ahead.","Heather Jones","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. On Jennie-O, you guys are adding capacity there this year. Is that correct?","Jeff Ettinger","So, we have the favorable announced capital addition last year that was going to enable us to have more ground turkey capabilities. We suspended that last year when the avian influenza outbreak occurred and now we haven\u2019t turned that back on. So, it\u2019s not head capacity change, but it does enable us to support what\u2019s been a really nice growing franchise for us, the lean ground products.","Heather Jones","So, could you help us understand how much that could \u2013 how much that new value added capacity could add to your growth rate? And thinking about 2017, you are comparing against an extra week. However, you will have a full year of \u2013 well, assuming AI doesn\u2019t recur, you have a full year of normalized volume. So, just wondering how we should think about \u201817 volume growth for Jennie-O?","Jeff Ettinger","Heather, we really don\u2019t have any 2017 projections on either the top or bottom line at this point. But I would point out and we have talked in past presentations that, that ground turkey line is not a flash in the pan. I mean, that\u2019s been a long-term strong superior CAGR deliverer vehicle for us. That was why we went ahead and made the investment in the capital. And we are comfortable that now that we can guarantee supply on a broad basis. And frankly, the Make The Switch campaign that Jim mentioned in his remarks, I mean, that\u2019s the product line that\u2019s featuring. So how easy that is to use in tacos and in burgers for consumers. And so we do think that will be part of the growth story for Jennie-O, but we won\u2019t be able to give you a quantification of that until we have talked 2017 in November.","Operator","And we will go next to Mario Contreras from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Mario Contreras","Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask first in international, if you can just give a little bit of detail around what drove the challenges in brands like Skippy and Spam? And then what gives you confidence if those will recover in the second half year?","Jim Snee","Yes. Good morning, Mario. This is Jim. The biggest issue that we faced is we finally have felt the impact of the strong dollar in some of our export markets. It\u2019s not something that we have talked about in previous calls. But that really did impact both Skippy and Spam. There have been other supply issues that impacted our fresh pork business in terms of EU pork now flooding the Asian markets. So, it\u2019s really been a combination of things. But obviously, we have seen moderation in the strength of the dollar. We feel like we are positioned in terms of our branding, our advertising, our pricing that the second half will shape up to be a much better half on a comparable basis versus 2015.","Mario Contreras","Okay, thanks. And then one other question, with respect to Justin\u2019s, do they own any of their own manufacturing facilities? And then beyond that, can you just give a little bit of additional detail around where you see potential synergies coming from there?","Jim Snee","Sure. They have actually done a great job of building the brand and building the business since 2004 with a network of coal manufacturers. And our team is very comfortable with that approach. And as we think about where synergies will come from having already worked with them on due diligence, we believe supply chain, finance, R&D, there is a number of opportunities to gain synergies and really leverage the capabilities of our organization. And as I mentioned in my comments, we do plan to still run the business out of Boulder, Colorado.","Operator","We will go next to Jeremy Scott from CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott","Hi, good morning.","Jeff Ettinger","Hi.","Jeremy Scott","Can you refresh us on your current mix of value-added versus commodity within Refrigerated Foods?","Jeff Ettinger","I mean, it\u2019s in the 70% range. Frankly, it\u2019s probably \u2013 it\u2019s been in that range for a while. I think the bigger effort in recent years has been moving products even further up the value ladder. So, there is raw bacon, there is flavored bacon, there is microwavable bacon, now we have Bacon 1 for our foodservice group. And each case provide an added element of convenience or unique flavors that also enable us to obtain a better margin return for our efforts in creating those products.","Jeremy Scott","Okay. And just on the resilience within the Refrigerated Foods business has been exceptional. I was hoping you could share how you expect given where processing margins have come down, how do you expect the back half to trend relative to the front half?","Jeff Ettinger","I mean, the back half will \u2013 should trend a little bit lower than what the first half was on an operating margin basis, but still very strong versus historical averages for the group.","Operator","We will take our next question from Eric Larson from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Larson","Yes, good morning everyone.","Jeff Ettinger","Hi, Eric.","Eric Larson","Just a couple of questions, back \u2013 one back on Jennie-O, Jeff and Jim, the \u2013 it\u2019s kind of related to Heather\u2019s question and adding some capacity to some of your individual product lines at Jennie-O, i.e., the grown turkey product lines, etcetera. Will you move into a net of buying position for your raw materials for that division eventually? Is that part of your strategy? And does that make sense to be diversified in that front rather than adding headcount? And then as kind of a follow-on, Jeff and I think we have talked a little about this maybe about a year ago, obviously, with that \u2013 with your operations so concentrated right in this upper Midwest area, when you had the flu impact, it obviously had a bigger impact on you as opposed to having more diversified potential operations in other parts of the country. Strategically, does it make sense to diversify your sourcing and maybe part of this is with more third-party sourcing to supply your Specialty Products?","Jeff Ettinger","So, on your first question, I mean, realistically, we were probably a couple of years away from having to address adequate meat supplies before the AI hit. And of course, that\u2019s put us in a completely different mode for the past year and the team has done just a great job of surviving through that and positioning the brand well. So, that will come again in the future, where at some point we would have to assess, okay, do we engage in a more expanded program of buying in meat or do we look for further capacity capabilities of our own? And we will cross that bridge as that heads forward.","On your second question, I mean, we did make an assessment of that. At this point, we have chosen to redouble our efforts within the region that we do operate to make sure that we are kind of on the front lines of understanding how disease issues like that might spread and what you can do to combat them. Ultimately, we feel we have a really nice position being within a 4-hour concentric circle of our operating plants and our production lines that allows for the maximum freshness of product. In general, absent last year\u2019s AI outbreak, this is a very favorable grain market with positive basis situation in most cases. And so overall, we like our position of being where we are. But clearly, if we were starting to have repeated incidents, we might have to reassess that at some point.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thanks. Couple of questions. First one is you said pork processing margins down 40%. On my tracking they are still up versus historical levels though and I think versus year ago, if you factor in like overhead or shipping costs being down, transportation costs are lower, that\u2019s also a benefit we have a service that does that for us, I want to know if you are seeing a similar thing? And then secondly on turkey, I continue to underestimate the profitability of turkey during AI and I just was hoping to get just a little more color on, once you get your volume back, do you think you go back to kind of a normal margin environment? Can it be a well above normal margin environment as a result of maybe some continued tight supplies out there? It\u2019s just a little hard to figure out what it\u2019s going to look like maybe you are having the same challenge when you get back to normal?","Jody Feragen","Okay. I think I may have misled you by saying this down 40%. That was just the average so far in May versus the average in April. So, that was a sequential. You are absolutely right, we do expect pork operating margins to be above last year\u2019s in the back half of the year and somewhat higher than the historical averages.","Robert Moskow","Right.","Jim Snee","And then Rob on your second \u2013 to your second question, I mean, our expectation is, as the production level returns to normal at Jennie-O Turkey Store that these margins will fall in line with our normalized margin range. And it is \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of now that supply is back, we have seen some break in markets that we were able to capitalize on. And then clearly, the mix where we were perhaps being opportunistic in some of our buys, now we are going to have the supply of the birds and it\u2019s going to be our responsibility to make sure that we are clearing all of that volume, which changes the margin structure of the business slightly. So, we really do expect that it will be more normalized range as we head into the future.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Jeremy Scott from CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Scott","Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. I was wondering if you could try again on Applegate, if you can share the run-rate of that business and if there has been any success in moving some of that into foodservice?","Jeff Ettinger","This is Jeff. What we mentioned was that the business is performing consistently with the kind of earnings guidance projection that we provided on the business early on. We are looking forward to having that additional supply available and being able to start seeing the sales successes and the team placing items then that utilize that supply. But overall, I mean, the Applegate brand still is connecting very well with the consumer that we are seeking to partner with, with that kind of a brand and we are very pleased with where Applegate sits today.","Jim Snee","And as we think about opportunities in the future for foodservice, I mean, clearly, we are working on making sure that we regain the space with the retail business first. And then as supply opportunities present themselves over time, certainly, foodservice would be an opportunity.","Operator","And we will take a follow-up question from Akshay Jagdale. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale","Thank you. So, just following up on Jennie-O Turkey, just a modeling question, so how should we be thinking of the volume growth for the back half? I mean, there was some pretty massive declines last year, right, strong double-digits. So, should we be expecting double-digit increases in volume in the back half as we are lapping those? Can you help us with that?","Jeff Ettinger","Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t have the precise volume for you, but definitely, when it comes to on a net sales basis, it will be solidly double-digit for both of the upcoming quarters.","Akshay Jagdale","Okay. And in terms of guidance, can you remind us how much the divested business was contributing to EBIT? So, how much of your guidance change includes negative impact on EBIT from the business that you are selling? And do you have any sense as to what Justin\u2019s might be accretive or dilutive in a full fiscal year?","Jody Feragen","So Akshay, as a reminder, our annualized sales for the divested portion of Diamond Crystal Brands was estimated around $260 million. And we have never given guidance for subdivisions of our segments. But I think the comment that our $1.56 to $1.60 outlook for the full year includes not having the benefit of Diamond Crystal in the back half of the year as well as a slightly negative impact from Justin\u2019s and that\u2019s mostly driven because we will have transaction costs that we recognize currently as well as an estimated step up in some fair value of the inventory. So, the $1.56 to $1.60 is all-in.","Jeff Ettinger","And then on Justin\u2019s we did provide that for our first full year operating the business, we are looking at $0.01 a share. And clearly, the business with the double-digit growth expectations and what we think is going to be an ability to attain synergies that we think we will be able to move up from there over time.","Operator","We will take our next question from Robert Moskow. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","We got a lot of time. So, I am following up. I think you said there is a $70 million tax credit for Justin\u2019s. How is that factored into your accretion guidance and how quickly can you realize the benefits from that? And then the second question, Jeff, I think you mentioned some declines on certain products within the Refrigerated Foods segment, can you elaborate on which products those are and maybe the circumstances, are you seeing competitors discounting or is it just some products just need to be revived a bit?","Jody Feragen","So I will take the tax benefit. That\u2019s just a reflection of the purchase price. It has no P&L impact going forward. So, we will get the benefit from a tax perspective, but it will not impact us on the P&L. But if you think about what we paid for the business, I would look at it as the $276 million \u2013 $286 million less the $70 million tax shield to get to kind of the price though, but no P&L impact and that\u2019s a cash flow that\u2019s generated over the next 10 to 15 years.","Jim Snee","And then Rob, on the volume question, couple of the categories that were impacted we have got some what we would consider to be more commodity deli business that is more of an intentional decline, if you will and we are okay with that. The second category that has become very competitive is the bacon category. And over the last several years, our team has done a great job really driving our share, really developing our brand. And most recently, we are facing some competitive activity. And so we did see some short-term declines, but we remain very confident in the category and our ability to continue to drive our share and brand over time.","Jody Feragen","I would d like to follow-up on a response we gave earlier too about the volumes in Refrigerated Foods. Without Applegate, they were slightly positive. So, tonnage was up for the quarter in Refrigerated, under 1%, but up.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] It looks like we do have another follow-up from Akshay Jagdale. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale","Sorry, just one last one. This is for Jody. Can you talk a little bit about the free cash flow? It looks like working capital has been a little bit of a drag and so has the sort of other line. I am guessing that has to do with the acquisitions, but can you \u2013 because it\u2019s a deflationary commodity environment, so you would expect maybe working capital to be in a source of cash. But can you just help us give us a little bit more color on what might be going on there?","Jody Feragen","So, we have had some \u2013 and I think you said free cash flow, so that includes stepped up capital expenditure base as well as we bring turkeys back into the barn. Remember, those animals are gone inventory the minute they are in egg, so those will be the two biggest drivers.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And currently, there are no further questions in the queue.","Jody Feragen","So, thanks everyone for participating on the call today. And this is Jana Haynes last call as Director of Investor Relations. And we would like to thank her for her leadership of the Investor Relations function and wish her well in her new position as Vice President and Controller. And at the same time, we welcome Nathan Annis as the new Director of Investor Relations and look forward to working with him. Have a great day.","Operator","And this does conclude your teleconference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime."]}}
