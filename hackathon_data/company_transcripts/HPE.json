My name is Denise and I will be your conference moderator for today's call.","At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Andrew Simanek","Good afternoon. I'm Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I'd like to welcome you to our fiscal 2019 first quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tarek Robbiati, HPE's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before handing the call over to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast.

With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.","Antonio Neri","Thanks Andy. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today we reported another strong quarter for Hewlett Packard Enterprise providing further evidence that our strategy and disciplined execution are driving solid profitable growth. In Q1, we continue to execute against our strategy of accelerating growth in Intelligent Edge and delivering profitable growth in Hybrid IT, through innovation exceptional customer experiences and a commitment to our team and culture.","We are on track to exceed most of our fiscal year 2019 financial commitments that we laid out at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October last year. Q1 revenue grew 1% year-over-year when adjusted for the Tier one segments in line with our guidance.","Most importantly, we grew significantly in the high-margin value categories like high-performance compute, hyperconverged and composable infrastructure. Our continued mix shift as well as the ongoing cost management and supply chain simplification helped us significantly improve our operating leverage. We improved gross margins by 280 basis points year-over-year.","We grew non-GAAP operating profit by 19% year-over-year, well above our 6% to 8% guidance. And we grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 31% to $0.42, well above our outlook of $0.33 to $0.37. All of these drove free cash flow growth of over $200 million year-over-year putting us well on our way to delivering our fiscal year 2019 outlook of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.","From a macro perspective, demand remains steady. We continue to monitor the economic uncertainties around the globe, but the overall IT spending environment remains healthy. Our customers tell us the IT investment they are making are critical to driving business outcomes as they look to harness the explosion of data that continues to grow.","While the demand environment is helpful, our performance largely reflects our sound strategy, focused execution and software-defined portfolio that is resonating with our customers around the world. Computing at the edge is the next frontier. HPE's unique ability to connect our customers' data between all their edges and all their clouds is a significant differentiator and opportunity for us.","That is why we continue to prioritize strategic investments in the Intelligent Edge business. Our Aruba business performed well in Q1. We announced two important new solutions, the Aruba 510 campus access points designed for 802.11ax and the Aruba 8325 switches.","The introduction of these new offerings should drive accelerated growth in future quarters. Finally, as you saw in our financial realignments last week, we made an operational change by consolidating our edge data center networking business under Aruba.","This will help us even more effectively bring a complete networking portfolio to market. Investments like this will enable us to continue to be the leader in the edge. Turning to our Hybrid IT business, we continue to approach this market in a targeted segmented way.","That means, streamlining our go-to-market approach for our volume solutions and investing in high-value software-defined solutions and services. Software is increasingly embedded across all of our value solutions and we continue to drive software innovation both through organic investments and acquisitions.","For example, HPE OneView is a software foundation that delivers our composable hybrid cloud vision. It has over 1 million licenses in deployment and just won software product of the year for one of the leading channel publications, so it is clearly resonating with our customers and partners.","And HPE OneView is a key factor in synergy success in the market. HPE Synergy is now a $1 billion run rate business since being introduced just two years ago. Another good example is Plexxi which is now incorporated into the composable fabric of our SimpliVity hyperconverged offering. Our hyperconverged portfolio with SimpliVity and synergy grew 17% in Q1. And thanks to our AI software from InfoSight and more recently, BlueData we are offering the most intelligent storage platform on the market.","This software is what sets our storage portfolio apart and helped drive the seventh straight quarter of growth. Finally, innovative services like Pointnext GreenLake which offers a consumption model that lets customers pay for what they use continue to resonate with customers.","GreenLake orders grew double digits in Q1 and added to HPE's subscription services that drive our recurring revenue and profit. We have recently seen competitors compare their offerings to GreenLake, but the reality is that our solution enabled by software and backed by HPE Financial Services is the only on-prem consumption-driven offering in the market.","Beyond GreenLake, Pointnext overall has a strong book-to-bill ratio of 110% in Q1. As we begin to recognize the full benefit of a higher attach rates on our value compute offerings, the go-to-market improvements we have been executing and the completion of the intentional country exit in Advisory and Professional Services we expect to see a positive inflection in revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2019.","The investments and focus in differentiated software-defined solutions and services is driving the right mix shift to deliver growth, and expand margins in Hybrid IT. Tarek will get into the details, but I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on improving profitability, and believe there is still more room to grow.","Most importantly, our strategy and solutions are resonating with our customers and partners. In Q1, I continue to spend over 50% of my time with our customers and partners and I consistently hear from them how our vision, portfolio and strategy are perfectly suited to lead them through their digital transformation journeys.","We continue to win competitive deals due to our differentiated experiences and ability to provide focused portfolio as scale. For example, in Q1 we won a significant new deals with Telefonica in Spain for a technology infrastructure refresh including a transition from traditional storage to an all-flash storage solution.","Indiana University selected Aruba for a complete network refresh to support their 109,000 students including indoor and outdoor access points while Switches, ClearPass for security and a way for network management and net insight for analytics and assurance.","And Tata Motors recently selected us for a significant technology upgrade including 3PAR and Superdome flex. Finally, I believe to compete and win, we need the best innovation which is made possible by having the best talent.","Our people are our future, and in Q1 we continue to invest in making HPE a dynamic place where people are proud to work. We are executing a leadership team in place with focus on recruiting top talent to HPE and improving the engagement of our teams through new employee experiences, training and professional development and community services opportunities.","And as you may have seen, we began our move to a new state-of-the-art and custom-built headquarters in San Jose, California, two weeks ago. It showcases our innovative solutions while providing collaborative workspaces for our team. We will host a grand opening in April and I will be excited to welcome customers, partners and all of you to our new home this year. I am pleased with the important progress we have made to transform HPE and I remain incredibly optimistic about our future.","Our strategy is on point. The enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud enabled and data-driven. And we are proud to be the Company who can best help our customers connect all their data wherever he lives. Near-term we expect the demand environment to remain healthy and our differentiated software-defined solutions to continue to gain traction with customers driving accelerated revenue growth starting in Q2.","Tarek will provide the details, but our confidence in these areas has led us to raise our earnings per share forecast for fiscal year 2019. Longer term, by continuing to execute on our strategy and making important investments in our customers, innovation and our people, I am confident in our ability to deliver strong financial performance and shareholder returns.","I look forward to what lies ahead and I hope you share my enthusiasm for both the opportunity and for how well positioned we are to capitalize on it. And now let me hand the call over to Tarek who will provide additional details on the quarter. Tarek?","Tarek Robbiati","Thank you very much, Antonio. Now let me share with you our financial results for the quarter. As I did before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to better highlight the solid start we had in our Q1 to our fiscal year.","Starting with Slide 1, you'll see that we are already on track to exceed most of our key financial metrics that we committed to at our Securities Analyst Meeting. Revenue grew in line with guidance while we significantly expanded both gross and operating margins enabling us to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share well above our quarterly outlook.","This incremental profit and focus on working capital resulted in growing our free cash flow by over $200 million versus the prior year demonstrating that we are executing well and our strategy is resonating with customers. From a macro perspective, despite some ongoing uncertainties around the globe, we continue to benefit from the underlying trends of ever increasing amounts of data and the acceleration of digital transformations that our customers are undertaking.","As a result, we have seen IT spending from our enterprise customers remain steady. Looking at foreign exchange rates, they have continued to move unfavorably the last few quarters and we faced a modest headwind in Q1 of 30 basis points. We expect currency will be close to a two-point headwind to revenue growth on a full year basis in FY 2019 based on our current spot rates.","Looking at Slide 1, total revenue for the quarter was $7.6 billion, down 2% year-over-year, 1% in constant currency. However, excluding the headwind from our exit of the low-margin Tier one business, revenue grew 1%. Looking forward, we expect the impact from Tier one to become less dilutive to revenue growth towards the end of the year.","We also expect the solid enterprise demand environment to continue and our own execution to remain strong all of which should drive accelerated year-over-year growth rates beginning in Q2. Slide two gives you a geographic breakdown for the quarter.","America\u2019s revenue was up 1% in constant currency. Core compute grew double digits and Storage grew approximately mid-single digits. Revenue growth in EMEA continued to be strong, up 2% in constant currency with double-digit growth in the U.K. and France.","Asia Pacific was down 9% in constant currency primarily driven by revenue declines in the China market. Our HPC partnership there continues to be strong, and we are working to optimize the right mix of HPE product which generates revenue on our P&L with HPC's local offerings to maximize the profit of the overall entity. As a reminder, we recognize our 49% equity interest in our P&L and receive dividends.","In fiscal year 2018, we received cash dividends of $164 million from our HPC joint venture and expect to continue to receive similar dividend payments going forward. Beyond HPC, we saw a double-digit growth in our total Asia Pacific region in our Intelligent Edge and Financial Services business.","Slide three shows our performance in the quarter by segment. I won't take you through every number, but the key takeaway is that from a portfolio mix perspective, we are continuing to win where it matters. We maintained robust growth in our strategically important Intelligent Edge segment with balanced growth across both wired and wireless LAN.","In Hybrid IT, our high-margin value compute portfolio grew close to 20% driven by strength in the high-performance compute which grew over 50% and in hybrid converged offering which grew 70%. Within our storage portfolio, we saw a notable strength in all-flash arrays which grew 20%.","Our services business continues to show great potential with a Pointnext book-to-bill ratio of 110% and orders for Pointnext Operational Services including Nimble services growing 2% year-over-year in constant currency.","And within HPE Financial Services, we saw strong double-digit growth in our asset management business which is key for unlocking value to our customers and higher margin for us. Overall, we are confident that we can accelerate revenue growth as we continue pivoting our business towards higher margin software-defined offerings and improve our performance in our services business as fiscal year 2019 progresses.","Slide four shows our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42 was up 31% year-over-year and well above our previously provided outlook of $0.33 to $0.37 due to strong operational performance, favorable other income and expense and lower-than-expected tax rate and a lower share count from opportunistic buybacks.","This marks the fifth consecutive quarter we have exceeded the high end of our outlook range. This outperformance has been driven primarily by the significant improvements we are making in both gross and operating profit margins to drive increased operating leverage.","I'll talk more about that in just a minute. As outlined at our Security Analyst Meeting in October, we report our non-GAAP earnings using a structural tax rate based on long-term non-GAAP financial projections. At our analyst meeting, we had indicated that the rate was expected to be 13% beginning in fiscal year 2019.","Having received further guidance from the U.S. Treasury, we have now concluded our structural tax rate will be 12% which will be our non-GAAP tax rate for future quarters pending any structural change in our worldwide tax environment.","GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.13, below our previously provided outlook range of $0.19 to $0.23 per share, primarily due to the impact of onetime non-cash U.S. tax reform adjustments as we received incremental guidance on how to apply the new regulations. Turning to margins on slides 5 and 6, we continue to deliver significant margin expansion as a result of focusing on profitable growth in Hybrid IT, shifting our portfolio towards higher value, higher gross margin offerings and continuing to drive HPE Next initiatives.","Gross margin of 31.1% was up 280 basis points year-over-year and up 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter, the fourth quarter of sequential expansion. Improvements were driven primarily by portfolio mix, supply chain efficiencies, reducing manufacturing overhead and to a much lesser extent, lower commodities cost. Expanding gross margins is very important as it demonstrates that we have a rich portfolio of software-defined offerings of significant value to our customers.","Non-GAAP operating margin of 8.9% was up 160 basis points year-over-year. HPE Next has been a great success story for us this year. It has enabled us to make significant investments back into the business including a 20% increase year-over-year in R&D to drive organic innovation.","We expect the benefits from HPE Next to continue well into the future enabling investment opportunities and margin expansion benefits that will ultimately drive further cash flow growth. Now turning to the segment and business units starting on Slide seven with the Intelligent Edge. Revenue was up 5% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency led by growth in Aruba services.","Operating margins of 1.3% which are seasonally lowest in Q1 were down 390 basis points year-over-year due to ongoing significant investments in sales and R&D. Aruba product grew 3% with balanced growth across both wired and wireless LAN.","We expect share gains in wireless and wired which has gained share for seven consecutive quarters. With the new product launches in both wireless and wired switching that Antonio mentioned, we expect to drive accelerated growth as the year progresses.","Aruba services went up 20% on a continued installed base growth. We will continue to push high-margin Aruba services to represent higher portion of Aruba's total revenue.","Moving on to Slide eight in Hybrid IT, revenue was down 3% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency, but grew excluding Tier one sales. Operating margins were 11.3% up 200 basis points year-over-year, almost at a two-year high level.","We're executing well against our strategy of driving profitable growth by shifting to higher gross margin value offerings while improving operating margins across the portfolio with HPE Next. Compute's revenue was down 3% year-over-year, but up 3% excluding tier 1. Most importantly, our higher margin value compute business was up nearly 20%. Our Hyperconverged portfolio which includes Synergy and SimpliVity offerings was up 70%.","Our high-performance compute category was again up over 50%, and our edge compute service grew triple digits again this quarter. These trends are indicative that our focus on market segmentation is paying off and we are winning where it matters. Storage revenue was up 3% year-over-year which marks our seventh consecutive quarter of growth.","This quarter we saw particular strength in all-flash arrays which grew 20% year-over-year driven by Nimble. Big data also had another strong quarter growing a 25% year-over-year, and we expect it to further benefit from our recently announced acquisition of BlueData. We have also seen significant margin expansion as our customers embraced our intelligent storage offerings.","Looking forward, we expect storage revenue to ramp targeting $1 billion per quarter. HPE Pointnext revenue declined 6% year-over-year as expected due primarily to our continued intentional exit from low-margin countries in the Advisory and Professional Services business.","This would become less dilutive as the year progresses. More importantly, Operational Services orders including Nimble service orders grew 2% in constant currency. Growth in new attached to our higher-value offerings like Nimble and the increasing adoption of our Flexible Capacity offerings with GreenLake which was up double digits drove the order growth and the strong book-to-bill ratio of 110% in the quarter.","These leading indicators give us confidence in the long-term health of the business and we expect an inflection in revenue growth in the second half.","Moving to Slide 9. HPE Financial Services revenue was up 3% year-over-year and 6% in constant currency on strength in our higher margin asset management business. Financing volume was down 3% year-over-year and flat in constant currency with an ending net portfolio of assets of $13 billion.","Loss ratios also continued to be best in class below 50 basis points. Operating margin increased 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.4% and return on equity was a robust 15.6%. Our Financial Services business continues to play a vital role unlocking value for our customers through our traditional leasing offerings, asset management services and flexible consumption offerings with GreenLake that we will look to accelerate for years to come.","Now, turning to cash flow on Slide 10. Free cash flow was a negative $190 million in Q1. This is an improvement of more than $200 million versus the prior year driven by improved working capital management and higher profitability. Q1 is always our seasonally weakest quarter so we are well on our way to achieve our full year outlook of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flow.","More importantly, and on an annual basis, we expect working capital to be a contributor to free cash flow generation in the year offsetting some of the restructuring costs of HPE Next, thanks to an improved cash conversion cycle.","The cash conversion cycle was a negative 22 days in Q1 as working capital became a source of cash this year compared to the same period last year where it was a use of cash. Moving to capital allocation, as part of our continued $7 billion capital return plan through fiscal year 2019, we returned $1 billion to shareholders during the quarter.","We paid $157 million in dividends and repurchased $814 million worth of shares in the quarter that we intentionally accelerated to be opportunistic at lower trading prices throughout the quarter. Finally, and as you can see from Slide 11, our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with an operating Company net cash balance of $2.1 billion.","Also, as a reminder the vast majority of our debt is associated with a $13 billion receivable book of our financing business. With less than 50 basis points of bad debt as a percentage of average net receivables, the underwriting performance of HPEFS is best in class. As a result, the level of cash support for HPEFS are minimal which enables HPEFS to generate a high return on financial assets and double-digit return on equity as I mentioned before.","Now turning to our outlook on Slide 13, as a reminder, we started the year with a fiscal year 2019 EPS non-GAAP outlook of $1.51 to $1.61 per share. Given our strong non-GAAP EPS performance in Q1 and continued confidence in achieving the full year plan, we are raising our EPS guidance for the full year. We now expect to finish fiscal year 2019 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.56 to $1.66, and we expect our fiscal year 2019 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.88 to $0.98 per share.","This is now the fifth consecutive quarter that we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook. For Q2 fiscal year 2019, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.38, and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.19 to $0.23. So overall, I'm very pleased with the performance in the quarter to start the year.","We continue to execute well against our strategy and it's clearly resonating with customers as we are making the right bets and winning where it matters. This gives me a great confidence in our ability to accelerate revenue growth in the upcoming quarters with continued margin expansion that will drive our free cash flow and ultimately strong shareholder returns.","Now with that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will be from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Ashley Ellis","Hi. Thank you. This is Ashley Ellis on for Shannon. Within Pointnext, I was wondering if you could quantify the drivers of the decline, I think you began exiting or maybe you completely exited several countries around the middle of last year.","So I'm wondering what else drove the decline versus the prior two quarters? And how do you plan on stabilizing that business? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Antonio Neri","Sure. Thank you for the question, this is Antonio. I'm going to start and I'm going to give it to Tarek. So first of all, let's recap Pointnext, which we are pleased with our bookings performance which as Tarek said in the Operational Services business grew 2% year-over-year, but when you look at the book-to-bill ratio which is the orders that we take now against the current revenue period or the current period revenue and you think about the future which is basically translate those orders into revenue, that was 110% which is very, very strong.","On the Advisory and Professional Services in your question, we started last year as a part of HPE Next and will be done sometime at the latter part of this year, and we are as I said earlier in my HPE Next commentary is the fact that we are really refocusing Advisory and Professional Services in fewer countries so we can make big investments where we can drive the pull through above our software-defined infrastructure, our Intelligent Edge and the attach that goes with it.","So instead of being in 170 countries, we're going to be in fewer countries, and that work is well underway and that's the declining revenue that we saw in Q1. But as I said in my remarks, we see that inflection point to start happening in the second half of 2019.","Tarek, I'm not sure if you want to add anything on that.","Tarek Robbiati","Thank you, Antonio. I would simply add by highlighting the fact that under the umbrella of Pointnext, we have essentially two types of businesses. We have the Pointnext Operational Services business which is a maintenance business across all our installed base and our customers; and we have also the A&PS business which is by and large a consulting business that we run globally.","To answer your question Ashley most of the decline in revenue, was driven by A&PS and this is the fruit of decisions we made with respect to country exits. The order book on Pointnext Operational Services is working well.","We're very confident with the order levels that we've seen across Pointnext Operational Services and Nimble services in the quarter, and the book-to-revenue ratio, the book-to-bill ratio, the 110% is pointing to long-term revenue generation by this business unit.","Antonio Neri","The only thing I will add Ashley since you asked the question, remember one of the key components of that Operational Services portfolio is also HPE GreenLake, which grew double digits, and to give a size of that business for you to understand it, we already have more than 450 customers under that type of contract.","The TCV value of that over the period of time is already over $2 billion and this business is going to be close to $1 billion run rate business for us in year. So we are very excited about that because I made the comments in my remarks that it's the only on-prem true consumption-driven offering on the market.","Ashley Ellis","Thank you. That was very helpful. Maybe we could go further into that thing. Could you detail the margin profile between the operational business and the advisory business, and maybe how you see margin improving over time? And that is it from me. Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","I'm glad you're asking the question. So the richest margin revenue stream is Pointnext operating services. A&PS is a lower margin, but still very profitable for us compared to Operational Services.","Operator","The next question will be from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thanks for taking the question. This may be a difficult one for you to answer, but I wanted to see if you had some thoughts on why one of the other peers within the IT space has talked about weakness in January following a decent close to calendar 2018, and it sounds like your view on the overall IT spending trends are fairly stable and no particular weakness apart from some of the international challenges that are ongoing not new. Can you may be shed some light on why you might see the world differently?","Antonio Neri","Sure. I mean I'm going to comment for us not for the other vendors. Listen, from a macro perspective the demand remains steady, and obviously we continue to monitor the economic uncertainties driven by global trade and Brexit and others, but our demand was very steady throughout the quarter, and people ask me questions like the government shut down had an impact to the U.S. business, the answer is no, zero.","In fact, one of the elements of the portfolio we serve to the government is the high-performance compute, and I can tell you our high-performance compute in that segment in the government grew triple digits. When you ask me about Brexit, our business in U.K. grew double-digits, and in China we have an unique set up which Tarek made the comment about our joint venture with a Chinese partner in a company called new HPC.","We at this point in time, I always talk about this from the customer point of view, we see customers accelerating their digital transformation, I talk about all the time about the explosion of the data around that. That data is outpacing the compute power, but that compute is shifting. It's not just in the cloud. It's moving to the edge, and that's why I talk about the ability to provide the cloud computing at the edge, and that's why our edge computing platforms grew triple digits this quarter.","So we may have a different portfolio, and maybe we may have different focus on the segment, but we saw no slowdown in our demand in Q1, and that's why, together with our portfolio and our sound strategy, we are very confident to accelerate growth in revenue in Q2 and beyond, and that's why we also raised the EPS guidance.","Operator","The next question will be from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes, thank you. I just want to reconcile the increase in guidance with what appeared to be some non-operating benefits, so I'm hoping you can just correct me if I'm misspoken and then reconcile it.","So by my calculations, other income was a $0.045 benefit this quarter relative to your prior guidance. Tax rate now at 12% for the year is about a $0.02 benefit. So those two alone are $0.065 and you raised in guidance $0.05. Additionally, relative to my model, unallocated stock-based compensation was down $25 million year-over-year, that helped $0.02.","So if I add these three factors, it's $0.085 which are all effectively non-operating, and yet you're raising guidance by $0.05 despite the fact, they sound very positive on fundamentals. Am I misspeaking on any of the factors? And how do I reconcile that? And I have a follow-up please.","Tarek Robbiati","Yes. I think Toni your math doesn't work. The improvements in operating profit is driving the vast majority of the growth that is tend to be behind our guidance change. Yes, there is some benefits from tax, but the difference is not going to drive more than $0.01 and a little bit more potentially from our math.","The OI&E improvement is also a function of two things. There is the interest expense side that we are managing and keeping under control, and there's also dividends from China that we explained and continue to [indiscernible]. That is responsible for $0.01 or $0.02. On the whole, the real driver of operating performance is the expansion in gross margin.","We expanded gross margins 280 basis points year-over-year, and that is really the key acid test in my mind in the way we want to look at the business moving forward. With HPE Next also driving higher levels of efficiencies from an OPEC standpoint, and this is why you can see a pretty large improvement in overall operating margins which are now at 8.9% in Q1, up from 7. 3% in Q1 last year once you've normalized for the pension adjustment.","So it's 160 basis points improvement year-over-year in operating margin overall.","Toni Sacconaghi","Okay. Thank you, Tarek, maybe you can just provide updated guidance for interest and other, it was minus $250 million for the year, what's the updated guidance then? And then separately for my follow-up, edge compute did extremely well, that's new to the segment. So I'm trying to understand the growth trajectory of traditional compute.","So I think traditional compute was probably minus five or minus six, if we exclude edge compute, maybe you could help us with what server units grew and what server ASPs did in the quarter. Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","Okay. So let me take the first part of the question and I will ask Andy to shed some light on edge compute versus compute growth. And Antonio will add to that. Fair question on OI&E. We did -- and you're correct in guide at the SAM meeting at the Securities Analyst Meeting to a $250 million expense for the full year.","We don't give specific new guidance at this stage on this line item, but it's true that we did have some outperformance relative to what we guided on a full year basis in the course of Q1. And we expected to beat on the $250 million, but even if you were to think the $250 million in terms of overall EPS impact, the impact will be relatively small relative to the original guidance that we gave at SAM. Andy and Antonio?","Antonio Neri","Yes. So on the server side, Tony a couple of things, our value compute grew 20% in aggregate, and you saw some of the commentary around the software-defined infrastructure with hyperconverged growing 70% and high-performance compute growing 50%. And obviously we are an extended Tier one business right which that continues to be now a less of an impact for us, but if you look at the growth of compute overall it was minus 3, but if you excluded the Tier 1, it's plus 3%.","So we expect that headwind to continue to be less and less, because obviously we continue to deplete that specific segment. On the edge side, it's still relatively small in our overall basis, but we are very encouraged about the momentum because we're growing triple digits, and that will continue to be the case.","And the reason why that's the case Tony is because we see the growth of that cloud closer when the data is created, and we see new use cases in manufacturing, transportation and health care. And the embedded compute in those platforms plus the cloud closer where the data is a better economics for customers in many of the use cases.","So that's what we see today. From the AUP perspective, our AUP continue to grow, and that's a function of the fact that we said many times that two-third of the AUP is structural because as you know the commodity costing has been declining, and it takes longer time to pass that through, but the reality we continue to grow AUPs roughly 20% which is a function of what customers are buying which is configurations related to AI and big data analytics and other software-defined infrastructure.","So that's what we see Toni at this point in time.","Operator","The next question will be from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Katy Huberty","Thank you, good afternoon. Can I just come back to the guidance question, because you beat in the quarter by $0.07, you're raising by $0.05 which assumes that there is a $0.02 headwind that hits in the following quarters. Is that what is that headwind? Or are we thinking about that wrong? Is there just conservatism baked into the guidance? Then I have a follow-up.","Tarek Robbiati","All right, it's true, Katy, we beat by $0.07 and we gave back $0.05 by way of guiding guidance improvement. This is only Q1, we have three quarters to go, we want to accelerate growth and give me $0.02 to be able to do that.","Katy Huberty","Okay. And then as a follow-up, R&D as you mentioned is up strong double digits year-on-year. Can you just talk through the projects that are receiving the most incremental investment? Is that all going to the Intelligent Edge investment over multiple years that you've talked about, or are there other areas of the business where you are seeing a significant step up in investment? Thanks.","Antonio Neri","Sure Katy. So one point I want to make on the previous question is the fact listen we need to manage the Company for the long term, and obviously we continue to accelerate investment where we see the opportunity to grow and deliver shareholder value.","So to Tarek's point this is just Q1 and we see opportunity to accelerate some investments. To that question that Toni asked the Intelligent Edge is absolutely an area that we continue to invest. And you saw in the numbers right, that we are growing, but also reinvested significantly back into the business.","And in that think about the connectivity aspect of this as 5G comes online, there is an opportunity to integrate 5G into the overall control plane and data plane that will provide customers within Aruba platforms. Think about the cloud computing and the edge we talked earlier, and then in the core business right for us it's all about software embedded in our solutions because customers want a workload-optimized solution on prem that they can connect to a cloud in a very efficient way.","And all of that is going through software, and as you think about that is the private cloud on premises with the right consumption model, with the right simple aspects of the experience to provision and manage that infrastructure? And we feel very good about that.","That's why Synergy is a billion-dollar run rate business for us. And when you think about Synergy 95% of that business or the platform is software. That's why HPE OneView now is the foundation to deliver that composable cloud and the hybrid cloud vision, and that's why there's already more than 1 million licenses deployed.","So think about core, all about software AI, machine learning to automate everything and to make that Hybrid IT experience simple, and on the edge really the edge compute connectivity and security, and obviously services, services for us is very, very significant and the consumption model is one aspect of that.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet.","Jeff Kvaal","I'm afraid I'm going to have to start with clarifying that guidance one step further. And that is if I'm interpreting your remarks correctly the gross margin improvement that you've got in this quarter is sustainable. But you may choose to increase your OpEx a little bit more to pursue some of these growth opportunities and that's why the full year guidance isn't going up. Is that right?","Tarek Robbiati","No. Jeff look the gross margin improvement of 280 basis points is sustainable. But in my speech I've explained the sources of that improvement which have to do with supply chain efficiencies improvement such as logistics cost manufacturing overhead cost reductions and also to a much lesser extent the improvement in commodities cost.","The mix is the fundamental point that drives the improvement in gross margins. It's not just the cost of sales but the mix of the revenue drives the improvement in gross margins. This has caused us to beat guidance in this quarter by $0.07. This is the first quarter of the fiscal year. We see potential. I talked to many customers to continue to grow and accelerate growth starting Q2. And so we are going to make a limited amount of investments to go and pursue that growth moving forward.","Antonio Neri","And to be clear that investment is again in the areas I talked earlier before is all about accelerating innovation accelerating innovation based on the customer feedback which feedback i s our strategy is sound and is resonating with them. Our HPE Next actually gives us the operating leverage together with our mix shift to make some of those choices.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay that makes so much sense. And your gross margin commentary Tarek what's clear is it's more of an OpEx question. And I also ask on the Aruba side of things your product seems like you got some new products 11ax upgrade. Should we expect that to bring Aruba back towards a more traditional growth rates in next quarter or over a series of quarters? Or how should we think about that?","Antonio Neri","Yes absolutely. We are incredibly excited about the new offering that Aruba brought to market here Aruba 510 access point that to your point now are going to deliver this new experience with the 802.11ax which improves bandwidth and improve the overall experience. As you know Aruba is the software platform that provides a mobile-first cloud-first approach. And these access points are actually going to enhance those experiences. And the 8225 switches are the next iteration of programmable switches that ultimately take advantage of these newer capabilities and we expect that to accelerate growth.","Listen the Aruba portfolio the wireless LAN grew double digits and that's great. But as you know when customers see this new technology they also want to take advantage of it. And also in the United States you have programs like and all those that come to play. And so I know there was another question before that didn't come up but since I'm here I'm going to answer proactively.","It was the Q4 deals have an impact to the Q1? The answer is no. It's just normal seasonality and our bookings and Aruba products are incredibly strong. So this is just about converting the bookings to revenue and then take advantage of these new offerings which are super super bullish.","Operator","Next question will be from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs.","Rod Hall","I just wanted to come back to the AUP comment. I think you had said that AUP is up about 20% for service and I wonder if you can give us the other side of that equation the unit decline number. And then I have a follow-up and that relates to that geographical revenues in the guidance. We see this big deterioration in Asia Pacific which you called out as China. I wonder if you could talk about whether that in your estimation is declining further? Or whether that's relatively stable at this point. And maybe simultaneously at EMEA if you could just comment on what you think forward trends look like there.","Tarek Robbiati","Sure Rod. I'll take a quick grab at the units and AUP question. So as Antonio mentioned AUPs were up again about 20% or so this quarter. And so you can kind of back into the unit numbers that they were down similar to what we saw last quarter. So no major change in the dynamic because obviously compute excluding Tier 1 grew 3%. So I think the important thing that Antonio mentioned was we've got enough structural AUP uplift to continue to drive overall growth in core compute. So no major change from that dynamic perspective. And maybe Antonio I'll let you take the","Antonio Neri","Yes I don't want to make a comment on that because remember the units that have been declining is the units that have no attach to Pointnext. That's what I really want to emphasize versus the units are growing are the ones that drive the attach to Pointnext Operational Services which are they're value units whether it's high performance compute or hyperconverged and others. And that's why those businesses that are growing whether they're growing 50% or 70% with AUP of increase of 20%.","The reality is that drives the night attach and that's why our book-to-bill ratio was 110% and that's why our Operational Services business grew as well. So that's why I want to emphasize that because they two hand-in-hand versus the volume commoditized which is a big churcn for the unit decline was the Tier one and no implication to Pointnext.","In terms of China as I said before we have a unique setup there. But Asia Pacific without China grew again and that's what is important and it grew double digits. But in China because we are set up they have a combination of a portfolio of HPE products and Chinese products.","As you can imagine selling in that market is not linear in uniform because when you saw the government right they would like you have more Chinese products versus selling in the traditional commercial space. But in the end we don't are not concerned at all because in the end we have a 49% stake that delivers very nice dividends.","And we are driving that upside together with our shareholders because we pass those dividends to our shareholders. And so I want the community to understand that that business as a whole is growing but the mix within that business is shifting. But the reality is we pass the benefit of that growing business to the dividend side.","Tarek Robbiati","Yes. If I can just at a commentary on this one because it's really important to understand our setup in China. Look most companies who set up a business in China most Western companies typically set it up with a special purpose and they call the Chinese partner and both parties put their assets and know how to work with a joint venture to succeed.","Very few players across all sectors have a 49% stake in the substantial operational China. We do. If you really want to look more at our Chinese business you have to refer back to the parent company UNIX which is listed in China and see how much of the profit of our HPE joint venture contributes to the total profit pool of UNIX. So the setup for us is optimal and what we're trying to do is to manage the operations as Antonio said through the mix of products to maximize profits and dividend payouts.","Rod Hall","And maybe a comment in Europe?","Tarek Robbiati","Yes. Europe was actually the best-performing region I would say. when you think about that. And we have very strong growth in many of the geos within Europe. I mean I made a comment about Brexit early on that our U.K. business grew double digits. So France, so Germany. We are very strong momentum in Europe.","And I think our portfolio considering how business is done there and how customers adopt new technologies is incredibly suited for that market. So overall we are very pleased with Europe. They grew 3% year-over-year. And then that you have others in the Central European countries that I talked about our Advisory and Professional Services. But the core business and the Operational Services business grew very nicely. And we see an expansion with Aruba too. ","Operator","It will be Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital.","Ananda Baruah","Look congrats on a solid quarter. Hey just going back to the revenue acceleration commentary you guys mentioned revenue acceleration coming starting in the second quarter a handful of times across a handful of segments using a handful of contacts. I know the growth kind of forecast for the fiscal year was really just for growth.","But I would love c ontext you probably all would just on how you want us to sort of think about revenue acceleration because that will sort of suggest something greater than just nominal growth. And so how should we think about that? It also sounds like you're talking about investing in the upcoming growth opportunities too. I think the word amplified was used as well. So any context there would be fantastic.","Tarek Robbiati","Okay. Let me try and add a little bit of color for all of you to understand this point. We did say and we guided that we would be growing revenue for the full year. There is no change to that. However there were a couple of dynamics that we also flagged to you. Number one currency. We still expect a 1% to 2% of headwind from currency. It's closer to 2% rather than 1%. and there's also good Tier one dynamic. The Tier one revenue decline has diluted our growth profile.","What gave us now more confidence that we can grow as of Q2 is because we have seen the Tier one decline being sharper than what we originally anticipated which reduces the dilution effect for the subsequent quarters. And that's why we made a commentary overall that we can see acceleration of revenue from Q2 Q3 and Q4. And finally and most importantly what really is driving this level of confidence is all the discussions we're having with our customers who are reiterating that their plans continue at pace. And that's why we qualified the macro environment by saying it is steady.","Antonio Neri","I will add one thing to that point here is that we see again the explosion of the data as a driver to drive growth. Our high-performance compute portfolio is best in class and we see the momentum accelerating. Aruba will continue to accelerate starting Q2 and beyond because of new offerings and also because how demand shapes throughout the year. And obviously our software-defined portfolio clearly is resonating with customers.","That together with the comments that Tarek made about the Tier 1 we actually very very confident that our Q2 and beyond our revenue will accelerate from the current levels. And that's why together with our mix and together with our cost disciplined execution we are confident to raise the guidance. And as I said in my comments I think there are more opportunities here to continue to drive that shareholder value.","And again our innovation is the best we ever had. The employee morale in the company is the best we've ever had. We just moved to a new headquarters here which is phenomenal. And we are winning in key segment of the markets where we decide to focus on. So that gives us the confidence that we can accelerate revenue.","Ananda Baruah","And just a real quick follow-up. That does that hold to your channel business as well which is a significant portion of your revenue? You mentioned enterprise. You gave some enterprise context earlier but for your channel business as well.","Antonio Neri","Yes absolutely because if the channel doesn't grow we can't grow. So 70% of our business in the core Hybrid IT and up to 90% in Aruba are all driven by the channel. And in fact the more I will be talking to the channel partners about our momentum and our innovation to all the key seals in there with us. So they like unpredictable channel program so they can understand how to make money with us. But ultimately they like our portfolio to serve our customers better. So our sellout in the channel has grown double digits and that's why we are confident.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you Ananda. And thank you everyone else for joining the call today.

As mentioned, the earnings presentation can be found posted to our website and it is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call.","With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.","Antonio Neri","Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We have just closed a very successful fiscal year 2019 at HPE marked by strong and consistent performance across the company. We did what we said we would do this year and built on our track record of delivering on our promise since I became CEO almost two years ago.","In fiscal year 2019, we realized the benefits of a more streamlined and focused company and we executed with discipline. We've made organic investments and targeted acquisitions to shift our portfolio to higher-value, higher-margin offerings. And we made our culture a priority, which has resulted in an 18-point increase in our employee engagement score over the last three years.","This reenergized, high-performing team is committed to accelerating what is next for customers and partners. Through these efforts, we improved profitability across the business and significantly exceeded our original non-GAAP earnings and free cash flow guidance.","Let's take a closer look at our full fiscal year financial results. Revenue has been stable sequentially the last three quarters with total revenue of $29 billion for fiscal year 2019, down 2% year-over-year when adjusted for Tier 1 and currency. Revenue was impacted by our deliberate action to realign our portfolio as we continue to exit the lower margin Tier 1 server business as well as certain macroeconomic factors.","In key areas of strategic investment, we saw strong double-digit growth and reported record revenue for the year in high-performance compute, Hyperconverged Infrastructure, and Composable Cloud. We also continued to see very strong growth in HPE GreenLake orders.","I am pleased to report our first annualized revenue run rate of $462 million consistent with the outlook we provided at our Security Analyst Meeting last month. This metric is to help investors track our progress and better value the recurring and higher-margin benefits as we shift our model to as a service.","Our non-GAAP gross margin of 32.6% improved 270 basis points year-over-year. This is a key metric because it demonstrates our success transition into higher-margin and recurring revenue. Our non-GAAP operating profit of $2.8 billion grew 4% year-over-year.","We delivered fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.77, an improvement of 20% year-over-year and well above our original and revised guidance. We improved the quality and quantity of our free cash flow, generating $1.7 billion, which represent growth of 58% year-over-year, even after $668 million arbitration award payment to DXC. These strong results allow us to make significant investments in our R&D spending, which was up 10% year-over-year.","And as I committed in early 2018, we completed our plan to return $7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends over fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. Our consistent and strong performance in fiscal year 2019 has laid the foundation for the next phase of HPE's journey. HPE is the edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service company, and we will execute our strategic pivot to offering our entire portfolio as a service by 2022 as we drive sustainable, profitable growth.","Before providing an overview of our business segment performance, I want to note that our view on the macro economy has not materially changed. Ongoing global trade tensions and other geopolitical factors have created uncertainty that contributes to an uneven demand environment. The elongation of sales cycles we experienced since Q2 continues, particularly in larger deals. But against this backdrop, we are confident we have the right strategy that anticipates our customer needs.","We live in an edge-to-cloud world. We have gone from simply having a data center to having centers of data everywhere. Data has tremendous value and is critical to our customer success. They need a technology partner that has the expertise, the tools, and a flexible delivery model to help them harness the power of their data across all their clouds and edges.","HPE is uniquely positioned to meet these needs and provide a consistent cloud-like experience for apps and data everywhere. Our edge-to-cloud platform delivered as a service gives customers the ultimate in choice and flexibility and control to all their apps and data no matter where they live, so we can deliver outcomes for their businesses.","To highlight the full-year performance in our business segments, I will start with Intelligent Edge, which delivered revenue of $2.8 billion, down 2% year-over-year. As we have said previously, we identified some execution issues in North America early this year that impacted revenue, and we have been actively addressing them through both new leadership and segmentation initiatives.","I am particularly pleased with the traction in Aruba Services, up 18% in fiscal year 2019, which will contribute to driving profitable growth in the future. Throughout the year, we made substantial R&D and sales investments in our Intelligent Edge business. I am excited about the differentiation we are continuing to build in our portfolio.","We developed new products to expand our reach with new customer segments, including the launch of Aruba Instant On, which targets the growing SMB segment, and we have made enhancement to Aruba Central, which is at the heart of our edge-to-cloud platform. It is the only cloud-native, simple-to-use platform that unifies network management, AI-powered insight, and IoT device security for wire, wireless, and WAN networks.","In Q4, we launched our revolutionary new CX series switching portfolio. This is the industry's first services-rich networking portfolio designed specifically for today's modern enterprise campus branch and edge data center. It is cloud-ready, easily deployed and simple to manage. This new networking portfolio also lays the intelligent foundation required for future AI-powered automation.","We are seeing traction in the fast-growing and competitive Wi-Fi 6 enterprise access point market. In September, industry analysts showed Aruba taking an early market lead position in delivering Wi-Fi 6 infrastructure. Our Aruba 8000 Series core switches that run our advanced operating system, ArubaOS-CX attracted more than 80 new logos per month, and we continue to see new customers turn into Aruba solutions to provide unique and better experiences to their employees and customers at the edge.","Recent examples include the Kentucky Administrative Office of Courts, who was looking for a solution to manage the evolving demands of a digital workplace in the network of 120 courtrooms. Critical to their decision was Aruba Central for its single pane of glass and Aruba ClearPass security to increase visibility and control of the network.","U.S. supermarket chain, Giant Eagle, selected Aruba switches and the Aruba AirWave network management platform to minimize business latency, optimize operational manageability and rollout services quickly to help the IT staff become more proactive. And Carnegie Mellon University purchased Aruba Meridian location services platform in conjunction with AppMaker to help them build their smartphone app with wave-finding services.","Eventually, this deployment will cover the entire 5 million square foot campus, serving 14,500 students and 3,000 faculty as well as campus visitors. More and more enterprises are understanding how critical Intelligent Edge is to their digital transformations. Business outcomes will depend on the experiences they can deliver at the edge.","HPE declared the opportunity of the edge early on, and we continue to make important investments and enhancement to our portfolio and execution to deliver differentiated capabilities and solutions.","Turning to Hybrid IT. Our investment in higher-value products and as a service offerings is paying off. Our operating profit of 12.3% for the year was up 210 basis points from fiscal year 2018. Revenue of $22.8 billion was down 3% when adjusted for Tier 1 and currency.","Importantly, we saw strong double-digit performance in key areas of the business. High Performance Compute grew 15% in the full-year, Composable Cloud grew 47% and Hyperconverged Infrastructure grew 25%. And also this year, HPE Apollo and HPE Synergy each achieved more than a $1 billion in revenue for the first time.","HPE GreenLake continues to be one of our fastest-growing businesses. Orders were up 39% in constant currency in fiscal year 2019. Our ability to deliver a consistent cloud-like experience on and off-premises as a service with HPE GreenLake is a key competitive advantage for HPE. We saw over 200% GreenLake order growth year-over-year in the channel. Our partners are an important extension of our own sales and technical teams, and they are a powerful force in driving growth.","At our Security Analyst Meeting last month, I previewed next generation of our as a service offering. We want to enable our customers to be the broker of services to their enterprise by giving them visibility, access and control across public, private and edge workloads. Stay tuned for a very exciting announcement in early December.","HPE Pointnext services orders including Nimble orders grew 1% in fiscal year 2019. Going forward, our favorable shift to higher value solutions should continue to drive service intensity with higher services attach rates. In our Composable Cloud portfolio, earlier this month, we integrated HPE Primera, our intelligent storage platform with HPE Synergy and HPE Composable Rack, accelerated speed and agility to deliver new apps and innovations to propel customers businesses.","Just last week, we unveiled our new HPE Container Platform. HPE is the first and only vendor to provide a Kubernetes-based container platform that can support the deployment of any enterprise application, whether it was developed as a cloud native or as a virtualized enterprise application.","The platform is built on our BlueData container-based software platform with a new open-source Kubernetes orchestration engine and integration with MapR's unique file system that can provide persistent data, addressing a key challenge in Kubernetes. ","And in our high performance compute business, just last week, we announced the industry's most comprehensive HPC and AI portfolio for the exascale area with a combination of HPE and Cray. We are proud that 21 of the 50 largest systems on the top 500 supercomputer list are now HPE and Cray systems.","Against a tougher market backdrop, storage experienced a modest revenue decline of 2%. However, we continued momentum in key strategic areas, HPE Nimble reported record revenues, up 35% in constant currency for the year.","Finally, no matter what stack our customers choose, we want to differentiate the hybrid cloud experience with the right software-defined innovation tools. Customers are looking for a simplified and automated experience. This is why we took steps to embed HPE InfoSight, our cloud-based AI operations platform across our workload optimized portfolio that includes Simplivity, 3 PAR, ProLiant, Synergy and Apollo.","Here are a few examples of how customers are putting our technology to use to drive key business outcomes. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, a state-owned enterprise of India has selected our storage technology paired with HPE GreenLake to help them manage their critical data with consumption-based services.","Previously, they have been grappling with rightsizing their infrastructure for unpredictable data growth. However, now as one of our largest HPE GreenLake customers, they will be able to flexibly adjust capacity without over-provisioning.","Since 2017, we have been working with the EPFL Blue Brain Project, a Swiss brain research initiative that is focused on building a biologically detailed digital reconstruction and simulation of the mouse brain. As the Blue Brain Project has progressed in their scientific roadmap in neuroscience research modeling large and larger brain regions, they have needed to exponentially increase compute power, which they are now doing with a major new upgrade of 880 HPE SGI Apollo 8600 notes.","Turning to HPE Financial Services. Fiscal year revenue of $3.6 billion is flat when adjusted for currency, while operating profits increased 70 basis points. HPEFS best-in-class loss ratios drove a strong return on equity of 16%. HPEFS serves as the financial engine behind our as a service offering, giving customers flexibility in how they consume their IT solutions by bringing our robust balance sheet with over $13 billion of net portfolio assets.","HPEFS saw strong double-digit growth in its as a service revenue this year. HPEFS differentiates our value proposition is strategic to our customers as it helps them manage and monetize their existing assets in new ways. HPEFS plays a major role in helping customers achieve their sustainability goals by promoting the circular economy with its best-in-class asset management business.","In summary, I am very pleased with our performance in fiscal year 2019. I remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results in fiscal year 2020 as we continue to shift our portfolio to higher-value, software-defined solutions and execute our pivot to offering everything as a service by 2022 to deliver our edge-to-cloud platform, which will drive sustainable, profitable growth.","I'm confident because we have spent the past two years sharpening our focus, never losing sight of our customers and partners and executing with discipline. We've built a world-class leadership team that has reinvigorated our culture and is bring customer-driven innovation to market through our own R&D and through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.","We have the right strategy that will enable us to deliver exceptional edge-to-cloud experiences for our customers that are unmatched in the industry. This is an exciting place to be as we begin the new year.","With that, I will turn it over to Tarek to walk you through our results in more detail.","Tarek Robbiati","Thank you very much, Antonio. Now let me provide you more detail on our financial results for the quarter and the full-year 2019. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to better highlight our performance in the fourth quarter and our fiscal year.","Starting with Slides 1 to 3, I'd like to first talk about the key highlights for the full-year 2019. In fiscal year 2019, we continue to pivot our portfolio towards higher margin and more recurring revenue that will lay the foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in the future. We've executed on our strategy with great discipline and despite an uneven macro environment, we maintained sequentially stable revenue for the last three quarters.","And we did this while significantly expanding non-GAAP gross margins, which improved by 270 basis points this year, driven primarily by structural improvements including product mix and cost of sales efficiencies. Our gross margin improvements have enabled us to make further investments in the business, while simultaneously delivering growth in non-GAAP operating profit.","The combination of margin expansion and below the line benefits including share buybacks, resulted in diluted non-GAAP EPS of $1.77, which is up 20% year-over-year and well above our original outlook of $1.51 to $1.61 provided at SAM in October 2018.","On the cash front, we generated significantly higher levels of free cash flow this fiscal year of $1.7 billion, which was up 58% compared to the prior year. I'll talk more about that later in the presentation.","On the acquisition front, we successfully closed the Cray transaction in September, well ahead of schedule. While the financial impacts of Cray were minimal in fiscal year 2019, we expect to derive more material benefits in fiscal year 2020 and beyond.","Finally, we also delivered on our capital returns program commitment over fiscal year 2018 and 2019 returning $7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends per our original commitment made in early 2018.","Now turning to Slide 4 for the quarter results. We finished the quarter with non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.49, which was above our previously provided outlook of $0.43 to $0.47 and up 14% from the prior year. GAAP diluted net EPS for the quarter was $0.36 above the previously provided outlook of $0.24 to $0.28 primarily due to the benefits from the termination of a Tax Matter Agreement with HP, Inc. that was established at the time of the separation.","Moving onto a macro view of the business on Slide 5. As Antonio mentioned, our view of the macroeconomic environment remains largely unchanged with uneven demand. Trade tensions and geopolitical factors continue to cause business uncertainty, particularly in larger enterprise deals similar to what we called out during the prior two quarters. However HPE's broad portfolio and global footprint makes us well diversified to handle choppy markets, which has enabled us to stabilize revenue in the last three quarters.","We will now move to Slide 6 that shows our performance in the quarter by segment. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge, we've made sales leadership changes and introduced new segmentation to improve our go-to-market execution. We believe the Edge remains the next big opportunity, which is why we've continued to make significant R&D and sales investments, despite pressuring near-term profitability.","We now have an enhanced go-to-market and a full suite of differentiated solutions that can also be consumed as a service. Going forward, we are expecting a meaningful improvement in profitability as these investments begin yielding benefits and revenue returns to growth as fiscal year 2020 progresses.","In Hybrid IT, we continue to grow our higher-margin compute offerings with Composable Cloud growing at 21%, reaching a record level of $1 billion in annual revenues this year and our Apollo offerings, which power the high performance compute portfolio also reaching a record $1 billion in annual revenues. These organically developed offerings demonstrate the strength of our innovation engine.","With respect to units, excluding Tier 1 and China, our server units have been growing sequentially since Q2 of fiscal year 2019 and were up year-over-year. Within storage, we continued making great strides in the entry level and mid-range storage markets with notable strength in Nimble Storage, which grew 2%. Hyperconverged Infrastructure, which will be reported in storage starting the next quarter, grew at 14%.","In our services business, Pointnext operational services orders including Nimble orders were flat this quarter, but up 1% on a full-year basis in constant currency. Our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per unit was up across all hardware categories this quarter. Services intensity reached record levels in value compute and storage, which were both up over 20% year-over-year. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to improve.","GreenLake orders, which have 100% services attach rates, grew by an impressive 72% year-over-year to record levels demonstrating strong execution in pivoting to our as a service offerings.","Within HPE Financial Services, we expanded our net portfolio of assets which was up 1% in constant currency this quarter, with longer contract term supporting GreenLake and we maintained a strong return on equity which exceeded 15% again this quarter.","And while not shown on the slide, Communications and Media Solutions or CMS is a strategically important business providing software capabilities to telcos, which is showing improved momentum. Orders in CMS were up 17% year-over-year due to improved execution selling software licenses. We are excited about the opportunity for CMS to collaborate across all businesses to capitalize on the 5G momentum and growth opportunity with service providers.","Slide 7 shows our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.49 in Q4 is well above our previously provided outlook of $0.43 to $0.47 due to operational outperformance and favorable other income and expense. This marks the 10th quarter in a row that we have exceeded the high-end of our non-GAAP quarterly outlook.","As a reminder, we ended fiscal year 2017 with a non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $0.94. Based on our fiscal year 2019 diluted non-GAAP EPS performance of $1.77, we have demonstrated tremendous progress in non-GAAP EPS, which has grown by over 88% in the last two years. We have been able to achieve this through significant expansion of gross margin and operating margins, which I will talk about next.","Turning to gross margins on Slide 8. We continue to deliver significant year-over-year gross margin expansion as we focus on profitable growth in Hybrid IT, shifting our portfolio towards higher-value, higher gross margin offerings and more recent commodity tailwinds.","Non-GAAP gross margins of 33.3% was up 260 basis points year-over-year and up 500 basis points since Q1 of fiscal year 2018. This has been possible through a combination of portfolio mix shift, HPE Next initiatives and commodity tailwinds.","Now moving to Slide 9. We continue to make significant investments in R&D and sales to support future revenue growth, while driving significant non-GAAP operating margin expansion. HPE Next has enabled us to redirect investments back into the business, including a double-digit increase this year in R&D to drive organic innovation in our higher margin, faster growth areas of the portfolio and additional investments in go-to market through improved sales effectiveness.","We expect to drive revenue productivity and growth in the upcoming quarters from these strategic investments. Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating margins has climbed over 10%, up 290 basis points versus Q1 2018.","Turning to cash flow on Slide 10. Free cash flow was seasonally very strong at $878 million in Q4. On a full-year basis, we generated significantly higher levels of free cash flow of $1.7 billion that is up over $600 million or 58% versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher profitability and lower HPE Next payments. Underpinning our year-to-date free cash flow performance is an improvement of over $1 billion or 35% in our cash flow from operations relative to last year.","It is important to note that in the $1.7 billion figure, we absorbed the unexpected arbitration payment of $668 million made to DXC. We also had a $200 million benefit from terminating the Tax Matter Agreement with HP, Inc. Most importantly, even without the payment from HP, Inc., we would have been at the midpoint of our original FY 2019 guide of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.","Looking forward into fiscal year 2020, it is important to consider some puts and takes as you model out free cash flow. We expect cash earnings will increase with growing profitability and we expect to receive another charge of $50 million from HP, Inc. related to the termination of the Tax Matters Agreement.","We will also need to make capital investments in our as a service offerings and make integration payments related to Cray that will drive future revenue and profit growth. As a result, we continue to expect fiscal year 2020 free cash flow to be between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion.","Slide 11 shows the ARR slide I had discussed at our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. Please reference the SAM presentation for a deep dive into what makes up the ARR. Our Q4 2019 ARR actuals came in line with our guidance at SAM at $462 million. Looking forward, we feel confident we can achieve our growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2022.","Slide 12 shows our capital returns to-date. We returned $431 million to shareholders during the quarter. We paid $147 million in dividends and repurchased $284 million worth of shares in the quarter.","At this point, we have completed our $7 billion capital returns program over fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019, returning $4.1 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2019. It is also important to note that we have also recently raised our dividend payment from $0.1125 per share to $0.12 per share, an increase of 7%.","Now turning to our outlook on Slide 13. At our recent Securities Analyst meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year 2020. I would encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook.","Having said that let me reiterate a few key points of our outlook. From a topline perspective, we expect to grow our fiscal year 2020 revenue adjusted for currency fluctuations. Also we expect to grow our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP operating profit by 4% to 6%.","Consequently, we expect fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be a $1.78 to $1.94 and fiscal year 2020 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be a $1.01 to $1.17. For Q1, 2020, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $0.20 to $0.24 per share and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42 to $0.46 per share.","Overall, I'm very pleased with the performance in the quarter and the fiscal year 2019. We have successfully demonstrated that our business is resilient to macro softness and can generate substantial amounts of free cash flow.","We have the right strategy and have laid a strong foundation for the years to come. We will continue to shift our portfolio to higher margin software defined solutions and focus on delivering our edge-to-cloud platform offering our full portfolio as a service by 2022. This will ultimately drive sustainable profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long-term.","Now with that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kathryn Huberty","Thank you. Good afternoon. As we look into the January quarter, do you have any thoughts around the revenue trajectory? Just looking at street expectations for a revenue increase of 2% to 3% from the October quarter, but since the spin from HP, there isn't a consistent seasonality and in fact, revenues have been flat to down in past January quarters?","Tarek Robbiati","Hi, Katy. Good afternoon. It's Tarek here. So, as a broad reminder on fiscal year 2020, we do expect to grow revenue adjusted for currency overall. Now when you specifically get into the Q1 of fiscal year 2020, you have two effects to take into consideration.","Number one, the reality that we're operating in is different than one it was in fiscal year 2018 owing to the macro environment. Number two, we will consolidate the contribution of revenue from Cray in full for the first quarter.","So, on the whole, we do expect within the context of what I mentioned and with seasonality that we will grow revenue for the full-year, and on a first quarter basis will be roughly flat sequentially relative to where we stand right now.","Kathryn Huberty","Okay, that's helpful. And Tarek, how should we think about the contribution from lower commodity costs on gross margin of the 260 basis point gross margin expansion? How much of that would you say is from commodity costs? Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","Yes. So far, as we explained at SAM and even in prior earnings releases, some of the gross margin expansion is structural in nature as a result of the products and the mix of what we sell, and the remainder is driven by commodities. So, I would say 50\/50 is the rough split between what is structural and mix related on one side versus commodities on the other.","We feel that the commodities environment is probably at best it could be right now and is going to continue for a little bit. The question is how long will that be continuing for. We do believe that the profitability level that we are experiencing right now are there to stay for at least couple of quarters.","Antonio Neri","And I will Katy, couple of things. One thing I am pleased is our discipline with pricing. I think the team has done a very good job, despite the changes in commodity price and to drive the right configuration for the right workloads and the right pricing, which as you can see, we have achieved what I believe a record year of profitability in the Hybrid IT business.","But as we talked before, the structural changes continue to be there because obviously the systems with more IP built into it, particularly with software defined as well as the configuration for density and more data kind of driven type of configurations give us the confidence on that AUP stability as we go along.","Tarek Robbiati","Great. Thank you, Katy. I appreciate it. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could just comment on the demand in macro environment. I know you use the term stable a lot in terms of revenue stability. But if we look at the metrics that you like to use most, which is, I think the most accurate which is ex-Tier 1 at constant currency, it's gone from plus 1 in Q2 to minus 3 in Q3 to minus 7 in Q4, and the comparisons are really not all that different and if anything you had a bit of Cray this quarter?","And so at least on the surface, it appears as though the macro environment might be becoming more challenging and you've had a number of other enterprise players suggest that. So perhaps you can provide us with an update on the macro environment, and if you do believe it's relatively stable then why are we seeing this deceleration in revenue trajectory? And I have a follow-up, please.","Antonio Neri","Sure. Thanks, Toni for the question. As I said our macro economy view has not changed \u2013 materially changed from Q2 since we started talking about this, but I will say, Toni there has been two halves here.","The first half, obviously, coming in from a strong 2018 with inflationary commodity costs. Obviously, Tarek can talk a little bit more about the tax reform and what that did, and in some pent up demand on some modernization that needs to take place because of digital transformation.","And then the second half, more driven by the tariff situation with the global trade, some geopolitical instability and then the deflationary side of the commodities. We saw unit increase in Q4 of 2%. So, I think, listen, the elongated sales cycles continue to be there. We believe the demand is there. It's just a matter of timing in many ways, and obviously customers are looking at where to spend the dollars. And I would say a lot of dollars are spent to make sure they can harness the power of the data as fast as possible because that's the value of doing this.","But obviously, if we stay in this environment, there will be always a little bit more questions out there. So hopefully, we're going to get the result one way or the other one. But I am still very hopeful about the future because obviously this digital transformation continues to be there and continue to accelerate, and the data continues to explode about around that 7. Tarek, do you have any additional comment on that?","Tarek Robbiati","Yes. Thank you, Antonio. I'd like to add some comments on the impact that tax reform has had on the industry. We've done a fair bit of work on this internally, and there is no doubt that the fiscal year 2018 was propelled by the benefits from tax reform, i.e. there was more disposable income for large corporates worldwide to be spent on infrastructure, and that has happened \u2013 that carried on pretty nicely all the way on to the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.","Beyond that point, there was a drop due to macroeconomic factors, but also we do believe that there is an element where the spend that was taking place in fiscal year 2019 has to be digested by the companies moving forward. So, in simple terms, I'd say the tide has come down in fiscal year 2019 relative to fiscal year 2018, and that digestion is taking place.","So year-over-year compares, which give rise to the calculations you've \u2013 you put forward, Toni. By the way, your calculations are correct. The year-over-year compares are lesser and less relevant in the context where you do have to assume that this infrastructure is to be digested.","And what's important for us is to see that the revenue remaining stable should bode well for the future as continuous demand for data will get to a point where that capacity that has been essentially consumed in fiscal year 2018 will be needing to be refreshed in the upcoming quarters. So hopefully that provides you with a color on the year-over-year comparison.","Antonio Neri","And I will say, Toni, one more thing is that our revenue for the last quarter has been stable. So despite all of this, our revenue would be stable for three consecutive quarters.","Toni Sacconaghi","Thank you for that \u2013 I know you've made some very conscious decisions about exiting Tier 1 and focusing on higher value products. But just on a reported basis, your revenue is down $1.7 billion or about 6%, and so the question is, in light of a smaller topline, do you have to sort of take out incremental costs because you have a lower revenue base and how do we think about that like as HPE all done or is there more?","Do you feel you need to take out more cost and certainly at least in this quarter, you seem to have very tight control over OpEx even R&D, which have been growing all year seem to have come down this quarter, despite Cray?","So maybe you can comment on in light of a top line albeit somewhat driven by your own decisions being down, whether you need to take out incremental cost and how specifically you're thinking about OpEx and whether Q4 was really a sign of what we should expect going forward?","Tarek Robbiati","Sure. So like Antonio said, Toni, the revenue for us was stable hovering above the $7.2 billion mark for Q2, Q3 and Q4. What's interesting in this is the underlying profitability of the revenue has materially improved as a result of some actions that we have taken shifting the mixed structural improvements in the products, et cetera.","So the underlying EPS and you could see it also from an operating cash flow standpoint has been improving materially, although the revenue is stable. So EPS for Q2, we were at $0.42, for Q3, we were at $0.45 and for Q4 we were at $0.49. So we are extracting more and more value over a revenue base that is stable.","In saying that, we are not going to cut costs materially to propel our EPS forward in fiscal year 2020. The reason is, we do believe that we have to continue to make the investments in R&D in the key strategic areas of our business, the Edge being one of them. The second one storage as well and you'll see more and more of that in the upcoming quarters.","There is always an element of having to apply cost discipline and that is normal in the context of any company and should be expected. We feel that it's important that we stay relatively Nimble in our thinking and on inflate our cost base, too much. But the underlying fundamental trends of data are there and they're playing.","That's why we are investing quite significant amounts of dollars in R&Ds in the right category and the performance of our Edge business this year, if you really look at it and what has driven it in the detail, a lot of the underlying operating profit performance is driven by those R&D and FSC investments that we have made to pivot the business to growth in the upcoming quarters.","Antonio Neri","So Toni, I will add a couple of things. First of all, if you're asking the question there will be a separate cost reduction program again? No. We are executing our HPE Next. This is the year three, and we are super, super pleased with the outcome and we expect to continue to derive productivity from what we have done in the previous two years. Understand there is one more year to go here, which will complete the program.","But as Tarek said, we will always look for opportunities to improve the productivity of the business by improving the way we engage customers and partners, and obviously we still need to get a lot of the benefits of the investment we've made in IT.","This year, we invested plus 10% when you look at the year as a whole, plus 10% growth in R&D and FSC and that will also drive productivity in term of growth in the key strategic areas that we're looking for.","So we are very proud and pleased with the work we have done and I think we have still a disciplined mentality here to continue to be very, very rigorous about our approach, but I want to make clear that there is no one-off program here, we already have done what we needed to do and that becomes now part of the DNA of the company going forward.","Toni Sacconaghi","Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","Great. Thanks, Toni. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Shannon Cross","Thank you. Can you provide more details on the performance and storage this quarter? If you can talk pricing and demand competition, just wondering what the underlying trends you're seeing there are. And I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","Sure. I mean, storage was down year-over-year, 11%. But when you look at the year, Shannon, it was down 2%, within that, we saw growth in Hyperconverged, which is up 25% for the year and we saw Nimble to a record year of 35%.","And we are leveraging now the platform called HPE InfoSight, which you're familiar with, our AI ops platform, that we embedded everywhere, where it is in ProLiant, where it is in our storage business across the entire portfolio, be on Nimble. So we have now Hyperconverged, we leverage it in HPE Primera. Primera for us will be an area of growth going forward.","But if you look at the last point of market share, we actually gained 100 basis points in market share last quarter. So in a market, obviously, there has been kind of stop in the growth in the second half and probably decline and we don't have the final figures here, we gained share. So that's why we are very excited about our storage portfolio and obviously is a key strategic area for us.","And then with the acquisition of MapR and BlueData storage, now we have a complete portfolio for our customers in the software defined space and that's why we introduced our HP container platform last week. So for the year again, the revenue was down 2%, but in that a lot of growth in key strategic areas and a lot of profit improvements and share gain in the last quarter that was reported.","Antonio Neri","And specifically for storage Shannon, if I may add, Storage revenue in Q4 relative to Q3 was marginally up on a sequential basis. This is again another element of the prior answer which is year-over-year compares are of a different nature, given the various effects at play nowadays, but revenue from storage, sequentially Q4 on Q3 was marginally up.","Shannon Cross","And pricing, what trends are you seeing there? Given what's going on in commodities?","Tarek Robbiati","I think I would say, pricing on storage is stable.","Shannon Cross","Okay. Thanks. And then my final question or my second question is just on China. Can you touch on what you're seeing through the joint venture and what that market looks like and maybe some of the trends in terms of using your technology versus H3C's? Thank you.","Antonio Neri","Yes. So our set up in China continued to be a point of focus for us. We are pleased with that set up because obviously it allows us to participate in a market that obviously is unique. The indigenous part of the H3C in China continues to grow nicely and obviously we capture that through our dividends.","And our portfolio, meaning the HP side of portfolio continue to be sold through that entity because they have the exclusive distributor of products in China, but that has been declining because of the shift between the indigenous products and the green products of HP Green or HP owned products.","So overall, in total that business continue to grow, but as always, there is challenges there driven by the same situation we see here. But overall, we are very pleased with the set up and I think it's the right set up at this point in time we are today, considering the global trade tensions.","Tarek Robbiati","Great. Thank you, Shannon. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to see if we could maybe double click on what's happening trend wise in the Intelligent Edge, the HPE Aruba business in that. I think earlier this year, you had talked about some execution issues was hampering this business, and now, I guess, we've got some concern about the macro yet some opportunities from things like Wi-Fi 6. Just if you could maybe walk us through the cross currents and how to think about the trajectory of that line of business? Thank you.","Antonio Neri","Sure. First of all, I am excited about the business because it is positioned for where we see the trends in the market, right. So first of all, the digital transformation starts by providing secure connectivity to drive the experiences through the digital transformation.","Second, more and more workloads are moving to the edge. And so we have been working on a couple of things. First, our portfolio of products, so we have the best portfolio we had now since the introduction at HP Discover and later in Q3 with Aruba Central, which is the most comprehensive as a service model for both mid-market and enterprise and Aruba Instant On, which is a killer solution for the SMB market, obviously Wi-Fi 6 became available in the second half of 2019.","And as I said in my earlier comments, more than one-third of the Wi-Fi 6 and Enterprise was Aruba, but it is early stages, obviously we have to work on our own execution on in North America, which we feel we have put behind us and we feel that that's going to give us momentum as we enter 2020.","But in the Aruba portfolio, obviously we sell Aruba and the rest of the portfolio and I will say that the Aruba parts of the portfolio is steady and growing slightly and the other ones were slightly down, but in aggregate, that's where you see the performance. So I know Tarek has few comments to add associated with that.","Tarek Robbiati","Yes. Thank you, Antonio. So I found the Intelligent Edge, if you look at our presentation and you referred specifically to Slide 3. You will observe that the majority of the operating profit decline is driven by the conscious decision we made to invest in R&D products to equip the Edge with a full suite of products.","So more than two-thirds of the operating profit decline year-over-year is a conscious decision we've made to invest in R&D to equip Aruba with a full suite of products and very recently they've launched a number of different solutions including a single operating system to cater for the high end of the market all the way down to branches Wi-Fi 6 Aruba Central.","And we feel that now the company is from a portfolio standpoint \u2013 product portfolio standpoint, extremely well positioned for the future, it's been acknowledged by number of industry outage publications, including the Ghana Group, IDC and Forrester Research and there we feel that we are extremely well equipped and positioned for the future with Aruba. Now this puts more emphasis obviously on execution in fiscal year 2020 and we look forward to seeing the fruits of those investments.","Shannon Cross","Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","Great. Thanks, Simon. Can we get our next question, please?","Operator","Our next question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Roderick Hall","Yes. Hi guys, thanks for the question. I wanted to start by asking if you've seen any change in the size of customers exhibiting these delays and lower spending patterns, in other words, have you seen it moved from Fortune 100 type customers down to mid markets in any of your business line or in all of them. And then I have a follow-up to that.","Antonio Neri","No, no really, I mean what we said is that the elongation sales cycles are really in the mostly in the enterprise space in the larger deals, not in the smaller deals or smaller customer segments.","Roderick Hall","Okay, great. Thanks, Antonio. And then the follow-up, I wanted to see maybe Tarek, if you can answer this. With the potential transaction at HPQ changed their commitment to you in terms of financial services in any way or whatever commitment they have with you persist through any sort of potential transaction?","Tarek Robbiati","The simple answer to your question is no. There is a contract in place between the parties. We've been working for more than decades with HPI on financing their own equipment. This is incredibly well established and set across the channels. It's incredibly difficult to therefore dislodge HPFS from those channels. We feel very good about this. I don't think a transaction will cause us any palpitations in that regard.","Roderick Hall","Okay, great.","Antonio Neri","Because of the market we cover, and the vast majority of those customers or channel partners, we have direct relationships anyway.","Roderick Hall","Okay, excellent. Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","Great. Thanks, Rod. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thanks. I have two questions and I'll ask them at the same time. So you can decide which to ask first \u2013 answer first or second. So the first one is your sales growth, you mentioned growth for next year, is that with or without Cray? I know you said on a currency as adjusted basis, but I want to be clear is that with or without Cray? And then my second question is your fiscal 2020 EPS outlook is the same from your Investor Day. Does that include more stock buyback and if so how much should we plan on? Thank you.","Antonio Neri","The first question is with Cray which is what we said at the Security Analyst Meeting, and Tarek will answer the question on EPS.","Tarek Robbiati","So yes remember \u2013 at our Securities Analyst meeting, we said that we would be from a capital management policy return between 50% to 75% of our cash flow to shareholders. And therefore that this would be tracking cash flow, which in turn will be tracking earnings and there is no change to this.","We've assumed a certain level of share buybacks, which is \u2013 what is currently implied by the market and the dividend we up the dividend from $0.1125 to $0.12, so you can very easily do the math to understand the level of share buyback that is implied by the figures, I've just quoted to you.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for the details. That's greatly appreciated.","Tarek Robbiati","Great. Thank you, Jim. I think we have time for one last question, please?","Operator","Our final question today will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have one question and a follow-up as well. As we think about the impacts of component pricing dynamics and it sounds like the positive trends might continue here for a little bit with regard to the business in the gross margin.","I'm just curious, is there any kind of framework you can help us understand of how much mix has played a part within the server category, particularly any comments on how much content growth you've seen from say DRAM or memory, in general, just trying to think about the structural kind of sustainability of those trends going forward?","Tarek Robbiati","Okay. So you may recall from my speech that I made a comment with respect to units, and we explained that when you look at the units of what we sell excluding Tier 1s and China, our server units have been growing sequentially since the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, and they were up 2% year-over-year in Q4 with higher services intensity.","So this is really the key driver of our earnings performance in Q3 and Q4, and we see those trends continue, although now most of what we sell is Gen10 on the server side. We do believe that the configurations that customers require to cater for the exponential growth of data are closing ultimately to see units going up and eventually AUP after phase of deceleration will start to go up again. So that's what we are seeing in the medium to long-term.","Antonio Neri","Obviously, we have taken actions ourselves to take advantage of the supply, pricing, and as you know, we do a lot of long-term supply arrangements as they become available. But in the end, the structure of the systems, particularly as the Generation 11 comes online, that will drive again another structural change in our AUPs because of the configurations.","Aaron Rakers","That's helpful. And then as a second follow-up question. On the storage business as we think about the product portfolio, I know you mentioned strong growth in Nimble, but I'm just curious of where we're at with the Primera product? When do we expect that to really start to materialize from a revenue standpoint?","And just remind us how much of your business in storage is related to more of those higher end platforms? I think that that's founded on the legacy 3PAR platform. I'm just trying to think about the refresh opportunity as you look through this next several quarters what that might present?","Antonio Neri","Yes. I mean, we have received very strong accolades and interest on HP Primera, and remember HP Primera, we don't sell it just as a part of our independent storage appliance, but we sell it as a part of a Composable Cloud. And with integration, with both HP Synergy and HP Composable rack as a block of IT that has all the software defined intelligent and automation including HP InfoSight.","And obviously our strength has been mostly in the mid-range market and, but the high-end is very \u2013 is a market that's very interesting for us and we are rolling that as we speak, and I believe throughout 2020, will be a driving force for growth for us.","Generally, the market is actually moving in a direction that's more software-defined. And that's why HP InfoSight is a key component of HP Primera for us, because it's mostly softer on appliance-based driven solution, but it is actually the software that makes that unique.","Aaron Rakers","Thank you very much.","Tarek Robbiati","Great. Thank you, Aaron.","Tarek Robbiati","So I think we're unfortunately out of time for questions. But, Antonio, let me turn it over to you for any final comments.","Antonio Neri","Well, as always thank you for joining us today. I just wanted to wrap up by saying I believe we had another very strong year. This is the second year as a CEO and we did what we said we would do. I think we have achieved record level of profitability, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. I will emphasize the free cash flow because we actually improved cash flow by 58%.","We are on track to deliver that normalized cash flow. We have spoken many, many times and we are very, very confident that $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. What I'm really pleased is about the execution in the business with disciplined by pivoting the business and excited about the future without forgetting the fact that the culture of the company as it plays a huge role and I couldn't be more pleased and proud of the work we have done here. So thanks again for joining us today and hopefully see you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call today. Thank you."],"10808":["Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.

My name is Laura and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Good afternoon. I'm Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and I'd like to welcome you to our Fiscal 2016 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call with Meg Whitman, HPE's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Stonesifer, HPE's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-K.

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release.","With that, let me turn it over to Meg.","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We've now completed our first full quarter as an independent company, and we're off to a very strong start. We are already seeing the benefits of being a smaller, more focused and agile company across a number of fronts. Our customers and partners understand our strategy and appreciate working with a simplified, faster-moving organization.","Our employees are engaged and aligned. For example, we've created a single pan-HPE sales training and account planning program, which has already uncovered over 100 accounts where there are significant untapped cross-selling opportunities. Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, and you're going to see some amazing new introductions in the coming quarters in key areas of the portfolio, including Servers, Cloud, high-performance computing, IoT, all-flash storage, Aruba and converged systems.","For our shareholders, this focus is driving strong financial and operational performance. In Q1, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency with revenue of $12.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year. And when you exclude the impact from recent M&A activities, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis in every one of our business segments for the first time since Q4 fiscal year 2010.","At the same time, we continued to make progress on our cost structure, particularly in ES, and delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41, at the top end of our previously provided range.","Delivering strong cash flow is also a key priority for us. While Q1 was impacted by seasonality, separation payments and timing, we expect cash flow to improve as we move through the year, and remain confident in our full year free cash flow outlook of $2 billion to $2.2 billion. Tim will walk through the specific Q1 cash flow drivers in a minute.","Finally, in line with our commitment to return cash to our shareholders, in Q1 we paid $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion for share repurchases and nearly $100 million in dividends. As a result, we've already exceeded our FY 2016 commitment of returning at least 50% of expected free cash flow to shareholders. And share repurchases will remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders, given the current market conditions.","Overall, while there is more work to do to accelerate top-line growth, align our cost structure and drive even closer collaboration and integration across our organization, I'm very pleased with where we stand today.","Now let me turn to business performance. We had another strong quarter in Enterprise Group, with revenue up 7% year-over-year in constant currency. Our portfolio is truly the best we've had in years and is driving strong customer traction. For example, today HPE is the leading infrastructure provider for SAP HANA with nearly twice the number of shipments over the next competitor. And this quarter we won a number of important deals, including one with the Canadian communications company, Rogers, to help them transform their existing traditional IT to a hybrid infrastructure. We will provide a comprehensive solution, including converged systems, cloud systems, StoreOnce, 3PAR all-flash and technology services.","We also signed a multi-year agreement with one of the world's largest food producers, JBS, to help them build an IT environment that supports faster business expansion, including consolidating their data centers and moving to the cloud. And just last week, at Mobile World Congress, we announced that Swisscom, Switzerland's leading telecommunications provider, will deploy new virtual network functions using HPE OpenNFV solutions.","This customer momentum is driving financial results, and each of our hardware business units performed well in Q1. In Servers, we delivered 5% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, maintained strong margins, and also continued to make R&D investments. While we won't chase share for share's sake, we continue to see significant growth opportunity ahead as the clear market leader with the most comprehensive portfolio of offerings, from mission-critical and high-performance computing to our new IoT and Cloudline solutions.","Storage had another strong quarter, with revenue up 3% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by continued strength in 3PAR. Converged storage grew 17% year-over-year in constant currency, and is now a solid 56% of Storage revenue. We had record revenue for 3PAR, driven by triple-digit constant currency growth in all-flash, which grew at three times the market rates. With the industry-leading all flash product and the broadest reach through our channel, we expect to gain share for the ninth quarter in a row in calendar Q4.","Turning to Networking, the significant actions we took last year are paying off, and we are very pleased with the performance overall. Networking revenue grew 62% year-over-year in constant currency. Normalized for the Aruba acquisition, revenue grew double-digits, driven by record China revenue as well as good performance in other regions.","As we've discussed before, we are seeing strength in China, as customers anticipate the completion of the deal with Tsinghua that we announced last year. We are currently working through the final regulatory approval in China, and we expect the deal to close by the end of May. Aruba also grew double-digits at an operational level, and we saw strong pull-through of HPE's switching portfolio to complement Aruba's wireless offerings.","Technology Services revenue was down 3% in constant currency, although TS support performed better. Total orders grew year-over-year excluding China, where we are seeing some customers delaying renewals until the Tsinghua transaction closes. Unlike Networking or Servers, these are long-term contracts and we believe some customers are waiting to work directly with the new entity. We also saw constant currency double-digit order growth in new solutions, like Datacenter Care and Proactive Care. We expect TS performance to improve throughout the year driven by a better mix of new, faster growing support solutions.","In Cloud, following a major wave of product releases across our HPE Helion portfolio in the second half of 2015, we are seeing strong customer traction. In fact, since separation, Helion has gained over 200 customer wins, including some of the world's largest banks, service providers and industrials. This momentum reinforces our belief that our strategy of helping customers transform to a hybrid infrastructure is a winning approach for us.","Enterprise Services continues to execute well against its turnaround strategy. ES is building a more diversified customer base, stabilizing revenue and significantly reducing its cost structure. For example, during the quarter we grew new business TCV by 4% year-over-year in constant currency. This includes an agreement with Sabre to provide virtualization, automation and security services, hardware and software to support faster product development, and extend Sabre's position in the global travel industry. And it includes an agreement with Avon to transform key elements of the leading beauty company's global IT infrastructure by offering dedicated data center services, cross-functional support, network management and security services. This builds on the progress we've made over the past three years.","Remember that in FY 2013 just three customers made up approximately 65% of ES operating profit. Today, no account makes up more than 10%. We also continue to make progress on our cost structure by exiting high-cost data centers, improving low-cost location mix and rebalancing our workforce. As a result, Q1 revenue grew slightly in constant currency, marking the first quarter with constant currency growth since Q3 of 2012. We also had our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion, Q1 operating margin of 5.1% improved 2.1 points year-over-year driven largely by delivery cost actions.","Overall, I believe we are taking the right steps to achieve our long-term goal of a sustainable market-competitive cost structure with the 7% to 9% operating profit margin.","In Software, we continued to make progress aligning the portfolio and go-to-market through our four transformation areas, increasing efficiency and accelerating SaaS. This has included the divestiture of several Software businesses that were not core to our strategy, including iManage, LiveVault and TippingPoint, which we expect to close later this month.","In Q1, Software returned to growth with revenue up 1% in constant currency when adjusted for recent M&A activity. The ADM\/ITOM business was down slightly in constant currency, as continued headwinds in license and support were nearly offset by Professional Services and record revenue growth in SaaS, which grew over 20% year-over-year. Big Data was strong with revenue up double-digits when normalized for currency and divestitures, driven by triple-digit growth in vertical license. Security performance was also strong across both license and SaaS.","Financial Services continues to provide our customers with the financing flexibility they need to take on their biggest IT challenges. At the same time, the team does a great job managing this business to minimize our risk and maximize our return. Financial Services revenue grew 3% in constant currency in Q1 and financing volume also increased to 3% year-over-year.","Before I hand it over to Tim to provide further insight into the financials, I want to highlight some of the exciting product announcements from the quarter. One of the most important benefits of being a smaller, more focused company is that we are able to be very targeted in our investments and to even more effectively put our resources towards the most important high potential opportunities that support our strategy. As we've discussed before, we prioritize organic investments to maintain a strong technology pipeline.","At Discover in December, we unveiled HPE Synergy, a new category of infrastructure designed to run both traditional and cloud native applications for organizations running a hybrid infrastructure. Synergy, powered by our OneView software represents a critical step in delivering our vision for hybrid infrastructure. We also introduced our new IoT Edgeline Systems and Aruba networking sensors specifically designed to help customers more efficiently collect, process, and analyze IoT data. The new solutions are key elements of our strategy of delivering more connectivity and computing power at the network edge, and you can expect more IoT announcements coming up this year.","And in January, HPE expanded its network function virtualization portfolio. We announced HPE Service Director, a new end-to-end service operation solution designed to help communication service providers managed services in NFV deployments by bridging traditional and new virtualized environments.","In addition to organic investments, we are also investing in key partnerships. In January, HPE and Scality announced an enhanced partnership designed to accelerate the adoption of software-defined storage. And we announced a new partnership with Microsoft appointing Azure as a preferred public cloud partner for HPE customers while HPE now serves as a preferred partner in providing infrastructure and services for Microsoft's hybrid cloud offerings.","As a result of this commitment to innovation, our products and services are being recognized as leaders in the industry. For example, we are now named a leader in 26 different Gartner Magic Quadrants including integrated systems, modular servers, storage disk arrays, and wired and wireless infrastructure. Forester has ranked Enterprise Services as a leader in workplace services and positioned HPE as a leader in its recent private cloud report. And IDC ranked us as leader in application modernization services.","Looking forward, you can expect this momentum and investment in innovation to continue. Later this month, we will announce a new market-changing hyper-converged offering based on our industry-leading ProLiant virtualization server. Our new solution will offer customers installation in minutes, a consumer-inspired simple mobile array user experience, and automated IT operations, all at 20% lower cost than Nutanix. We believe this new system will allow us to quickly become a top player in the $5 billion high-growth hyper-converged market.","Also later this month, we'll refresh our server portfolio to include a game-changing new technology called Persistent Memory, which was invented by our server group. This new technology will enable an ecosystem of new applications supporting non-volatile memory and is a key milestone on our journey to the machine. So overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter as an independent company. We are already seeing the benefits of being a smaller, more focused organization, and I'm excited about what's ahead.","On that note, I will hand the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Meg. Good afternoon, everyone. We've now completed our first quarter as a standalone company and overall I'm pleased with our performance. As part of the separation process, we developed a clear financial architecture for HPE, where each business segment has a specific role in driving overall company performance. Enterprise Group is our growth engine, Enterprise Services is committed to stabilizing revenue and expanding margins, Software provides high margins and strong cash flow, and Financial Services provides a consistent annuity-based revenue stream. After only one quarter, it's already clear that each business is executing against this framework and, as a result, is driving solid financial performance at the HPE level.","First quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, down 2.5% year-over-year, but up 3.8% in constant currency. And as Meg said, this marks our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. Clearly, currency was a significant headwind this quarter. You might recall that we saw the most significant movement in currencies during our first fiscal quarter last year, which drove a large rate translation impact this year and a total currency impact of 6 points year-over-year. Going forward, currency will still be a significant impact in Q2 and then moderate in the second half. And we still anticipate a currency headwind of approximately 3 points to revenue for the full year.","Looking at performance by geography. We had some challenges in the Americas, which grew 1% year- over-year in constant currency with increased weakness in January, particularly in U.S. hardware as macro uncertainty caused a slowdown in global accounts funding. EMEA delivered growth of 4% year-over-year in constant currency driven by balanced growth across EG hardware. APJ saw the best growth at 9% year-over-year in constant currency due to strength in servers and record China networking revenue. The gross margin was 28.4%, down 1.2 points sequentially due to normal seasonality and up 70 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by continued productivity improvements in Enterprise Services.","Non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.6 billion were up 3% year-over-year driven by R&D as we continue to make targeted investments. Non-GAAP operating profit was 8.1%, down 1.5 points sequentially and down 40 basis points year-over-year.","Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.41, at the top of our guided range. Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pre-tax charges of $311 million for restructuring charges, $218 million for amortization of intangible assets, and $79 million for separation costs. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.15, $0.02 above our previously provided outlook range of $0.09 to $0.13 due primarily to tax indemnification adjustments related to the separation.","Free cash flow was negative $831 million, down 70% year-on-year on an adjusted basis that reflects the estimated HPE contribution to the combined HP company free cash flow last year. As we discussed during the Q4 earnings call, Q1 is usually our lowest cash flow quarter due primarily to earnings seasonality in ES and Software as well as normal annual bonus compensation payments. You can see the seasonal pattern in our adjusted fiscal year 2015 results when our free cash flow for Q1 was a use of approximately $500 million. In addition to normal seasonality, in Q1 2016 we had higher separation payments year-over-year, which are now largely complete, and higher usage of working capital.","Let me explain what's happening with working capital. The cash conversion cycle was 31 days, up eight days sequentially. This was above our targeted levels of mid-20 days primarily due to payables that were impacted by intra-quarter purchasing linearity and strategic buys that provide an economic benefit to the company. These items are largely timing related, and we continue to more aggressively manage our working capital and expect the cash conversion cycle to improve throughout the year and return to our targeted levels. With all that in mind, we remain committed to our free cash flow outlook of $2 billion to $2.2 billion for the full year.","Turning to capital allocation. In the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.2 billion for share repurchases, including $1.1 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program and an additional $132 million on the open market as part of our ongoing share repurchase program. We also distributed $96 million as part of our normal dividend. To-date, we have already returned over 60% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders. And now we are raising our commitment and expect to return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders in fiscal year 2016.","Separately, as Meg noted, we expect the Tsinghua transaction to close near the end of May. When the deal closes, we expect to receive cash of just over $2 billion that is net of some initial tax on the sale. We are planning to use the vast majority of this cash to opportunistically repurchase shares. The timing of the repurchases may not be linear and will be dependent on several factors, including market conditions and availability of U.S. cash.","Now turning to the business results. The Enterprise Group delivered healthy growth and stable profitability, in line with our financial architecture. As Meg discussed, we are investing in innovation across EG to deliver best-in-class solutions in growing markets, while maintaining cost discipline and solid profitability. Revenue grew 1% year-over-year as reported, or 7% in constant currency with strength across all hardware groups. Profitability was down 1.8 points to 13.4%, primarily due to FX and to a lesser extent, product mix.","Servers revenue was down 1% year-over-year as reported, but grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was driven by strong Tier 1 and by core sales in both EMEA and APJ. This was somewhat offset by pressure in the Americas towards the end of the quarter. Our R&D investments continue to pay off with our industry-leading offerings in high-performance compute that now exceeds a $1 billion run rate and strong double-digit growth in mission-critical x86 servers.","Looking forward, we continue to see opportunities for profitable revenue growth and share expansion in the server market. We have the most comprehensive and compelling server portfolio with solutions for every workload. And we are aggressively taking advantage of the uncertainty in the markets surrounding our competitors.","Storage revenue declined 3% year-on-year as reported, but grew 3% in constant currency. The unified 3PAR architecture combined with our excellent channel partnerships continues to drive revenue growth and share gains, while our competitors are distracted and contracting. 3PAR all-flash grew triple digits again, driving 3PAR revenue growth of 21% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outperforming the market. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 15% year-over-year in constant currency. We estimate that we've gained solid market share in the fourth calendar quarter and expect Storage to continue be a growth driver in constant currency throughout the remainder of the year.","Networking revenue grew 54% year-over-year as reported, or 62% in constant currency, and expanded operating margins, driven by the acquisition of Aruba and strong execution across all regions. When adjusted for Aruba, Networking revenue was still up double digits in constant currency. The Aruba acquisition continues to prove to be a key strategic move for HPE and has transformed our Networking business. Consistent with our acquisition strategy, Aruba continues to drive growth in wireless and it's also been integral in returning switching to double-digit growth year-over-year.","TS revenue declined 9% year-over-year as reported, or 3% in constant currency. However, approximately one point of the decline was due to the discontinuation of HPI related service contracts that were supported by TS last year. Encouragingly, TS support, which has significantly higher margins than consulting, continued to stabilize and revenue was only down 2% year-over-year in constant currency, including the HPI impact. Orders were down slightly in constant currency, but up excluding China, where signings have been delayed ahead of the Tsinghua deal close date.","Enterprise Services executed well against its plan to stabilize the top line and expand margins. Revenue declined 6% year-over-year, but grew slightly in constant currency. Applications and Business Services, which you'll recall is the higher margin business within ES, continued to improve with a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, driven by strong apps performance in stabilization and business process services.","Strategic Enterprise Services revenue was up double digits year-on-year, with strong growth in Helion Managed Cloud. Overall, TCV was up nearly 30% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strong renewals as well as growth in new logos and add-ons.","ES operating profit improved 2.1 points year-over-year to 5.1% as the team continued to execute productivity improvements and delivery in sales and improved new deal profitability. We also had a benefit from a one-time divestiture of a non-core business.","We continue to make progress against the cost takeout plan we laid out at our Analyst Meeting. We now have approximately 45% of our workforce in low-cost locations and are well on our way to our longer-term goal of 60%. Given the progress we have made on bookings and cost improvements, along with our normal quarterly seasonality, we remain confident in our full year operating profit outlook of 6% to 7% and revenue of down 2% to flat year-over-year in constant currency.","Software executed well in the quarter, improving revenue and delivering strong profitability, while continuing to become more tightly integrated with the rest of the HPE portfolio and go-to-market approach.","Revenue declined 10% year-over-year as reported, or 6% in constant currency, but was up 1% when adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures in constant currency. We saw strong performance in big data and also some growth in security, offset by declines in IT Management. SaaS had a very good quarter growing double digits in constant currency when adjusted for divestitures driven by ADM, ITOM and security.","Operating profit was 17.4%, down 60 basis points year-over-year due primarily to currency and a higher mix of Professional Services. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, but is still making strategic R&D investments in growth areas that align well with the broader HPE portfolio.","In Financial Services, revenue declined 3% year-over-year, but grew 3% in constant currency as we began to see more impact from the volume growth we delivered last year. Financing volume in the quarter declined 4% year-over-year, but was up 3% in constant currency. Operating profit improved 1.7 points year-over-year to 12.9% as we were able to adjust bad debt reserves to reflect the improved loss rates and our high quality portfolio. Return on equity was up one point year-over-year to 18.1%.","Now turning to our outlook. We will not formally update our fiscal year 2016 outlook for the impact of Tsinghua transaction until after it closes, but I wanted to give you some information about how to think about the potential impact. We now anticipate the deal to close near the end of May and expect the transaction will impact fiscal year 2016 EPS operationally by approximately $0.05. This includes some stranded costs from corporate administrative functions that we will mitigate in the near term. After the transaction closes, we will update our fiscal year 2016 free cash flow and EPS outlook, including any expected benefit from share repurchases made with the sales proceeds.","Also, we do have an EPS benefit from our share repurchases completed in Q1 and still feel confident in the underlying operating performance of the business, but it's too early in the year to change our full-year outlook given the softness in January and near-term market uncertainty.","With that in mind, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.39 to $0.43 in Q2 2016, and continue to expect full-year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.13 to$0.17 in Q2 2016 and continue to expect full-year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.75-$0.85.","Now let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Good job on the operating margins. I was hoping you could give us some detail about how you're thinking but margins, particularly in the Enterprise Group as we move through fiscal 2016 and some of the other operating margins? I you've commented on Enterprise Services, but wanted to get your sense about the Enterprise Group in particular with the new products coming out?","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Sherri. We did see some margin deterioration year-over-year if you look at the margins for EG, in total, they were at 13.4%. Most of that was driven by FX, so keep in mind in the first quarter last year the euro, as an example, was at 124 and the average accounting rates in the first quarter this year was 108. So we still saw significant pressure from a FX perspective when you look at the first quarter. Going out for the rest of the year, we would expect the margins to stabilize and maybe get a little bit of a lift particularly as we continue to grow the storage business as well as the networking business.","So as you know, those businesses have a healthier margin profile so as we continue to grow those, we should see some lift there. And then, the only other major comment I'd make is on the ES business. Again, we saw some great performance there in the first quarter, margins at 5.1%, up 210 basis points year-over-year. So the efforts of the team continues to execute upon as they're transforming that business, and the seasonality in that business. We would expect those margins to improve over the course of the year and settle on average in the range of 6% to 7% as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting in September.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. And then just thinking about your free cash flow guidance. Now you're planning to spend 100% of your free cash flow, returning that to shareholders. Does that change your acquisition strategy? What are you thinking about acquisitions this year? Thank you.","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we continue to execute a returns based capital allocation strategy, and given where the stock price has been trading, this is one of the best return on investments that we can actually make. And as I said when we were on our road show for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise, our first choice is, from an innovation perspective is organic innovation. Look at the success of the 3PAR all-flash storage array, internally homegrown, growing three times the rate of the market, and gives that benefit of a common architecture from top to bottom. The benefit of doing organic innovation is you don't end up with a Frankenstein of architectures. The second choice would be acquisitions that look like 3PAR, 3Com and Aruba. These have been very successful acquisitions for us. They are additional complementary technology that goes through our excellent distribution system. But, again, where the stock is trading right now? We think that this makes a lot of sense to buy back shares, which is why we've decided to go to 100% of the free cash flow.","Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Sherri. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question will come from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. I just have a couple of clarifications, actually. Maybe for Meg, first of all, and Tim touched upon this. You talked about how you're seeing constant currency revenue growth over several quarters. All businesses have grown since the end of 2010. Are we now at the point whereby this business might sustainably at constant currency in revenue terms just grow? I'm not asking for a number of percentage growth rate, but do you think you have that visibility? Because the reason why I ask is, Tim also mentioned visibility in January, and obviously, we can see what the markets have been doing and the macro. So I'm kind of curious as to how we see sustainable growth of the business?","And then also, just for Tim, on the Enterprise Services margin guidance and the growth guidance for this year, given the contract value growth, given the mix shift you're seeing in the business, the cost changes you're putting through very well, why isn't \u2013 that guidance just seems for Enterprise Service is now very conservative. So is there some caution you're reflecting in that guidance in the balance on the Enterprise Services side specifically? Many thanks.","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So on the overall growth rate of the company, remember, we said at the beginning of this year that we would grow Hewlett Packard Enterprise in revenues in constant currency, and we are on track to do that as you can see from Q1. Again, from an as-reported basis, the compares get earlier \u2013 I mean, get better in the second half of the year because we've worked through those big currency fluctuations in Q1 of last year. And I think your question is, can we see accelerated growth? I think we just are a little concerned about the macroeconomic environment. We saw a slowdown in the U.S. in the last three weeks of January. Linearity appears to be back on track, but it's early in the game, and so I think we're just being a bit cautious here.","We like our product portfolio. We like our go-to-market changes. We like our innovation engine. There's a lot of things that we're feeling very good about, but the macroeconomic environment still has pockets of weakness. Russia continues to be a big challenge, the Ukraine, parts of Latin America. China right now for us is doing well, but that can change at any minute. So, we feel great about the stated goal of growth in constant currencies, and let's see how the macroeconomic and sort of the political environment changes over time.","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. And then on the ES point, again, we feel great about the progress we've made in the first quarter. We have the delivery centers in motion. We continue to move folks from high-cost countries to low-cost countries, so the team has done a tremendous job in transforming the business. Now, to your question, as we continue to progress in the year, we're going to continue to see pricing pressure in that business. It's very competitive. We're going to continue to invest in the business, particularly in that go-to-market motion. So, and also given the fact that it's really just the first quarter, so we have nine more months to go. There is some market uncertainty out there, so we just felt it prudent to stick with the 6% to 7%.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Kulbinder. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. I'm wondering if you can update us on the status of expected restructuring and separation charges? I think as of last call, you had talked about $1.7 billion in cash impact this year and that you expect it to be front-end loaded. It ended up being less than one quarter of the year's total. And so, I'm wondering if a) you can give us an update on how many people came out in the quarter, what that expectation is for the year, and are we incorrect in what I just played back in terms of understanding that this didn't appear to be more front-end loaded, in fact, it felt less than linear, and why that might be?","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Toni. A couple of things that I'd say about the restructuring. We are on track. So as we called out at the Analyst Meeting, we will be about $1.2 billion in cash. So we are on track for that this year. And then as far as how many folks that we've taken out so far, it will be 3,000 in the first quarter. We don't really guide on what we're going to take out for the entire year, but the only thing I'd say is we're on track and that $1.2 billion in cash for this year still remains there.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And separation, that was $600 million I believe and you did $79 million in the quarter, where do you stand on that?","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. We did $300 million. You're right, it's $600 million in separation for the year, and we did $300 million in the first quarter.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. But the cash impact was only $79 million or was it grouped in another group then?","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. No, the cash impact was a $300 million payment.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then finally, you mentioned the benefit from a divestiture in ES. Was that a margin benefit? And is that part of the reason for not being more optimistic about margins over the course of the year? Or was that either immaterial or a revenue impact?","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, that did have a impact from a margin perspective. I'd say it was not really material. It does have some impact on the margin to your point, but overall we feel very good about the health of the ES margins.","Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Toni. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question will come from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just quickly two questions. One, bad debt reserves, you mentioned was a benefit to Financial Services margins in the quarter. Was that a one-time benefit or does that flow through to future quarters? And then secondly, the sale to Tsinghua is taking longer than expected. Can you just talk about what milestones are left to get that deal completed and just some context around why it's been delayed? Thank you.","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I'll hit the bad debt reserve and then I'll let Meg talk about Tsinghua. So the bad debt reserve was a one-time benefit. It was about, I think it was about 150 basis points of the improvement, and it's primarily driven by the fact that we adjusted reserves. We're still very conservative, but if you look at our loss reserves as a percentage of expected or historical losses, it's still at about two times, which is very conservative in the Financial Services business.","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Katy, let me talk a little bit about Tsinghua. So you recall, we originally thought this would close roughly at the end of February, and now we are confident that the deal is going to close near the end of May. And we're working through some final Chinese regulatory approvals, so all the U.S. approvals have been received, (38:20), et cetera. Only the China Securities Regulatory Committee remains. They call that the CSRC in China, which is a bit like our SEC. And there has been a couple of things going on there. One is they have a new head of the CSRC.","Two, there is a big backlog of deals, and they're working through that backlog. But we feel confident. We expect that deal to close at the end of May. As you can imagine, we've been in contact with all the appropriate regulatory people and obviously our partners at Tsinghua. So that's the way we think about it right now. There's also, as you know, a fair amount of volatility in the markets in China, and I think that frankly is slowing things down a little bit in China. And by the way, the H3C revenue over there is doing great. We had a record revenue for our China Networking business, and I take that as a positive sign. It means that the Chinese government is still leaning into H3C and that product and that business is being very well received in the China market.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Katy. Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question will come from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Just two if I could. First quickly, Meg, you mentioned a few times the January weakness. Is this just macro? Any parts of your business or verticals that is hit more meaningfully? And then onto the networking business, I think you mentioned Aruba helping the switching business get back to double-digit growth. Could you just talk a little bit about is that AC driven? Or what is it that's helping those two businesses do such a good job of cross-selling? Thank you.","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So the January weakness, we saw the last three weeks in January slow significantly in the United States, actually not that dissimilar from what I believe Cisco referred to on their call. And I don't have a good explanation of that except for one or two things. One is, remember the opening week in the market in 2016 was really tough, right? And I think companies are quite now extra sensitive to volatility in the market. They are quite quick to be cautious and pull back purchases.","From a vertical perspective, obviously the weakest vertical was oil and natural gas. We saw that across the board and a lot of our oil and natural gas customers are in the United States. So that was a challenge and will probably continue. What I will say is, while I'm cautious about it, it looks like February has returned to the linearity that we would have expected. Oil and natural gas continues to be a bit weak, but there's been some strength in other parts. So, I'm not quite sure what happened in those last three weeks, but that would be my guess.","Turning to Aruba and why it has helped our networking switch business, it's because the customers now believe we're completely committed to the Networking business. We are all in on Networking, and while we had HP Networking before, I think people thought, well, maybe they are not 100% committed, maybe a bit below scale. With the acquisition of Aruba, they've gained a great deal of confidence in our product roadmap and in our commitment to the business. And so Aruba I think has cast a really nice glow over the rest of our HP networking business.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Thank you, Tim. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo.","Maynard J. Um - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. I was just wondering if you just could help us a little more in terms of granularity around quarterly free cash flow and the charges. In particular, do you think that in the next quarter that your free cash flow will end up being positive and then continue to grow off of that? And then secondly just on Enterprise Services, are there any metrics you can provide or plan to give us at some point to give us some comfort on revenue stabilization? Whether it's book-to-bill or some other metrics? Thanks.","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. On the quarterly free cash flow, we're not going to guide on a quarterly basis. But, if you think about it, obviously, first quarter for us is seasonally low and that's primarily driven by earnings seasonality, right, which is driven by the profiles in ES and Software as well as the timing of that bonus payment, which happens in the first quarter of every year, it's a one-time payment. So we saw that same seasonality last year. Now going forward what I would say is we're going to get improvements every quarter, and primarily four areas; one, earnings improvement. So obviously we're back-ended loaded from an earnings perspective, particularly in the Second half. So as those earnings improve, obviously, our free cash flow will improve.","The bonus payment is behind us now, so that is no longer a drag as you go forward. The cash conversion cycle, we were disappointed with the 31 days, but when you look at the fundamentals of our terms and mix, we're confident that that will get back to the mid-20 day range, so that will drive a significant amount of improvement. And then lastly the separation. So to Toni's question, we had $600 million of separation charges planned for the year. We paid out $300 million of that in the first quarter, so that becomes less of a drag.","So as we progress through every quarter, similar to last year you will see improvements. So I think if you look at the seasonality of last year, that would probably give you a pretty good reflection of how it may play out this year.","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let me talk a little bit about ES and your question about confidence in the revenue trajectory which member we said is, negative 2% to flat in constant currency. So I think there's a couple of things going on here. One is, this is the first quarter of constant currency revenue growth, not a huge amount, 0.1%, but relative to \u2013 from whence we've come in that business, this gives us a lot of confidence. It's the first quarter of constant currency revenue growth since Q3 of FY 2012. And ABS which happens to have a higher level of profitability than ITO, posted its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth.","SCS, as I mentioned that's our cloud, big data, security practices, grew over 30% year-over-year in Q1 and we saw some benefits from strong strategic Enterprise Services signings in FY 2015. I think we have also worked through the vast majority of the key account revenue runoff that we've talked about for the last couple of years. These were three or four very big ES customers that have now really runoff and have become quite predictable. And then I've got to give the Finance team and the Operations team and ES credit. We are much better now at forecasting revenue than we have been. It's a very granular account by account forecast profit \u2013 forecast of revenue by type of practice. And that gives us a lot of confidence. So as we sit here today and we look out at the landscape and we see a book-to-bill ratio of roughly 1, we feel good about that negative 2% to flat.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Maynard. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Yes. The next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Two things. First of all, if you could comment on the EMC-Dell deal? I'm sure you're going to say that it's an opportunity to gain share, but do you have any proof points of that at this early date? And then second, you're going to be spending about $4 billion on stock repurchase here over time and it's at a time when IBM's had its biggest year of M&A, Dell and EMC are getting together, and there's probably more consolidation, Cisco is making a play for the data center, and you're very hardware-centric. So it seems like you should be making some acquisitions here. Are you comfortable with the strategic position that leaves you in?","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So let me talk a little bit about Dell-EMC. So it is interesting to note how different HP and Dell \u2013 we have taken very different strategies in this environment. There's no question. And my view of this is predicated upon the speed that this market is changing. And so we decided to get smaller while they got bigger. We decided to lean into new technology while they're doubling down on old technology in a cost takeout play. They levered up while we delevered. And we're super-focused on being fast and nimble for our customers. So both strategies may work. I happen to like our hand better than the Dell-EMC hand.","So how are we taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace? So we learned a lot about how to do this in the context of IBM's sale of their server business to Lenovo. We have a very focused channel play where we \u2013 actually it's called Smart Choice and we have a big opportunity to go take Dell and EMC business much as we took a lot of the Lenovo business that would have gone to Lenovo. And so we're seeing good results in the marketplace. We're rolling out our full sales efforts. You're going to start to see even more advertising and digital as we capitalize on another one to two years of uncertainty as this deal closes and they work through the integration.","The other thing is, as you think about it, we continue to invest in innovation. And you have to think about Dell-EMC in many ways as owned by private equity. And you can do your own calculation on what you think the debt interest payments are going to be. For perspective, the entire EMC R&D budget is $2.7 billion. So we feel good about our hand. Two completely different strategies, but I like where we are.","In regards to M&A, as I said, our first priority is organic innovation and you're starting to see that innovation engine really kick into gear. And we started this, Steve, you'll remember four years ago. As we cut costs over the last four years, almost every single quarter year-over-year we spent more money on innovation and it's paying off. That doesn't say we won't do acquisitions, but I would reiterate it's returns-based and it is focused on companies like 3PAR, like 3Com, like Aruba that are complementary technology that fit into our overall four transformation areas as we go forward. So I think we've got the right strategy here, we're thoughtful about it. But if the right acquisition comes along and we feel like the price is appropriate, we'll go ahead and do it.","Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","For what it's worth I think the stock is too cheap, too. Thanks.","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we appreciate that, which is why we're backing up the truck.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Thank you, Steve. Next question, please.","Operator","And next we have Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thank you very much. Just actually following up on that comment of backing up the truck, is the new target of returning 100% or more of free cash flow this year inclusive of the proceeds from the Tsinghua sale? Or would that be on top? And then I have a question as well.","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, the Tsinghua proceeds after the transaction would be on top of that.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And that would be targeted for this year as well in terms of buyback or is that market-dependent?","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's really market dependent. I mean, it's hard to tell. I don't mean to be evasive, but it really depends on market conditions. It depends on the availability of U.S. cash. There are multiple variables in the overall equation, but we are committed to returning a vast majority of that through share repurchases.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, Meg, on the hyper-converged product you mentioned, is that an organic product? And how meaningful do you expect it to be for revenues this year?","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So it is an organic product developed in-house in record time and we're quite excited about this. The hyper-converged market is big. It's growing fast. It's also getting pretty crowded. You've seen a lot of announcements over the last couple of months, but we very much like this product from a side-by-side comparison and features and functionality to our competitors. Feel really good about it and I think it means that we can be a leader in this quite large and fast-growing part of the market.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Simona. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Yes. The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Tim, in your working cap comments, you noted headwinds from intra-quarter linearity and some opportunistic purchases, what regions \u2013 was it primarily just the U.S. that drove that linearity difference or were there other regions that drove that difference? And what components were you procuring opportunistically? And I have a follow-up.","Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It was primarily the U.S., but we did see some pressures across the globe. And again, if you think about timing challenges and free cash flow and cash conversion cycle, it's both sales and purchasing linearity, so this time around it was the purchasing linearity and then we also made some strategic buys.","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And, Meg, just a follow-up on the last question around hyper-converged. Where do you think those dollars in hyper-converged take away from over the next several years? And do you view it as cannibalistic to any of your converged offerings? Thanks.","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There certainly is some cannibalism there, probably the converged infrastructure play, but I would say that this is part of a migration to the next generation data center. What we're seeing from customers of all size, if your company is older than five or 10 years, you are trying to figure out how you're going to take your existing infrastructure to the next generation of IT. And so this is part of the sale of \u2013 okay, you can get more out of your existing IT if you transform to a hybrid infrastructure, and this is one of the core hardware components and software-defined components that allows you to get the most out of this next generation of IT.","So, listen, our business is cannibalistic. Right? I mean, new products come in to replace old products, but we think we can get an increased share of that data center spend, which we see actually growing and overall the margins on CS are accretive to servers and to the EG Group in general.","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Meg.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Yes. The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much. My question is regarding the Services segment. Recently both the federal government as well as the Military has talked about some big contracts coming up for renewal as well as potentially breaking them up into smaller pieces. And we're just wondering, is there any risk there for HP about any of these contracts coming up specifically kind of midyear or second half to where they will enter another realm of some large contracts running off?","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. Actually we think it's an opportunity for us because some of the contracts, at least the ones I'm aware of, are actually owned by many of our competitors. And so those competitors \u2013 I know one in particular that's going to break from one into three, and we have a really very good opportunity to get one out of those three that's right in our sweet spot. As has been widely reported, the U.S. Navy and Marines contract comes up \u2013 I can't remember if it's in 2017 or 2018. I think it's the end of 2017, beginning of 2018 we have to start rebidding that. But we know how to do that. We've done it for years. So actually I think we're on the right side of most of these federal contracts that are breaking up.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, Jim. I think we have...","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Jim. I think we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from Shannon Cross of Cross Research.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Thank you very much. I'll just stick with one question. So, Meg, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing on the cloud? And I know you've signed a deal with Microsoft and you've talked a lot about a hybrid cloud, but maybe you can talk a bit about what you're hearing from customers in terms of their thoughts about moving to Azure or AWS solution versus maybe using more of a hybrid one? And then also how you're thinking about server impact this year and going forward from cloud, given last year was so strong and you still have benefit I think this year from Gen9? Thanks.","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. So what we're hearing from customers is there is almost universal acceptance that their environments will be hybrid. And there's almost universal acceptance that it has to start with an analysis of the apps. How many apps does the customer want to have? Is there opportunities to reduce the number of apps and consolidate? And then what instantiation do you want that app to be on? Some apps are going to stay locked down in a customer's data center, untouched by anyone's hand other than their own employees, but some apps will go to a private cloud on-prem, a virtual private cloud, a managed private cloud, and then obviously to the public cloud. And we're seeing workloads move because even going from a traditional data center to the private cloud can be a 20% to 30% savings to a customer for that workload, which is meaningful.","So, as you know, we are the leader in private cloud. It is the first step that many customers take and then they think okay, what would I like, what of my apps would I like to have in a virtual private cloud and a managed private cloud. I think there is an inexorable march from data center only apps to private cloud, VPC, MPC, and ultimately to the public cloud. So one of the other things we're doing here is developing our multi-cloud management layer, or one pane of glass, our orchestration and automation of your multi-cloud environment. How do you deploy workloads to these different clouds quickly and efficiently? So I think we've got the right strategy here. I think it was smart to get out of our spending on public cloud. I think that game has moved to Azure and AWS and maybe someday Google, and we're really pleased with our Azure partnership. So that's working well.","The other thing I would say is, recall that we have built our cloud operation on Helion OpenStack and our Version 2.0 of what we call HOS, Helion OpenStack 2.0 is a significant improvement from 1.1 where we had some installer challenges. So we're getting a lot of good feedback around HOS 2.0 as well as our carrier-grade OpenStack which is, of course, of interest to the telcos. We had a very good Mobile World Congress show. I was there for three days and our open NFV solution, we have 60 POCs across the globe and a couple of very big customer wins.","So I feel like we're on the right strategy. The world's changing at breakneck speed, but we feel good about our strategy and I feel good actually about having chosen OpenStack. Two or three years ago, I was getting a little concerned because I wasn't sure how fast OpenStack was going to mature, but it seems like it's finally hitting the knee of the curve and the adult supervision that a number of big companies have provided is actually helping.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Great. And server thoughts?","Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Server. Yeah, so we actually see growth in high-performance compute; growth in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 service provider. And in some parts of the world, core server growth. But we've got to make sure that we have the best server roadmap and the best opportunity for customers to run existing applications or cloud native apps, hence, HPE Synergy, which allows a developer to basically compose the infrastructure they need for their app. So HPE Synergy isn't exactly cloud by any stretch of the imagination, but it is in fact the next generation of infrastructure for the software-defined data center.","I would also say that we are gaining share in that market. There's no question about it. We did a great job I think in grabbing share from Lenovo, as I said earlier, when those servers moved from IBM. And we are all over this Dell-EMC opportunity. So in a flat to declining market, which probably core servers are, at least over the next five years, we have to gain share, but there are real pockets of growth in the market as well. And HPC, by the way, high performance compute, we're like the last man standing there and we're investing in HPC and it's a core competency for the company.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations","Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining today.

","As mentioned the earnings presentation can be found posted to our website and it is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call.","With that let me turn it over to Antonio.","Antonio Neri","Thanks Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our Q2 performance reflects our continued progress on shifting our portfolio to higher margin products and services to deliver positive and consistent earnings growth. As a result of this focus, we delivered strong growth and operating margin improvement, expanding non-GAAP EPS and grew cash flow versus the prior year. We also made a number of bold strategic moves to drive innovation, strengthen our culture and win new customers.","While our Q2 revenue growth was impacted by a combination of both intentional and unanticipated factors, we delivered on our [some] [ph] commitment to grow revenue, and we are raising our EPS outlook for the year. In Q2, we deliver revenue of $7.2 billion, up 1% year-over-year excluding the Tier 1 sales and the currency impact.","We grew in key businesses, including storage, high-performance compute, composable cloud, Aruba services and GreenLake orders. Strength in these areas partially offset continued intentional declines in Tier 1 sales and sales into China, as well as some market and execution factors, which I will talk more about in a minute.","As we shifted the mix of our portfolio toward higher value solutions, our underlying profitability improved across the board. Our gross margin of 32.2% expanded 200 basis points and our non-GAAP operating margin of 8.9% was up 70 basis points year-over-year. All of this combined with favorable OI&E drove a strong non-GAAP EPS performance of $0.42 well above the midpoint of our outlook and positive free cash flow of $402 million, up over $650 million versus the prior year.","From a macroeconomic perspective, we continue to see global demand driven by the need to process ever-growing amounts of data. However, like others in the industry, we did see some changes in market dynamics. For example, trade tensions are creating uncertainty. We continue to believe that an open market where everyone can innovate and participate is important for market stability and customer confidence. We also recently experienced an elongation in sales cycles with some customers. We will continue to monitor these and other microeconomic factors.","By business segments, I will start with Intelligent Edge. We continue to see the Edge as a significant opportunity for the company, the explosion of data, devices and apps is driving strong demand for connectivity, security, analytics and cloud computing capabilities of the Edge. Given our strong portfolio and ongoing investment in this business, we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend over the long-term.","In Q2 Intelligent Edge revenue was $666 million, down 5% year-over-year. We saw solid growth in EMEA and APJ and in Aruba services and we won new customers and introduced new compelling products. This positive momentum was offset by some unexpected execution issues and changes in market dynamics. We uncovered some uneven execution in North America, mainly driven by our current sales coverage model, which we are actively addressing.","From a market perspective, we experienced some deals not closing in the timeframe we anticipated. While we will continue to monitor the demand environment closely we are confident in our position going forward based on the new customer wins we closed and the positive reception to the products we introduced this quarter.","For example, we won a deal with C&S Wholesale Grocers, the largest wholesale grocery supply company in the United States, with 14,000 stores in 50 locations. C&S selected Aruba wireless solutions to address its network and security needs.","McKesson Corporation, a global healthcare leader currently ranked sixth on the Fortune 100 will be deploying Aruba's wire and wireless infrastructure. And, Amherst College updated its entire campus network with Aruba's solutions.","We continue to invest in key capabilities like AI and security. For example, in Q2 Aruba introduced two new offerings to help enterprise customers simplify the adoption of IoT by eliminating security and connectivity barriers and decreasing associated operational costs and complexities.","Aruba ClearPass Device Insight delivered a single pane of glass for device visibility, employing automated device discovery, machine learning based fingerprinting and identification. And new access points built on the industry's most advanced family of Wi-Fi 6 IoT ready access points. We expect these new solutions and additional introductions later this year to contribute to growth in our Intelligent Edge segment in the long-term.","Turning to Hybrid IT, we delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, excluding Tier 1. Our segmented approach and investment in high value products and as a service offerings are paying off. We saw continued strong performance in key areas of the business, including storage up 5% year-over-year, high performance compute up 25% year-over-year, hyper converged up 25% year-over-year, and composable cloud up 78% year-over-year. ","Our ability to offer all of this technology as a service is a key differentiator for HPE. We are the only company on the market that can provide a true consumption driven offerings in a hybrid cloud environment.","HP GreenLake is a key element of our push towards subscription based revenue, which also includes Aruba services, and other software defined solutions. GreenLake continues to see very strong customer momentum and recorded its largest quarter ever, with orders that grew 39% year-over-year. This contributed to our overall HP Pointnext performance, which exited the quarter with a book to build ratio of 1.12 highlighting the potential for future revenue growth.","These growth areas offset the impact from some unexpected market dynamics and execution, as well as the intentional decline in Tier 1 sales and revenue coming from our H3C relationship in China.","From a market perspective, we saw extended sales cycles, which indicates a slightly softer demand environment from what we saw earlier in the quarter. And like the Intelligent Edge, although to a lesser extent, we did not execute as well as we could have in North America. We are taking steps to improve our execution including realigning our sales coverage in specific segments of the market.","Separately, as we have discussed in prior quarters, while our H3C partnership continues to be strong, we are working to balance the right mix of HP products with H3C local offerings to optimize profitable growth for the overall entity. This had some impact on our revenue in Q2, which Tarek will talk more about in a minute.","In Q2, we continue to attract new customers and partners. For example, we won a significant technology and services deal with electrical utility company, Southern California Edison, as they upgrade all their customer facing applications. We also expanded the HP GreenLake ecosystem by announcing a strategic global partnership with Nutanix to provide customers with more choice for building their hybrid cloud strategy. We also announced a similar partnership with Google Cloud. These partnerships show the growing understanding and acceptance of the fact that the world will be hybrid.","From an innovation standpoint, we are continuing to invest in BlueData, which we acquired early this year. In Q2, we announced a new integrated offering that combines the HP BlueData software platform with the HP Apollo System and HP Pointnext services to provide customers with a powerful solution for AI and data driven business innovation.","Finally, we are very excited about our intent to acquire Cray. As you know Cray is a premier provider of high end supercomputing solutions. I believe this acquisition will position us to tackle the most data intensive workloads in the high growth segment of high performance computing.","HPC has been and continues to be a strategic focus area for HPE, and one where we have the clear differentiation. Over the years, we have invested organically to build a strong portfolio and completed acquisitions, including SGI to take advantage of the rapidly growing demand for powerful computing capabilities. ","With its leading presence in the government, academic, life science, energy and manufacturing segments, Cray will bring complementary technology and end markets to further strengthen our position.","Customer benefits will include new offerings in AI, machine learning, analytics and new consumption models with HP GreenLake in the near future. Together, the companies can achieve greater scale by combining engineering talent and technologies and enabling R&D innovation leadership. We will also have enhanced supply chain capabilities with its improved U.S. based manufacturing. So overall, I couldn't be more excited to have Cray join the HP team once we close the deal in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.","Just as we are investing in bringing innovative offerings to the market, we also remain committed to thoughtfully investing in our own culture. I believe attracting and retaining the best people is critical and our renewed focus on culture is bringing energy to our employees and attracting new attention from recruits. The day we celebrated our official grand opening in San Jose last month, we also launched several new employee benefits, including six months of paid family leave for the birth or adoption of a new child.","I believe strongly in supporting both the career and personal development of our people, and I am proud of the new ways we\u2019re able to do so.","In summary, I am pleased that we delivered strong margin improvements, EPS above our outlook and robust cash flow in Q2. While we experienced some changes in microeconomic dynamics, and could have executed better in certain areas. We are on track to deliver on our commitments we laid out the SAM.","I am excited about our future as we continue to deliver what customers need most. Our strategy at the Edge is to provide connectivity, security, analytics and cloud computing. At the core, we provide workload optimize, cloud enable and consumption driven solutions for a hybrid world remain confident that our execution against this strategy will drive profitable growth and solid free cash flow generating strong shareholders returns.","With that, I would like to turn it now to Tarek.","Tarek Robbiati","Thank you very much, Antonio. Now, let me provide more detail on our financial results for the quarter. As I did before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to better highlight our performance in the second quarter of our fiscal year. Starting with slide one, you'll see as Antonio said that we are on track to deliver our key financial metrics that we committed to at our Securities Analyst Meeting. Revenue grew in line with our commitment at SAM for constant currency growth excluding Tier 1.","We continue to expand both gross and operating margins, enabling us to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share above our quarterly outlook. Most importantly, the quality of our earnings is improving. This has enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $402 million in Q2 and $212 million in the first half. This is the first time, we've achieved positive first half free cash flow as Hewlett Packard Enterprise since the company was spun-off from the Hewlett Packard Company in November 2015.","Now let me take this opportunity to explain our revenue growth story in this quarter, as shown on slide two. This quarter, we continue to take deliberate actions to improve our profitability. We continued the wind down of our Tier 1 business. The business made up 5% of our total revenue in the prior year, and is now just under 2%, but at a much better gross margins. And as Antonio mentioned, we are selling fewer HPE products to our HPC business in China in order to optimize our HPC joint venture for profitable growth. I will talk about China and the HPC entity there in more details shortly.","Currency was also a greater headwind to revenue this quarter. As you can see, after adjusting for deliberate actions in currency, the underlying core business is growing, driven by our strategic focus area.","Turning to the macroeconomic environment, I'll start with China. As you see on slide three, China continues to be an important market for us as the largest and fastest growing IT market in the world. We have a strong presence in China through a very unique structure with HPC, where we own a 49% equity stake, and UNIS owns the other 51%. UNIS is an $8 billion market cap company listed in China. UNIS derives the vast majority of its profits from H3C.","As mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on balancing the amount of HPE products versus HPC\u2019s local offerings to optimize the overall entity for profitable growth. While selling fewer units to HPC does impact our revenue, keep in mind that we sell product at preferential prices to HPC. As a result of the balancing, we are recognizing higher equity interest year-over-year in the OI&E line of our non-GAAP P&L for which we receive regular cash dividends.","HPC\u2019s performance which is operational in nature is an important component of the OI&E results in our non-GAAP P&L. Also since the beginning of this month of May 2019, we have the right over the next three years to exercise our put option to sell all or part of our 49% stake to UNIS. The put option is valued at 15 times trailing 12 months net earnings. ","It's worth noting that the publicly traded shares of UNIS are trading at a much higher multiple than the multiple of our put option. However, we do not currently intent to exercise our put at this time, given the strategic importance of the China market, and HPC\u2019s growing revenues and earnings.","Moving on to a broader view of each global region on the right hand side of slide four, we did witness some shifts in market dynamics, with global trade often mentioned as a concern by our customers. We are taking actions ourselves to mitigate the risks of the recent tariff increase from 10% to 25%, and have factored that into our outlook.","Moreover, foreign exchange rates have continued to move unfavorably the last few quarters, and we faced a significant year-over-year headwind in Q2 of 210 basis points. We now expect currency to be close to a two point headwind to revenue growth on a full year basis in fiscal year 2019, based on current spot rates instead of just over 1 point as stated at SAM in October 2018.","Geographically, Americas revenue was down 7% in constant currency or down 2% when normalizing for Tier 1 sales. Revenue growth in EMEA was up 1% in constant currency, with solid double-digit growth in both France and Germany. Asia Pacific was up 1% in constant currency, and up 6% in constant currency excluding China.","Slide five shows our performance in the quarter by segment. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In Intelligent Edge, we had solid performance in both EMEA and APJ, but as Antonio mentioned, we have some go to market execution issues in North America that we are working through in the coming quarters.","In Hybrid IT, our higher margin value compute portfolio grew at 8% and within storage, we saw notable strength in nimble storage, which grew 45%. In Operational Services, we grew orders again, including nimble services. And within HPE Financial Services, we saw solid single digit growth in our asset management business, and continued strength in return of equity, which again exceeded 15% this quarter.","Let me bring everything together on slide six and put into perspective the key metrics to measure our business as we pivot our portfolio. The left hand side of the chart shows how the various businesses within Hybrid IT contributed to HPE\u2019s overall revenue growth.","First, it is important to separate out our deliberate actions in both Tier 1 and China that diluted growth by 4 points combined. The volume compute business remains stable contributing 20 basis points to growth and more importantly, our higher margin value compute business grew 8% contributing 1.2 points to overall growth. ","We are seeing strong growth in these categories with HPC up 25%, contributing 1.5 points, composable cloud of 78%, contributing 1.3 points and HCI up 25%, contributing another 20 basis points. Storage also was up 5%, contributing 60 basis points to overall growth. While Pointnext revenue was down in the quarter, we\u2019re growing operational services orders including nimble services at 1% year-over-year, and GreenLake subscription services which were up 39%. ","These are both important lead indicators to overall future Pointnext revenue growth. This portfolio mix shift combined with supply chain efficiencies and improvements in manufacturing overhead drove margin expansion of 200 basis points year-over-year in Q2. Roughly two thirds of that was driven by the mix shift and the remaining one third was other costs of sales efficiencies including lower commodity costs.","We have also been able to hold non-GAAP operating expenses relatively flat through our continued savings and investments from HPE Next. As a result, non-GAAP operating profits continue to expand and were up 70 basis points year-over-year in Q2. All of this has resulted in significantly improved non-GAAP EPS. ","We're also focused on working capital, and we have been able to decrease our one-time payments for HPE Next. As a result, Q2 cash flow from operations was $1 billion, up 300% versus a prior a year. The key takeaway is that our underlying profitability and quality of earnings is materially improving.","Slide seven shows our EPS performance to-date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42 was up 31% year-over-year and above our previously provided outlook of $0.34 to $0.38 due to solid operational performance and favorable other income and expense. OI&E was favorable due to lower interest expense, favorable currency hedging, stronger earnings from HPC and one-time asset sales. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of robust double digit growth in continuing operations, and we continue to outperform the high end of outlook range.","GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.30 well above our previously provided outlook range of $0.19 to $0.23 per share, primarily you to the same reasons for the non-GAAP outperformance and lower than expected transformation costs.","Turning to margins on slides eight and nine, we continue to deliver significant margin expansion as we focus on profitable growth in Hybrid IT, shifting our portfolio towards higher value higher gross margin offerings, and executing HPE Next initiatives. Gross Margin of 32.2% was up 200 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points quarter-over-quarter, the fifth quarter of sequential expansion. Expanding gross margins is very important, as it demonstrates that we have a rich portfolio of software defined offerings of significant value to our customers.","Non-GAAP operating margin of 8.9% was up 70 basis points year-over-year. As mentioned, HPE Next has enabled us to redirect investments back into the business, including a double digit increase year-over-year in R&D to drive organic innovation. ","Now turning to the segment and business units starting on slide 10, in the Intelligent Edge revenue was down 5% year-over-year. While we saw solid growth in EMEA and APJ we underperformed in North America. We're taking action to address several improvement opportunities in our go to market execution and remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity for this business. Operating margins of 3% were down 490 basis points year-over-year due to ongoing investments in sales and R&D, as part of our announced plan to invest $4 billion into the Intelligent Edge in four years.","Aruba product declined 7% due to the execution issues just highlighted in North America and longer sales cycles at some customers. Despite these challenges, we feel very good about our Intelligent Edge strategy and are launching our next generation of Wi-Fi 6 products that are just beginning to sell into the installed base and will ramp more significantly in the upcoming quarters.","Aruba services, was up 18% on continued installed base growth. We will continue to push high-margin Aruba services to represent a higher portion of Aruba's total revenue. This will be a source of continued gross margin expansion for us.","Moving on to slide 11, in Hybrid IT revenue was down 3% year-over-year, but up 2% excluding Tier 1 sale. Operating margins were 11.4%, up 140 basis points year-over-year at a two-year high level. Similarly to Edge we saw some execution weakness in North America and some lengthening sales cycles that slowed our growth in the quarter. Compute revenue was down 4%, but up 4% excluding Tier 1. Most importantly, our higher margin value compute business was up nearly 8% contributing 120 basis points of growth to HPE.","Storage revenue was up 5% year-over-year, which marks our eighth consecutive quarter of growth. This quarter, we saw particular strength in nimble storage, which grew 45% year-over-year. We have also seen significant margin expansion as our customers embrace our intelligent storage offering. We have also made good progress installing InfoSight across three bar, which is now on approximately one third of our installed base and is shipping on all units.","HPE Pointnext revenue declined 3% year-over-year, driven by our continued intentional exit from lower margin countries in the advisory and professional services business. As mentioned on earlier calls this will become less dilutive as the year progresses. Our book to bill ratio was 1.12, which is an indicator of future revenue growth. Operational services orders including nimble services orders grew 1% in constant currency, driven by growth in new attached to our higher value offerings like nimble and increasing adoption of our flexible capacity offerings with GreenLake, which had its best quarter and was up 39% year-over-year.","Moving to slide 12, HPE Financial Services revenue was up 2% year-over-year in constant currency on strengthening our higher margin asset management business. Financing volume was down 6% year-over-year in constant currency, mainly driven by our business with DXC [ph]. We ended the quarter with net portfolio assets of $13 billion and loss ratios continue to be best in class at approximately 50 basis points. ","Operating margins increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 8.6% and return on equity was a robust 15.6%. Our financial services business continues to play a vital role, unlocking value for customers through our traditional leasing offerings, asset management services and flexible consumption offerings with GreenLake that we look to accelerate for years to come.","Turning to cash flow on slide 13, free cash flow was seasonally very strong at $402 million in Q2. This is an improvement of more than $650 million versus the prior year, driven by higher profitability improved, working capital management, and lower one-time payment. Given our performance to-date, and based on our historical ramp up in the second half of the year, we feel confident that we will achieve our full-year outlook of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash. With respect to working capital, the cash conversion cycle was a negative 21 days in Q2, as inventory became a source of cash versus being a use of cash in the same period last year.","Finally, as part of our continued $7 billion capital return plan through fiscal year 2019, we returned $728 million to shareholders during the quarter. We paid $154 million in dividends and repurchased $574 million worth of shares in the quarter.","As you can see from slide 14, our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with an operating company net cash balance of $1.7 billion. Also as a reminder, the vast majority of our debt is associated with the $13 billion book of net portfolio assets of our financing business. With approximately 50 basis points of bad debt as a percentage of average net receivables the underwriting performance of HPEFS is best in class, as a result, the levels of cash support for HPEFS are minimal, which enables HPEFS to generate a high return on financial assets and double digit returns on equity as mentioned before.","Now turning to our outlook on slide 15, as a reminder at SAM we originally guided our non-GAAP FY 2019 EPS outlook to be $1.51 to $1 61. Due to our strong non-GAAP EPS performance in Q1, we raised our full year EPS guidance by $0.05, to $1.56 to $1.66. With our continued outperformance in Q2, we are again raising our EPS guidance for the full year. ","We now expect to finish fiscal year 2019 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.62 to $1.72. And we expect our fiscal year 2019 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.98 to $1.08. This is now the sixth consecutive quarter that we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook. ","For Q3 of fiscal year 2019, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.44. And we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.29 to $0.33. So overall, while we have some work to do in North America sales execution, I am pleased that we continue to make progress against our strategy of shifting our portfolio towards profitable growth that will drive our free cash flow and ultimately, shareholder returns.","Now with that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. ","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good afternoon. First, just a couple of clarifications on EPS in the quarter, what would be the net impact of shipping fewer units into China? And then offset by the higher H3C earnings that flow through OI&E. And similarly, what was the impact of one time asset sales on EPS in the quarter? Then I have a follow up.","Tarek Robbiati","Hi, Katy. When you look at overall, our business in China, you can look at page two and see the contribution it makes from a revenue standpoint. And what comes at the bottom by way of OI&E. What we explained today is that the revenue that comes from the products we sell through H3C is at preferential prices. And therefore you can assume that that revenue is relatively low gross margin. So from the top line side, the impact to the EPS is practically negligible.","Within the OI&E side, you do get the benefit of the equity interest that comes from H3C from selling their products in China plus, of course, our products through their channels in China. And we received a pretty high equity interest in the quarter, but that was not the sole driver for our performance in OI&E, there were other drivers there as well, such as currency hedges, one off asset sales, and of course, the contribution of our H3C business in China. So on the whole, it's a mix of factors that have driven up OI&E. And from the top line, the contribution to EPS growth is negligible.","Katy Huberty","And what was the impact of the one-time asset sales in OI&E?","Tarek Robbiati","Relatively on a EPS standpoint less than $0.01.","Katy Huberty","Okay, thank you. And then just as a follow up, given such strong free cash flow in the quarter, why not raise the full year and flow through that strength? I guess you knew you were going to get that question.","Tarek Robbiati","Yes. It's pretty obvious. The thing we remind ourselves of where we were on a free cash flow basis when we started this fiscal year. In the first quarter we did flag that for the first time working capital would be a contributor to cash in this fiscal year as opposed to a use of cash. So in the performance on a free cash flow basis, you have the three components.","Number one, the cash earnings, which are more stronger thanks to the improvement in gross margin and everything we\u2019ve done from a cash earning standpoint. Number two, the working capital, which is a very important part of the free cash flow equation. And number three, we are having less transformation costs than originally anticipated.","The guidance that we provided on free cash flow is sufficiently wide $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. And we\u2019re comfortable with that level of guidance at this stage, we may want to choose during the course of the year to calibrate some investments. And that's why we're not changing the guidance.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. ","Andrew Simanek","Thank you, Katy. Can we go to the next question, please? ","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Please go ahead with your question. ","Shannon Cross","Thank you very much for taking my question. I just wanted to understand a bit more of what's going on in North America with Aruba? It seems like a pretty abrupt change from a business that was doing pretty well and you were highlighting significantly. So, I guess, if you can give us any more color as to, what went wrong and then the specific steps you're taking to improve the go to market? Thank you.","Antonio Neri","Yeah, thanks for the question. And good afternoon. Listen, we drove solid growth in EMEA and APJ and we continue to see the momentum going. What we uncover in North America was the market dynamic and the demand shifted in different segments of the market. And we have to make some quick adjustments on how we cover those markets where the growth is, understanding that now there is a transition on new technology with Wi-Fi 6 and other software capabilities that we just introduced to the market.","But at the core of the channel was nothing more than making sure our resources and covering the market are in line what the growth is. And there was that. The second was the elongated sales cycles that we saw. And the third one was also the fact that, as people assess what's going on here in North America, particularly with global trade, we saw this elongated cycles in the decision making. And that had an impact on a few deals that shifted from Q2 to Q3. And so that come all together in a way that drove that decline in North America. But I'm really confident, A, number one, we know exactly what it is, and we have taken active action to address it. Number two, is the fact that our products and services are very differentiated. And we feel comfortable about that. But to be fair, we could have executed better in that specific segment of the business. And the good news, we know what to do. And we have put in place the changes that are needed.","Shannon Cross","Okay, thank you. And then, Tarek, can you talk a bit about the gross margin improvement, more on the operational side? I'm curious as to how much you think is sustainable? How much more you think you can do? And again, some of the specific things you're doing maybe within the supply chain to take costs out? Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","Yes, certainly. So expanding gross margins is very important. And I'm glad that you're focusing on it, it demonstrates that we're not a commoditizing business. And there's a lot of richness in the portfolio of software defined offerings we provide to our customers. The trends are very positive, and we expanded gross margins now for five quarters in a row, we\u2019re up to 32.2% in Q2, and this is up 200 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially, if I'm not mistaken.","If you look at what has driven up the improvement, it is primarily pivoting the portfolio mix to higher revenue, rich -- margin rich revenue. That was two thirds of the improvement in gross margin. And the remaining one third came from supply chain efficiencies, the work we're doing with HPE Next, addressing manufacturing overhead and of course, lower commodity costs.","So specifically, to your point, when you're asking about sustainability of that gross margin improvement, it is not prone entirely to commodity costs rising because the revenue mix is shifting to higher differentiated revenue streams that command the gross margin premium. And therefore we feel very good about the upside we have in gross margin overall as we continue to accelerate the pivot of our portfolio towards revenues that are higher gross margin.","Shannon Cross","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Perfect, thanks, Shannon. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. ","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes, thank you. I think on your last earnings call, you had talked about an expectation that revenue growth would accelerate throughout the remainder of the year, and that Aruba\u2019s growth would also accelerate throughout the year. And I hear you that things have changed. I'm just trying to maybe dimension the magnitude. So based on your Aruba statement it feels like you may be missed Aruba by $60 million. You may be missed your top line relative to that statement by $200 million or more. And so, I guess, I'm trying to understand of that other 140, how much of that was something that you think got pushed out because deals didn't close and you'll get them back next quarter? Or how much of that is the reflection of weakening demand? ","And given that trade really only started to rear its head like on after the quarter closed in early May, is that a potential incremental concern or headwind for Q3? So maybe you can help me dimension sort of what the magnitude of kind of the levers that you expressed were in terms of the disappointment relative to your expectations? And then, why don't some of them carry over if they are weaker demand and if we haven't really maybe seen the impact of trade hesitancy in full yet?","Antonio Neri","Yes, Tony, thanks for the question. So, the market dynamics at the beginning of the quarter were certain that we felt we could accelerate. And at the end of the quarter, we saw a different story, because obviously, the uncertainty continued to be in the market. And as I said, that had an impact on elongated sales cycles, which translated in some deals shifting from Q2 to Q3, and those deals will come as we go along.","Definitely, we continue to drive solid growth against our strategic initiatives. And obviously, you saw some of the numbers we quoted with Aruba services and we quoted HCI and compostable cloud and even GreenLake which had the largest quarter ever. But no question we could have executed better in some aspects of this particular on the -- as we said just a minute on the Aruba product in North America. But the reality, I cannot put a specific number associated with each of them was a combination of the market dynamics changing from the beginning of the quarter, some deals slipping to from Q2 to Q3.","And then obviously, some execution aspects that we could have done better. And -- but we believe, we have the handle on the execution challenges, because that are in our control, and we know exactly which segments of the market and we have made or continue to make the changes. But the demand for ever growing amount of data, and the pipeline that we have out there continue to reflect the fact that we actually will continue to deliver on our commitment to some, which is to grow the company and obviously grow the Intelligent Edge, which is, as I said in my opening remark, is a big opportunity for the company.","So, overall, I think, you know, that's how I characterize this quarter. And there are things we have in our controlling and things we have not in our control. But the pipeline, the fact that data continue to explode, and the fact that we have these deals shifting from one quarter to the other give us the understanding and the confidence that we will execute as we go along.","Toni Sacconaghi","Okay, thank you for that. Just to follow-up, I was wondering if you could tell us what operational services revenue growth was in the quarter. And what the operational services order growth rate was, if we exclude nimble, because that's not part of how you define operational services as you report it. And you said last quarter that, this good book-to-bill would help growth rate in operational services. When do you expect operational services to show positive growth?","Tarek Robbiati","Okay, Toni. So overall, we feel good about the long-term opportunity and profitability of Pointnext. Revenue in Q2 was down 3% year-over-year, mainly due to the continued exit of low margin countries in the advisory and professional services business. This will become less dilutive as the year progresses.","Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.12 which is an indicator of future revenue growth. And in my script I've indicated that as GreenLake continues to grow there is an elongation of the cycle that we could see for recognizing the revenues pertaining to Pointnext OS. And we need several quarters off a book-to-bill ratio at current levels to be seeing Pointnext OS, operational services revenue growing.","So when you look at this, what's important and what we do as we drive the book-to-bill ratio to be at or above current levels, we also drive operational services orders in nimble. And when you take the combination of operational services orders plus the nimble services orders the combination grew 1% in constant currency as we have the tailwinds of new attached offerings across our portfolio.","GreenLake is really the only on-prem consumption driven offering in the market and it was up 39% year-over-year plus thing that we also announced the strategic partnership with Google cloud and Nutanix and this is to expand the GreenLake echo systems for several quarters ahead of us. So we feel good about this, it will take us a bit of time, maybe Antonio wanted to add. ","Antonio Neri","Yes, no just a couple of comments, Tony. So our book-to-bill ratio is what I've really measured going forward in each aspects of the portfolio because obviously when you're at these levels over time depending on the mix of what gets booked, it will drive revenue growth. And if you look at our book-to-bill ratio in Q1 was lower than Q2 even though it was above the revenue. So that means we have seen an acceleration of the book-to-bill ratio quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and as that matures becomes in the balance sheet over time you are going to see that balance sheet translated into revenue.","And the other thing let's remind ourselves that GreenLake while it has potentially a longer elongated cycle because of the way the revenue gets recognized, let's remind yourself, it has 100% attach rate of operational services. Every time you sell a GreenLake it comes with hardware and 100% attach of operational services. So, as GreenLake grows, so grows our attach rate and attach rate gets recognized in the traditional way we recognize our deferred revenue for operational services.","So that's why I'm very encouraged and very pleased with the performance of operational services where the book-to-bill ratio and the GreenLake because that drives 100% attach rate.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Tony. Can we get to the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. ","Aaron Rakers","Thanks for taking the question, one question and one quick follow up, as well. First on the server side of the market, I'm just curious of how you are currently seeing component pricing, particularly DRAM pricing flow through the model, whether or not you actively reduce your pricing or if you plan to do so going forward? And kind of underneath to that, how do we think about unit growth within the server category is that -- when do we expect that to maybe trend to the positive?","Antonio Neri","Thanks for the question. So the overall commodity environment continue to be favorable and there is an oversupply now compared to last year's as you recall there was shortages and costs going up. The DRAM prices are down, but let's remind our self that that does not translate in a lower AUP because at the same time we said our AUPs are two third structural because more and more options in the form of memory and flash get attached to these units.","And so we have talked about this before, the fact that units get sold with more and more options even though the AUP of the components go down it does not translate in a lower AUP at the system level and that\u2019s why this quarter we again grew our compute revenue by 4% excluding Tier 1 obviously which we're intentionally declining. And despite the decline on commodity cost and that commodity cost takes time to find its way in the in the system and I always make this analogy, is when the cost goes up is like when you take off with the plane it goes up fast, when you land the plane it takes longer and this is exactly the same way. ","And because our unique portfolio in the compute because we have probably one of the richest portfolio in term of what I call volume and value and in value we have probably the most complete in term of mission critical, in term of in memory solutions HPC, obviously, and things like blade and compostable. We have a unique mix that bright higher value AUPs and higher attach. So it will take long time to get these numbers the lower costs in the system AUP, but at the same time, more and more options will get attached.","The second part of the question was about the units. And now we are in a very low single-digit declines. And as we said before, by the end of the year, we believe this is going to be a non-event and from there on obviously, as we continue to drive this pivot to the higher value products and services, particularly in the product side we're going to see growth in that and we start to see the momentum in some of these areas like I quoted right so compostable cloud 78%, high performance compute continue to be very strong, another 25% growth.","And obviously, as we close the Cray transaction that will add more to it at the larger, larger amount of scale of units, because these are big amount of systems. And then obviously, the hyper converged infrastructure as well, which are the core is a compute platform with a bunch of storage attached to it.","Aaron Rakers","That's perfect. A quick follow-up, you mentioned in the call that you obviously have this put option for the H3C asset, I think at 15 times trailing 12 months net income that actually equates to a relatively large number. So I'm curious of how you think about evaluating that put option relative to the strategic nature of that relationship or how you just think about that with that now being on the table?","Antonio Neri","Yes, look, it's important to realize that China is a very critical market for us. It's the largest and fastest growing IT market in the world. And we have a unique structure there with a fully operational business that makes money. And it's a structure that not many Western companies can actually claim they have.","Starting May 2019, we can exercise that put option to sell part or all of our 49% stake. And if you take the minimum of the put value at 15 times trailing 12 months and earnings you get to the figures that you have in mind. But it's important to understand the contribution of H3C to the overall profit pools at UNIS, which is a listed company in China is actually generating and what is that contribution of UNIS underneath H3C on a niche unit, alongside the other entities that UNIS has. And I invite you to just take a look at this and you will form your own view as to the value of our put and what it represents for us.","So, let me add a commentary on this. I mean, obviously there is a financial aspects of this and then there is the strategic aspect of this. We are incredibly pleased with this relationship and the setup in China. And it has proven to be very important and critical in the times we are living today. Because we can participate in the second largest market growing faster than any other market. And so, we are actually collecting the benefits of that growth in a unique setup that shows up in our EPS growth as we talked earlier.","And obviously we have to assess a couple of things right, how that market evolves and how we participate in the market. Ultimately, what is the source of a potential use of that cash to continue to drive the growth in the company. Right now, as we said, in the opening remarks, we have no intent to sell the put option. But as always, we will continue to evaluate what is the best for the company, for our shareholders, understanding what's going on in that market and understanding how we continue to participate.","Aaron Rakers","Thank you. ","Andrew Simanek","Perfect. Thanks, Aaron. So we're coming up on the bottom of the hour. So I think we have time for just one more question, please.","Operator","And our final question today comes from Jim Suva from Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. I have one question and it's probably the CEO and CFO both want to chime in on it. But it appears that on this conference call you were a lot more vocal about the H3C operations, put options, especially to put options have been in the past. And maybe I'm just hearing that a little different. But it seems like you're a lot more vocal about that. Why is that? Is that because of the China U.S. friction? Or is that because of perhaps a lot of the guide and beat was due to this other income line? Or how should we think about, it appears to be a change in the verbalization around this line item on your income statement? Thank you.","Antonio Neri","Thanks for the question. I think, we felt that it was a need to provide more clarity and education on our setup. Honestly, as I go back, and listen to the type of questions and so forth, we felt we probably haven't done a good job explaining this setup and the value of this unique relationship. That's why we decided to show it to you. It has nothing to do with the U.S. China relationship. It had to do to how we drive value for shareholders. And we believe this is driving significant value for shareholders. But we didn't explain it to the extent that Tarek did today, because we felt, we didn't do a good job before. So that's why we're bringing it up.","And it just happened at the same time, with everything going on in China. Now, probably people will think, well, maybe the setup is unique and it's more valuable in the context of what we see. But really, it was all about educating you in understanding this setup in the context of the valuation and the value we drive for our shareholders. And I thought Tarek did a very good job explaining that. Because it's very unique, we don't see anything out there like this. Tarek, I don't know if you want to add anything else. ","Tarek Robbiati","Absolutely. I will simply add that this is -- at the beginning of this month this is the first time where we can exercise the put option. And that's the reason why we talked to you about it today.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for the details, that make sense. I appreciate it.","Antonio Neri","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Jim. I think with that we can close out the call. I know there's a heavy earning scheduled today. So appreciate everybody join us and we'll look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you."],"10813":["Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call May 31, 2017  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Andy Simanek - Head, IR","Meg Whitman - President and CEO","Tim Stonesifer - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein","Jim Suva - Citi","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Maynard Um - Wells Fargo","Shannon Cross - Cross Research","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Operator","Good afternoon, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2017 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Earnings Conference Call.","My name is Lawson, and I\u2019ll be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Andy Simanek","Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fiscal 2017 second quarter earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.","For a discussion of some of these of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE\u2019s filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE\u2019s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2017.","Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Throughout this conference call all revenue growth rates unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and beginning with fiscal year 2016 are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency.","We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE\u2019s operational performance, given the significant divestitures we\u2019ve recently completed, including the sale of 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our website for details.","With that, let me turn it over to Meg.","Meg Whitman","Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today.","As you know, during the past year and half, we've made significant progress in strengthening HPE to compete and win well into the future. We've been marching towards becoming a smaller, nimbler and financially stronger company that is more committed to customers and partners than ever before.","With this call in mind, we separated from HPI in November of 2015 and last month, we spun our enterprise services business and merged it with CSC to form DXC Technology. Completing this transaction was a major milestone in our strategy and I'm proud that we were able to execute such a significant change within the tight schedule we laid out and on budget.","Later this summer, we'll complete the spin merger of our software business. The two spin merger transactions will deliver more than $20 billion in value based on the current stock prices of the DXC and Micro Focus.","We've also made a number of strategic acquisitions in key growth segments of the market that are directly aligned with the three pillars of our strategy. In November, we acquired SGI, which has cemented our leadership position in the high-performance computing market, which is growing 6% to 8% per year.","Earlier this year, we acquired SimpliVity, a leader in hyperconverged, a market growing 25% per year. Niara, a leader in network security that uses machine learning and big data to discover network attacks. We'll make Aruba even stronger.","Cloud Cruiser brings IT consumption analytic to our flexible capacity services offering, giving customers clear insight into IT usage and spend and the ability to effectively plan and manage their IT systems and with the addition of Nimble, we now have a complete world-class flash storage portfolio from entry-level to the high end in a market growing around 17% per year.","Nimble also brings a simple user experience platform based on predictive analytics that we plan to roll out across our storage portfolio. These were all the right strategic moves for HPE's long-term success, but they were not done in a vacuum. In fact, we've been reengineering our company while facing challenging market conditions, including stiff competition, unfavorable foreign exchange movements and industry-wide commodities constraints.","All these challenges have only made us fight harder. In fiscal Q2, we delivered results in line with our outlook, but just as important, we also have shown growth in key areas that portend well for HPE's future.","Total Q2 revenue was $9.9 billion, which includes revenue from both continuing operations e.g. financial services and software, as well as two months of enterprise services, which has now accounted for in discontinued operations.","Revenue from continuing operations of $7.4 billion was down 5% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures and currency, driven mainly by reduced server demand from a single tier 1 customer and lower license and professional services sales in software, but absent tier 1 server sales, the future HPE, which excludes enterprise services and software, delivered revenue growth of approximately 1% driven by continued strength in key growth areas.","For example, we saw a 20% organic growth in high-performance compute where we are well positioned. All flash storage revenue grew 33% as enterprises move more workloads to flash in order to take advantage of its performance and low latency benefits.","Aruba continued to perform well driven by 32% growth in wireless solutions and technology services, which includes our new services brand, Pointnext grew for the fourth consecutive quarter up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong customer demand for our advisory and transformation services as well as data center care.","And we overcame most of the execution challenges we discussed on the Q1 call, in particular core servers stabilized with revenue down only 1% globally.","Finally, I'm excited about our rapidly growing partnerships with system integrators. While DXC remains a very strong partner to us, we are seeing accelerating demand from other system integrators following the spin of ES.","In fact, our overall revenue through these alliance partners saw strong growth in the quarter, up double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific and with certain partners in North America. Our Indian SI partners grew by more than 20% year-over-year, driven by strength in the financial sector, strong demand for our flexible capacity offering as well as the first placements of synergy.","Turning to margins, as we discussed on the Q1 call, margins in EG continue to be pressured by DRAM pricing, currency and short-term dilution from recent acquisitions. We also experienced a very competitive pricing environment, which we expect to continue.","Tim will talk more about margins in the quarter and going forward; however, let me say that we believe we experienced the worst of the margin pressure in Q2. We believe the situation will improve as we move through the end of the year as we work to mitigate the increased commodity prices and we eliminate stranded costs from the spin mergers and acquisitions.","And now that we've completed the ES spin merger, we're taking a fresh look at the cost structure for the new HPE. As a smaller company, it should be much easier to spot opportunities to optimize the business, streamline processes and reduce costs.","We believe we can take out another $200 million to $300 million in cost in just the second half of this year. Tim will talk more about this in a minute.","With all of that, we delivered non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $0.35 at the midpoint of our previously provided outlook. Looking forward, I remain confident in our strategy for the go-forward HPE. We remain focused on creating a nimbler, faster moving company, committed to the three strategic pillars that are aligned with where the market is moving.","First, we make hybrid IT sample. We help customers and partners build the right mix of intelligent software-defined infrastructure that provides speed and agility for business innovation while also reducing cost. For example, high-performance compute is increasingly the answer to managing the expanding amounts of data being created every day.","We are seeing strong demand from companies like global chemical company BASF, which recently selected HPE to build one of the world's largest supercomputers based on HPE's Apollo Systems.","We also announced an extended partnership with Nvidia to create a portfolio of solutions and services, purpose built for artificial intelligence and deep learning and we continue to be the leading SAP HANA infrastructure and services provider with two times the market share of our next closest rival.","Our continued investment in HANA Solutions coupled with our 28-year alliance with SAP, is helping us break into new accounts and drive incremental revenue.","On the storage front, we are seeing a rapid shift to all-flash. We're extremely well-positioned here given our leading three-part portfolio and the recent Nimble and SimpliVity acquisition. Just last week, we announced a full refresh of our storage portfolio, designed to give our customers even more options at a variety of price points to help aid their transition to flash storage and we continue to gain momentum with synergy, the industry's first composable infrastructure platform.","We now have nearly 400 customers like DreamWorks, Redbox and HudsonAlpha, who have installed Synergy and we expect that to continue to ramp into the end of the year.","The second pillar of our strategy is to power the intelligent edge that will run campus branch and industrial IOT applications. Aruba is at the core of this pillar and we've seen accelerating momentum as Aruba leverages HPE's go-to-market.","In Q2, Aruba's wireless business grew at three times the market rate with strong demand across industry segments. For example, we had a significant win with the leading global fast-food company as well as major wins in retail, healthcare and education and remember that these Aruba installations pull through high-margin services, often up to twice the value of the hardware and software.","As industrial IOT takes off, we're also seeing strong demand for our Edgeline converged systems, which offer compute, storage and analytics at the edge, fully integrated with traditional, operational, technologies such as control and data capture system and industrial networks.","Given its small form factor and low energy consumption, Edgeline has been in high demand for the distributed applications that will drive industrial IOT, well of a small base, Edgeline saw significant growth in Q2 and we are seeing a number of promising proof-of-concept programs with major institutions across retail, manufacturing, transportation and smart cities in particular.","Finally, we are focused on providing world-class expertise and flexible consumption models to help customers transform their IT environment. HPE Pointnext draws on the expertise of more than 25,000 specialists in 80 countries covering 30 languages and spanning a range of disciplines from cloud consulting to operational services experts.","These teams collaborate with businesses worldwide to speed their adoption of emerging technologies, including cloud computing and hybrid IT, big data and analytics, the intelligent edge and Internet of things.","We're also seeing strong demand for our datacenter care as customers look to consolidate their datacenter footprints and flexible capacity, which delivers cloudlike consumption models with on premises solutions.","During the quarter, we continue to invest in each of these three key areas. As you know, one of the projects we are most excited about is the Machine, which is an entirely new computing architecture that puts memory at the core and in May, we announced the latest milestone in our machine research projects, a powerful prototype that connects 160 terabytes of memory to 1,280 processor cores.","In other words, an amount of memory that would hold 80,000 human genomes and simultaneously run anomaly detection algorithms on every core and while this is impressive, the most exciting thing about this milestone is that it demonstrates the ability to scale the architecture to a potentially limitless pool of memory, which is the secret to delivering scientific breakthroughs, industry-changing innovation or life altering technology for the mountains of data we create every day.","So overall, despite some current headwinds, I remain very confident in our strategy. We will continue to invest in our three strategic pillars; hybrid IT, the intelligent edge and our Pointnext services model and we will continue to find efficiencies and productivity in the new HPE that will allow us to run the company more profitably with each passing quarter.","Next week you'll see some exciting product announcements during our Annual Discover Conference in Las Vegas with thousands of customers and partners join us from around the world for three days of inspiration, learning and networking. I hope to see many of you there.","With that, let me turn it over to Tim.","Tim Stonesifer","Thanks Meg. As discussed, while our overall performance in Q2 was impacted by tough markets and the external factors I discussed last quarter, we continue to drive growth in our higher margin businesses and align our cost structure with the future HPE operating structure.","Total revenue for the quarter was $9.9 billion. This includes $2.5 billion for two months of enterprise services, which is not reported in discontinued operations. Revenue from continuing operations of $7.4 billion was down 5% adjusted for divestitures and currency driven by declines in software and tier 1 server sales.","If you exclude software and tier 1 and consider just the future HPE, revenue was actually up 1%. I'll dive into the business segment performance in a minute.","From a macro perspective, we continue to see competitive pricing and a challenging commodities environment. Currency remained unfavorable and was an 80-basis point year-over-year headwind to revenue. HPE's performance in the U.S. was stable excluding tier 1 servers as core servers improved and strong growth and networking was offset by a challenging storage market.","Revenue in Europe continue to be weak driven by the U.K. although strong results in Germany helped the region. APJ was mixed with good performance in Japan and India, more than offset by broad softness in the rest of Asia.","Turning to margins, gross margin of 33.8% was down 200 basis points year-over-year and down 240 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit of 7.8% was down 130 basis points year-over-year and down 270 basis points sequentially.","As Meg discussed EG margins were negatively impacted by increased DRAM pricing, currency, stranded costs and short-term dilution from the recent acquisitions, as well as a very competitive pricing environment. I'll discuss these in further detail in context of the enterprise group.","Combined non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.35 was at the midpoint of our outlook of $0.33 to $0.37. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.25 and $0.10 was from discontinued operations.","Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations primarily excludes pretax amounts for separation charges of $141 million, restructuring charges of $118 million and amortization of intangible assets of $107 million.","GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was negative $0.37 below our previously provided outlook range of negative $0.03 to negative $0.07, primarily due to a one-time non-cash GAAP-only valuation allowance of our U.S. state domestic deferred tax assets resulting from the changes were legal structure related to the spinoff of enterprise services.","As a reminder, this was similar in nature to the HPE-HPI separation and discussed as part of our first quarter earnings announcements, but not integrated in our GAAP EPS outlook.","Now turning to the results by business. In the enterprise group, revenue was down 7% in a tough market with continued commodities pricing pressure. However, EG revenue grew slightly year-over-year when adjusted for tier 1 sales, driven by several areas of encouraging growth across the portfolio.","Aruba was up 27%. Three part all-flash arrays were up 33%. High-performance compute grew more than 40% with SGI in over 20% organically and technology services was up 3%. These are some of the areas of the business that we expect to drive profit expansion and topline growth for the future of HPE.","That said, operating margins were down 300 basis points year-over-year and 390 basis points sequentially to 8.8%. The margin declines can be broken out into three categories. First, we had structural changes including the year-over-year impact from our H3C divestiture. We now report our remaining stake in equity interests below the operating profit statement line.","Q2 will be the last quarter we have a significant compare issue for EG margins related to H3C. Also, we now have stranded costs of our previously allocated to enterprise services, which are now hitting the enterprise group results. These stranded costs are most acute immediately following the spinoff and we will quickly work them down to zero on a run rate basis by the end of the fiscal year.","Second, we have the short-term dilution impact from our recent acquisitions of SGI, Nimble and SimpliVity. We're moving quickly to reduce their costs. So, all of these acquisitions are accretive in fiscal year '18 and third and most significantly, we continue to be impacted by elevated commodities cost in DRAM and a year-over-year headwind from currency.","The pricing environment was also increasingly difficult and hindered our ability to raise prices as an offset. We anticipate the impact from commodities will remain significant in the near-term, but we believe we can begin to mitigate it as we move towards the end of the year.","Given these margin pressures, we're taking significant steps to optimize the cost structure of the future HPE and believe we can drive an incremental $200 million to $300 million in cost savings in just the second half of this year. These savings will be a combination of tight control over spending and simplifying the organization through delayering and spend control actions as we become a smaller, more nimble company.","Server revenue declined 14% primarily due to tier 1 as we deemphasize the category to focus on more profitable areas. While we'll continue to focus on strengthening our go-to-market, integrating the recent acquisitions into your portfolio and driving targeted organic R&D, we are making solid progress since our stabilization in more profitable core servers, which declined less than 1%.","Storage revenue declined 13% driven by continued challenging markets and tight SSD supplies. However, we do expect to maintain share in the high-growth all-flash portion of the market. Our all-flash array growth accelerated this quarter and was up 33% year-over-year and results were still meaningfully impacted by SSD supply constraints.","The supply constraints will likely linger in the near-term, which we expect to loosen towards the end of the year. Also, encouragingly, all-flash still has a relatively low penetration rate in the data center and with the recent acquisition of Nimble and the portfolio refresh announced last week, we believe we are very well-positioned to accelerate our customer's journeys to an all-flash datacenter.","Networking revenue grew 14% driven by Aruba Wireless Solution, which was up over 30%. Aruba was especially strong in North America with over 100 new logo wins and is expected to take more than two point of share worldwide adjusted for H3C.","HPE's campus and branch switching business delivered mid-single digit growth demonstrating that it's combination with Aruba is working. We've also stabilized the datacenter networking business, which grew slightly.","Technology services, which includes our newly launched the Pointnext business as well as Aruba Services and CMS, remains a bright spot with revenue up 3%. Orders also grew year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter giving us strong confidence that TS will grow through the current fiscal year.","We saw a strong order performance in consulting with particular strength in network and data center as well as commercial media solutions. We again improved service intensity or attach dollars per unit, which helps offset pressure from declining hardware unit sales.","HPE Financial Services revenue grew 11%, its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, driven primarily by one-time lease conversions and an increase in operating lease mix. We've been pleased with the performance of financial services as it has become strategically more important to our customers as they increasingly value flexible consumption models.","Operating profit declined 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%, reflecting the increased operating lease mix. Financing volume declined 7% due to the indirect business and return on equity was up 60 basis points year-over-year to 13.5%.","Software revenue was down 9% as declines in license and professional services more than offset growth in SaaS as the team works through a transition to Micro Focus. The team continue to focus on disciplined cost controls, leading to an operating margin of 26.4%. This is a 160-basis point improvement year-over-year as reported and their improvement is over 10 points when adjusted for one-time items last year, including the TippingPoint divestiture gain.","And now to cash flow; free cash flow was better than expected at negative $64 million. However, this was artificially high since we accrued approximately $300 million for enterprise services payroll ending March 31 that was paid by DXC and we expect to repay that in the second half.","The cash conversion cycle now reflects the removal of enterprise services and was negative 12 days down one day sequentially.","Turning to capital allocation, during the quarter we paid $107 million in dividend payments and repurchased $670 million of outstanding shares. We've now returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the first-half of fiscal year '17, aligned to our $3 billion full year commitment.","Moving to our two spin merge transactions, we completed our ES CSC spin merge transactions on April 1 on schedule and on budget. The software Micro Focus transaction is also progressing as planned and we continue to anticipate the transaction closing on September 1.","We are making progress removing stranded costs and continue to anticipate a $0.06 diluted EPS impact in fiscal year '17 with all costs eliminated on a run rate basis by the end of the year.","Turning to our outlook, the seasonality of EPS will be more backend loaded given the stranded costs and M&A dilution will be worked down over time. Also, the majority of the $200 million to $300 million of incremental cost savings will come in Q4.","Also keep in mind that our outlook reflects the company as it stands today, with a partial year contributions from ES and a full year contributions from software, since we haven't yet closed that transaction. As is our typical practice, we will update our outlook when we close the software transaction.","With that we expect Q3 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.24 to $0.28. From a GAAP perspective, we expect Q3 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of negative $0.02 to positive $0.02.","For the full-year, we are holding to our prior fiscal year '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook of $1.46 to $1.56. From a GAAP perspective, we expect fiscal year '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of negative $0.03 to $0.07.","Finally, turning to cash flow outlook, as previously mentioned, we anticipate paying DXC approximately $300 million in the second half for the ES payroll ending March 31. Also, we expect to pay DXC an incremental $300 million in the second half for agreed-upon balance sheet adjustments, primarily related to working capital.","This incremental payment will not reduce our overall cash balances as our ES pension funding requirements were less than expected by roughly the same amount. In total, we continue to expect full year fiscal year '17 free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion.","Overall while this quarter presented some challenges, like Meg, I'm confident that our plan is the right long-term strategy to position the future HPE for success.","Now let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner","Hi. Thank you. If we look at the midpoint of your 3Q guidance and the midpoint of your full-year guidance, it suggests an EPS for 4Q of somewhere around $0.45 which is a pretty significant acceleration versus the 3Q guidance.","Can you give a little bit of detail on how you get to that number? Is that primarily the cost cutting that you're seeing and some of that accelerated cost that you can take out or maybe give us a little detail on why you're confident you can hit that number?","Tim Stonesifer","Sure Sherri. So first of all, just to remind everybody, the full-year guide includes a partial year for ES and a full year for software. So, it may be easiest to start with Q2. So Q2 we ended up with an EPS of $0.35, now $0.10 of that was related to ES, which was in discontinued operations.","So, when you move from Q2 to Q3, that's relatively flat and basically what you're seeing there is the impact and the pressure from the stranded costs, from the short-term dilution of the acquisitions and some of the commodity cost pressures. Those are being offset by the second-half cost actions okay.","And then to your point, when you go from through 3Q to 4Q, you'd see that would imply about a $0.19 improvement quarter-over-quarter and there is really three elements to that. The first one is just typical seasonality.","So, if you were to go look at last year's results, we saw a similar uplift in Q3 to Q4. Same thing in 2015, we would anticipate that same type of lift due to seasonality in Q4 of this year. If you just think about the software business as an example, Q4 is typically much higher than Q3.","The second component of it is as we eliminate the stranded costs and as we get right size the cost envelopes around the acquisitions, that will be favorable in Q4 and then thirdly, is a $200 million to $300 million of cost out. So, the way I would think about that is roughly a third of that will come in Q3 and then two thirds of that will come in Q4 and that's what's going to drive the remainder of the lift. So that's why you see that ramp up in Q4.","Sherri Scribner","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful and then looking at the operating margin in EG, it's a little disappointing. Can you give us a little more detail on which segment that came from? Is it related to the weakness in the server market? I would assume it would not be that much related to servers given that a lot of that is tier 1 which doesn't have a lot of margin. So, is it more a result of the weakness in the storage market? Thank you.","Tim Stonesifer","Yeah. We don't really give BU specific guidance on the margins, but yeah, I would say servers is driving a component of that and again the way I think about it as we talked about in the prepared remarks is there's a component of that that's structural. There's a component of that that's one-time cost and then you have the operational headwinds, which is primarily the commodities cost increases. Again, most of that is memory. So that has a heavy impact on the server margin.","Meg Whitman","I think the other thing I would add to that is we believe that the worst is over from a margin pressure perspective in Q2 and we expect year-ago levels by Q4 as the structured -- the structural challenges that Tim mentioned roll-off as does the one-time acquisition dilution that goes away. So, what you're left with is the more normal business challenges that we all have where it's commodity price increases or whatever and then of course obviously the $200 million to $300 million of cost reduction also helps the margin.","Andy Simanek","Great. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have -- go to the next question please?","Operator","Next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes. Thank you. I wanted to revisit that operating margin question. My understanding from the conference call last quarter was that you expected the enterprise group to be pretty similar in Q2 to Q1 both from a revenue and from a profitability perspective and there was a dramatic downturn in profitability sequentially 390 basis points.","And I understood your bridge Tim, but many of the things you noted like H3C divestiture you had in Q1 or the acquisition impact you had most of that in Q1 the stranded costs I think were very visible to you. And so, I guess my question is was this simply incremental competition that didn't allow you to raise prices in the way that you thought or what changed and as I think about like a reality check if TS is 30% your business in EG and has 30% margins, that means everything else is zero profitability today, pre-overhead allocations and with overhead allocations, it's negative and how do we reconcile such dramatically weak levels of profitability?","Tim Stonesifer","Okay. I think there are a few questions in there. So, let me see what I can do. So, I think to your point, we did on the Q1 call, we did think that revenues would stabilize. We did not say that margins would stabilize and again if you're going through a quarter-over-quarter walk, to your point, stranded cost is a big element of that. We did not see that in Q1 obviously because we just separated the ES business in March.","So, all the overhead that we were allocating to ES in Q1, a lot of that was being allocated to EG. There is some FX impact. Again, we were hedged from an FX perspective in Q1 from the prior hedges that we put on in Q4. So, there was some pressure driven by that.","There was also some dilution in the acquisitions which we really didn't -- we didn't talk about in Q1, nor did we have that pressure. That gave us some pressure from an overall margin perspective.","DRAM is causing a pressure point. We did know about that in Q1. To your point, we talked about that. Obviously, that's why we took our guide down, but if you look at memory costs in 2Q, they're actually up another 10%. So, we saw a big increase in Q1 that was when we got the 40% and 50% lift, but those have continued to go up in Q2. So that drives some incremental pressure.","And then from a pricing point, we did go out with global price increases, but to be honest with you, the results were mixed. We saw some traction in APJ and those came in in line with what we thought they would. When you look at the Americas, we did not gain as much traction as we had anticipated, particularly in the U.S. and that's driven by some very difficult competitive behaviors and challenges.","We saw those same types of competitive dynamics in EMEA as well. So, the overall pricing mitigation that we had talked about I'd say came in lighter than we had expected. And then lastly you have typical seasonality from Q2 to Q1 or from Q1 to Q2.","So that's driving a lot of the variation from quarter to quarter. Now to get to your question on product margins, yes if you look at TS, the good news with TS is it's been very stable over the years not only from a revenue perspective but also for a margin perspective. So, we expect that stabilization to continue as we go forward.","Given the pressures that I just walked through between stranded costs, short-term dilution, DRAM pricing, yes, margins were pressured in Q2 and product margins would be negative.","Now as I think about how do we progress going forward and to Meg's point earlier, we think 2Q is going to be a low point and basically that's driven by the fact that one, we're going to work out the stranded costs. Again, those will be that zero on a run rate basis.","By the time we exit Q4, we will have time to right size the cost envelopes to the appropriate levels on the Nimble and SimpliVity acquisitions and then lastly, we've got the $200 million to $300 million of cost that we've targeted to come out in the second half.","Again, I think a third of that will come out in Q3 and two thirds of that will come out in Q4. So, as we take those cost out and the other thing that we should get is we should get a mix lift. As we continue to grow the higher margin businesses, HPC up 20% organically, all-flash array up 33%, Aruba up 27%. Obviously, those parts of the portfolio carry a higher margin. So, we should get a margin lift going forward. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color.","Andy Simanek","Great. Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. In the press release as well as the prepared remarks, you mentioned several times the excluding the tier 1 server sales, can you just help us understand strategically is that just you guys at Hewlett Packard Enterprise have strategically decided to shift away from that? Is it permanent share loss, timing, absorption. Is this something we should expect to have you call out many times in the future quarters to come or one-time in nature because last quarter it came up and now hear it again? How should we just think about this huge issue of excluding tier 1 server sales, thank you?","Meg Whitman","Yeah, so tier 1 service provider is a segment that we entered I think maybe 18 months ago, two years ago and we are heavily dependent on one customer. So, we're doing a couple of things. We anticipate that one customer to continue to - purchases to decline and so this tier 1 rationale or the way we talk about is going to continue for the next couple of quarters because it's a pretty big number.","We're doing a couple things, one is we're really thinking hard about what the future strategy is for tier 1. We continue to get new tier 1 customers, but this is low calorie business actually and so we need to think through does it make sense to continue that business on a go-forward basis or are we better off actually putting our selling resources and our R&D resources against more margin-rich sustainable profitability.","But the answer is yes, there will be I think for another at least a couple of quarters, there will be the explanation of what does our server business look like ex tier 1, which we think is a better -- gives you all a better understanding of what's happening with that one customer and then what's happening with the rest of the core industry-standard server business.","Jim Suva","Are there other tier 1 server customers besides that one that we should think about?","Meg Whitman","It's the vast majority is with one, there is a few others and we're building out some more tier 1 customers, but fundamentally the strategic question is, is this a business we really want to be in because we're not in the business for share, for share's sake. We're in it to get a return on our investment dollars and right now that doesn't look like a particularly productive segment for us.","Jim Suva","Thanks for the details, much appreciated.","Andy Simanek","Thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Katy Huberty","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. I appreciate that in the original guidance, but have you contemplated the ideal of removing $200 million to $300 million post the ES transaction or is that incremental work to offset the memory cost that surprised you this year and then just as a follow-on to that.","How should we think about incremental cost takeout as we -- how did the next year post the software divestiture is that $200 million to $300 million run rate or more like $400 million tto $600 million for the full-year the right run rate to think about for next year?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, sure Katy. So, I'll answer the first piece and then Meg you can jump in here. From a cost perspective, the $200 million to $300 million is incremental and it is all in the second half. So, as you know, we're always looking at cost. Now we're trying to be and we continue to be very sensitive to protecting our R&D, protecting our sales costs.","But net-net, particularly given the spinoff and now the fact that we have 110,000 fewer people and we've had a little bit of time under our belt to operate in the new model if you will, we do think there are opportunities and there are going to be opportunities in the usual suspects.","So, if you think about just tighter spending around travel, around optimizing programs spend, around tighter policy enforcement, we think there's more work to do there and we can continue to do that, but there's also an opportunity to simplify.","So, if you think about now as a standalone or as a remain co. if you will, you have the global structural versus the regional, versus the country. You have spanning control, you have all those types of things. Those are the things that we're having better line of sight on and that's some of the cost that we will address in the second half the year and Meg do you have anything else to put on it?","Meg Whitman","Yeah, I think Katy, if you cast all the way back up, we have just gone through one of the largest transformations may be in American business history. We've created four industry-leading companies that I think are poised to do very well in their given segments and so now we are very focused on the go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise financial architecture.","And I think there's a couple things Tim said it well, we now need to look at that cost structure and say what is the process reengineering we need to do? What are some of the policy decisions we need to make upstream to be a much more efficient, leaner company that we can really see the productivity benefits and Tim mentioned simplification. There's lots we can do here.","So, I am -- we are now in a different stage. I can see this very clearly now that ES is gone, software is on its way and of course HPI has been on its own for 18 months. So, we're at that next stage that I think we can have a major impact in how we run this company more efficiently and leanly.","So were super excited about it. It's going to be a lot of work because whenever you restructure a company, it's a lot of work, but I can see it very clearly. Now I want to say one thing is that we will not be adding to the restructuring dollars that we had already laid out for you.","So, remember there are $700 million of restructuring in cash payment in this year, another $200 million in '18. We may pull that $200 million in depending we're still working on that, but any incremental cost savings will be funded through the P&L. There will be no more restructuring dollars, which I think is an important point to make because I remember many of you especially when we owned ES and said this is sort of the perennial restructuring that actually is not going to be the case going forward.","Andy Simanek","Great. Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Maynard Um","Hi thanks. On the server business, can you just help us with the expectations over the next couple quarters. You'll have SimpliVity for another full quarter, you'll have synergy ramping and the alliances look like they're growing. Do you think that gets you back to flattish type growth in Q3 and Q4 and then I have a follow-up?","Tim Stonesifer","Sure. As synergy comes online, as we continue to grow particularly if you think about high-performance compute and some of the areas of the portfolio, again excluding tier 1, from a year-over-year component, we would expect to return back to growth in the latter part of the year.","Maynard Um","Great. And then on the storage side, how long do you think it will take to fully integrated the Nimble storage to be ready from a go-to-market and channel perspective and when do you think we start to see the ramp in storage from Nimble, thanks?","Meg Whitman","So, we're working hard to integrate Nimble into our data center storage sales teams. SimpliVity is all the way in both from an R&D perspective and as a sales perspective. Nimble R&D is going to merge with three par R&D to be a more powerful storage R&D team.","And then we're just about now ramping Nimble into our data center storage business. What's interesting about Nimble is there are some markets where Nimble actually had quite a good position. There are some markets where Nimble is not at all. So, we're actually building from scratch in a number of those markets, which is great actually.","But I'd say certainly by the end of this quarter, Nimble will be firmly integrated into our go-to-market motion and I think you'll start to see the ramp. Interestingly, what we saw with Aruba, what we saw with SimpliVity and what we believe we will see with Nimble is actually being part of the HP family helps accelerate those wins.","There's many customers who said, we would not have considered Nimble as a standalone independent company without being part of HPE. Actually, I think Aruba would tell you the same thing. We're winning deals there because they're part of the family. SimpliVity, we're winning deals there because they recognize that it actually holds into our overall offering and you're not purchasing an island.","In other words, a completely new technology that's unconnected to the rest of your data center. There is actually it's part of the family of HPE infrastructure. So that's worked really well for us and I think you're going to see Nimble ramp through the end of the year nicely.","Andy Simanek","Great. Thank you, Maynard. Can we -- let's go the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Shannon Cross","Yes. Thank you for taking the question. Can you talk a bit about your cash usage strategy? Obviously, you made several acquisitions over the last few quarters and you've had cash come in from both sometimes operating cash flow as well as what you've got from the divestitures.","So how are you thinking about cash as you sort of normalize it out? Has there been any change and how are you thinking about acquisitions given all the ones that you have that you're now integrating and then I have a follow-up? Thank you.","Tim Stonesifer","Sure. So, I'll give it a shot and Meg you can jump in here. So again, I think our strategy is still the same. We are going to continue to focus on organic investments because where we do that well and we do it right, it's good for customers, it's good for shareholders, it's good for partners, it's good for employees.","We always continue to look at share buybacks. Obviously, we're bias toward share buybacks right now. And then we're going to continue to look at M&A as long as it fulfills gaps in our strategy. So, the way we think about M&A again as being very consistent and it's all around complementary IP, where we can leverage our distribution and drive profitable growth.","So, it's all returns based. That a framework that's worked well for us in the last 12 to 18 months and I would expect us to continue to operate within that framework going forward.","Meg Whitman","No. I don't have much to add to that. The only think I would say is as we think about innovation, as Tim said, our first choice is organic innovation, think synergy. We will also look at innovation coming from M&A, but as Tim said, it's return based.","We have to buy it right. It has to be complementary technology that can leverage our distribution channels and then the third area is actually our Pathfinder program where we make small investments in new generation companies that we're not to be a venture capital company. I'm not looking for venture returns there. I'm looking for companies that further our strategy powering hybrid IT, powering the intelligent edge and the services that we can weave into our solution.","So, for example Docker, Mesosphere, Chef are all woven now into HPE one view. That makes HPE one view much more valuable to our customers, actually creates beginnings of a new stack as a control plane for hybrid IT and is actually good for those small companies and doesn't require us to outlay $300 billion, $500 billion, $600 billion for relatively unproven technology.","So that's the way we think of it and it's been a cultural change for the company because we're used to selling only what we own, but actually this Pathfinder programs has been great success. I think it's a differentiator for Hewlett Packard Enterprise because in some ways what we do is we curate Silicon Valley for our enterprise customers.","Shannon Cross","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then my second question is just as we think about Remain Co given all of the moving parts, then you talked about EPS ranges in the past and that, is there any shifting around given the accelerated restructuring versus maybe the pressure from component or from a server standpoint that we should take into account as we look forward past '17?","Tim Stonesifer","So, if you look at Remain Co. and again I'll take you back to Sam, we guided a $1.25 to $1.35 from an EPS perspective and we had normalized free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion. Now obviously we took that number down or we took our number down in total by $0.12 that was in Q1 that was driven by some of the FX pressures we saw, some of the commodity cost pressures we saw as well some execution issues that we were working through.","So, as I look at those three categories, those were all primarily EG related. So, I would adjust the $1.25 to $1.35 by that $0.12 and then I would also adjust your $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion of normalized free cash flow. I would take that down to roughly $2 billion of normalized free cash flow to reflect the earnings pressure.","So that will give you sort of a baseline as we exit '17 of about $1.13 to $1.23 and I think there are two or three areas that are going to impact that you need to think about as we move forward. The first one is commodity cost movements and the corresponding pricing mitigation.","Again, as we talked about earlier we are making traction in that we anticipate an APJ, but we're finding it very difficult in the Americas and EMEA. So, depending on how that equation plays out, that would have an impact on your baseline.","From the second-half cost actions, the $200 million to $300 million that we talked about, to the extent that a piece of that is recurring, which we would expect, that would also impact your baseline going forward and then when you look at the rightsizing, the cost envelopes particularly around the acquisitions, that should provide a little bit of accretion going forward.","So that's how I would think about the baseline for Remain Co. from both a cash and EPS perspective and we will give much more guidance and clarity and visibility at SAM in October.","Shannon Cross","Great. Thank you","Andy Simanek","Perfect. Thank you, Shannon. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you very much. Regarding the storage business, first of all, I didn't see the converged traditional breakout? Are you still giving that and you did say that you're supply constrained in the quarter on storage and that that would continue, is that correct?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, sure. So, from a converged perspective, I think the converged part of the portfolio was down roughly 8% and traditional was down roughly 20% and then from a material perspective, really the supply constraints are much more around SSD and again as that market is very tight right now, we're getting our fair share of supplies, but given the complexity of our broad product portfolio, we're finding it challenging to what we call demand shift.","But we would expect that to loosen up in the second half of the year particularly as 3D yields improve as well as more factories come online. So that should loosen up in the second half of the year.","Steve Milunovich","Okay. And then Meg internally last quarter you talked about execution issues, could you bring us up date in terms of if those are alleviated and externally, what are you hearing from your customers in terms of the split? I've heard a few customers wonder if you may be pruned too far relative to having full solutions capability.","Meg Whitman","Yes, so let me talk a little bit about the execution issues. I would say we have largely overcome most of the execution issues that we discussed in Q1 and the biggest hurdle was getting through the ES separation that in many ways was far more complex than the HPE HPI separation because we had to spin and then merge into a third-party.","So, a third party actually had to be managed and worked with here. So, the first time it was separating the siblings, now we had to merge with the cousin. I would say -- and by the way that took a chunk of our leadership time in every country around workforce councils and things like that.","The other thing that we talked about last time was we had three new heads of all of our regions plus a new head of worldwide sales and that as I said last time might've been a little bit too much change at once, but now I'm firmly convinced we got the right people in the right job. They've now been in place six months and you're starting to see their impact.","For example, the server business in the US ex tier 1, actually had a pretty good quarter and that's thanks to Jim Merritt and his team. So, I feel like execution-wise we're back on track and I think you saw that in terms of the growth areas that we talked about on the call.","The feedback from customers that I'm getting is actually they are amazed at how smoothly the separation of these companies has gone, whether it was HPI or CSC. I think if customers are saying have we shrunk back too far, we still need to educate them about the services capability that we still have at HPE and it's not only our TS business, our services and support business, it's our TS consulting business, it's Aruba Services and that's very important, that advice and transform capability I think we need to do a better job of if you will advertising that.","But customers who know us well, I think are super excited about the focus. They know the services capability that we have. They really resonated to the strategy. This strategy of we make hybrid IT simple, we power the intelligent edge and we have the services to make it happen totally resonate and so we're excited about that.","So, I have no doubt about the strategy. I have no doubt about the validity of the spins. We are going to end up as a much stronger set of companies than we would have before and I think you all recognize the value creation for shareholders that has occurred here.","Andy Simanek","Great. Thank you, Steve. I think we have time for one last question please?","Operator","And our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","Yes. Thank you. Tim, you mentioned bulk tightening on travel, other discretionary spend items that sound obviously transitory in nature. How much of that $200 million, 300 million of incremental cost saves would you view as transitory versus elements that could be more structural like the span of control initiatives.","And my follow-up Meg just to clarify, did you say that the worst of the pricing environment in servers is behind you and if yes what do you think that's the case? Thank you.","Meg Whitman","Yes, I actually said that I thought the margin pressure was the worse that we're going to see in Q2 and it should return to last year's level by Q4 and I can't say necessarily that the pricing is going to alleviate but we've got the $200 million to $300 million of cost structure we've got both structural things and we've got obviously the one timer like stranded costs and acquisition dilution. So that's why I say it's going to come back to last year's level by Q4.","Tim Stonesifer","And then from a cost structure perspective ballpark, I think roughly half of that $200 million to $300 million is more of the discretionary type stuff like policies, like travel and then the other half is labor related and within that labor piece, I'd break it out into two components.","I think half of that is really around lowering our rehire rates, taking a look at contractor. So, when you think about the cost to do those things, there really is no cost to do that and then there's the remaining 25% that would be more structural and that's why we're evaluating the restructuring that we have in 2018 employing forward.","Meg Whitman","Yes, I would say the other thing I would add here is I think of that $200 million to $300 million as a down payment on the cost structure and reengineering that we need to do on the go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise.","As I said to the answer to one of the earlier questions, I am now laser-like focused on what is the future of Hewlett Packard Enterprise financial architecture? How do we simplify? How we reengineer the processes and how we take out overhead given that we are now a $28 billion company down from $110 billion company just five years ago.","So, I have a much clearer view of how this company needs to be re-architected from a financial perspective and reengineered from a process and complexity standpoint. So, I'd say listen, the way I think about that is the down payment on what we could do in 2018 and beyond.","Andy Simanek","Great. Thank you, Wamsi. I think with that we can wrap up today's call, thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today.

We believe this approach helps to provide a better representation of HPE\u2019s operational performance given the significant divestitures we have recently completed including the sale of 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our website for details.","With that, let me turn it over to Meg.","Meg Whitman","Thanks, Andy. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Let me start by saying I am pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter. While revenue was down slightly on an operational basis, we saw several areas of growth in key parts of our portfolio including networking, all-flash storage, high-performance compute and technology services. Profitability was very encouraging as we continue to deliver margin improvements in enterprise services and focus on profitable deals in the enterprise group. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.49, which even before the impact of a favorable tax rate was at the high-end of our previously guided range.","Free cash flow also improved to $1 billion through diligent working capital management and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders primarily through share repurchases. Tim will provide further color on the quarter, but I would like to take the bulk of my time to discuss today\u2019s spin-merge announcement and put it in the context of the strategy, we\u2019ve been executing against for the past several years.","Last November, we launched the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise with the vision to become the industry\u2019 leading provider hybrid IT with the secure next generation software defined infrastructure that will run our customer\u2019s data centers today, bridge them to multi-cloud environments tomorrow and enable the emerging intelligent adds that will power campus, branch and IoT applications for decades to come. We believe this is what our customers are looking for and what we are best qualified to do.","And most importantly achieving this vision will create a faster growing, higher margin, stronger free cash flow company for our shareholders. To realize our vision, we looked at our portfolio and our product roadmaps to determine gaps that we needed to fill and then evaluated how best to do so. Some we filled through increased R&D like the investment in our recently launched HC 380 Hyper Converged product in other areas we pursue innovative partnerships like the ones recently announced with Docker and Mesosphere. And in some cases acquisitions make sense like Aruba and SGI.","Next, we identified areas of the business that were not aligned with our go forward strategy. There we had look at how to best maximize shareholder value with these assets. We\u2019ve already made a number of decisions including the sale of TippingPoint, the H3C deal in China and of course the spin-merge of our enterprise services business with CSC. And today, we announced plans for a spin-off and merger of our non-core software assets with Micro Focus.","These assets include our application delivery management, big data, enterprise security, information management and governance and IT operations management businesses. This transaction is valued at about 8.8 billion including a 50.1% ownership of the new combined company by HPE shareholders, which is currently valued at $6.3 billion and a $2.5 billion cash payment to HPE. The combined company will be led by Kevin Loosemore, current Micro Focus Executive Chairman and Mike Phillips will serve as Chief Financial Officer. After the transaction closes, Micro Focus\u2019s Board of Directors will include an HPE Senior Executive and HP Independent Directors on the Board.","The new combined company is expected to have annual revenues of approximately $4.5 billion with strong recurring revenue streams. The company will be well diversified across product lines and geographies. It'll also have a stronger go-to-market capability with nearly 4,000 sales people worldwide and deep R&D resources to deliver best-in-class solutions to customers and partners. Micro Focus's approach to managing both growing and mature software assets will ensure higher levels of investment in growth areas like Big Data Analytics and security while maintaining a stable platform for mission critical software products that customers rely on.","For employees Micro Focus's approach will mean each product line will have a clear and important role in the overall company performance and employees will have a high level of clarity on the strategy for their organization. It also means employees will get to work on long-term customer focused projects and the software technology that they love. We believe the software assets that will be a part of the spin-merge will bring better value to our customers, employees and shareholders as part of a more focused software company committed to growing these businesses on a standalone basis.","With this announcement, Robert Youngjohns, the current head of our software business will assume the role of Executive Vice President, Strategic Business Development, reporting to me. In this new role Robert will partner with other members of the leadership team to drive strategic customer and partner initiatives focused on growing key parts of the business. With Robert taking on this new role, Chris Hsu, our Chief Operating Officer will lead the software business effective immediately in addition to his current responsibilities. Chris's track record of driving strong performance and understanding market dynamics at HPE and throughout his career making him a great fit for this role.","To be clear both software and services are still key enablers of HPE's go forward strategy. Our newly created software defined and cloud business will build upon key software assets like OneView and the Helion Cloud platform to deliver software defined hybrid IT solutions like synergy. HPE's composable infrastructure offering that enables customers to operate their workloads with unprecedented speed and agility. And in services we continue to have a world class capability in our technology services group which will represent about 25% of HPE's revenue following the two spins that we've announced.","ES\u2019 22,000 service professionals build solutions from the ground up with the consulting and support our customers need to transform their environments and take advantage of opportunities in emerging areas like campus, branch and IoT. Once the ES CSC and the software of Micro Focus transactions are complete HPE will be an even stronger company, well positioned for the future. With approximately $28 billion in annual revenue the future HPE will have significant scale, a diversified world class portfolio and a global footprint to meet the evolving needs of our customers and partners. We'll be a market leader both in the data center and on the edge with our world class portfolio of software defined servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure.","We'll also have strong recurring revenue streams that account for approximately 60% of our operating profit and we'll have an improved free cash flow profile. Given our experience with divestitures we're confident in our ability to execute and more importantly that we're making the right choices to set both HPE and our customers up for the long term while delivering maximum shareholder value. The market is already recognizing what we're doing. With these strategic moves and our continued strong operational performance HPE's market cap has increased by over $10 billion or 40% since separation from HPI on November 01, 2015.","In addition to the portfolio changes we also made important leadership and organizational changes this quarter that will make our business stronger and more efficient. For example, we started the process of rightsizing our corporate functions for the more focused standalone HPE. In addition, the enterprise group businesses have been simplified and streamlined to better address market opportunities, improve cost structure, accelerate innovation and strengthen our competitiveness. Furthermore, all business unit and corporate marketing efforts will be consolidated under our global marketing function and all sales will be under a single global leader. Finally we announced the Hewlett Packard labs would move into the enterprise group which will better align our research and go-to-market efforts.","While there is more work to do, we're already seeing that our strategy is working. As a more focused organization we've been better able to allocate resources more effectively and introduce truly best-in-class solutions. For example, as I mentioned earlier, we announced plans to acquire SGI. High performance compute and big data analytics are exciting areas for us as customers are increasingly looking for ways to gain deeper, a more contextual insights from the ever expanding volumes of data. Industries like financial services, semiconductors and energy are all increasing their HPC investments.","In Q3, we won several significant automotive deals where high performance compute is used for electronic prototype designs, improving fuel economy and improving crash worthiness. The SGI acquisition will further strengthen our position in the $11 billion HPC segment as well as the high growth data analytics segment. In storage, we extended our leadership in the all-flash data center with enhancements to HPE 3PAR and also introduced next generation software defined storage to enable a compassable data fabric. We also brought enterprise capabilities to the entry storage market with the introduction of StoreVirtual 3200 and in MSA 2040.","We announced HPE OneView 3.0 to provide software defined intelligence across HPE\u2019s family of infrastructure solutions. To-date, we have sold over 500,000 HPE OneView licenses across a variety of key verticals such as healthcare, industrial and financial services, and we have a growing partner ecosystem including Docker, Shaft, Turbonomic and Self Tech.","We unveiled the industry's first converge systems for the Internet-of-things the HPE Edgeline 1000 and 4000 which will enable real-time decision making and deliver heavy duty analytics at the edge by integrating data capture, control, compute and storage. We also announced updates to the HPE Helion cloud portfolio including HPE Helion cloud Suite, a new software suite enabling customers to manage their full spectrum of applications across infrastructure environments and HPE Hellion Cloud System 10 a hardware and software solution to build and deploy an enterprise grade private cloud environment. But most of all we're winning with our customers and partners.","Aruba continues to win customers and drive growth with its industry leading technology. For example, we helped Rio's airport handle the massive surge of travelers passing through for the Olympics this summer and Home Depot and Best Buy are currently implementing Aruba wireless solutions to provide a better in-store experience for customers and employees. Keep in mind that deals like this have great TS pull through as well.","As discovered in June, we announced a new partnership with GE Digital that will enable industrial analytics from the edge to the cloud. HPE will be a preferred storage and server infrastructure provider for GE's Predix Cloud technologies and the Predix platform will be a preferred software solution for HPE\u2019s industrial related used cases and opportunities. HPE was also instrumental in helping Dropbox transform to a hybrid infrastructure to help it meet the growing bands of its users. Dropbox moved the majority of its cloud storage business away from AWS to on-premise data center using HPE ProLiant and Cloudline servers all financed by HPE Financial Services.","We also announced a groundbreaking strategic alliance with Docker to help customer transform and modernize their data centers to benefit from a more agile development environment. At the heart of this alliance is HPE's Docker ready server program, unique to the server industry which ensures HPE servers are bundled with the Docker engine and support. And today we announced plans for a commercial partnership with Micro Focus that will name SUSE as HPE's preferred Linux partner and will bring together HPEs' Helion OpenStack and Stackato solutions with SUSE's OpenStack expertise to provide best in class enterprise grade hybrid cloud offerings for HPE customers.","So in summary, I am pleased with the progress we have made this quarter and I am just as pleased with the execution of our strategy since we separated from HPI. I am also excited about the opportunities we have created for shareholders in the spin-mergers of ES and CSC and our software assets with Micro Focus. We are setting up HPE for long term success while unlocking the kind of value we believe our shareholders appreciate.","On that note, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Tim.","Tim Stonesifer","Thanks Meg. Overall we performed well in the quarter. While revenue of $12.2 billion down less than 1% was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focused on profitable market share. We also executed well considering we faced difficult compares across the portfolio in an uneven global demand environment. As we indicated last quarter, compares became more challenging as we are no longer benefitting from the large Deutsche Bank deal we signed in ES last year, and an EG, we are lapping the compares from Aruba and the ramp of Cloudline servers. From a micro perspective, we did see weakness in Europe, particularly in ES from a slowing in the UK public sector business and also in Japan in the enterprise group. The Q3 currency impact to revenue was a headwind of 210 basis points year-over-year that we expect to moderate further.","We did have several areas of solid growth across the portfolio including networking up 12%, all-flash arrays up 70%, higher performance compute up 12%, and our highest margin business technology services returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. To improve growth in the overall portfolio, we are continuing to make investments in our higher growth businesses around software defined, converge and hyper converge. While we continue to enhance our go to market efforts that we expect will improve growth going forward. Overall we are still on track to deliver what we said we would do at the beginning of the year by growing total fiscal year '16 revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency.","Gross margin of 29.3% was up 60 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially, this was principally due to continued improvements in enterprise services and enterprise group to a lesser extent. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.8% was up 30 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.49 was above our outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 that was primarily the result of tax benefits realized to the recent divestitures, equating to approximately $0.04 per share.","Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pre-tax amounts for the gain on divestitures of H3C of $2.2 billion, restructuring charges of $369 million, amortization of intangible assets of $210 million and separation charges of $135 million. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.32 above our previously provided outlook range of $1.10 to $1.14, primarily due to a higher than expecting gain on H3C divestiture, lower separation costs and the previously mentioned tax benefit.","Now turning to the results by business. In enterprise group revenue was flat as we focused on profitability and delivered encouraging improvements in operating margins, which while flat year-over-year were up 90 basis points sequentially to 12.6%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to lower discounting, better server option attach, favorable mix and operational cost improvements as we right size the organization ahead of the separation from enterprise services and software.","Server revenue declined 2% as solid growth in Tier 1 and high performance compute was offset by pressures in core servers. Within the core we did have some market coverage issues that we are addressing through recent sales leadership and go to market changes with an emphasis on SMB. We also doubled down in the fast growing high performance compute market with the acquisition of SGI and continue to invest in workload optimized solutions like SAP HANA. From a margin standpoint, the team did a nice job prioritizing profitability over share for shares\u2019 sake expanding margins year-over-year. We also anticipate we held server share in the second calendar quarter overall and gained share in the Americas essentially optimized in Tier 1.","Storage revenue declined 5% with continued declines in the legacy portfolio more than offsetting growth in converged storage of 1% that was impacted by a softer than expected market. Margins increased year-over-year driven by favorable converge mix and improved pricing in all-flash. 3PAR, plus XP, plus CVA was up 5% and all-flash 3PAR revenue continued to drive the portfolio growing 70% at record revenue levels. Despite a challenging market, we estimate we gain share in the second calendar quarter, our 11th consecutive quarter of share gains. And we continue to expect storage to gain shares through the remainder of the year.","Networking revenue grew 12% and encouragingly Aruba growth has accelerated growing 20% and is exceeding our internal plan. We again saw growth across all regions as we continue to see the benefits of the combined Aruba HPE portfolio. Margins improved year-over-year driven by both a better mix and higher margin rates of Aruba.","TS returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. Revenue was up 1% as the strong order growth from fiscal year 2015 becomes a larger portion of the portfolio and revenue grew in both support and in consulting. And while orders were flat, we saw encouraging performance in non-attached and proactive services that are growing at double-digit rates and becoming a larger mix of the total portfolio.","We continue to improve service intensity our attached dollars per unit which is helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and higher server ASPs. Enterprise services revenue declined 3% as growth in the Americas and APJ was more than offset by weakness in EMEA resulting from a pause in UK public sector spending and a tough compare with the Deutsche Bank deal in the prior year.","Operating profit improved 260 basis points year-over-year to 8.3%, the highest since the second quarter of 2011 as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements and delivery in sales. We also benefited from improving location mix and new deal profitability. Progress made on cost improvements, sale strength and normal quarterly seasonality provides us with continued confidence that operating margins for the full year will be approximately 7% at the high end of our original outlook.","Revenue is still expected to be down 2% to flat in constant currency even with the Mphasis divestiture. We continue to track against our longer term goal of 60% headcount in low cost locations and completed the quarter with 49% of our headcount in low cost centers, a six point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year.","Software revenue declined 3% as strength in security and big data was offset by declines in IT management. SaaS had a record quarter with 17% revenue growth. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls decreasing OpEx 16% year-over-year. However, revenue declines ultimately outpaced operating improvements causing a 270 basis point decline in operating margins to 17.8%.","HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered the first quarter of as reported revenue growth since the first quarter of 2013. Operating profit declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 9.9% as lower residual sales from weaker volume and prior year\u2019s pressured margin rates. Financing volume decline 4% year-over-year in constant currency, on a tough compare that saw Deutsche Bank sale leaseback volume in the third quarter of 2015. Return on equity was down 190 basis points year-over-year to 13.3% and was similarly pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year \u201913 and fiscal year \u201914.","Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to optimize working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $971 million, up 15% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. When adjusted for the sale of Mphasis, the cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down 5 days, sequentially. Receivables where the largest contributor to working capital improvement due to favorable payment term mix and reductions to aged receivables. Going forward, we expect the cash conversion cycle to be in the mid-teens with fiscal year \u201916 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.","Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock during an accelerated share repurchase program and we paid $91 million as part of our normal dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders. Primarily through $2.7 billion of share repurchases. With our free cash flow generation and the recent divestitures, we are on pace to return more than $3 billion of cash to shareholders in the year, which as a reminder is approximately three times our original commitment at the start of the year.","Finally, I would like to discuss the financial impacts of the HPE software and Micro Focus transaction. As Meg mentioned, the transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.8 billion of enterprise value to HPE. This includes 50.1% of the equity in the newly formed company that will go to HPE shareholders. Valued at approximately $6.3 billion based on Micro Focus\u2019s current stock price and receipt of a $2.5 billion payment of onshore cash to HPE. HPE Micro Focus also expect to improve the margins on HPE software assets by approximately 20 points by the end of the third year following the deal close, while investing in key growth areas like big data and security.","As owners of 50.1% of the equity in the new merged company, HPE shareholders will share in the value of these operational improvements, as well as future growth of earnings. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the second half of HPE\u2019s fiscal year 2017. To recognize this $8.8 million of enterprise value and unlock a more attractive financial profile for HPE going forward. We will incur one-time separation cash payments of approximately $700 million with the vast majority occurring in fiscal year \u201917.","Following the separation from ES and Software Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a faster growing higher margin, stronger cash flow company for our shareholders. Just looking at fiscal year \u201916, revenue growth would be about 3 points greater, operating margins would be about 1 point higher at just over 10% and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue would be roughly 50% higher. It\u2019s also worth noting that we have roughly 30% of revenue recurring, but most importantly more than 60% of profitability will be recurring that comes from ES and Financial Services.","HPE will also have a very healthy balance sheet that currently sits at $5.3 billion in operating net cash. On top of that we just closed the Mphasis deal receiving approximately $825 million of before tax cash proceeds. We continue to see share repurchase as an excellent use of capital and similar to the H3C transaction plan to buy back shares with the vast majority of the Mphasis proceeds. In fiscal year '17 our net cash position will also be further enhanced by over a $1 billion from the cash and debt transfers with CSC and the $2.5 billion cash dividend from Micro Focus. We'll continue to deliver shareholder value with these proceeds just as we've done this year by following our returns based capital allocation approach. This approach is currently biased towards share repurchases and we'll provide more details on our fiscal year '17 capital return plan to shareholders at our upcoming Analyst Day.","With all that in mind we expect to finish fiscal year 2016 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of a $1.90 to $1.95 at the high end of our original outlook for the year, we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $2.09 to $2.14. Before we open it up to questions a quick reminder that we're holding our Annual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 18th in San Francisco where we'll provide additional P&L and cash flow details on the company as it stands today as well as the go forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise excluding ES and software.","Now let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Katy Huberty","The slowdown in storage was a bit of a surprise given that most other players in this space beat expectations, so just to begin I wonder if you could talk about what you think drove that, was it macro or execution? And then I've a follow-up.","Meg Whitman","So, the storage performance was not as strong in Q3 as we saw last quarter I think because there was a weaker margin -- I mean weaker market, but we also increased margins and we expect to take about a 0.5 point of share year-over-year in the second quarter. And I want to remind you this is the 11th straight quarter in the row that we've taken market share and revenue was down 5% year-over-year, adjusted for divestitures and the currency as traditional declined 12% more than offsetting the 1% growth in converged.","So, listen, we saw a softer market and but we've introduced our new StoreVirtual 3200, the MSA 2040 that brings the Enterprise capabilities at a fantastic price to the entry market and that has been a drag for us, we haven't had a great competitive offering in the entry market and what you know about the storage market, it's moving from high end to mid to entry very-very fast. So, looking forward I mean listen, we think the market is going to continue to be soft, but -- and that will keep overall market -- our growth muted, but we continue to gain share and we're very pleased with our HPE 3PAR all-flash performance that grew 70% year-over-year. So, some work to do there, but we feel good about where we are and on a go forward basis I think you'll see us return to growth, a bit more robust growth.","Katy Huberty","And through the July quarter you've essentially met your objective to return the 100% of free cash flow plus half of the H3C cash to shareholders, how should we think about the balance of additional buyback versus extenuating the Remanco portfolio of products after the two spin-merge deals.","Tim Stonesifer","So, we did the $1.5 billion in the ASR in the third quarter, so there will be some shares taken out in the fourth quarter as we complete that, as that was a six month program. I think looking forward we will have nice cash balances particularly as we close these transactions, so we're going to continue to execute our disclaimed ROI based approach. We think it has worked well so far. At the same time, we will consider some acquisitions right. SGI is a great example of complementary technology in the high performance compute data analytics space that we should benefit from a profitable growth perspective. So right now we\u2019ll stick with the ROI based approach and we'll obviously share more details with you on 2017 at next month's Analyst Meeting.","Meg Whitman","People always asked us what kind of acquisitions work well HPE and I think we\u2019ve got the formula down which is, what is complementary technology in the HPE strategy of being leading provider of hybrid IT with secured next generation software defined infrastructure. And also at the edge. So Aruba and SGI are perfect examples, complementary technology that we can put through our distribution center that really -- our distribution mechanism that really enhances value for customers. So I think those is a two perfect examples of the kind of deals you could see us do going forward. Unfortunately there aren't that many deals like that, but when they come along we'll do them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Toni Sacconaghi","Meg, a year ago you were out on the road show talking about the split of HPE, what is now HPE and HPQ and at that time you talked about cash balance being an asset and that acquisitions will be an integral part of the strategy, you also talked about HPE being a solution's company and a growth company. Less than a year later, it feels like a different story. Cash return has been the absolute priority acquisitions have been extremely minimal, arguably divesting software and services which are essentially ingredients to many solutions seems different.","And so I applaud the flexibility because the stock price has done extremely well and it's certainly been in the vein of value creation. But I was wondering if you could comment on what appeared to precipitous this change in thinking from, I think an impression that seemed different to most from the road show a year ago and is there a different end state for Hewlett Packard Enterprise going forward. I mean is this really a viable ongoing hardware centric company going forward or should we expect more portfolio rationalization? And believe it or not I have a follow-up.","Meg Whitman","So, let me take you all the way back to November 1st of 2015, where we separated HP Inc from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And we very much laid out the strategy of beating a leading provider in hybrid IT both in the traditional data center, which by the way is still a robust market, it's 85% of the spend in IT today and we are the leader there and we need to continue to gain share. And then we wanted to focus on software defined infrastructure which is really the next generation of the infrastructure that our customers need. And then finally, build out our cloud platform and compute storage in networking at the edge.","And that\u2019s exactly what we have done and as we\u2019ve laid out that strategy, we looked at our portfolio, what do we need to add to the portfolio either in acquisitions or partnerships, what do we need to divest, because those assets are non-core to the strategy, it doesn\u2019t mean they are bad assets, they are just not -- they are not core to what we are doing.","So if you take the ES transaction, listen, we are still going to be in the services business in fact 25% of the revenue of HPE will be services, it just a different kind of services business than IT outsourcing, business process outsourcing and apps maintenance.","If you think about software, we are still going to be in the software business, it\u2019s just not in application software like ITOM, it is system software like OneView and the software that powers synergy. So it is a portfolio matching to the strategy that we see our competitive advantage in.","As far as, I think you asked about further divestitures, so enterprise group as currently configured, needs to stay together and I\u2019ll tell why. My view of the market is everything is moving to converge and we have a differentiated position because we have networking storage and compute and that is not -- our two major competitors are missing a key component of that offering. So that we think is important to keep together.","And then as you think technology services, technology services is the key differentiator for our company. We can help customers support, maintain advice and consult across the globe and it would be uneconomic to simply support storage only or networking only. So TS is absolutely integral.","And then finally, obviously campus, branch and edge is a new growth area for the company, there is no reason that we should not own compute with the edge, there is no reason that we shouldn\u2019t own analytics with the edge in addition to obviously a Aruba. So I think to some degree the strategy has evolved, but really quite consistent with what we laid out and a big part of what we did this past year was portfolio optimization from this strategy.","So on a go forward basis, I think as Tim said well, I think you can look for more ROI based smart acquisitions like Aruba, like SJI and so I think it's entirely consistent with the strategy that we laid out a year ago.","Toni Sacconaghi","Okay thank you for that. Just as a follow up. Anytime you divest or acquire particularly -- in this case you say well, could I have done what others are going to do on my own. So what I mean by that is I can't help thinking that HPE software business is going to be like 75% of Micro Focus going forward, you are far, far, far bigger than they are from a revenue perspective. And they believe as a much smaller player that they can improve operating margins 2000 basis points, 2000 basis points on your revenue basis $750 million a year an operating process, which at a 10 multiple, 7.5 billion and you haven't given up the business.","So I guess the question is if the margin improvement opportunities are so huge even for a relatively small player why did you either not extract a better price or why did you not believe that you could have extracted those and created even more value for shareholders?","Meg Whitman","No, I think the first answer is this is what Micro Focus does. They are pure play Software Company who is expert at managing mature software assets. And as Micro Focus will tell you, most people who work in the software business and Silicon Valley want to grow assets. And actually some of these assets should actually be maintained on a stable platform that extends the value for customers and it\u2019s actually not what we do, it is what they do.","But then you come to the question of, why did we do a spin-merge as oppose to sell the whole business? And the reason is, is because our shareholders will be able to ride the upside of what Micro Focus does. Remember our shareholders will own 50% of the new company and by the way, I will be a shareholder of that new company given my vested options and my vested RSUs in HPE. And I can tell you I will be holding those shares because I think they are going to do very, very well.","And so this was a much better alternative than selling the company today on a PE multiple operating income because you get cash, but you pay taxes and then our shareholders wouldn't get to ride the upside unless they went out and took new money to buy those shares. So we thought that was absolutely the right thing to do. And I have to tell you Tony in today's world where technology is changing at lightning speed I've got to tell you the value of focus, I am seeing it every single day.","And so while may be back in the day it was great to be a technology supermarket like the financial supermarkets of yesterday. What I am pretty sure of is the next four or five years is going to be all about speed, agility and focus and innovation in something that is a more narrow focus.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner","I wanted to get a little more detail on the software spend. Will any of the software apps that stay with HPE business or will everything be spun-off? And then as part of that question, thinking about what you talked about at the Discover event the opportunities in Big Data, Internet of Things and Analytics. How does HPE benefit from those trends without having that software business? Thanks.","Meg Whitman","Sure. So what lives in our software business unit today is in fact spun and merged with Micro Focus. But we still remain in the software business, it's just a different kind of software business as I said, system software. The software defined infrastructure is all powered by software, but it's not applications software if you will like ITOM or ADM it is actually system software that powers the infrastructure of our customers.","Now, you say, all right so how do we capitalize on the Big Data and Analytics? Well, first of all, we will be the leader in high performance compute with the acquisition of SGI. So, companies need to process and compute huge amounts, ever escalating amounts of data. So really the high performance compute market which is an $11 billion business growing at 6% to 8% will really be between HPE now with SGI and Cray, but many of the other competitors like Dell, Lenovo they are not in that high performance compute business. So, as people need financial services, energy, as they need compute to process all this Big Data if you will, we will be the leading player there.","If you think about campus, branch and edge I think this is the next big growth area. If you think about autonomous driving vehicles, jet engines, healthcare sensors in healthcare beds and in devices, this is an area where huge amounts of data needs to be processed real time at the edge as opposed to enduring the latency of coming back to a major datacenter. So we\u2019re going to be able to capitalize in the IoT trend by analytics at the edge and be able to compute and store at the edge.","So that\u2019s the way we\u2019ll play in those trends, it will be different then like Vertica, which will go to Micro Focus, which is a big common or data base that processes huge amounts of data on a data base side, but we will pick-up the ability to process on compete storage and networking at the edge.","Sherri Scribner ","Okay, thank you. And then just a quick clarification for Tim. On the TS, the Technology Services side, looks like there is an 8 point difference between actual revenue and the adjusted revenue. Was there something other than currency in that number, because that seems like a big delta? Thanks.","Tim Stonesifer","The H3C transaction impacted that as well.","Sherri Scribner ","Thanks.","Meg Whitman","Because H3C had TS in China that went with that deal.","Sherri Scribner ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Milunovich","We\u2019ve come a long way for better together here. I give you a lot of credit, because you\u2019re basically creating this very focus companies whatever Computer Sciences is called and now Micro Focus, which I think does create a lot of shareholder value. But again when all is said and done, you\u2019re becoming more and more a hardware company and I would think your competitors ultimately are going to be primarily Cisco and Dell and obviously they\u2019ll use their large size against you and claim they\u2019ve got AI capabilities and so forth. How do you see matching up against them when all is said and done? And are you going to have a relationship with Micro Focus that\u2019s kind of favorite relation like you appear to have with Computer Sciences going forward?","Meg Whitman","Yes. The answer of that is absolutely yes. And actually beyond that, you saw what we announced today with SUSE, where there will be our preferred partner for Linux, as well as the OpenStack Distro. And listen a lot of the software products that are going in the spin-merge will be important to us going forward. So there will be a relationship there. So let me just give you a sense, I think we\u2019re in a great position to compete with both Cisco and Dell. So for example, actually the HPE go forward strategy will be about $28 million Company, that\u2019s only slightly smaller than HP\u2019s than Dell\u2019s enterprise business and it is more focus with better innovations.","I think we should just contrast our strategy with Dell. So we are getting smaller, well they\u2019re getting bigger. And this is important, because I believe speed and agility is critical in innovation and go-to-market. The second is they\u2019re levering up and we are delivering. We have $5.3 billion of net cash on the operating company and we\u2019re going to have a lot more by the time we\u2019re done with these transactions and that gives us dry powder, it also gives us the ability to return cash to shareholders.","And I think it\u2019s difficult to be levered as much as Dell is in this environment. And then secondly, we\u2019re leaning into new technology either through our own innovation, acquisitions or partnerships and we\u2019ve got major focused on our side. What they\u2019re doing is doubling down in old technology and the cost take out play and listen I think, I might be quite successful for leadership team there, from a financial perspective, I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s good for customers.","Steve Milunovich","Okay. And then on enterprise group, just want to confirm that you said you do expect storage growth in the future now that\u2019s reported or adjusted or whatever. But also can you talk about servers and what went on in the quarter and do you expect that to return to growth?","Meg Whitman","Sure. And by the way I forgot to address CISCO in your last question. So listen, CISCO is a good competitor, but they are missing a key element, which is storage. And as this converges, I think as in my environment converges and we look at hyper converged and on synergies, we\u2019re innovating really nicely now, for the traditional data center as well as the software defined data center and I got to tell you a Aruba at the edge is killing it. And a 20% growth rate above our internal plan and we're just winning deals hand over fist there so, we feel really good about our ability to compete with CISCO.","Okay, back to servers, so listen what's happening in servers is there's sort of core server growth, then there is Tier 1 servers which is to the big service providers and then is obviously high performance compute and the reason we did the SGI acquisition is to really stake out a great position in an $11 billion business as I said before that's growing 6% to 8%, that's very profitable for the compute itself, but also there's very high TS attached to high performance compute.","Core servers around the globe are under some pressure right now, but you saw what we did in terms of increasing the margin and we're doubling down on SMB which actually is still, there's pockets of growth in that area and we're also doing workload specialization -- okay we have the best compute in the world to run SAP HANAR, it's not even close with anyone else. So, we're specializing around workloads.","And then obviously there was a tough compare because of Cloudline a year ago, I mean we've just ramped up business into a multi-billion dollar business and so it's hard to compete with those compares, but we expect to continue to gain share in that market profitably. We're not in it for share-for-share stake, we don't want to take unprofitable deal, but as we continue to work on supply chain and the rationalizations we become more competitive there. And we're very mindful that ultimately there's Chinese competitors there as well and whether they're Huawei or Lenovo, it's not just Dell. So we're very aware of the cost structure we have to have to continue to compete.","Steve Milunovich","Any prediction of growth?","Meg Whitman","I think sort of low single-digits is probably what we'll grow, it'll depend on how much Tier 1 service provider business we want to take. But I'd say what you saw 1% to 2% is probably good estimate going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Maynard Um","I was wondering if you can help me understand the $700 million after tax separation cost, when you say it will unlocking a more attractive financial profile. I guess what exactly does that mean, those redundant employee restructuring costs and will that drive up easy margins? And I've a follow-up.","Tim Stonesifer","I think it's really a combination of couple of things, when you -- when we separate the software business and you look at the remaining piece of HPE, we're going to be -- if you were to extract ES and software from our 2016 financials, in Meg's earlier comments, revenue growth would be incremental 300 basis points, margins would be up in incremental 100 basis points just north of 10% and free cash flow as a percent of revenue would be up 50%. If you look at the absolute free cash flow, it would be relatively neutral driven by the fact that software does generate some free cash flow, but that's offset by the pressure in ES. So, when we're talking about the financial profile it's really related to RemainCo.","Meg Whitman","And I have to say that with our Enterprise Group really being now the anchor for RemainCo, we've been very conscious about making sure that we've got an overhead cost structure that is in line with the $28 billion business, that we're making changes to how Enterprise Group is organized internally, there will be savings around our OpenStack Distro with our new relationship with SUSE and then finally moving HP Labs, Hewlett Packard Labs to EG is going to tighten the linkage between downstream development and commercialization which I think is something that needs to be done.","So, we're all about making Enterprise Group more cost effective as we drive the RemanCo strategy.","Tim Stonesifer","And I would also add on RemanCo keep in mind that recurring profit will be above 60%.","Maynard Um","Great and then it looks like Dell raised pricing in the UK to offset the currency impact from Brexit, I was wondering if you could just talk about what impact that had on your business both in terms of revenue and margin and how we should think about that going forward? Will the hedging offset that to the bottom line? Thanks.","Meg Whitman","Let me tell you what we saw from a demand perspective and Tim can talk a little bit about our broader hedging strategy. We were not able to hedge in the quarter for the pound degradation, but what we saw was actually a pause in purchasing in the UK. Certainly the UK public sector, but the also the UK and then more broadly Europe which was, this was unexpected, a big change, let's take a pause and decide what we want to do here. And when we saw in a very market way, what I will say in the last couple of weeks we're actually seeing orders pick up again.","It was almost like they took a pause and basically had to take stock of what was happening and then basically the orders have started to flow again. I mean we continue to also monitor the pricing, competitive pricing environment that we see and we adjust as necessary particularly in the channel. So the channel is where we serve SMB and that's where our ability to sort of move the pricing in response to competition, we look at that actually every single week sometime multiple times a week.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Shannon Cross","I want to talk more about TS, it was up this quarter for the first time in a while and on a sort of net of divestitures and constant currency basis. How do we think about it as you look at the placements you've made over the last year I think you've mentioned some benefit from some of the hardware that were in place, but just as you look at the mix of hyper scale and what have you that you put out there, do you expect this to continue to grow sort of net of everything, is there an opportunity given with some quarters that it may dip. Just how should we look at it because it's obviously very important from a margin perspective?","Meg Whitman","So I think a little understood element of HPE is the dramatic transformation that TS has gone through. TS as is and was a very profitable business that was largely attached to business critical systems, very profitable very high attach. I mean you didn't really sell business critical systems without a TS attach. And when business critical systems both from a market perspective as well as the Oracle Itanium situation, by all right TS should be down 25%, if you remember Shannon over the last four or five years BCS was down 25% like clockwork every single quarter for four years as growing a little bit now. But all rights TS should have shrunk with BCS and it did not. And the reason it did not was very impressive new product offering, proactive care.","Other areas where we help customers maintained their datacenters state and so the fact that in as actually only been down a few percentage points over the last 12 months is a testament to the leadership team in that business. And now what you're seeing is those new productive offering are starting to get real traction. Orders have been positive for the last three or four quarters and those orders are translated into growth this quarter, not a significant amount of growth, but 1%, we\u2019ll take it all day long because it is a very-very profitable business.","So we have more work to do on Technology Services, I will tell you what is the benefit of now being a small and more focused company. Antonio Neri and I are going to spend a whole lot of time now on what is the next generation of Technology Services and whether that\u2019s flexible capacity services that allows consumption based model, whether it's proactive care, data center care, we are going to spend a lot of time there because it is the key strategic enabler of RemainCo HPE.","Shannon Cross","Okay and then this is a follow up, I am curious for the core company that you are going to have less, the cost structure is relatively close to where it needs to be, or are there more opportunities whether -- I think you mentioned a little bit in terms of the corporate cost but then just also within EG, where you might be able to optimize overtime to perhaps offset some pressure in or mix pricing?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, sure I think from a cost structure perspective, we spent probably in the last 18 months, we have done some detailed benchmarking particularly in a functional areas as to where the business needs to be basically cost as a percent of revenue. So we are getting closer to those benchmarks, we are not quite there yet, but we are close and we are there in some of the functions. So as we have done these divestures or as we are doing these divestures, we obviously incorporate that into what the new cost structure needs to look like and obviously we need to be very aggressive around what we call stranded cost.","So I think the good news is when you look at the HPE-HPI separation we did have some disynergies we call them, we have worked those through the system, with the H3C divesture, we\u2019ve got much better with identifying the stranded cost and being much more proactive in managing them out, we are starting to see those come out. So we are confident that we can continue to do that to get to the bench mark we need to get to when these transactions are done.","Meg Whitman","I\u2019ll just add a couple more things. When you are going to take -- we\u2019ve been streamlining the cost structure of this company for four or five years, now we are starting to do things differently. Because you can only take out so much cost, there is only so much low hanging fruit, you have to do things differently and whether that is supply chain and logistics, whether that is how we are organized internally with all R&D under one R&D leader, whether it is putting our software defined infrastructure and our cloud offering under one leader, whether it is putting all of our go-to-market under one leader, where we have consistent go to market strategy discounting across the board. Frankly, we were much better at minimizing discounting in APJ and EMEA than we were in the United States. We now have that discipline across the company.","And then finally corporate overhead we got have a corporate overhead that is designed for $28 million Company. And when we started we had a corporate overhead design for $110 billon company and then $50 billion Company and now at $28 billion Company. And I have to say I am really pleased with our ability to sort of right size the corporate overhead and be lean and mean, and that includes everything from HR, Finance, Legal IT things like real estates, systems. So we have made a lot of progress, but you will see more of that benefit I think in '17 and '18.","Tim Stonesifer","Thank you, Shannon I think we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","My question is regarding the separation cost, if I remember from the press release I think it was around 700 million, is that correct? And how should we think about that the timing of that and is that all in cost? And I kind of also take it relative to say the divestures of the services was just 900 million, and while 900 million is 200 million more than 700, it seems like to me that the services was a much bigger heavier lifting divestures. So I almost whether is 700 million kind of why just so much and not much lower, or is it just so much integrated in Hewlett Packard Enterprise, that\u2019s why it cost so much to break out? Thank you.","Tim Stonesifer","Sure. So yes, $700 million is the right number. Again we feel like the value that that transaction is driving is phenomenal for HPE as well as its shareholders. However, to realize that value we need to make investments and allocate resources to do the separation. So to your point, software although the activities are similar in nature to the transaction in ES they are discreet and they are not necessarily driven by revenue base or headcount levels.","So when you look at software it's a global complex business, it has multiple legal entities that have been accumulated overtime through a series of transactions and because of that when you look at the tax to finance the legal the operating structure it is still very, very complicated. So, in order to separate that there are some large expense items in there, for example, separating 650 IT systems during the carve out financials translating GAAP to IFRS splitting a 150 legal entities in 60 countries, trying to figure out what we want to do with 200 real estate sites across the globe.","So, there is certainly a lot of work that needs to be done there. The good news is we have done this before, so we know how to do it. The team has been very proactive and we are all over it, we have the work screens identified. So, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll get there when we go for it.","Meg Whitman","The other thing, I think that's important Jim is, we have come these separations that we have done today whether it was HP Inc. from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, whether its ES from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. We have come in on time and actually below budget. And so we're really proud of that. And we expect that to happen, I don't know how much, listen 700 is what you should have in your models. If we're on target we ought to come in a little lighter than that.","Tim Stonesifer","And the other way I think about it is the benefit of the deal far outweighs the cost, right. So when we get that $2.5 billion cash dividend and that will be on shore cash that far outweighs the cost of doing the transaction.","Jim Suva","Thank you for the details and congratulations to you and your team.","Meg Whitman","Thank you very much.","Tim Stonesifer","Appreciate it. Thank you, everyone for joining today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our call for today. Thank you. You may now disconnect."],"10812":["Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Q1 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call February 23, 2017  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Andy Simanek - Head, IR","Meg Whitman - President and CEO","Tim Stonesifer - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank","Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","Steve Milunovich - UBS","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Maynard Um - Wells Fargo","Shannon Cross - Cross Research","Operator","Good afternoon, and welcome to the First Quarter 2017 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Earnings Conference Call. My name is Denise, and I\u2019ll be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Andy Simanek","Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fiscal 2017 first quarter earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.","For a discussion of some of these of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE\u2019s filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE\u2019s quarter report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2017.","Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Throughout this conference call all revenue growth rates unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and beginning with fiscal year 2016 are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE\u2019s operational performance, given the significant divestitures we\u2019ve recently completed, including the sale of MphasiS, 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on the website for details.","With that, let me turn it over to Meg.","Meg Whitman","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.","Let\u2019s start right in. Overall, as I look back on Q1, I\u2019d say our performance was mixed. I was very pleased with our non-GAAP net diluted EPS of $0.45, at the high end of our previously guided range. We delivered normalized free cash flow of $200 million, a $500 million improvement year-over-year. And we saw strong performance across key growth areas of the portfolio. However, we also encountered some unexpected headwinds during the quarter. We saw several external factors impacting our performance that will become more challenging through the remainder of fiscal 2017, and we came up against some execution related problems that we are now fixing.","Let me talk a little bit more about the challenges we saw in the quarter and how we think about them.","First, we faced a significant challenge on both the top and bottom lines from foreign exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the dollar versus the euro and the yen. We were able to largely address the impact on our profitability in Q1 with our hedging strategy. However, we expect the continued strength of the dollar as these hedges roll off to present a significant headwind for the remainder of the year.","Second, we saw an impact from a challenging industry wide commodities market, particularly tight NAND supply which impacted sales in our storage and compute businesses and elevated DRAM pricing. We were able to mitigate a portion of the impact in Q1 through procurement strategies. However, we expect that the increase in DRAM pricing will accelerate and create near-term challenges to our profitability.","Third, revenue was impacted by a tough market environment, particularly in core servers and storage. We saw a significantly lower demand from one customer and major tier 1 service provider facing a very competitive environment.","Finally, we experienced some execution issues in the Enterprise Group business. So, let me say a little bit more about that. As you know, during the past few months, we\u2019ve been preparing HPE to compete aggressively following the spin mergers of ES and software. To that end, we\u2019ve been making significant changes to our organization, all during the final intense months before the ES separation and as the software separation done underway.","In just the last quarter, we\u2019ve reshaped the entire Enterprise Group business to better drive the three pillars of our strategy, hybrid IT; the intelligent edge; and services. We appointed a new Global Head of Sales and new sales leads in each of our geographical regions. We hired a new leader for the Technology Services business, and we hired a new leader for our channel program. These are the some of the more significant changes we\u2019ve made to set the Company up for long-term success. While these changes were the right changes to make, it was a lot for the organization to take in. Frankly, as we headed into Q1, we overloaded many of our top people and disrupted the day-to-day cadence of our business more than we should have. The good news is that we\u2019ve indentified the problem and are fixing it. More importantly, once the dust settles, the changes we\u2019ve made will leave HPE in a much better position to compete and win.","Now, while we faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, we also continued to see positive momentum across a number of fronts. In the Enterprise Group, I was very pleased with our focus on the critical, higher margin, higher market growth areas of the portfolio that will be the foundation of our futures success. We delivered strong results in technology, services support and consulting, Aruba, high-performance compute, and all-flash storage. And this focus drove improved year-over-year operating margins in EG when adjusted for currency and divestitures.","We also made strong progress in Enterprise Services where we continued to shift headcount to lower cost locations, and the operating margin came in at a solid 7% within our long-term target range. And software continued to stabilize revenue and improved operating margins by 400 basis points. At the same time, throughout Q1, we continued to execute strategic acquisitions, invested in innovation and developed important partnerships. All of these actions were directly aligned to the three pillars of our strategy, hybrid IT; the intelligent edge; and services.","In our mission to make hybrid IT simple for our customers, we completed the acquisition of SimpliVity, a leading provider of software defined hyperconverged infrastructure. Our hyperconverged market is approximately $2.4 billion and is growing around 25% annually. So, we see this as a significant opportunity. By bringing together HPE\u2019s simple user interface developed for our HC 380 solution with SimpliVity\u2019s enterprise class data fabric, HPE will deliver the industry\u2019s best and most comprehensive hyperconverged offering on the market. This world-class technology combined with HPE\u2019s unmatched global go-to-market is a game-changer in the hyperconverged space. We just closed the deal on Friday, and I\u2019m pleased that we received our first order on the same day. Customers can clearly see the promise.","In high-performance compute, we accelerated our momentum since closing the SPI deal late last year. Overall, the high-performance compute segment is an $11 billion market and is expected to grow around 6% to 8% annually over the next three years. And with the explosion of data across industries and sectors, the data analytic segment is growing at over twice that rate.","Over the past several weeks, I\u2019ve been meeting with customers and it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that SPI and our existing high performance computing business make a very powerful combination. Just this quarter, we announced a number of new offerings for sectors including life sciences and financial services as well as significant new supercomputer installations that are driving advances in space exploration, biology and artificial intelligence. We\u2019ll continue to lean into this space, as HPC becomes an essential component in today\u2019s data-driven world. And earlier this month, we introduced one of our most significant 3PAR flash storage innovations to-date, the next gen 3PAR operating system, which provides a foundation for hybrid IT as all-flash becomes the new norm.","In December, we announced HPE Synergy with HPE Helion CloudSystem 10, the industry\u2019s first private cloud running on composable infrastructure. This new solution gives organizations the ability to operate a single IT environment on-prem that supports both traditional applications and product clouds on shared infrastructure. It gives customers the security and control of an on-prem at public cloud economics. That is a game-changing combination.","Finally, we continued to deepen relationships with existing partners like Arista and introduced new ones as well. For example, in Q1, we announced a new reseller agreement with Mesosphere. HPE will build and deliver infrastructure solutions specifically designed for the Mesosphere data center operating system. For HPE, the agreement with Mesosphere shows how committed we\u2019re to helping enterprise customers fully embrace the benefits they want from hybrid IT including optimized performance and faster service time to market.","Turning to the next pillar of our strategy, we believe the intelligent edge and the industrial Internet of Things represents a significant opportunity for our business going forward. We\u2019re very well-positioned with Aruba today and continue to make investments to strengthen our portfolio for the future.","In late November, Aruba announced several new security solutions, ecosystem partnerships and switching products designed to accelerate the move to the digital workspace while addressing the security concerns associated with the adoption of IoT. For example, the new Aruba ClearPass Universal Profiler gives IT organizations unparalleled multi-device management and security options across multi-vendor wired and wireless networks. And Aruba\u2019s latest switches and switch operating system are specifically designed to power and security intelligent edge optimized for mobile and IoT devices. And in Q1, we acquired Niara to help our customers detect and protect themselves against advanced cyber attacks that have penetrated their network parameter defenses.","Niara is a leader in a new category of products that employ machine learning and big data analytics on enterprise packet and log streams to discover advanced attacks. By integrating Niara\u2019s behavioral analytics technology with Aruba\u2019s ClearPass policy manager, we can now offer our customers the industry\u2019s most advanced threat detection and prevention solutions for networks and IoT devices.","Finally, today more than ever, our customers are looking for a trusted advisor to help them define and implement an IT roadmap specific to their business needs. Services is at the core of our ability to be that strategic partner to our clients and its role in our business is crucial. In Q1, we announced the acquisition of Cloud Cruiser, a leading provider of cloud consumption analytic software that provides clear insight into IT usage and spend, and helps customers more effectively plan and manage their IT systems. This acquisition will further differentiate our Flexible Capacity offering, which as you know is the unique consumption model that enables our customers to manage IT infrastructure in their own data center but pay for it as a service. This approach reduces the risk of organizations investing too much or too little in IT, eliminates unused capacity and frees up valuable IT resources for new value-adding projects.","In the coming months, we will be speaking more to our customers about our services strategy, leading that charge will be Ana Pinczuk, who joined HPE just last week from Veritas, where she most recently held the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer and for many years and Cisco prior to that. As a seasoned leader with 30 plus years of experience, Ana brings a wealth of services expertise combined with a versatile background in engineering, sales and IT.","The best way to judge our strategy is through our customers. And our customer wins in Q1 gave us great confidence that we\u2019re on the right path. In January, the Tokyo Institute of Technology awarded HPE for the significant supercomputer win to address increasing demand for big data and artificial intelligence capabilities in research communities. Suncor Energy has signed a five-year Flexible Capacity service agreement. Flexible Capacity provides Suncor with benefits of a cloud-like consumption model and the performance and security afforded by having these resources on-perm. ","We are working with Giant Tiger, Canada\u2019s leading discount retailer who is implementing HPE Synergy to help consolidate and power their next generation 600,000 square foot state-of-the-art distribution center. Distribution and warehousing are core functions of the Giant Tiger business model and HPE Synergy will transform distribution operations with HPE Aruba wireless and 3PAR storage technology to run warehouse robotics. And next week at Mobile World Congress, we plan to announce a major smart cities project in India, involving the world\u2019s largest long range low-power wireless IoT platform deployment.","Overall, I would love to have seen better top line results in the quarter and we could have done without the market and execution headwinds I described earlier. But I remain very confident in our strategy. Nothing has changed my fundamental belief that HPE is on the right track. In fact, I believe we are ahead of many of our competitors in reorganizing to deal with the market challenges we all face. The steps we are taking to strengthen our portfolio, streamline our organization and build the right leadership team are setting us up to win long into the future.","With that, let me turn it over to Tim.","Tim Stonesifer","Thanks, Meg.","As is said earlier, our overall performance in the quarter was somewhat mixed. We did drive solid growth in our higher margin businesses and continued to align our cost structure, which enabled us to deliver better operating profit versus the prior year. However, we also faced increasing pressures from currency, commodities pricing and soft markets in addition to the execution issues Meg discussed. In total, revenue of $11.4 billion was down 4% when adjusted for currency and divestitures.","From a macro perspective, we continue to see an uneven global demand environment. Performance in the U.S. was impacted by tough markets, particularly in servers and storage. Revenue in Europe continues to be weak, driven by the UK public sector. APJ was mixed with good performance in Japan, more than offset by broad softness in the rest of Asia.","Currency movements were unfavorable throughout the quarter, which resulted in a year-over-year impact of revenue of 140 basis points. Gross margin of 28.9% was up 50 basis points year-over-year but down 150 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to continued progress on the offshore labor mix of Enterprise Services. The sequential margin drop was driven by normal Q1 seasonality in ES and software.","Non-GAAP operating profit of 9.2% was up 110 basis points year-over-year but down a 190 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.45 was at the high end of our outlook of $0.42 to $0.46. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS primarily excludes pretax amounts for separation charges of $276 million, restructuring charges of $177 million and amortization of intangible assets of $111 million. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.16, above our previously provided outlook of $0.03 to $0.07, primarily due to lower than expected separation and restructuring charges.","Now, turning to results by business. In the Enterprise Group, revenue was down 6% as we continue to focus on profitability and align the organization for future stay. Operating margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points sequentially to 12.7%. However, operating margins were up year-over-year, adjusted for currency and the H3C divestiture.","We had several areas of encouraging growth across the portfolio including Aruba, up 20%; 3PAR all-flash arrays, up 29%; high-performance compute, up more than 30% including the acquisition of SGI and almost 10% organically, and 4% growth in our highest operating margin business, Technology Services.","Server revenue declined 11% due to a softer than expected core server market combined with some execution challenges. And as Meg said, we saw lower demand from our largest tier 1 customer. We already have several actions in place to help sure up our core business.","First, we\u2019re making improvements in the channel with some process reengineering, and focusing more on SMBs through distributors and value-added resellers. Second, we\u2019re continuing to make investments in products like Synergy that will revitalize our competitiveness and belief. In addition to organic investments, we\u2019ve also augmented our portfolio with the recent acquisitions of SGI and SimpliVity, which will strengthen our position in two high growth markets. Lastly, we continue to focus on cost takeout by flattening new organization, better aligning R&D to the market opportunities and improving the go-to-market model.","Storage revenue declined 12% in a market that remains challenged, and we faced sales execution issues similar to our core server business. Results were also meaningful impacted by NAND supply constraints that we\u2019re expecting to lessen as the year progresses. We also recently announced a simplified pricing model and bundled compression offerings with 3PAR that should help to improve win rates and stabilize revenue going forward.","Networking revenue grew 6%, driven by Aruba hardware that continues to take share and was especially strong in EMEA with several large new logo wins. We also saw growth in campus and branch switching, but data center networking revenue continues to be pressured. We\u2019re in the process of transitioning from our legacy portfolio to the new Arista partnership that is starting ramp.","Technology Services continues to be a bright spot with revenue up 4%. Orders also grew year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, giving us strong confidence that TS will grow throughout fiscal year 2017. We saw encouraging performance in non-attach and proactive services as well as Aruba services which was up more than 10%. We also continue to improve service intensity, or attach dollars per unit, which helps to offset pressure from challenged hardware performance. We\u2019re very pleased to see TS grow, given its relatively high degree of profitability and recurring revenue stream.","Enterprise Services revenue declined 6%, with continued challenges in the UK public sector and normal account runoff. Operating profit improved 220 basis points year-over-year to 7%, as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements, and delivery and sales. We continue to track against our longer term goal of 60% headcount in low cost locations and completed the quarter with 52% of our headcount in low cost centers, a year-over-year improvement of seven points.","Software revenue was down 1% as strength in security was offset by declines in IT management and big data. SaaS had another good quarter with 6% revenue growth, driven by solid performance in Fortify on Demand and Digital Safe. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, leading to a 400 basis-point improvement in operating margins to 21.4%.","HPE Financial Services revenue grew 7%, its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth driven by strong volume from last year and an increase in operating lease mix. Operating profit declined 340 basis points year-over-year to 9.5%, primarily due to a bad debt reserve release in the prior year. Financing volume declined 9% in constant currency on a tough compare from a onetime item associated with the split form HPI.","Return on equity was down 490 basis points year-over-year to 13.1%. Free cash flow, which is seasonally weakest in the first quarter, was negative $2.3 billion. However, when adjusted for the $1.9 billion of ES pension funding, roughly $300 million of restructuring and $300 million of separation payments, normalized free cash flow was approximately positive $200 million. This improvement of approximately $500 million from the prior year is due primarily to less drag from working capital as we continue to see the benefit from structural changes we implemented in cash flow management. Within the quarter, we also benefitted from movements in other assets and liabilities, which is expected to reverse in the second quarter. The cash conversion cycle was 12 days, up 6 days sequentially, in line with normal seasonality.","Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we paid $109 million in dividend payments, which includes an 18% increase to $0.065 per share and repurchased $641 million of outstanding shares, aligned to our commitments at our Securities Analyst Day.","Now, moving to our two spin-merge transactions. Both the ES, CSC and software Micro Focus transactions are on schedule and on budget. We filed an updated Form 10 and S4 for the ES, CSC transaction and anticipate filing final version shortly with the expected close still on or around April 1st. The software Micro Focus transaction is also progressing as planned and we continue to anticipate the transaction closing on September 1st. We\u2019ve also made good progress removing stranded costs and continue to anticipate a $0.06 diluted EPS impact in fiscal year 2017 with all costs eliminated on a run-rate basis by the end of the year.","Now turning to our outlook, when we look back to original outlook provided at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October of 2016, there have been three significant developing headwinds, currency; commodity pricing; and some execution issues.","In regards to currency, the euro is currently hovering at a $1.06 versus a $1.10 when we originally guided fiscal year 2017 and we now expect FX to be roughly a two-point impact to revenue year-over-year. And as Meg discussed, while profitability was hedged through the first quarter, we will face a headwind for the remainder of the year. We\u2019re managing the challenge as much as possible through pricing actions but it often takes many quarters to recoup the full impact.","From a memory standpoint, prices increased roughly 50% last month, putting significant margin pressure on the Enterprise Group. We can mitigate some of this movement through pricing actions but similar to currency, the extent of the mitigation is dependent on many factors, including competition and demand. So, it will take some time for us to work through the challenge. Lastly, the EG execution issues will have some near-term impact, which should alleviate throughout the year as we move quickly to resolution. Consequently, we feel it\u2019s prudent to reduce our fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP EPS outlook by $0.12 in order to continue making the appropriate investments to secure the long-term success of the business. I view these headwinds as more temporary in nature and expect to recapture much of their impact through pricing actions.","With that, we expect Q2 2017 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41 to $0.45, and we expect fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to now be $1.88 to $1.98 from the prior outlook of $2 to $2.10. From a GAAP perspective, we expect Q2 2017 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of negative $0.03 to $0.01, and we expect fiscal year 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share to now be $0.60 to $0.70 from the prior outlook of $0.72 to $0.82. Keep in mind that this EPS outlook reflects the combined Company as it stands today with full year contributions from ES and software since we haven\u2019t yet closed the transactions. As is our typical practice, we\u2019ll update our outlook when we close each transaction. However, I do want to give you some information on how to think about the ES impact since the close is quickly approaching.","We expect the ES transaction to impact fiscal year 2017 EPS by approximately $0.42 including ES related stranded costs. We also want to highlight that ES only earns roughly one-third of its operating profit in the first two months of the given quarter as most customer milestones are in the last months. Consequently, we expect the ES transaction will impact Q2 2017 EPS by approximately $0.08 including ES related stranded costs. Also, similar to the separation of HPE and HPI, the spinoff of ES will likely cause a one-time non-cash GAAP-only charge in the second quarter from certain changes to our legal structure. The details of these changes are still being finalized. So, we\u2019ve not incorporated the impact to our GAAP outlook, but we expect them to result in a material write-down of deferred tax assets.","Finally, turning to cash flow. While this reduction in earnings outlook does put some pressure on cash flow, we\u2019re now expecting reduced ES pension funding payments and we\u2019ll maintain our full year fiscal year 2017 free cash flow outlook of negative $1.8 billion. As mentioned earlier, we do expect some of the timing benefits we saw in Q1 to reverse next quarter, so our Q2 free cash flow will likely be below seasonal norms.","Overall, while we\u2019re working through some near-term challenges, like Meg, I\u2019m confident that we have an effective near-term action plan as well as the right long-term strategy in place to position the future HPE for success.","Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner","Hi. Thank you. If I look at the server and storage performance this quarter, the numbers were pretty disappointing, and there seem to be a pretty significant deceleration. I think the bears would say that the cloud model is taking more share and that\u2019s pressuring your core business. Can you maybe comment on your view about how much the cloud is impacting your server and storage business?","Meg Whitman","Sure. So, listen, I think the cloud is impacting our server and storage business, but no more than we thought at the beginning of the year. And really, if you look at the server business per se and our results, within tier 1, we had a much lower demand from a single large customer that I discussed on the call. And we were also more selective around focusing on profitable deals. And the good news is that helped server margins year-over-year but it did depress the revenue a bit.","I think we did deliver strong growth in a number of our higher margin, better attach areas like high-performance compute, mission critical systems and the addition of SGI. And the good news is we also have some things coming up that I think will mitigate that decline. We\u2019re ramping our Synergy offering, we\u2019ve got the power of SGI and our high-performance compute that was part of HPE. We are also pursuing alliances very aggressively. When we owned ES, yes, we did some business with Accenture and Capgemini and the Indian firms, but they were always quite vary of us because they viewed us as owning a competitor. As ES gets spun off, there is a lot more opportunity for us to do business with those partners. And I think that will help mitigate the decline.","So, listen, I mean, I\u2019m optimistic that these actions will enable us to stabilize servers in FY17. I\u2019ll also say that Synergy is important because Synergy allows us to provide on-perm private cloud alternatives at public cloud economics, both the total cost of ownership as well as the consumption based pricing model. And we\u2019ve seen a number now of customers move workloads off the public cloud back into an on-perm datacenter because it\u2019s more cost effective. So that\u2019s the server apart.","Storage was challenged, I think by a continued contraction in traditional portfolio. Remember, we still have tape and some very old storage products that are in decline. And we also were impacted by SSD supply constraints. But on the positive side, all-flash grew almost 30% and would have been considerably higher than that without the SSD supply constraints. And then, we also announced a simplified pricing model and bundled compression offerings with 3PAR that was previously actually a competitive hole in our product.","So, I think we\u2019ve got -- one last thing is of course with the SimpliVity acquisition, we got now a whole new group of storage sellers where we can have broader market coverage, and we\u2019d become a more scale in that area. So, listen, there are real pressures, no question about it, but I don\u2019t think particularly more than we thought there was going to be in the quarter.","Sherri Scribner","And then, just as my follow-up. You took the full-year guidance down by about $0.12, but if you look at the first half, it doesn\u2019t seem like there was that much impact to the first half whereas most of the impact will be in the second half. Can you talk about the linearity of the FX impact and the commodity impact that you guys mention as being part of the takedown in guidance. Thank you.","Tim Stonesifer","Sure. So, if you look at FX as an example, we have a rolling hedge program, we do that by country; we do that by product. So, what you are seeing is the hedges that we put in place, call it six to nine months ago, which were favorable as they were all rolled up in Q1. So, there was no real impact from an EPS perspective driven by foreign exchange. And then when you look at DRAM pricing as an example that increased about 50% in the month of January. So, again, we had some supply built up or it\u2019s an inventory built up, so you don\u2019t see the full effect of that. So, you will see both, the FX and the commodity pricing flow through the rest of the year. Now we\u2019re going to try to price for some of that; we\u2019ve gone out with price increases; and it\u2019s really a question of what would the impact be to demand and what would be the competitive response. So, you will sort of see a flow through I would say, and sort of typical seasonality.","Meg Whitman","Sherri, let me add one thing about EPS takedown of about $0.12. So, when you think about commodities and you think about foreign exchange that was about -- we estimate about $0.12 of degradation. And the decision we had to make is did we want to cut $0.12 more of cost out of our cost structure. And as you all know, we\u2019ve been taking a lot of cost out of this Company over the last four and a half years. And my view was, we\u2019ve got very good investments in field selling costs, in innovation, in automation, in IT, that it\u2019s going to put us in very good stead for the long term. And I did not think it was the right thing to do to absorb all of that commodities and foreign exchange degradation by cutting more costs into what I think are going to be very high return on -- return on investment projects. So, we decided actually that the best long-term thing for the Company was to not cut into bone and meat.","Operator","The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes. At your Analyst Day and also on your earnings call at the end of the year, you provided three sets of the guidance, one for HPE as is which quite frankly is completely irrelevant at this point, given that you\u2019re going to be spinning off services, and you also provided guidance of $1.45 to $1.55 for the current year and $1.25 to $1.35 in EPS for Remain Co. Can you provide updated guidance for Remain Co go forward and current year? And I guess the question is, given that the erosion appears to be all in the Enterprise Group, in fact software and services were better than my numbers, should we be thinking about lowering the current year $1.45 to $1.55 by $0.12 and thinking of Remain Co earnings thereafter as being notably lower than the $1.25 to $1.35, and why not?","Tim Stonesifer","So, let me take a cut at that. So, we did guide the $2 to $2.10 as a combined company, because again similar to prior practices, until we actually separate, we will provide that outlook and then we\u2019ll adjust that outlook once the transactions have closed. So, to your -- to one of your questions around the as reported guide, the takedown would apply to that, so the $1.45 to $1.55 would go down by $0.12 on both ends -- in terms of the range. And again, that\u2019s primarily driven by the FX, commodity pricing and some execution challenges. When you look at the $1.25 to $1.35 number, from an ongoing perspective, because obviously we\u2019re not going to report that guide on a quarterly basis, it does have the 2017 assumptions in there. I think you\u2019ll still get within that range longer term. It really depends on how those price increases that we\u2019ve executed, how those take. So, the more that they take, you\u2019d be up at the higher end of that range; if they don\u2019t take given demand or competitive response, you\u2019d be at the lower end of that range.","Toni Sacconaghi","And then, just to follow-up, if I go back to when you last reported earnings in late November, the currency bundle really hasn\u2019t changed much. And I appreciate that DRAM pricing has changed in the month of January. But, I think most people were aware of a much-tougher commodity environment in November, in fact your sister company HPQ had been calling that out before November and it made provisions to adjust for that, both in pricing and in building inventory. So, I guess the question is, the only thing that really seems new or that you shouldn\u2019t have known about, was either the market changing or execution. Did you -- were you aware of this? I\u2019m sure you were aware in November; did you just think you could overcome them and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t update your guidance at the end of November or should we really be thinking that the market and your execution are really what the material differentiators are in terms of your choosing to lower the guidance now as opposed to in November when at least two of the forces were very apparent?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. So, I\u2019ll address that one and Meg, you can jump in here if you would like. So, let\u2019s start with FX. I think to your point, we guided in October for the full year 2017 outlook at SAM. So, at that point in time, the euro was trading at call at 1.10; and the yen, which has another significant impact was trading at about 103. When we came out on the fourth quarter earnings call, we did highlight that there was some pressure. So, we got a question, I can\u2019t remember who asked it. And we said yes, rates are less favorable than they were. I think at that point in time, the euro was about 1.06 and the yen as was at about 110, 111. But given the fact that we were three weeks into the year, given the fact that we were rolling into a new administration in the U.S. and we weren\u2019t quite sure how that was going to play out, as well as the fact that we had hedges in place that protected the first quarter, we decided to continue to monitor the currency environment, we would make some operational changes that we thought were appropriate. And that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t change the guide down.","As we sit here today, we\u2019re now five months into the year, and that euro is still sitting at about 1.06; the yen is still sitting at about 112. So, we felt it was prudent to adjust our guide now. And it\u2019s really -- it was a cognitive choice that Meg alluded to, is we had choices that we evaluated and we decided this was a prudent thing to do, so we could continue to drive the strategy, we continue to make the strategic investments that will drive long-term value. So, that\u2019s the foreign exchange piece.","And then, on the DRAM piece, those prices spiked in January, about 50% in January. We did do some advanced purchases in the fourth quarter but there was only so much you could buy because everybody sort of was facing the same thing, and there is only a limited amount of capacity. So again that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t see a lot of that pressure in our Q1 EPS because we were using inventory that we bought at lower pricing. And that\u2019s something that will continue to play out in Q2, Q3 and Q4. I mean, it depends on how the capacity comes on line. And we really don\u2019t see the foreign exchange changing drastically as we go forward as well.","So, hopefully, that answers your question.","Operator","The next question will be from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder Garcha","Just a couple of clarifications really, maybe for Meg. I think you\u2019ve talked about your TAM growing to 2% to 3% and at constant currency, backing out acquisitions et cetera, I think you\u2019ve hit a growth rate in that range or above that range about half the time since separation and half the time that hasn\u2019t been possible, since you\u2019ve separated. And that\u2019s a reasonable amount of time now. I\u2019m just wondering, do you still believe in that growth that the industry participants, do you think HPE can consistently hit those numbers? Does something maybe have to change on the M&A front to accelerate that growth in the revenue side? That\u2019s kind of my first question. And then, the second one on restructuring and cost savings, the fact that you\u2019re choosing not to take more cost out given the current challenges that you\u2019re seeing, is this -- does that also tell us that the efficiency drive and the inefficiency that HPE may have had in its cost now and it\u2019s going to be much more difficult balancing act between projects you want to keep and eliminating this redundant cost?","Meg Whitman","Yes. Okay. So, let me address the growth question. I think you\u2019re probably right that we\u2019ve grown about the half the quarter since we separated. And you\u2019ve got to look at first what is going to be the go forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise as opposed to also the whole company because in much of the last year, obviously Enterprise Services was more of a drag than EG was. But, let me answer the question about go forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise 2017, which is EG plus HPE Financial Services. I would say, yes. I think we can return to growth but there is one caveat that I would make and that is a single tier 1 service provider who was a big customer of our, slowing down orders dramatically. But for the rest of the business, ex that large single tier 1 service provider, I think we\u2019ve set ourselves up well to be prepared to tackle the future. I like our portfolio. We\u2019ve really reshaped this portfolio both inorganically as well as organically.","I think you should feel very good about TS. Remember, over the last three or four years, there was a lot of question, could we return TS to growth? And orders precursors revenue we\u2019ve seen orders grow and the last couple of quarters you\u2019ve seen revenue grow and orders grew again this quarter. So, we\u2019re very confident about the TS growth rate, and of course that happens to carry a much higher margin than our infrastructure products. Aruba continues to do very well and as I said, some of our other high growth areas. So, I\u2019m going to say yes, with the possible exception of the tier 1, the single tier 1 service provider and that could throw us into slightly negative growth for 2017.","On the cost out, so, listen, we have taken a lot of cost out of this Company. We\u2019ve improved the efficiencies, the business process reengineering. And by the way, embedded in our forecast for 2017 is all the reshaping that we did around Remain Co; costs are coming out. We\u2019ve totally reshaped how that business is run with far fewer layers and much more efficiency. So that will continue. I do think after we\u2019re separated, there\u2019s going to be potentially some more cost to come out. Right now, we\u2019re carrying almost the full IT load because the IT team is doing all the separations. We\u2019ll skinny down IT. Obviously some of IT will go to software, some will obviously go to CSC. So, I think that will help us. And then there\u2019s some other things that we can go after, but I have to say, quite honestly, the low-hanging fruit is gone.","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. Just to elaborate on that a little bit, if you look at our OpEx for Q1, we were down year-over-year about $340 million. Now, granted, we have the TippingPoint divestiture, so I\u2019ll call it from an operational basis, it\u2019s roughly $220 million. So, we do have a lot of cost takeout in the plan; we\u2019re executing upon that. I think when we get to -- when we talk a little bit about this at some point, when you get to the Q4 of 2017, we do this benchmarking as an example on all of our functions. From a run rate perspective, we\u2019ll be at that benchmark, except for the IT and the real estate component. So, again, it takes us a little bit of time to get through these separations and then we can really zero in on the IT and the real estate front to continue to capitalize on those savings. But, I think our view is there\u2019s always opportunity for cost, it\u2019s just a question of how much and how quickly can you take that out. And right now, we feel like we\u2019re taking out quite a bit of cost.","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Milunovich","Hey, Meg, could you talk a bit more about these management changes? You mentioned the Head of Sales -- the Head of TS, who I thought was supposedly doing a great job; you\u2019ve always spoken very highly of him, and all these GEOs. I mean, it seems to kind of coincide with the spins-offs but I don\u2019t know why that would affect a lot movement around EG. So, maybe you could talk about some of the individuals involved and why all the changes?","Meg Whitman","Sure. So, remember, as we go forward as Remain Co, if you will, which is EG plus HPE FS, we need to set up EG to be a very lean and cost effective competitor because this way in Europe we compete against the Chinese, obviously this is a very, very competitive market. So, we wanted to reorganize ourselves in a way that we thought would be much more cost effective and more efficient. And the first was, we appointed Peter Ryan to be the new Head of Global Sales. We\u2019ve actually never had a Head of Global Sales. He is now the Head of Global Sales and he has got three new regions heads, Jim Merritt, who used to be in Asia and did a fantastic job for us in Asia, has come back to the United States; and then we promoted Andy Isherwood to be the Head of Europe, who filled in behind Peter Ryan because he had been Head of Europe. So, I\u2019ve got three new region heads plus a new -- Peter being a new Head of Global Sales. They are not new to HP, but they are new in their roles.","Secondarily, we have now real plans to grow TSS, which is our Technology Services Support business as well as TS Consulting. So, Scott Weller still runs TSS; Rafael Brugnini still runs TSC, but we have hired someone to take both of those businesses and really drive growth overall in the services business because we\u2019ve got to grow our advisory and transform service; we have to grow our support services business as we have in the past, and there is a lot of opportunity in some of the new products, particularly around Flexible Capacity Services. So, we hired a new executive named Ana Pinczuk, who is going to be in charge of all services, Scott Weller\u2019s still in place and we think very highly of Scott, and Rafael Brugnini is still in place.","We also hired a new leader for our channel program. We had a fellow who was hired in a number of years ago, who actually did a very good job for us but was really focused on selling cloud services. And so, we actually hired a fellow by the name of Denzil Samuels, who has a long history with the channel. He most recently was at GE. And so, he has come in, in the last month or two months to run all the channel worldwide. Yes, Scott Dunsire is still in place in the United States. And so, we\u2019ve got consistency there but we do have a new head of the channel.","So, I think all these folks to some degree were also doing double duty. We were making divestitures; we were doing M&A; we were doing separations; and Antonio was doing a lot of double duty as well. So, I think the good news is largely that is through the pipeline or to the python, if you will. And I\u2019m feeling pretty good about people settling into to their new roles. But quite frankly, I probably put more change into this organization in Q1 then I probably should have.","Tim Stonesifer","And I wouldn\u2019t, I mean, this doesn\u2019t go under the org change category, but I wouldn\u2019t underestimate at the local level the impact on the country leaders which obviously do a lot of selling for us. I mean, when you do a separation like this, you have to go out and speak with customers, you have to explain to them the ES separation from HPE; you have to deal with workers\u2019 councils that they are going to be any organizational changes. So, there is quite a bit of work that kind of ripples through the organization.","Meg Whitman","And we\u2019ve got two separations going on now at once. And I\u2019ll add one more thing. When we separated HPI from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, it was one family; there was one adult that was supervising both the separation of the siblings. Now, we\u2019re doing separations, that is a merger with the third-party and that actually adds the complexity that we knew about, but has created some complexity. And by the way the most intense time for the ES separation was in Q1, no question about it. And now, we\u2019re on sort of nice glide path to March 31st.","Steve Milunovich","You talked about market\u2019s being difficult, but can you talk a bit about competition, particularly against folks like Cisco, Lenovo? And do you feel like you\u2019re missing a window a bit to take advantage of whatever disruption is happening at Dell EMC?","Meg Whitman","No, I think we actually did quite a good job of intercepting that merger, and we\u2019ve recruited a lot of new channel partners, they\u2019re beginning to ramp, a much as we did a good job intercepting the server move from IBM to Lenovo, that we did a very good job intercepting a lot of that business. So, I think we\u2019ve taken advantage of that to some degree. Lenovo is around -- they\u2019ve got their hands full on a couple of other things, the server business and Motorola. But, Dell is being very aggressive, particularly in the server side of things. And we\u2019re countering that. When we think it makes the right sense, we\u2019re not doing share for share sake here but we\u2019re being smart about it. And then in Europe, we actually are seeing the Chinese. We\u2019re seeing Huawei being more aggressive. And we\u2019re trying to avoid what we learnt in the PC business, which is they do the land and expand. If you can keep them from landing, then that is a much better long-term strategy. So, we\u2019re working hard on that too.","I\u2019d also say that joint venture in China is actually working quite well. There\u2019s been some growing pains there but actually we\u2019re quite optimistic about that and optimistic about the Shingwa team that is now in charge of that business. And listen, given the trade situation and what may or may not happen with the administration, I\u2019m very glad I\u2019m part of a joint venture in China.","Operator","The next question will be from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Katy Huberty","When I look at the storage business, a number of the headwinds you\u2019re discussing including the clients in the legacy business and higher commodity prices or dynamics that some of your big competitors also face. And yet when I look at NetApp, the closest public peer, they grew their business 5% sequentially; your storage business declined 12% sequentially. So, that\u2019s a huge gap. And I just wonder if you can talk a little bit more about what changed your momentum so quickly relative to peers, and then what needs to be done to get back on track?","Meg Whitman","So, I\u2019d say, listen, the bright spot in the storage portfolio continues to be the all-flash growth, which was almost 30% and it would have been considerably higher if we\u2019d had more SSD supply. So, we\u2019re feeling really good about our all-flash display -- I mean, our all-flash product. Some of the other parts of the business were weaker than probably they should have been. I think I\u2019ll attribute some of that to execution and some of that to market. So, we\u2019re not happy with the storage performance this quarter. I\u2019m quite happy with the all-flash situation but there\u2019s other things that we\u2019re going to buck up as we go forward. So, I think that\u2019s the way I would characterize the quarter.","Katy Huberty","And then the weakness at a major tier 1 service provider, can you talk about that little bit more, it\u2019s got a HP year-on-year comp issue or is there just a change in the momentum of buying at that particular customer?","Meg Whitman","It\u2019s actually both, it\u2019s a year-over-year comp issue and it is a different buying pattern than have been anticipated. And so, we will see if that corrects over the next two or three, four quarters. Built into our forecast is that it does not correct. So, if it does, that would be an upside. And again, remember, these tier 1 deals, we do make money on them but they are not as profitable as the core ISS. So that doesn\u2019t translate as dynamically into operating profit as it does to revenue. So, they are facing a very competitive business; the tier 1 business is very competitive, and we\u2019ll see what happens there.","Operator","The next question will be from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Maynard Um","Within TS, if I exclude the SGI services business, which I presume is in there, I\u2019m calculating that the core TS was maybe down on 2% year-over-year. And I\u2019m just wondering if this is purely a function of slowing hardware or is there slowing in that re-classed ES revenue that you moved in there? And I guess, what I\u2019m really trying to figure out is whether the larger hardware declines that are happening now, will have an adverse impact on TS or if the new services are now growing significantly more? And then, I have a follow-up.","Meg Whitman","So, Maynard, the organic TS result was 2.5% in constant currency, 2.5% growth in constant currency. So, we\u2019re actually feeling pretty good about that. And it is driven by the new product acceleration, data center care, proactive care, FSC. And if you go back three or four years on TS, in all rights for a while there that business should have been down 25% a year because it was so driven by our mission critical business. The TS team deserves a huge amount of credit for diversifying the product and actually having that business down only single-digits. Now with the new products coming on line and being actually quite successful, orders are up and we anticipate that business will grow organically, forget adding the SGI services on top of that. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about that business and anticipate we\u2019re going to see growth.","Tim Stonesifer","Keep in mind that business -- about 85% of those revenue streams are recurring. So that\u2019s why we are confident in the growth throughout the course of the year.","Meg Whitman","Yes. And so, listen, of the lot of the server business that was weak, didn\u2019t have high attach to it anyway. Okay, so, tier 1 service provider has no service attached to it. So, it\u2019s not a drag on our services business.","Maynard Um","Great. And then, with the incremental cash you\u2019ll be getting from the divestitures, any guidance on how you intend to use that cash, particularly against the backdrop of the Company being more acquisitive lately, and the possibility for a tax repatriation holiday? Thanks.","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. So, I think that we are going to continue to execute the returns based capital allocation strategy. We feel like that that\u2019s been working well for us. So, in Q1, as an example, we will return $750 million in cash in the form of share repurchases and dividends. So, we\u2019re still committed to that $3 billion that we\u2019ve talked about at SAM, again in the form of share repurchases and dividends.","Now, I will say, we are biased toward share repurchases. But we feel like that framework is working well with us, and we are going to continue to operate within that framework. As far as the repatriation, we haven\u2019t incorporated any of that into our plans because we are not sure what is going to happen, to be quite honest with you. But if there was a onetime holiday as the majority of our cash is offshore, we would certainly benefit from that, like many other companies. But, I would just balance it with, even if we were to see some sort of holiday, I\u2019m not so sure that it would change our returns based approach; I\u2019m not so sure it would change our approach or strategy towards M&A as we go forward.","Meg Whitman","I agree with that. I mean, remember what we\u2019ve said is the kind of acquisitions that have worked well for this Company are 3Com, 3PAR, Aruba; SGI is actually going to be very successful and SimpliVity, we\u2019re excited about it; it\u2019s too new to declare a victory, we just closed on Friday. But what do they have in common? They\u2019ve got reasonable valuations; they leverage our distribution channels, they\u2019re complementary technologies and they drive profitable growth. So, I think the best indication of the future is the past.","Andy Simanek","Thanks, Maynard. I think we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","And that will be Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Shannon Cross","Just can we go back to the tier 1 service provider? I\u2019m just curious as to whether or not the changes you saw there were basically a slowdown from a capacity need for them or was it a competitive decision, so you\u2019re just facing more competition, maybe from white box? I guess, I\u2019m trying to figure out if this is sort of just a one-timer or if there is something fundamentally changing in the business model?","Meg Whitman","Yes. I mean, I\u2019m not entirely sure; what I will tell you is that they have dramatically decreased their purchasing below commitments that they had made to us.","Shannon Cross","And then, Tim, just a quick clarification, and maybe talk a little bit about cash flow during the year. You gave us few comments on how we should think about it from a linearity standpoint for fiscal second quarter. But, I just wanted to confirm it, so we\u2019re down to $1.9 billion, then what should be the pension funding? And then is there anything -- so, that\u2019s all done now; there won\u2019t be any more coming out I guess in this quarter. And then just how should we think about the opportunity to drive more working capital out of the model? Maybe you\u2019re not going to be cutting costs as much in the P&L but is there more room from a working capital standpoint, as we look forward?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, sure. I\u2019ll just give you a total year perspective. So, our guide, we\u2019re still comfortable with the negative $1.8 billion. We have, to your point, we\u2019ve paid out the $1.9 billion in pension. Now, there\u2019re some more payments to be made because we don\u2019t finalize everything until we close the transaction. But, we do expect that those payments will be less than the $2.5 billion that we\u2019ve communicated at SAM. So, we\u2019ll see some favorability there. The reason why we\u2019re sticking with our guide is because obviously with the $0.12 takedown, that drives some earnings pressure. So, net-net, we still feel very comfortable with the free cash flow guide. As far as working capital, again, we have some timing elements here and there. But I would say overall assumptions over the course of the year have not changed since the guidance we gave at SAM.","Andy Simanek","Great. Thank you, Shannon. So, I think with that, thank you everyone for joining today. And we\u2019ll wrap up the call. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines."],"10966":["Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) Q3 2019 Results Conference Call August 27, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Andrew Simanek - Head of Investor Relations","Antonio Neri - President and Chief Executive Officer","Tarek Robbiati - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Shannon Cross - Cross Research","Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein","Paul Coster - JP Morgan","Simon Leopold - Raymond James","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo","Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Good morning, good afternoon and good evening. And welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Earnings Conference Call. My name is Gary, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We'll be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Andrew Simanek","Good afternoon. I'm Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I'd like to welcome you to our fiscal 2019 third quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE's President and Chief Executive Officer and Tarek Robbiati, HPE's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before handing the call over to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.

As mentioned, the earnings presentation can be found posted to our Web site and it is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call.","With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.","Antonio Neri","Thanks Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In Q3, we continue to demonstrate disciplined execution, which expanded profitability across the Company. In a more uneven market, we improved both gross and operating margins, delivered strong non-GAAP earnings per share and generated a record level of year-to-date free cash flow. These results reflect our momentum as we take deliberate steps to shift our portfolio to higher-value, software-defined offering delivered as a service.","This quarter, we also advanced our innovation agenda. We made organic investments in new products and announced strategic acquisitions that drive growth by significantly enhancing our ability to help customers with their digital transformations. We delivered revenues of $7.2 billion in Q3, up 1% sequentially, and down 3% year-over-year adjusted for the Tier 1 business. Our revenue growth was primarily impacted by delivery actions through HP Next, including portfolio rationalization, as well as some microeconomic factors.","Importantly, we continue to deliver growth in key areas of strategic investment, including high-performance compute, Hyperconverged Infrastructure, Hybrid Cloud, HPE Pointnext services orders, of which GreenLake is a key driver of our growth. Our gross margin of 33.9% is up 170 basis points from last quarter and 340 basis points year-over-year. This was fueled by the mix shift to higher value offerings and commodities pricing tailwinds.","Non-GAAP operating profit margin of 9.9% is up 80 basis points year-over-year. And our non-GAAP EPS of $0.45 is up 7% year-over-year and above the high end of our previous outlook. But the quantity and the quality of our free cash flow continues to improve. Year-to-date, our free cash flow is $860 million, which is up $790 million from the same prior year period. As a result of our ongoing performance, I am very pleased to say that this marks our seventh quarter of raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook for the year.","Before I provide specific highlights of our business performance, I will offer a few perspectives on the macro environment. We continue to see uneven demand due in part to ongoing trade tensions, which impact market stability and customer confidence. This is showing up in elongated sales cycles, particularly in larger deals as we noted last quarter and reiterated during our IR Summit at our Discover conference in June.","However, our customers continue to affirm their need to accelerate their digital transformations to improve business outcomes and customer and employee experiences while reducing cost.","The exposure of data will continue to fuel underlying demand for solutions to help, protect, store, manage and analyze their vigor. And this is where we are laser focused. We have a strong portfolio of solutions and services that span the Intelligent Edge and hybrid cloud. We are uniquely in position to help our customers with this transition. This is why at our Discover conference, we unveiled new innovations to accelerate customers' enterprises with eccentric cloud enabled and data driven solutions. And I announced that we will offer our entire HP portfolio as a service by 2022.","To share pro forma highlights from our business segments, I will start with Intelligent Edge. In Q3, our Intelligent Edge business delivered revenue of $762 million, up 14% sequentially, which is better than our sequential growth last year but down 2% year-over-year. As we noted last quarter, we are actively addressing the sales coverage model in United States. I am pleased with the actions taken to-date that have resulted in positive attraction with our U.S. product business, which was up over 40% sequentially.","We delivered solid growth in EMEA and APJ and in our Aruba services business. This growth was driven in part by new customer wins. For instance, Vancouver Clinic, which provides healthcare services across Southern Washington, wanted to deliver modern healthcare and reliable connectivity for staff, nurses and doctors to access patient records and utilize medical devices. They chose Aruba's mobile first network with ArubaOS 8 to deliver secure mobility and allow the clinic to perform live network upgrades without interrupting connectivity.","A key factor in their decision was Aruba ClearPass, which addressed their security concerns as it allows the IT team to quickly and easily create policies for authenticating and on-boarding new devices. With a population of more than 750,000 residents, the County of San Mateo here in California has standardized on Aruba for their wireless network access control and edge switching solutions. A key factor in the county's decision to choose Aruba was its need for secure and stable access to mission critical applications in locations such as the county funded hospitals.","Customers are recognizing the advantage of Aruba solutions to deliver exceptional customer experiences of the Intelligent Edge. This is one reason Aruba emerged as the only vendor in the leaders' category in the recent Forrester New Wave Wireless Solution report, which evaluated eight of the most significant vendors in the wireless space. We also launched new offerings during the quarter, including solutions for a fast growing mid-and small-market customer segments and extended services to capture additional enterprise customers.","We introduced Aruba Instant On, a secure, scalable and simple Wi-Fi solution for small businesses, allowing the SMB market to benefit from a proven enterprise expertise. Now small businesses can deliver a seamless wireless experience with an easy setup that can be managed from any mobile device. We extended the HPE GreenLake portfolio to the Edge by announcing HPE GreenLake for Aruba, which gives organization flexibility and choice in how they obtain and support their Edge infrastructure.","We unveiled exciting enhancements to Aruba Central, our cloud based network platform that manages more than 20,000 customers' branch networks. With this next generation, customer will benefit from artificial intelligence powered network analytics, improved security and user centric assurance for wired, wireless and Edge infrastructures from a single point of control. We believe the Intelligent Edge is the natural next step of the cloud experience. The opportunity at the edge is all about using technology and data to bridge the digital and physical worlds. Increasingly, business outcomes will depend on the experiences that enterprises can deliver at the Edge. Our strong portfolio enables us to capitalize on this exciting opportunity.","Turning to Hybrid IT, we delivered our highest operating margins since Q1 fiscal year '17. Our operating margin of 12.7% was up 260 basis points year-over-year. Revenue of $5.5 billion was down 3% year-over-year when adjusted for Tier 1 in China. While we saw some signs of microeconomic softness and longer sales cycles in certain markets, we realize the year-over-year traction in critical areas for customers. High performance compute realized its 10th consecutive quarter of growth and compostable cloud grew 28%. While storage overall experienced a modest revenue decline against the tougher market backdrop in year-over-year compare, we gained momentum in key strategic areas like HP Nimble Storage, which grew 21% and Hyperconverged which grew 4%.","On the innovation front, we announced HPE Primera, a new storage platform for mission critical workloads. HPE Primera offers unprecedented deployment times of 20 minutes, a guarantee of 100% data availability and upgrades with no downtime for a truly differentiated customer experience. HP Pointnext services orders included Nimble orders grew 2% in constant currency, as we have the highest quarter yet for services intensity. We demonstrated success in attaching a greater level of services and favorable mix shift to infrastructure with higher attach rates. HPE GreenLake is now one of our fastest growing businesses.","This quarter, we continued to see very strong customer momentum with order growth of 10% year-over-year, or 42% excluding one large deal from the prior year. In addition to bringing as a service to the Edge with HPE GreenLake for Aruba this quarter, we also launched new solution to accelerate HPE GreenLake growth in the mid-market. Customers are choosing HPE GreenLake for choice, flexibility and speed to market. For instance, we were selected by the Publicis Groupe for our HPE GreenLake for SAP HANA, a managed private cloud solution to provide speed, scalability and budget predictability.","As part of their most to SAP HANA, Publicis evaluated public cloud alternatives but determined that on-premises model with our pay per use managed solution built on HPE's recognized industry leadership was the right option for them. Additional customer wins during the quarter demonstrate the strength of our portfolio. We won a significant deal with Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG. The Company was looking for a cloud like pay-per-use model with an intelligent data platform that could offer high-speed and low latency. And HPE was the only company with a model that could meet both needs through HPE GreenLake and HPE 3PAR.","In addition, Chase Center the new home of the NBA Golden State Warriors chose HPE SimpliVity for its 18,000 capacity arena, enabling our private cloud to run application at scale. Chase Center will open its store next month ahead of the 2019-2020 NBA Season, and is already working with Aruba to power personalized digital connected experiences for fans and guests. In Q3, we also expanded our innovation through our important partnerships and strategic acquisitions. We deepened our strategic relationship with Google Cloud to deliver true hybrid cloud for containers with a choice for as a service delivery through HP GreenLake. We first announced the relationship in April with two HPE validated designs for Google Cloud Anthos. This expansion shows the growing understanding and acceptance of the fact that the world is hybrid.","Just yesterday, we announced the expansion of our partnership with VMware to offer VMware Cloud Foundation as a service. Through the integration of HPE GreenLake and HPE Synergy with VMware Cloud Foundation, our two companies will allow mutual customers to keep all their applications, tools and data in place, while achieving the benefits of cloud and compostable infrastructure. On the acquisition front just after our Q3 close, we acquired MapR's business assets. We have been building our HPE AI portfolio over the last few years. With MapR's enterprise grade file system and cloud native storage, we have a complete portfolio of products to drive AI and analytics applications.","The technology is also highly complementary to BlueData's container platform strategy. HPE plans to support existing customer deployments along with ongoing renewals, and we are pleased to welcome MapR customers and partners and the MapR team to the HPE family. As you would remember, we announced the Cray acquisition early in Q3 and now expect to close the Cray transaction by the end of Q4 fiscal year 2019 earlier than originally planned. HPC continues to be a strategic focus area for HPE, and we have a clear differentiation that is even further strengthened by Cray. For instance, Cray recently announced its Second Exascale Supercomputer Award with Lawrence Livermore National Lab. And last week, HPE jointed NASA Ames at the grand opening of its Modular Supercomputing Facility in Mountain View, California. Supporting our purpose to advance the way we live and work, HPE is building a new supercomputer based on the HPE SGI 8600 system as researchers work to land the first woman and the next man on the moon by 2024.","Turning to HPE Financial Services, revenue of $818 million represented a modest year-over-year decline. However, financing volume was up 5% when adjusted for currency and operating profit increased 90 basis points year-over-year. HPEFS remains a strategic business that continues to help customers manage and monetize their existing assets in new ways, as well as address the entire product lifecycle to reduce the cost resource demands of IT.","In summary, I am pleased with our disciplined and focused execution which delivered strong operational performance this quarter. We have been able to simultaneously invest in the future growth of our business, while expanding operating margins, delivering non-GAAP EPS above our previous outlook and generating record levels of cash flow. I remain very confident in our strategy and our ability to continue to drive profitable growth as we pursue the exciting plans we unveiled at Discover to offer our entire portfolio as a service by 2022. By doing so, we will be well positioned to deliver long-term recurring revenue growth and profit.","It is an exciting time at HPE. Over the last two years, we have shifted our portfolio and aligned our investments and execution to that shift. The hard work has paved the way for us to innovate and we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us and to continue to deliver strong shareholder value. We look forward to providing more details about our long terms plans at our Security Analyst Meeting in New York on October 23rd.","With that, I will turn it over to Tarek.","Tarek Robbiati","Thank you very much, Antonio. Now, let me provide more detail on our financial results for the quarter. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to better highlight our performance in the third quarter of our fiscal year.","Starting with Slides 1 and 2, I would like to talk about the key highlights from this quarter. The main takeaways are that we have significantly expanded gross margin this quarter, while simultaneously making further investments in the business and delivering non-GAAP EPS above our previous outlook that we will raise for the full year, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of increased non-GAAP EPS guidance. We have also reached record levels of free cash flow compared to the prior year-to-date period, and grew revenue sequentially in an uneven macro environment.","While our revenue continues to be in transition due to deliberate actions such as Tier 1 sales, China optimization and A&PS country exits, we're pivoting our portfolio towards with higher margin and more recurring revenues. This has translated into gross margin expanding by 340 basis points year-over-year this quarter, driven by our portfolio mix shift and commodity tailwinds. Our ongoing execution discipline demonstrates that our underlying profitability and quality of earnings continue to improve quarter-after-quarter. I'll talk more about this in the upcoming slides.","On the cash front, we delivered the highest level of free cash flow we have achieved through the third quarter of the fiscal year as Hewlett Packard Enterprise. With respect to GAAP EPS, we finished the quarter with an EPS loss of $0.02 that included $0.42 reserve due to a one-time arbitration award to DXC compared to the previously provided outlook of $0.29 to $0.33 per share for the quarter. While we are disappointed with the ruling, it is important to note that at this stage, our fiscal year '19 free cash flow guidance remains unchanged.","Finally, we also announced recent strategic investment in Cray and MapR. We already closed the purchase of MapR's business assets that we acquired for less than one-time annual revenue. We are also making good progress towards closing the Cray transaction, which is now expected to close by the end of quarter four of fiscal year '19 earlier than originally anticipated. We look forward to driving significant value from both these acquisitions next year.","Moving onto to a macro view of the business on Slide 3. We continue to see an uneven demand environment, largely caused by trade tensions similar to what we called out last quarter's earnings and reiterated at our Discover event in June. While elongated sales cycles persist and remain more pronounced for larger enterprise deals, they are not materially worse than in June. HPE's broad portfolio and global footprint makes us well diversified to handle choppy markets. We have also been able to successfully navigate all of the recent tariff increases on China exports that have been factored into our outlook.","We will now move to Slide 4 that shows our performance in the quarter by segment. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge, we began to make progress improving our go-to-market execution in the United States where our product revenue grew over 40% sequentially. We have also introduced several new offerings for the mid market and SMB market that are gaining traction. Aruba services growth continues to be solid across all geographies.","In hybrid IT, we continued to grow our higher margin offerings with Composable Cloud growing at 28% and high performance compute at 2%. Within storage, we again saw notable strength in Nimble Storage, which grew 21% and Hyperconverged Infrastructure, which grew 4%. In our services business, Pointnext operational services orders and Nimble services orders together were up 3% in constant currency, driven by GreenLake orders, which grew 10 % year-over-year. Pointnext advisory and professional services orders also grew in constant currency. And within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 5% year-over-year in constant currency and return on equity remains strong, exceeding 15% again this quarter.","Now we will turn to Slide 5 that demonstrates the many contributions we derived from our unique partnership with H3C. As you know, H3C is a major player in the fast growing China market with number one market share in campus switching and wireless LAN. As noted on the slide, profit contribution from H3C occurs in three areas; HPE's sales of products to H3C for resale in China market; HPE's resale of H3C's products in the rest of the world outside China; and HPE's share or H3C's profits based upon HPE's 49% stake in H3C. We greatly value our unique partnership with H3C, which helps us capitalize on the incredible growth opportunity in the world's second largest IT market. In addition, HPE's 49% equity stake and H3C has been increasing in value through the put option and publicly traded market value of units.","Slide 6 shows are EPS performance to-date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.45 in Q3 is well above our previously provided outlook of $0.40 to $0.44 due to operational outperformance. This marks the ninth quarter in a row that we have exceeded the high end of our non-GAAP quarterly outlook. On a year-to-date basis, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share has grown 21%. As a reminder, we ended fiscal year '17 with a non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $0.94. Based on our updated fiscal year '19 non-GAAP EPS outlook of $1.74 at the midpoint, we have demonstrated tremendous progress in non-GAAP EPS, which has grown by over 85% in the last two years. We have been able to achieve this through significant expansion of our gross and operating margins, which I will talk about next.","Turning to gross margins on Slide 7. We continued to deliver significant gross margin expansion as we focus on profitable growth in hybrid IT, shifting our portfolio towards higher value, higher gross margin offerings and commodity tailwinds. Gross margins of 33.9% was up 340 basis points year-over-year and up 170 basis points quarter-over-quarter, the sixth quarter of sequential expansion.","Since Q1 fiscal year 2018, we have expanded gross margin by 560 basis points through a combination of portfolio mix shift, HPE Next initiative and commodity tailwinds. Expanding gross margins is very important as it demonstrates that we have a broad portfolio of software defined, IP rich offerings of significant value to our customers. Similar to the last quarter, let me show you on Slide 8 how the mix shift in our portfolio is improving our underlying profitability and quality of earnings. Year-to-date, we have expanded gross margins by 270 basis points, driven by portfolio mix shift combined with supply chain efficiencies and lower commodities cost.","Now let me put in perspective the key metrics to measure our mix shift as we pivot our portfolio. The left hand side of the chart shows how the various businesses within hybrid IT contributed to HPE's overall revenue growth in the first three quarters of this fiscal year along with a spectrum of gross margins. First, currency has been a headwind this year of about 130 basis points year-to-date. Second, we continued to wind down the low margin areas of our Tier 1 business that was roughly 5% of our total revenue last year versus only about 2% this year, but at much better gross margins. In compute, the volume compute business declined slightly diluting growth by 70 basis points. But more importantly, our higher-margin value compute business grew 4% year-to-date and contributed 90 basis points to overall growth at much higher margin.","Storage contributed another 20 basis points to overall growth year-to-date, driven by 49% growth in Nimble. In services, we grew operational services orders, including Nimble services at 2% year to date, driven by GreenLake subscription services, which was up 24%. These are both important lead indicators to overall future point next revenue growth. The key takeaway is that our portfolio mix shift is working and our underlying profitability and overall quality of earnings is materially improved.","Now moving to Slide 9. We have been able to make significant investments in R&D and sales to support future revenue growth, while driving significant non-GAAP operating margin expansion. HPE Next has enabled us to redirect investments back into the business, including a double digit increase year-to-date in R&D to drive organic innovation in our higher margin, faster growth areas of the portfolio and additional investments in go to market to improve sales effectiveness. We expect to drive revenue productivity and growth in the upcoming quarters from these strategic investments. Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating margin has find back up to nearly 10%, up over 250 basis points versus six quarters ago.","Turning to cash flow on Slide 10. Free cash flow was seasonally very strong at $648 million in Q3. On a year-to-date basis, we have delivered a record level of $860 million in free cash flow that is up $790 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher profitability and lower one-time payments. Underpinning our year-to-date free cash flow performance is an over $900 million improvement in our cash flow from operations relative to last year. Consequently, at this stage, we believe that we can absorb the unexpected DXC award payment of $666 million to be made in Q4 within our existing full year outlook of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flow.","Slide 11 shows our capital returns to-date. As part of our continued $7 billion capital return plans through fiscal year '19, we returned $727 million to shareholders during the quarter. We paid $150 million in dividends and repurchased $577 million worth of shares in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders with $500 million in dividend and $1.9 billion in share repurchases.","Now turning to our outlook on Slide 12. As a reminder, at SAM, we originally guided our fiscal year '19 non-GAAP EPS outlook to be $1.51 to $1.61. Due to our strong non-GAAP EPS performance, we raised our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 in Q1, and other $0.06 in Q2 to $1.62 to $1.72. With continued operational outperformance in Q3, we are again raising our EPS guidance for the full year. We now expect to finish fiscal year '19 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of a $1.72 to a $1.76, and we expect our fiscal year '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.65 to $0.69. This is now the seventh consecutive quarter that we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook.","So overall, I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make on our revenue and margin transition. We will continue to execute against our strategy of shifting our portfolio towards profitable growth that will drive our free cash flow and ultimately shareholder returns. And as Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us at our Securities Analyst Meeting on October 23rd in New York where we will provide an update on our strategy and financial outlook.","Now with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Katy Huberty","Yes, thank you, good afternoon. We\u2019ve heard from some of your peers over the last couple of weeks that lower commodity costs are starting to be pass-through to customers in the form of lower ASPs. Can you just talk through how that will influence margins over the next couple of quarters? Can you hold on to the margin benefit from commodity prices, or will some of that come out of the model? And then I have a follow-up.","Antonio Neri","Yes, thanks, Katy for the question. Definitely, the commodity prices has started to come down. But I think we have executed with discipline on pricing and costs. And therefore, we're able to hold a lot of that. And in the short-term, we believe that will be the case, think about one to two quarters. But at the same time, let's remind ourselves that the content, since you asked the question about ASPs. The content that gets attached to each of the solutions continue to grow. So whether it is memory, sizing or storage sizing continues to grow. While the cost per bit maybe coming down, the reality more our overall content gets attached, and therefore less impact on AUPs. But I think we have done an excellent job in retaining the cost decline through more content attach and better pricing discipline. Tarek has a comment on that.","Tarek Robbiati","I just want to add to what Antonio said. There are two effects had played, as you pointed out; one is a tailwind from commodities that Antonio commented on; and there is also the revenue mix shift. The revenue mix shift is really critical to us sustaining the gross margins going forward. And we're confident that by continuing to grow the areas, the revenue streams of higher gross margin, we can maintain the level of gross margins we have overall.","Katy Huberty","And then just as a follow-up on cash flow, you're holding the full year guidance despite the over $600 million payment. Can you just talk about what the offsetting positives are to help you hold free cash flow guidance?","Tarek Robbiati","Yes, I'm glad you asked the question. Last time even I spoke and you asked us why we didn't raise the free cash flow guidance, you may remember that. My answer to your prior question was we had a pretty wide range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. So we stopped to that guidance back then. And now specifically with DXC award from the arbitration, we feel that there are essentially three factors that give us confidence to be able to still deliver the guidance at $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.","Number one, you know that our Q4 quarter is the strongest one from a free cash flow generation. We continue to believe this will be the case in this quarter; number two, if you really look at the free cash flow guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and the outperformance on non-GAAP EPS that our performance is about $250 million in underlying cash flow earnings; and number three, we also said at the beginning of the fiscal year that our working capital will be this year contributor to free cash flow as opposed to a use of cash flow resources. So the combination of these three factors makes us believe that at this time, we can withstand the payment of $666 million to DXC. I will not hide from you that this won't be easy. But at this stage, we feel comfortable we can do that.","Operator","Next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Shannon Cross","I wanted to dig a bit more into the gross margin. I understand Next is a big part and obviously components. But you know, I think Tarek, you said it would be sustainable at these levels. And I'm kind of curious as to how far you think you can take some of the improvements that you're doing right now? And how much further there is to go with gross margin? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","So as Antonio said, we feel that the commodity tailwinds will continue for a little bit, couple of quarters as he mentioned in the prior question. Over and above that the revenue mix shift plays a very important role in driving higher gross margins. The revenue streams that we have highlighted on our presentation on Slide 7, if numbering is correct -- Slide 8, excuse me. If you really stack up these revenue streams, they all come up with improved gross margins individually due to the commodities, but also as the more higher value revenue streams from value, compute and storage kick-in, you can see that the revenue mix will move into favorable gross margin territory.","And third, I think you know we are also as a management team looking always at ways under HPE Next and otherwise through our global operations team, finding efficiencies in the way we repurchase commodities to build our product that we manufacture. So on the whole we feel that we have sufficient levers between commodity tailwinds, supply chain efficiencies and revenue mix to sustain the gross margin.","Antonio Neri","And I will add then on, which you've kind of -- Tarek, provided a comprehensive answer is the fact there is always opportunity to improve our cost structure. HPE Next was the framework to go about it, and we made huge progress. But since then we have cover all the areas, which we are executing and that's the normal course of business management.","Shannon Cross","And then I understand net of Tier 1, you were down about 30% in revenue and there is puts and takes throughout the model. How do you think about revenue as a -- revenue growth versus profitability? I don't know, Antonio, if you want to sort of just balance them off, because clearly at some point we would help you shift back more into a revenue growth situation. So that will take acquisition and continue mix shift. So, I\u2019m just curious how you sort of think about that versus cash flow and margin? Thank you.","Antonio Neri","I mean listen finding the right balance between growth and profit is always what we are after. I think as Tarek said, the portfolio mix shift is something that we are completely committed to do and is paying off, which has allowed us to make investments in the business in the areas we see the growth is going to happen going forward. And in that investment is both organic and inorganic, so we made a commitment to particular segments of the market on Intelligent Edge, which I believe is the next frontier through connectivity, security and the cloud consumption model.","I think the multiple use cases we see expanding in that space are sources of growth, and we feel pretty good about with the latest innovation we brought into the market. As I think about the core business right, the workload optimize cloud enabled and consumption driven model are areas of growth. And in that, when you think about workloads we will drive growth, we talk about HPC, high-performance compute, the ability to provide hybrid solutions with software defined experiences is where we're making investments.","And so for us, finding that balance is key but also getting the portfolio in the right place is what we are really after. And obviously, we believe we are in the right place. And the service piece of this is obviously very critical. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about the GreenLake offering, because there is a point of differentiation for us in the marketplace that customers are paying attention and even our competitors for that matter. But getting growth also on the underlying businesses like we did with Nimble is as foundational. I don't know Tarek if you want to add anything.","Tarek Robbiati","Yes, I just would like to put a little bit more context on what Antonio has said and put some perspective on our fiscal year '19. Fiscal year '19 was not a year where we wanted to dial up the growth. Fiscal year '19 is a year where we had to deliver on EPS commitment, drive free cash flow, these are the two most important metrics, prepare ourselves to dial-up the growth in the subsequent quarters. And we feel that we've done a fair bit of progress here. There\u2019s of course more to be done. But you can see on Slide 9 that we\u2019ve made significant investments in FSC dollars and R&D dollars to dial-up the growth in the upcoming quarters.","In addition to Antonio\u2019s point, the inorganic investments that we have made will bear fruit. Effectively today, we secured the approval for the completion of the Cray acquisition. This has become official just a few minutes before our call. So we will close the Cray acquisition in Q4 of fiscal year '19 and start to consolidate immediately upon the close, which is late in the quarter of fiscal year '19. More of that growth will be felt in fiscal year '20 as a result of the consolidation but notwithstanding the consolidation of Cray, we will grow our business overall.","Operator","And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Toni Sacconaghi","I'd just like to revisit the gross margin topic one more time. Maybe you can help provide what estimate you think was -- what percentage of the gross margin improvement year-over-year and sequentially was driven by commodities? And whether you can confirm there were no one-time factors in Q3? I was just struck by how much gross margins went up sequentially when revenues were essentially flat, Tier 1 was essentially flat and there didn't seem to be really radical mixes in your business on a sequential basis, yet margins went up a 170 basis points. So maybe you can help clarify how much was attributable to commodities year-over-year and sequentially that there were no other one-time factors? And how we should think about sequential dynamics?","Antonio Neri","So there are no one-time factors that affect the gross margins that's the first thing you can take that off the table. The second thing Toni that affects the gross margins is, the mix shifts versus the commodities. I'd say to put some metrics around this, roughly 50% was mix shift and 50% was commodities. As part of that, you also have to the mix shift pertaining to Pointnext. Pointnext OS cost of services is effectively affecting our gross margin. We're injecting more and more automation in Pointnext OS to reduce the actual cost of labor that affects the gross margin component.","So all of the levers that are available to us and I -- last but not least the supply chain as we spoke a moment ago, are contributing to augmenting the gross margins. We have a new team in global operations. We are starting to feel the weight of -- that they carry and the traction they're gaining. We want to see further savings from supply chain moving forward. And so on the whole, because we know this is the most important metric that govern the tax base, we will drive the gross margins to higher level. So how high is up? It's for us to see and for you to determine overtime as we execute. But we are very pleased with the progress so far, Toni.","Tarek Robbiati","And Toni, I will add one thing. Obviously, we talk about our newness and what\u2019s going on in the market. But I think this team has executed with discipline. Discipline to participate in the market we want to compete, to extract value from that market. And that's what resulted in expanded profitability.","Toni Sacconaghi","If I could just follow-up, you've talked about unevenness in macro. I guess the question is. How do you know that sort of what you're seeing or the revenue softness that you're experiencing is not due to a more structural shift to the cloud, or some of these customers that are pausing or not thinking about tighter partnerships with cloud vendors? And what makes you confident I guess that the revenue weakness that you've seen, I think relative to expectations, because I think at the beginning of the year you're optimistic that growth would accelerate through the year. So relative to those initial expectations, what makes you confident that this is not something structural rather than what appears to be cyclical demand factors that you're citing?","Antonio Neri","Yes, Tony, I mean, let me start by stating that the world is hybrid. And I quote that some of the deals that we won this quarter, where you see the value of placing data and workloads both on-prem and off-prem and that's the new reality. And more and more of those overloads and data will be processed at the edge and that's the big opportunity. That's why I have a lot of confidence and confidence in the fact that the data around us will continue to explode, fueled by the digital transformation we all experience in every industry. That data has tremendous value.","We are only utilizing 6% of that data today and that's why we see an acceleration of new techniques, like AI, machine learning, big data analytics. And that's why we're making quite a significant of investments first to make our infrastructure more intelligent so that our customers don't need to spend money running that infrastructure. Second, to give a simple experience, like you would think about the public cloud in many ways but with the same economics, because we have talked to -- I spend 50% of my time with customers and they are telling me at their scale of production workloads, it is cheaper for them to run it on-prem than off-prem. That said, they will put workloads in both places. And last but not least is the fact that they want to consume more and more as a service, and that's the new reality.","And so that's why when I bring it together, the world is hybrid, the Edge is becoming more and more intelligence, the data has value, because that's where outcomes have been derived. And I think our portfolio is uniquely positioned to address these new realities and how we connect this world is opportunity going forward. We have been trimming down, pruning down all the areas we don't want to participate and unfortunately that has taken time for as the Tier 1 business or some of the advice and professional services and companies where we believe we couldn't get scale, re-pivot that resources and funding as we want to go forward and then augment that investment with targeted, very disciplined acquisition or return on invested capital that will drive growth.","And that's why I'm confident, Toni. Obviously, we need the right innovation and the right talent. But I will say this team is really executing with remarkable discipline and you can see the expanded profitability, and I think that will continue.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Coster with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Paul Coster","Just drilling into the uneven demand comment, I wonder, if you've noticed or any difference in the behavior of enterprise customers versus SMB's? Or whether there's any verticals, which are standing up quite well under this sort of onslaught of news? And if there are any verticals which on the other hand looking particularly uncertain about their IT spending?","Tarek Robbiati","So I will say the SMB market continues to be strong and this where we are putting a lot of our emphasis on what we call in a no touch low touch model for the transactional high velocity business. We also introduced new offerings targeted for that segment of the market. An example is Aruba Instant On where you know now you can, if you are a small business from a single couple of clicks back two, three clicks on a mobile app, you can actually deploy entire Wi-Fi infrastructure for less than $200. And so that [Technical Difficulty]\u2026","Operator","Pardon me, this is a conference operator. It appears we have had a disconnection from the speakers' location. Please standby as we try to reconnect them. Pardon me, this is the conference operator. I have rejoined the speaker location to the call. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call back over to speaker location.","Andrew Simanek","This is Andy. Sorry everyone for the technical difficulties we were having there. So, we'll jump back in with -- I believe Paul Coster asked a question about the macro environment, and any particular verticals that we're seeing unchanged. So Antonio\u2026","Antonio Neri","Yes sorry about that, I'm not sure what happened. We will check into after this. But you asked the question about the unevenness of the market and most importantly which segment of the market. I will start to answer the question that, we see good momentum in SMB and mid-market, particularly in the transactional business. And that\u2019s why we have a lot of focus both on the product portfolio and the go-to-market. We\u2019ll make some announcement with Aruba on Instant On and the low touch no touch, particularly on the e-commerce side with our channel partners.","And then on enterprise, we see strong demand in healthcare. I spend a lot of time with them here at our ADC because of the digitization of the experiences, with the mobile first cloud first approach, at same time the industrial space with manufacturing. They need to bridge the analog world with the digital world. Oil and gas obviously continue to be a little bit hit and miss there, because of the situation with oil. But overall, I mean, when it comes down to larger deals that\u2019s where we see the elongated sales cycles. Sorry about the disruption.","Operator","And the next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Simon Leopold","I first wanted hopefully simple, maybe clarification. Appreciate you're reiterating the fiscal '19 free cash flow target. In June, you had also reiterated the fiscal '20 target for roughly $2 billion of free cash flow. Just wanted to make sure that nothing has changed in your view on that fiscal '20 target?","Tarek Robbiati","Thank you for asking the question. I should have mentioned this. Nothing has changed for our 2020 $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion of free cash flow guidance.","Simon Leopold","And then, I wanted to get back to the trending. One of the things we heard about and I think you'd even addressed is, declining ASPs. And clearly, your costs have come down faster and you've benefitted from mix. Is there some element that you could help us quantify the dynamic of what degree you're reducing price since that will factor into maybe our revenue estimates? Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","So we are starting to see AUP come down, which were up at very low single-digits and these were reflecting lower DRAM cost that are starting to be pass through. But we're now almost at a full Gen10 mix. So we're getting less uplift from the new generation. Having said that, we continue to see more and more option attach and richer configurations, as Antonio mentioned, that will continue to be a trend due to the ever increasing amount of data that has been generated and consumed. So consequently, we should see AUPs tick back up overtime DRAM costs start to level off or even potentially rebound in the future.","Antonio Neri","And I want to add to that, that since, I run the compute business for several years. And I have to tell you, the tick-tock of the technologies and the amount of memory storage you can attach continue to increase. As we go through the next generation or Gen11 and just take a look at just the latest announcements we made with the AMD, the amount of memory channels you can attach more options to it continues to grow. And so now on the same form factor, you have way more memory and way more storage capacity.","And like I said before, as the cost per bit may be going down the number of bits continue to grow. And therefore, what we said before is two-third of that AUP is structural and that will continue, because now we have new solutions like non-volatile memory and so forth. And so, those are technologies that will find its way through the portfolio that we already provide in the next generations.","Operator","And the next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Aaron Rakers","Yes, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the execution on the mix of the business driving forward. On the mix discussion, I'm curious, it looks like now your Tier 1 customers for this given quarter has fallen below 1% of total revenue. So it looks like that's kind of that mix shift has finalized itself. But I'm curious in terms of the overall mix of compute between value versus the volume. Where does that mix stand today? And how do you think about that mix, or what it could look like over the next year or two years? And I have a follow-up.","Tarek Robbiati","Yes, look you're right in your assertion around Tier 1. Right now, Tier 1 as we said is 2.2% of HPE's revenue year-to-date. So in the last quarter, it was roughly the amount as you've indicated. But it is coming at a much higher gross margin and we're happy with that level of gross margin. Revenue with no gross margin makes no sense to us. With respect to the rest, 50-50 is roughly the answer between volume compute and value compute. But within that, you also have more and more software defined solution, which will lift the gross margin up of each of those two categories. And so that is important to note. We're making those investments in R&D to drive differentiation. That differentiation comes in the form of software defined infrastructure, in both volume and value compute and of course, needless to say, storage and all the other offerings that we have in hybrid it.","Aaron Rakers","And then as a follow-up going back to GreenLake. I think the last quarter or last couple of quarters, you've given some metrics. I know that orders look like they were up about 10%. But I'm curious any update on how many customers have adopted versus the 600 that was quoted last quarter? And where do we stand as far as the contract value of GreenLake at this point? Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","So we have north of 600 customers right now. Our total contract value is in excess of $2.5 billion from GreenLake.","Antonio Neri","And as we go along, we're going to share more about this. But the bottom line there is with new logos and expansion of current contracts, so that's the reality. And one of the things that we saw with GreenLake, which is very pleasing is the ability to continue to grow once you're in the contract. And the renewal rates, which are 99% and the NPS score is 91, which is remarkable for a business like that. And one comment I want to add on the volume versus value. We categorize that based on the type of server we talked before on the compute side, but more of the volume will become value as we add, to Tarek point, more software and more of the IP we acquire, particularly in areas like Plexxi in a compostable rack. And you can think about a server that has a volume aspect but a ton of value added on top therefore becomes, in a packaged solution, becomes a value overtime.","Andrew Simanek","So we're already running over time. But I wanted to make sure we gave a little extra since we went dark for a second. So, let's go ahead and take one last question, please.","Operator","And that question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","I wanted to ask about the Pointnext trends and op services within that. So Pointnext still deteriorating by 4%, but op services up 3%. I just wonder if you guys can help us understand when you would expect that overall line maybe to stabilize. And we'd love it if you'd give you of course the proportionate split between the two things? And then I have a follow-up.","Tarek Robbiati","So remember, in Pointnext overall, you have two revenue streams that have very different economics. One is Pointnext OS and the other one is the A&PS business. Overall, we feel good about the long-term opportunity in Pointnext and particularly following Antonio's announcement at Discover to offer our entire portfolio as a service by 2022, and this is where the GreenLake plays a crucial role. In Q3, the services orders for Pointnext OS and Nimble grew 3% in constant currency, and our book-to-bill ratio was similar to last quarter about 1.12.","It is important to understand that the mix shift that we're driving across the portfolio of compute to more sophisticated software defined offerings is increasing our attach rates and service intensity to levels that we haven't witnessed in the past. The service intensity in Q3 was the highest quarter ever. GreenLake as we mentioned is also a key driver of Pointnext orders, and is one of our fastest growing businesses with strong customer momentum, and GreenLake grew 42%. So that gives you good color around Pointnext OS. And with respect to A&PS, it's a much smaller portion of the total Pointnext revenue stream. And we are optimizing that business for growth and profitability with the country exits that Antonio referred to at the beginning of this conversation.","Rod Hall","And then just a quick follow-up, since we're over time. Could you just clarify, I heard your comments on AUP starting to decline a little bit in core compute ex-Tier 1. Could you just clarify what is happening there with unit volume trends?","Tarek Robbiati","So units were still declining at the low single-digit rate. This hasn't changed but it doesn't truly bothers me again, it's just as this -- what we're trying to do is to shift towards those units that drive higher services attached, number one. There is also, an important point to note is that when you look at units on a sequential basis, they were up. So what matters is that we look at the momentum of the business overall and what drives the attach rates, which is service intensity in the right type of units, we feel reasonably good about the performance on this quarter on that front.","Antonio Neri","But I think this is something very important, our units were up sequentially, and after that the major takeaway. And second is that, our ability to attach to the right units has improved dramatically and that's why we draw the best services intensity yet. And so for us that's what our strategy is and more software content we add, obviously we attach all the type of services, particularly in the software license associated with those units, not just associated Proactive Care or break\/fix type of support.","Again apologies, I don't know what happened to the web service here, but we're looking to it. But I just want to wrap up by reiterating that we are pleased with our progress in what we call an uneven market. We executed with strong discipline, which obviously you can see the results and expanded profitability on record levels of cash flow that give us the confidence to raise our outlook and reaffirm both to 2019 and 2020 free cash flow. And at the same time, we continue to invest in the business, both organic and inorganically so we can continue to focus on that growth that Shannon asked the question with the right level of profit.","So with that, we're looking forward to see you on October 23rd, at the Security Analyst meeting. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today.

We experienced solid revenue growth across each business segment with particular strength in Intelligent Edge, High-Performance Compute, Storage, Hyper Converged and Composable Infrastructure. From a macro perspective, the IT market remains robust. We saw growth in all regions with particular strength in both EMEA and APJ.","Currency was a larger year-over-year benefit, providing a 3 point tailwind this quarter. Given our strong execution helped by $0.01 tax benefit, we delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.34, above our outlook range of $0.29 to $0.33.","Looking at cash flow. Our free cash flow was negative $269 million in Q2. We remain confident in our full-year outlook of approximately $1 billion in free cash flow. Tim will provide more color on this in a moment.","Finally, in Q2, we began executing against our $7 billion capital return plan we announced last quarter. We returned $1 billion to shareholders in form of share repurchases and dividends, and we announced that we are raising our dividend by approximately 50% starting in the current third quarter.","Looking forward, as a result of our outperformance in Q2, as well as a continued benefits from a lower tax rate, we are raising our fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP EPS outlook to $1.40 to $1.50 from our previously provided outlook of $1.35 to $1.45. Tim will provide more details in a minute.","Before I turn to the business segment\u2019s performance, I want to give you an update on our progress with HPE Next. As a reminder, HPE Next is a companywide initiative to re-architect HPE to deliver on our strategy and drive new wave of shareholder value. It is all about simplification, execution and innovation. Through this initiative, we are simplifying our operating model in the way we work. We\u2019re streamlining our offerings and business processes and modernizing our IT systems to improve our execution. And we\u2019re shifting our investments in innovation towards high-growth and higher-margin opportunities.","Over the first-half of this year, we have achieved some significant milestones across each of these areas. For example, we have reduced bands and layers between the CEO and the customer. We have significant streamlined our sales structure, empowering the front line to make key decisions, and we have dramatically reduced SKUs and platforms across our volume and value segments, which simplifies our operation and makes us easier to work with.","Looking into the second-half of the year, we\u2019ll be concentrating our efforts on the next phase of the initiative, including building out our no-touch sales model for certain [indiscernible] segments and accelerating our IT transformation to better service customers and partners. The changes we are making through HPE Next, will not only improve our cost structure, we will also give us a significant long-term competitive advantage.","I\u2019m very proud of the work we are doing here. And while the decisions we are making are for the long-term, you are really beginning to see the benefits in our financial results. In Q2, we delivered an operating margin of 8.6%, up 270 basis points from last year due in part to the effective execution of HPE Next.","Turning to our business segments, we saw solid performance across the Board, while continuing to deliver innovation in key areas of our portfolio. In Intelligent Edge segment, revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strength in both product and services. Q2 wireless LAN revenue rebounded as expected after a softer Q1 and wire switching remains strong. And while still a small portion of our overall products sales, we saw strong customer traction with our Edgeline IoT Systems, including a significant win with a global financial services company. These results bode well for our future.","Our customers tell us they want to take advantage of exploding amount of the useful data being created at the edge. We hear them and we continue to make investments to build out our Intelligent Edge portfolio. For example, in Q2, we strengthened our portfolio with the acquisition of Cape Networks. The Cape acquisition is the latest steps towards our vision of autonomous infrastructure enabled by artificial intelligence.","Cape expands Aruba AI powered networking capabilities with a sensor-based network assurance solution that improves network performance, reduces disruptions and significantly simplifies IT management for our customers. We also introduced NetInsight, another complementary AI-based analytics and assurance solution for optimizing network performance. NetInsight uses machine learning to continuously monitor the network and deliver insights in the event of anomalies. It also recommends how best to optimize the network from today\u2019s mobile-first employees and workplace critical IoT devices. Looking forward, we see significant potential in Intelligent Edge and this will continue to be a key area of investment for us.","Turning to Hybrid IT, revenue was $6 billion, up 7% year-over-year with solid performance across all segments. Compute grew 6% year-over-year and 9% if you exclude Tier 1. We saw very strong growth in high-performance compute, composable infrastructure and hyper converged, offset by the continued decline in our customized commodity server sales to Tier 1 vendors, a business we are moving away from.","Our focus continued to be on providing solutions that deliver high value differentiation to our customers and drive profitable share for HPE. And we continue to prioritize investment in those higher-margin, high-growth segments of the market.","For example, just last week, we announced the acquisition of Plexxi. Plexxi provides innovative software-defined networking technology, which we plan to integrate into both SimpliVity, our hyper-converged offering, and Synergy, our composable infrastructure offering. With Plexxi, we will enable customers to move and manage their data more quickly and effectively and also significantly reduce CapEx and OpEx by up to 50% in some cases.","Storage performed very well, up 24% year-over-year with the Nimble acquisition and up 14% organically. All-flash continue to perform well growing 20% year-over-year, as the market continues to transition and we benefit from our strong position with both 3PAR and Nimble.","And earlier this month, we introduced the next generation Nimble Storage platform, which is backed by guaranteed to deliver the best storage efficiency of any all-flash array on the market. Data center networking revenue was up 2% year-over-year with good execution within our existing installed base.","Finally, turning to services. HPE Pointnext revenue grew 1% year-over-year in Q2. We saw a pickup in orders from deals that slipped from Q1 and strong customer traction from our newest offering called HPE GreenLake. HPE GreenLake is a suite of pay-per-use solutions available for top customers\u2019 workloads like Big Data, SAP HANA and Edge computing.","The offering simplifies the IT experience and gives customers choice in where workload should live and how to flexibly consume them. This is an offering we will continue to expand, look for updates soon. And in Q2, we also continue to strengthen our advisory capabilities building on our acquisition of cloud technology partners with the acquisition of RedPixie.","RedPixie is a UK-based cloud consulting company with deep Microsoft Azure expertise, which perfectly complements CTPs strong AWS relationship. We are excited about the capabilities these two acquisitions bring to HPE and are already seeing them open doors to new and bigger deals.","HPE Financial Services also performed well in the quarter with revenue up 5% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our asset management business. Customers are responding well to the actions we are taking both from an operational and innovation perspective. They believe in our strategy and the powerful portfolio of products and services we are building, and that confidence can be seen in some recent wins.","For example, in Q2, we won a major high-performance compute deal with the U.S. Department of Energy. This is just the latest example of the strength of HPE\u2019s HPC portfolio and the value it brings to the U.S. government and the nation in international competition over computing power.","We also won a new project with Time Warner, where Aruba was selected for the state-of-the-art Hudson Yards Smart Digital Workplace project in New York City. And we announced a new supercomputer installation of KU Leuven, a Flemish research university, consistently ranked as one of the top five most innovative universities in the world.","We have collaborated with the university to develop and deploy a new supercomputer specifically built to run AI workloads. It will be used to build applications that drive scientific breakthroughs, economic growth, and innovation in Belgium.","And next month, we will host our Annual HP Discover Conference in Las Vegas, bringing together thousands of customers and partners from around the world. We will be making some exciting announcement at the event and I look forward to see many of you there.","So, as I said earlier, I\u2019m very pleased with our performance in the first-half of fiscal year 2018. All of our business segments performed well. We made solid progress on HPE Next and continue to invest in innovation that will furthest strengthen and differentiate our company into the future.","Looking ahead to the rest of the year, as we indicated last quarter, we expect the growth rate to moderate given tougher compares, lapping acquisitions and a smaller currency tailwind. While we see a more challenging second-half, we have got great momentum and I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll deliver on our annual fiscal year 2018 outlook.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim.","Tim Stonesifer","Thanks, Antonio. Our Q2 financial results were strong, with robust revenue growth, significantly improved operating margins and better than expected earnings. Total revenue for the quarter was $7.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year and 6% in constant currency. Top line performance was driven by good market dynamics, solid execution and both favorable year-over-year compares and exchange rates.","From a portfolio mix perspective, we\u2019re seeing solid growth in our value offerings and our core volume business is growing better than expected. From a macro perspective, IT spending continues to be quite healthy with solid customer demand across all businesses and geographies.","The pricing environment remains competitive, but has continued to be more rational and passing through elevated commodities costs. DRAM cost increases have also started to flatten. Currency drove a 330 basis point tailwind in revenue year-over-year. With that said, rates have moved somewhat unfavorably in the last month, so currency will not be as large of a benefit in the second-half, if these rates hold. We now expect closer to a two point benefit to revenue in fiscal year 2018.","Regionally, HPE\u2019s performance in the Americas continue to be solid, growing 3% in constant currency. Most of the growth came from the U.S., Canada and Brazil with strength in storage and the Intelligent Edge. Revenue growth in Europe continue to be strong, up 9% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in UK, France and Italy.","Performance in EMEA was strong across all business units with double-digit growth in compute, storage and Aruba Products and Services. Asia Pacific grew 9% in constant currency, with strong growth in China, Australia and Singapore.","Turning to margins. The gross margin of 30.4% was up 90 basis points year-over-year and 200 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.6%, was up 270 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially. We continue to execute well this quarter with HPE Next savings driving most of the improvement.","DRAM was also less of a pressure point as compared to prior quarters and we continue to gain traction on the pricing front. Going forward, margin improvement will be driven primarily by delivering the cost savings from HPE Next and growing our value portfolio offerings, which have higher margins.","Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.34 is just above the high-end of our previous outlook of $0.29 to $0.33 due to strong operational performance and a tax rate benefit of approximately a $0.01. The Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 9.6%, which is just below our previously provided tax range of a 11% to 15%, due to various one-time reductions in non-U.S. tax expense.","For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be at the lower-end of the 11% to 15% range, but we\u2019re still working through many variables associated with tax reform. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.49, above our previously provided outlook range of $0.10 to $0.14, primarily due to releasing reserves we\u2019ve been holding associated with HPQ tax risks that were part of our separation agreement, which has now been settled.","Now turning to the business units. In Hybrid IT, revenue was up 7% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. Revenue performance was strong and balanced across all businesses in all regions. Operating margins were 10.3%, up 220 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially and in line with our expectations.","Compute revenue was up 6% year-over-year and 9% excluding Tier 1. We continue to see higher AUPs, driven by passing through more DRAM costs, increasing our gen 10 mix and delivering richer attach configurations. We saw continued momentum in our value business with high-performance compute growing over 20%, hyper converged up triple digits, and synergy gaining increasing customer traction.","As mentioned earlier, revenue growth in our volume business was higher than planned, driven by strong growth in core rack. Storage revenue was up 24% year-over-year with continued momentum in the organic business, up 14% year-over-year. We saw strong double-digit growth in converged storage, driven by Nimble and Big Data storage that has become a meaningful part of the portfolio.","All-flash arrays grew 20% year-over-year. While the overall storage market remains competitive, we like our current position and expect to take nearly 50 basis points of share this quarter, which will be the 10th time in the last 12 quarters, where we\u2019ve gained or maintained share. Datacenter networking revenue was up 2% with good execution, primarily from our installed base in the Americas.","HPE Pointnext revenue was up 1% year-over-year, with operational growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. Overall, orders grew 1% with even better growth in operational services, which was driven by our new HPE GreenLake flexible capacity offering. Service intensity remains strong, but attach orders continue to be under pressure from lower unit growth and richer hardware configurations.","In the Intelligent Edge, revenue was up 17% year-over-year and 14% in constant currency. Operating margins of 6.5% were up 360 basis points sequentially due to the operating leverage from higher revenue, but were down 110 basis points year-over-year due to significant investments in sales and R&D.","Aligned to our strategy of pivoting to the Intelligent Edge, we\u2019ve been making significant go-to-market and R&D investments that have given us a leadership position in this high-growth market opportunity. Aruba Product grew 18%, with continued strong growth in campus switching and a rebound in wireless LAN, despite tough compares in the prior year. We\u2019ve also started to see good traction in our edge compute business. Aruba Services was up 10% on an installed base growth due to strong attach of our software platform like ClearPass and AirWave.","HPE Financial Services revenue grew 5% year-over-year and 1% in constant currency, driven by strong residual sales and growth in our direct business that was somewhat offset by lower operating lease mix. Volume was flat, as growth in our direct business was offset by the pressure in our indirect business. Operating profit declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 7.9% due to one-time items.","Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow was negative $269 million in Q2. The cash conversion cycle was in line with expectations and decreased sequentially by one day to negative 22 days. Both inventory and payables were elevated in the quarter due to strategic positioning of key commodities and somewhat higher pricing. We also ended the quarter with an operating company net cash balance of $3.5 billion.","Looking forward, we\u2019re still on track to achieve our free cash flow outlook of approximately $1 billion in fiscal year 2018, as the second-half benefits from a few items. First, we expect cash earnings to ramp aligned with normal seasonality and the cost savings from HPE Next. Second, working capital will be a source of cash versus the use of cash in the first-half with the cash conversion cycle improving to the negative high 20-day range similar to our Q4 exit rate. Last, we have fewer a one-time payments and expect incremental real estate sales towards the end of the year.","Moving to capital allocation. As part of our $7 billion capital return plan through fiscal year 2019, which we announced in Q1, we returned $1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. This includes $907 million of share repurchases and $116 million of dividend payments. As previously communicated, we raised our quarterly dividend by 50%, which will be payable in July.","We also announced today that we\u2019ll be redeeming $1.6 billion of our bonds maturing in October at the end of June. The bond redemption is consistent with our capital allocation approach, which includes maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Going forward, we intend to run the operating company with net cash neutral or positive and will maintain financial flexibility through borrowing capacity as needed.","Now turning to our outlook. Consistent with our approach in Q1, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal year 2018 by $0.05, due to our operational performance in Q2 and a favorable tax rate that we now expect to be at the low-end of our 11% to 15% guidance for the year. As a result, we expect fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50, and we expect our fiscal year 2018 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $1.70 to $1.80.","For Q3 2018, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.35 to $0.39 and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.19 to $0.23. So overall, I\u2019m pleased with the performance in the quarter and I\u2019m looking forward to focusing on delivering our full-year commitments.","Before we open up the call for questions, as Antonio mentioned, I just wanted to remind everyone that we have our IR Summit coming up in June at our Discover Customer Event in Las Vegas, and I hope many of you will be able to join us.","Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first questioner today will be Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you. I think, Antonio and Tim, you both mentioned that DRAM cost increases have started to flatten. Can you remind us what \u2013 how you\u2019re feeling about DRAM and NAND pricing and generally component pricing as we move into the second-half of the year? And I think when we talked about it last quarter that\u2019s going to be somewhat of a pressure on revenue. How are you thinking about that as we move into the second-half?","Antonio Neri","Yes, sure. Thanks, Sherri, for the question. So we start to see a flattening of the DRAM cost. We still see what I call nominal low single-digit cost increases, but where we\u2019re able to pass those along for two reasons. One is stronger execution in our go-to-market, more disciplined approach, and second is our competitors are becoming more rational about pricing in general.","So it\u2019s going to be a very low kind of cost increase and we feel confident we\u2019ll pass those along. Listen, the AUPs obviously are \u2013 continue to be elevated for two reasons. One is the DRAM, right, we talked before, and two is the richer configurations, right? So the \u2013 particularly on the compute side, the compute side are really driving a significant rich configuration of memory, obviously, flash NAND, internal storage, and that\u2019s why we see the increased AUPs. And those are not going to change any time soon also, because customers are trying to reach more efficiencies in their data centers, particularly as they deploy the private cloud. And the other one is some of these workloads demand that level of configuration, particularly as you move to AI and Big Data analytics. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen so far.","Sherri Scribner","Okay, great. And then just looking at the storage business, it seems like you guys have definitely recovered in that business versus some issues you had last year. How are you feeling about the storage business as we move into the second-half? Do you think these revenue growth levels are sustainable, or do you expect them to come back in a bit? Thank you.","Antonio Neri","Sure. I mean, listen, storage performed very well, up 24% year-over-year with inclusion of Nimble and 14% organically, which is, to your point, right, we actually executed way better than last year. Last year, we had some execution challenges, particularly North America.","We think we have addressed those issues. And when they think about the opportunity, the market, obviously, all-flash continue to be a significant opportunity. This quarter, we grew 20%. And we are really excited about our portfolio. I have to say, the combination of Nimble and 3PAR with the simplicity of our value proposition with cloud capabilities built into it and most importantly, whether our AI technologies built into it, both in Nimble and 3PAR, because now we scale that solution to 3PAR, actually is something that\u2019s resonating with customers.","And so, as I look forward, we expect to see solid organic growth in storage. But let\u2019s remind ourselves, right, like next quarter, right, we\u2019re going to have the lapping of the Nimble acquisition to the portfolio. So I think the growth rate would be a little bit more moderated, but we\u2019re very confident about our ability to execute with this portfolio, because we have true value differentiation.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question, please?","Operator","And our next questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good afternoon. You beat revenue in EPS two quarters in a row and yet the majority of the $0.05 full-year guidance increase is tax-related. So can you just comment on why you\u2019re not assuming that the strong operational trends continue for the remainder of the year? And then just as a related follow-up to that, when you talk about tough compares in the back-half of the fiscal year and lapping acquisitions, does that end in a company that\u2019s not growing top line, or do you think the top line can continue to grow in the back-half just at lower rates? Thanks.","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. So as far as the $0.05 goes, I\u2019d say, $0.02 of the $0.05 was operational. Again, we continue to perform very well, particularly in the volume piece of the portfolio that\u2019s growing faster than we had expected. As far as why we aren\u2019t passing more through, again, we have quite a bit of execution left in the second-half. We still have six months to go.","So we feel that it\u2019s just prudent to pass along the operational performance we\u2019re seeing. And then obviously, we\u2019re trying to be as transparent as we can on the tax front as we\u2019re still working through all those changes.","As far as the growth goes, yes, I think we can continue to grow. If you look at the 10% growth that we had in Q2, I\u2019d say, about 3.5 points of that was tailwind from FX. We had a couple points of tailwind from the compares with Nimble and SimpliVity and then we have 4.5 points of execution. And I think it\u2019s really a combination of execution, because I do think our go-to-market motion is working better. I do think that our geo model that we pivoted to this year is working very well. But we also have better markets, right? We have better \u2013 we have stronger customer demand. We have a better pricing environment, so that plays into it as well.","As I look forward into the second-half, rates have moved a little bit unfavorably for us. If those rates hold, we would get less of a tailwind. We obviously lose the favorable compares. The other point I would make out is, we\u2019re doing about half of the Tier 1 business in the second-half of the year that we did versus the first-half. So that\u2019s about 2.5 points of headwind, no margin impact and then we have tougher compares overall. So I think, going forward, we can certainly grow, but it\u2019s obviously not going to be at that 10% rate given the reason that just laid out.","Antonio Neri","So, Katy, this is Antonio. I want to add the couple of things here. One is, if you go back to what we guided at SAM, right, we said 0% to 1% growth. It\u2019s obvious we\u2019re going to grow faster than that full-year. I think that\u2019s one area. Second is that, we are very, very confident in our portfolio. And I think, as we continue to pivot from volume to value, we will see also an improvement there, because the growth areas we see are in hyper converged in areas like private clouds, high-performance compute and so forth. So we believe this company absolutely can grow and definitely this year will be above the guidance we gave you for the full year.","Katy Huberty","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Katy. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","And our next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes, thank you. You provided an update on HPE Next and some of the accomplishments so far. I think the target was to try and deliver $250 million in net savings for this year and ultimately $800 million over the next three years. Could you provide an update specifically on where you think you are in terms of the savings capture rate so far this year? And whether we should still be thinking about $250 million savings for the year? And I have a follow-up please?","Antonio Neri","Sure, Toni, this is Antonio. Thanks for the question. So we are confident we are on track to deliver the $250 million for the year. And just as a reminder, right, HPE Next is the initiative I launched to re-architect the company to deliver on our vision and our strategy. And at the core of this was not just cost savings, right, it\u2019s all about simplification, innovation, and execution. We have made good progress on many fronts.","One is, listen, the operating model simplification in a go-to-market is paying off in terms of not just the savings, but actually improved execution.","Second, we have reduced already quite significantly number of platforms and options, which translates into lower amounts of SKUs to our customers and partners, which allows us to better plan and execute in our supply chain.","And then third is the culture of the company as well. So from my standpoint, we are on track what we said we\u2019re going to do. And to me this is going to be the competitive advantage that Hewlett Packard Enterprise would have going forward. For me, this is not just a way to return shareholder value, but really to improve the way we execute our business every single day. The reality is the market is moving really fast. We need to react to those opportunities quickly, and having a lean mean end-to-end value chain is absolutely essential.","So now we\u2019re going enter the second phase of this, which is the transformation in the processes and IT modernization, which actually will give us the incremental step forward on executing even better and more simply in front of the market opportunity. So, Tim, you want to add anything?","Tim Stonesifer","No, I think you nailed it.","Antonio Neri","All right.","Toni Sacconaghi","So the follow-up, it still looks like if we believe that Pointnext has about 30% operating margins, which is historically where it\u2019s been. It still looks like operating margins on servers, storage and the data center networking is in the 1% to 2% range right now, and that probably suggests that server margins are negative still. How should investors just think about what a normalized margin for these businesses are, or has the whole server market move to a market where we shouldn\u2019t be thinking about it that way? And that you\u2019re really looking at a blended margin between support and servers are really becoming the vehicle to selling high-margin support and we shouldn\u2019t be thinking about discrete profitability for each of those?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. So thanks for the question, Toni. I would just say this, I think your math is correct. You\u2019re in the low single-digit range for the hardware businesses. I\u2019m not really going to comment on where those are going. But again, I\u2019ll \u2013 to give you some color, if you look at our overall margin of 8.6%, as we\u2019ve talked about all year, we do think that continues to improve over the course of the year. And that\u2019s really a combination of the increase cost savings from HPE Next, it\u2019s a combination of the acquisitions as they become more and more of accretive as we continue to grow those businesses and right-size those cost envelops.","And then to Antonio\u2019s point, as we continue to pivot towards the value portion of our portfolio where we have higher margins and higher attach, that obviously gives us some great lift as well. So we do expect those dynamics to continue through the course of the year.","On a normalized, if you will, basis, two or three years down the road, I think, a couple calls ago, I said, I think there\u2019s a couple hundred points of improvement. And I still think that\u2019s true, because, again, even as we exit 2018, we\u2019re still going to have more HPE Next savings and will continue to pivot towards the value portion of the portfolio.","Antonio Neri","The other thing I will add, Toni, this is Antonio, is that, listen, when you look at our Q2 performers, right, we improved our Hybrid IT margins by 220 basis points in that business. And obviously, like I said before, the rationalization of platforms and options give us improved profitability on the hardware side. It is obvious that obviously a big chunk of our profitability comes from services.","But let\u2019s remind ourselves that profitability of the services business is not just attach, right, is what we call, services-led opportunities and we have pivot our portfolio quite significantly in the last two to three years and we see now the momentum in the way customers want to consume in a more subscription-based model. And that\u2019s why things like HPE GreenLake are very important to us as well.","But to Tim\u2019s point, right, we will continue to drive that rigor and discipline in our cost structure and ultimately, the simpler we innovate in our portfolio, the easiest to go sell it to improve that, the pull-through for services and as well for the rest of the HPE portfolio.","Toni Sacconaghi","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Excellent. Great. Thank you, Toni. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","And the next questioner today will be Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Victor Chiu","Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I wanted to ask about free cash flow. It seems like, FCF seems like, it will have to have a quite a sharp step up in the back-half of the year to get you $1 billion target. So, I just was hoping you could give us a little more color around that, how much of the upside is coming from the proceeds from real estate? And what parts of working capital are you expecting will improve that will help drive the cash conversion in the second-half of the year?","Tim Stonesifer","Sure. So listen, we\u2019re still confident with $1 billion for fiscal year 2018. Q2 came in at negative $269 million, which to be honest with you, was lighter than we had expected. I think on the last call, I said Q2 would be flattish, and we basically had a higher mix of one-time payments along with some unfavorable movements and other assets and liabilities that was related to the VAT taxes. So those are more timing than anything else.","But as you know, in this business, free cash flow is very seasonal. If you look at the last couple of years, we typically have negative free cash flow in the first-half of the year and then we generate a significant amount in the second-half of the year. And I don\u2019t think 2018 is going to be any different and it\u2019s really driven by four things.","I mean, first of all, you can look at the earnings ramp, I mean, that\u2019s reflected in our EPS guide, that\u2019s a combination of HPE Next savings, as well as typical seasonality. So that will obviously generate more free cash flow. From a working capital perspective, we actually had a cash usage. In the first-half of the year, we\u2019re going to generate cash. In the second-half of the year, I think, the best indicator to look at there is our cash conversion cycle.","As we said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019d expect that to end at the negative high 20- day range. That will be very consistent with where we exited Q4 of 2017 and that generates a significant amount of cash. Other assets and liabilities, we had some unfavorability in the first-half, I would expect that to come back in the second-half. Nothing has really structurally changed when you think about the balance sheet. I\u2019ll go back to the VAT example. We should be collecting on those receivables in the second-half of the year.","And then lastly is, we\u2019re going to have fewer one-time payment. So if you look at the SAM presentation that we laid out, we had about $1.1 billion of one-time cash payments, roughly $800 million of that has been taken care of in the first-half of the year, so that provides us a tailwind in the back-half of the year. And then we will have, to your point, we will have some real estate gains in the second-half of the year.","So, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in free cash flow, that\u2019s why it\u2019s very difficult to forecast on a quarterly basis. But given those comments, we feel very good about the $1 billion for fiscal year 2018.","Victor Chiu","Great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.","Andrew Simanek","Perfect. Thank you, Simon. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","And our next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Shannon Cross","Thank you very much. The first question is with regard to AI, I\u2019m just curious how you see some of the new offerings that you\u2019ve launched in some of the acquisition sort of fitting into this? And particularly, I\u2019m curious as to how you\u2019re going to monetize them, because everybody sort of talked about AI and what it\u2019s going to do to the industry. But I\u2019m wondering how it helps you from a competitive standpoint over time? And I have a follow-up.","Antonio Neri","Sure. Thank you for the question, Shannon. I mean, I\u2019m actually very excited about AI. We see this every single day. I spent 50% of my time talking to customers. And AI is kind of interesting, because what they\u2019re looking for is to monetize that data faster and trying to understand what they should be doing with the data from a business perspective.","So AI gives you the vehicle to accelerate outcomes from the data standpoint, and we already have very strong offerings, both in-memory solutions. If you think about our Superdome Flex and as well as HPE Apollo 6500, which is an AI design platform. And so how we monetize is very simple. We provide services upfront, which is basically the advisory capability how to implement AI in their environment. And number two, how we design and implement the right solution for them. And at the core of this, we already have many, many platforms with AI embedded into it into the most solution development kits that their data scientists can go and develop using whatever tools they want, whether it\u2019s cloud data or Horton works or whatever it is.","And so this is a good opportunity for us, and also we are using AI inside our portfolio, right? So we talk about the future of Hybrid IT being adaptive and autonomous. We are leveraging those AI technologies inside our own software-defined infrastructure, an example of that obviously is InfoSight, but you\u2019re going to see more and more of that embedded at the Edge and as well as in our cloud orchestration capabilities.","Shannon Cross","Thank you. And then can you talk about how we should think about the model changing as you move more and more to flexible capacity or flexible consumption models over time? I mean, how quickly do you think we make the shift sort of \u2013 we saw it in software obviously to SaaS, and now I guess, we\u2019re seeing it into devices and service over time? Thanks.","Antonio Neri","I think, you\u2019re asking a question from the business model perspective or the financial perspective? If it\u2019s financial, I will ask Tim Stonesifer to comment. I mean, what we see right now is, customers like the ability to consume on-prem in a utility-based model. And what that means, they want a fully integrated solution with the hardware or the infrastructure that they need with the software and the services to be able to run at a most efficient way.","In many ways, as you know, we talked before how we bring that public cloud experience and economics on prem, and that experience includes the consumption-based models. So depending on the scale, we already can provide customers a very competitive solution on premises. And it\u2019s not just infrastructure as a services, but also outcome as a services. Think about backup recover \u2013 recovery as a service, SAP HANA as a service and so forth.","So we already have those solutions available and we see a significant interest and actually a significant uptick in that business. From the financial perspective, right, we have crafted what I think is a very strong and simple solution of our customers, leveraging our strength with our portfolio of financial services, which provide that embedded financing, but is a services-led orientation. And the way we financial treat them is no way \u2013 not different than any subscription-based model. But Tim, maybe you want to comment on that.","Tim Stonesifer","No, I would just say that, over time it will improve our recurring revenue and will also improve our profitability.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Shannon. Can we move out to the next question, please?","Operator","The next questioner today will be Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much and good job on the results and execution. I have a question on the Hybrid IT reporting segment, specifically the Pointnext or the service revenues. If I do the math correctly, that is up about 1% year-over-year, but constant currency down 1% year-over-year. How should we think about why would revenues for Pointnext be down year-over-year when overall, your company results are so strong or how do we bridge the gap between those differences?","Antonio Neri","Yes, I just think that\u2019s a factor. Obviously, FX is a challenge. And I think that\u2019s just a factor of the contracts rolling off and given the fact that a lot of these are three-year contracts. You have some timing in there from a translation or FX perspective.","Jim Suva","Okay. So if that\u2019s the case, should we expect Pointnext to be challenged the next few quarters then with timing of contracts rolling off?","Antonio Neri","No, I think \u2013 think about it \u2013 listen, when we book the orders, right, we book at whatever the currency was at that time. But at the same time, we are booking the orders with, what I call, more favorable currency. And the mix of this is going to dictate basically what the outcome is. But we\u2019re still confident that we\u2019ll continue to drive the growth in this portfolio, driven by this new offerings not just the attach. And that\u2019s why, we are very keen to continue to drive the consumption-based model that Shannon asked the question for, because that HPE GreenLake is growing significantly faster than what we are posting here as a whole segment.","Tim Stonesifer","I would say the other thing to look at in that business is the services intensity. So service intensity was up 35% in Q2, so we continue to have more attach dollars per unit.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for the clarification in detail.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Jim. Can we move out to the next question, please?","Operator","The next questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Milunovich","Thank you. First of all, on the tax rate for fiscal 2019, I think, previously you said the tax rate would go up next year. We were thinking maybe 18%-ish, but does that come down a couple points now?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, we\u2019ll give you guys more color at SAM, because we\u2019re still working through the impact in fiscal year 2018. But to your point, at the last time we guided, we said 16% to 20%. So you\u2019re right in the middle there. Again, I\u2019m not going to give any guidance here for 2019, but we\u2019ll give you full transparency in October at SAM.","Steven Milunovich","Okay. And then I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on your private cloud opportunity, what some of the trends you\u2019re seeing is Azure Stack out there and some volume? How is your Microsoft relationship? And I think you actually need new servers if an account were to use as you\u2019re with your products. And maybe talk a little bit about your software offerings. I think, you have some fairly good orchestration software?","Antonio Neri","Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. So we see good traction in the private cloud segment. We offer a multi-cloud type of solution. Obviously, we have the VMware and we have now a very strong integration between the VMware stack in our HP Synergy. We see a significant traction of Synergy with VMware in particular segments like the financial sector, where they need large deployments of large VM farms, I call it, that ultimately, they can manage significant amount of workloads.","The other one is Azure stack. It\u2019s still a little bit early. But we see good traction with Microsoft in providing the true consumption-based model on-prem and off-prem with Azure Stack and Azure cloud. We have now slightly different implementation of that, because we have better engineering integration and we already provide different type solution whether it\u2019s HPE ProLiant or what is now with availability of HPE SimpliVity as well with the Hyper-V solution.","And so \u2013 and by the way, with our offering of HPE OneSphere, we also provide an OpenStack and Docker Kubernetes environment for those customers who wants to accelerate deployment of containers. So in the end, we have one platform called HPE OneView that manages any type of infrastructure, whether it\u2019s a traditional Tier 3 approach, converged, hyper converged and composable. And now with the inclusion of Plexxi, which we announced last week, we\u2019ve actually now virtualized in a network and fully integrated natively that solution in all our offerings.","And then with HPE OneSphere, we provided through multi-cloud in a Hybrid IT environment, where you deploy VMs or you deploy a container or even a open source type of solution. So we see the traction across them. And I think, we wrap all of that with our consumption-based model, right? And we talked about the HPE GreenLake, and that\u2019s where the customers are very, very interested to work with us.","Steven Milunovich","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Perfect. Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question, please?","Operator","And our next questioner today will be Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Ananda Baruah","Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys. Yes, two, if I could, now ask them both at the same time. The first is, with regard to long-term competitive advantages from Next, makes sense as to how it would improve your processes and your get to market and like that. Could you speak specifically to what you see is some of the competitive advantages relative to the marketplace and to your competition?","And then the second question is, I believe there is a comment that the second-half will be more challenging. I was just wondering if you could kind of tease out what some of the challenges specifically you see are in the second-half? Thanks.","Antonio Neri","Sure. I mean, as I said before, we truly believe, I believe that HPE Next will be a competitive differentiator for us, because one of the challenges we see in this industry with all the acquisition mergers and whatnot is the ability to provide an integrated experience. With the hard work we have done over the last 6.5 years and position of Hewlett Packard Enterprise clearly in the space where we can compete and win, we have the opportunity to really deliver a whole integrated new experience. And it\u2019s an opportunity of life time.","And so, listen, I\u2019ve been in the company for 23 years. And unfortunately, I know every system, every process for good or bad, and I know we have tremendous upside, not only to improve our cost structure, but really improve our growth through better execution once we have these integrated experience. And let me give you example of that.","We now \u2013 we\u2019re going to have a simple, much better integrated partner experience with configurators. We\u2019re going to have a no-touch, low-touch model for more the transactional side, particularly as you think about that market in the mid market and SME. We\u2019re going to have a streamlined one single kind of platform for the supply chain, which actually improves not just the, what I call, quote to cash, but also the finance side of the execution.","So there\u2019s \u2013 but all of this translates into value both for our customers and for our shareholders, because obviously, we will automate everything we can in that execution. From the growth standpoint, again, like I said before, we are confident we will beat our guidance we gave at SAM, which was 0% to 1%. But obviously, we\u2019re going to have tougher compares, right, as we articulated before, right, the currency is not going to be as strong as a tailwind.","We have the, what I call, the acquisitions now in the full run rate. But I\u2019m very confident in our organic growth, because our portfolio is very, very strong. So it\u2019s going to come down to how well we\u2019re going to execute. And we\u2019re executing better and obviously, where we see the opportunity in terms of balancing growth with the profitability, which we just increase again on EPS.","Ananda Baruah","Both of those are very helpful. Thanks so much.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thanks, Ananda. I think, we have time for one more question. Squeeze the last question, please?","Operator","Yes, the question will be from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Aaron Rakers","Yes, thank you for taking the question. I do have a follow-up as well. I want to go back to kind of Toni\u2019s earlier question on the progression of your savings that you expect to generate from HPE Next. I\u2019m curious if you could just give us a framework of how much have you realized of the $250 million thus far in the first-half of the year?","And when you look at some of the progress of things that you\u2019re going to execute upon manufacturing facilities from 17 down to seven going to one ERP system versus 10, 400 sales comp plans down to 25, et cetera. I\u2019m just curious, can you help us understand what has been done and what maybe still or what you\u2019re planning to execute upon looking through the second-half of the year? And I do again have a follow-up?","Tim Stonesifer","Sure. So I\u2019ll answer the financial component then flip it over to Antonio. So if you look at the $250 million, I would say that probably a third of that is in the first-half and two-thirds will be coming in the back-half of the year. And as Antonio mentioned, everything that we have seen so far we\u2019re on track to deliver that.","Antonio Neri","Yes, in terms of what has been done, so we already initiated the platform simplification to your point, right? We said 26 platform down to seven and on the volume side and 27 down to nine. So we are well on our way. We\u2019re not completely done on that, but we\u2019re well on our way.","In terms of the manufacturing side actually, we have not yet initiated the full transition, because part of this is dependant to the IT implementation. So in the back-half of this year, particularly in the latter part of the year, we\u2019re going to implement the new SAPs instance. And with that foundation with a common data master, we\u2019re going to move to the simplification of our supply chain in number of nodes, which the vast majority will happen in 2019.","In terms of core plans, we executed much of that. We entered 2018 in terms of sales core plans, which actually is also one of the reasons why we have executed better, because you\u2019re telling the sellers exactly what to focus on and how they\u2019re going to get paid. And so that\u2019s a \u2013 is a motivator in many ways and that\u2019s where we have better execution.","So very confident where we are today, but there\u2019s still a significant amount of work to be done. And it\u2019s a journey that we laid out for the next three years and much of this will also would be dependent on the IT transformation we\u2019re driving, particularly on the low-touch, no-touch, which is going to come in the latter part of 2019, and that will improve again our execution of go-to-market as we continue to pivot from volume to value growth.","Aaron Rakers","Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. And maybe this is somewhat tied to it and as the follow-up. When I look at the cash conversion cycle, one thing that stands out as you had about a 17% increase, 40% year-over-year in your inventory carried on the balance sheet coming out this last quarter. Is there strategic purchases being made in the inventory balance or you\u2019re holding more just than what you would naturally hold, given some of these initiatives, or what\u2019s really driving that increase in the inventory side?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, it\u2019s a little bit of both. I mean, we were carrying some excess buffer stock just to make sure that we had enough inventory to meet customer demand. And then you have to remember that we have elevated DRAM costs in there as well, so that has a significant impact.","Aaron Rakers","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Aaron, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. With that, I think, we can close up the call.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our call for today. Thank you for attending."],"10962":["Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Q3 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call August 28, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Andrew Simanek - Head, IR","Antonio Neri - President and CEO","Tim Stonesifer - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Toni Sacconaghi - Bernstein","Rob Cihra - Guggenheim Partners","Simon Leopold - Raymond James","Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital","Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo","Jeff Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Paul Coster - JP Morgan","Operator","Good afternoon.

At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Simanek","Good afternoon. I am Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I would like to welcome you to our fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before handing the call over to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our website for details.","With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio.","Antonio Neri","Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. We delivered solid results across all key financial metrics. We grew revenues and we significantly expanded operating margins. We also delivered EPS well above our outlook and generated strong cash flow. Our focus on shifting our mix to higher-value growth areas while optimizing our volume business is working. This is supported by excellent execution of HPE Next, our initiative to re-architect the Company from the ground up with a goal of driving better operational efficiency and effectiveness. Even as we focus on new growth areas, we continue to deliver solid performance across each of our business segments. This combined with the market momentum will enable us to deliver fiscal year \u201818 revenue and earnings well above our original outlook provided at securities analyst meeting last year.","In Q3, we delivered revenue of $7.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by balanced performance across Hybrid IT, Intelligent Edge and Financial Services with particular strong growth in Intelligent Edge segment.","We also continued to strengthen our profitability by focusing on the high-value segments of the market, while improving efficiency through our HPE Next actions. In Q3, we achieved non-GAAP operating margins of 9.6%, up 270 basis points from the prior year. As a result, we delivered strong EPS growth in Q3. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 doubled from a year ago and is well above our outlook range of $0.35 to $0.39. From a free cash flow perspective, we delivered $751 million and are well on track to deliver $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal year 2018.","Turning to the business segments. In Hybrid IT, we have the right strategy. And in a healthy IT spend environment, we are executing well, and it is showing up in our results. After a strong first half, we continued to see solid growth with revenue of $6.2 billion, which is up 3% year-over-year or up 5% year-over-year, excluding the tier 1 segment. The operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 10.6% from a greater mix of Gen10, improved pricing and savings from HPE Next. We\u2019re also gaining share in the higher margin, high-growth segments like software-defined infrastructure, high-performance compute and mission-critical systems. In compute, ISS core grew 10% year-over-year due to continued market demand and accelerated mix of Gen10, and better options attach, which helped drive improved average units pricing. This is more than offset in the decline in tier 1 commodity server sales, as we intentionally exit that type of business. Our hyperconverged segment, which now includes appliances, infrastructure and our composable offerings, grew over 130% year-over-year and has reached an annual run rate of more than $1 billion. HPE Synergy delivered record revenue and has more than 1,600 customers.","Finally, high-performance compute is another area of strength. Revenue was up 9% year-over-year and we continue to be the market leader with roughly 35% market share. And we have strong momentum across both public and increasingly, private sector deployments. For example, in Q3, we announced a new development in our long-standing relationship with the U.S. Department of Energy to build a new supercomputer for the national renewable energy laboratory. The new system named Eagle, will run detailed models that simulate complex processes to advance early research and development of renewable energy technologies across fields, including vehicle, wind power and data science.","Outside of compute, storage revenue grew 1% year-over-year even with tough second half compares. At the same time, we saw 70% growth in big data storage. We expect improved organic growth in Q4 as we drive increased sales productivity and as our latest storage offerings gain customer traction. For example, in July, we expanded our offering of HPE InfoSight across our 3PAR portfolio, which now enables intelligent all-flash storage for our customers. HPE InfoSight is our artificial intelligence platform that helps our customers operate more efficiently in an autonomous data center. We also introduced the next generation of our HPE Nimble Storage platform that enhances the protection of our customers\u2019 investments and incorporates our store more guarantee, which provides customers with a significant upfront and long-term financial advantage by offering the industry\u2019s first guarantee of storage efficiency.","We continue to strengthen our HPE Pointnext services business, and we see significant opportunity as we execute our services-led go-to-market strategy. In Q3, HPE Pointnext revenue was down 1% year-over-year, but overall orders grew 4%. More importantly, our most profitable operational services business grew 1%, with orders up 8%. This growth is largely due to strong improvement of services intensity as we shift our focus in more value-added offerings, high-growth in HPE GreenLake and some larger deals. Advisory and professional services revenue was down 10%, largely due to our intentional exit of more than 40 companies as part of our HPE Next plan, and we continue to invest in new services capabilities. For instance at HPE Discover in Las Vegas, we announced our next generation of HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud to help our customers optimize their hybrid cloud operating models.","By eliminating the need for staff to manage their hybrid environments day to day, the new HPE GreenLake solution enables them to focus on innovation. Overall, our Hybrid IT portfolio of products and services is stronger than it has ever been, and continues to help our customers manage and simplify their IT in a hybrid world.","Turning to the Intelligent Edge segment, performance remains strong with revenue of $785 million, up 10% year-over-year. We saw particular strength in our campus segment, driven by our secure cloud offerings. Looking forward, Intelligent Edge is a significant long-term growth opportunity for us, therefore, a key area of investment. I said that because there is a major transition happening right now, driven by the explosion of the data created at the edge. The edge is the word outside the data center. And Gartner says, 75% of the world\u2019s data is generated at the edge. I am certain that the rise of Intelligent Edge is the next great market transition coming. And HPE is uniquely committed to and build for this transition. We already have a competitive advantage at the edge with Aruba, pioneering networking with HPE\u2019s deep history in continued innovation, compute storage and services.","That is why we recently announced that we plan to invest $4 billion in this statement over the next four years. To give the examples of the innovation, we are driving Intelligent Edge on Aruba\u2019s new software-defined brand solution and our converge OT\/IT edge solutions. We see a world that is edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And our portfolio of Intelligent Edge solutions is resonating with customers. In Q3, Aruba won significant new deals with customers, including Caesars Entertainment which will roll out Aruba wireless LAN across their large public venues, and a deal with University of Arkansas where Aruba will completely replace the existing networking system, including software and security.","We\u2019re also seeing strong traction with our Edgeline system in industrial IoT applications. For example, a leading auto manufacture is deploying these systems to pioneer the convergence of operational technologies and enterprise-class IT functions, all in a single solution. This new integration is allowing customers to reduce costs in the manufacturing operations while increasing production rates.","Finally, HPE Financial Services had another strong quarter, delivering revenue of $928 million, up 3% year-over-year with strength in our asset management business. Financial Services remains a consistent and predictable business for us as customers continue to look for flexible alternative ways to consume and finance their technology needs. In addition to strong business performance, our efforts with HPE Next continue to pay off as we build on the progress we made in the first half of the year. For example, in order to improve our operations, we have significantly simplified our portfolio by reducing our compute platform by nearly 60% and our options by nearly 80%, bringing our total live SKUs down by about 75%.","We\u2019re already starting to see the benefits of this effort show up in our results as the simplification is driving more focus and lower costs. In our supply chain, we are consolidating our manufacturing sites and have already reduced the location by more than half. This has cost us around facilities, test equipment, as well as planning and product setup costs. We also completed a final wave of transition to partner-led models in 11 countries in Europe, Middle East and Africa, which enable us to continue to serve these market with value partners while we focus on improving our execution in the markets that drive 99.5% of our revenue. Finally, we have also continued to invest in innovation with an emphasis in Intelligent Edge, software-defined, artificial intelligence and cloud-enabled technologies.","Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our performance in the quarter. We continue to execute against our strategy, which is clearly resonating with customers. I am excited about the Company position. And against a strong market backdrop, we are well on track to meet or exceed our full year financial commitments as we continue to focus on delivering for our customers and partners and driving significant shareholder value.","Now, before I turn over the call to Tim, let me address the other news we announced today. After four and half years at the Company during a period of incredible transformation, Tim is stepping down at the end of our fiscal year. Tim played a significant role in turning HP around and contributing to the largest operation in corporate history as we launched Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. He has helped us demerge two major businesses, which deliver more than $20 billion of transaction value and has overseen the completion of 11 acquisitions. Tim has been an incredible partner, advisor and friend to me as we navigated tremendous change together. As I said in our announcement, Tim has helped make HPE\u2019s future possible.","We are very well-positioned for future success because of Tim\u2019s leadership and commitment to this Company, our employees and our shareholders. Tim will remain with the Company through the end of October 2018 to help ensure a smooth transition to Tarek Robbiati who will join us as a new CFO, effective September 17th. You will have the opportunity to meet Tarek at our securities analyst meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on October 24th.","Tarek is a seasoned executive with significant global expedience, managing both business and financial strategy and operations at public and private health companies within the telecommunications, media, technology and financial services industries. He most recently served as a CFO Sprint Corporation where he was responsible for all finance functions as well as mergers and acquisitions and business development. He drove Sprint\u2019s transformation efforts to significantly reduce operating expenses and he played a strategic leadership role in repositioning the Company ahead of its closing merger with T-Mobile. HPE will benefit from Tarek\u2019s financial expertise, his customer-centric mindset and his industry segment knowledge. And I look forward to partner with him as we continue to execute against our sound strategy that Tim helped us create. I\u2019m tremendously grateful to Tim for all he has helped us achieve. And it is my pleasure now to turn the call over to him to provide additional details about our performance and financial outlook.","With that, I will turn over to Tim.","Tim Stonesifer","Thanks, Antonio, for the kind words.","Our Q3 financial results were strong with good revenue growth, significantly improved operating margins, better than expected earnings and healthy cash flow. Total revenue for the quarter was $7.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year and 1% in constant currency. Top line performance was driven by solid execution and good market dynamics that we expect to continue. From a portfolio mix perspective, we continue to drive good growth in our value offerings and our core volume business continues to grow better than expected.","From a macro perspective, IT spending continues to be healthy, with robust customer demand, the market remains competitive but pricing remains rational, and we continue to pass through commodities costs. DRAM cost increases appear to have peaked; and NAND prices while less of an impact on our portfolio have become more favorable. Currency drove a 230 basis-point tailwind to revenue year-over-year. Foreign exchange rates have continued to move unfavorably. So, we will not have as large of a tailwind in Q4 and expect less than 1 point of benefit to revenue in Q4 if current rates hold.","Regionally, HPE\u2019s performance was solid around the globe. Americas\u2019 revenue was down 3% in constant currency, but grew 1% excluding tier 1 business. Both core compute and edge grew 10%. Revenue growth in EMEA continued to be strong, up 3% in constant currency, with particular strength in the UK, France and Italy. Performance in EMEA was good across all business units, particularly in compute and data center networking. Asia-Pacific grew 6% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in Japan, and Australia. Growth in APJ was also solid across all business segments with normal strength in compute and edge.","Turning to margins. The gross margin of 30.7% was up 140 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially, non-GAAP operating margin of 9.6%, was up 270 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially. Pricing was favorable this quarter as we focus on improving compute margins and we no longer face significant headwinds from commodity costs. We also delivered expected savings from HPE Next.","Looking at the full year, we will continue to take advantage of healthy demand and grow our volume business, much better than expected, which optimizes our operating profit. We now expect fiscal year \u201818 non-GAAP operating margin to be just over 9% compared to our prior 9.5% target. Longer term, we will continue to expand margins by driving further cost savings from HPE Next and improving the mix of our value portfolio, which has higher margins and Pointnext services attached.","Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 is well above the high-end of our previous outlook of $0.35 to $0.39 due to strong operational performance, favorable onetime benefits in OI&E and a lower-than-expected tax rate. The Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 8%. This is below our previously provided tax range of approximately 11% due to a favorable shift in the mix of earnings and the delay of certain tax expenses from Q3 now expected in Q4. Consequently, we expect our Q4 tax rate to be elevated but still come in at approximately 11% for the full year, aligned to our prior guidance.","GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.29, above our previously provided outlook range of $0.19 to $0.23, primarily due to the same reasons as the non-GAAP results.","Now turning to the business units. In Hybrid IT, revenue was up 3% year-over-year and flat in constant currency. Operating margins were 10.6%, up 270 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially and in line with our expectations. Compute revenue was up 5% year-over-year and 10% excluding Tier 1.","We saw continued momentum in our value business with hyperconverged and synergy of triple digits and mission critical growing 10%. Revenue growth in our core volume business was once again higher than planned, driven by strong growth in core rack and tower. Also, we continued to drive higher AUPs in core compute, up over 25% by increasing our mix of Gen10 servers with richer attach configurations, improving pricing and to a lesser extent, passing through elevated DRAM costs. Structural AUP increases which exclude elevated DRAM costs, made up more than 75% of the total increase and more than offset core unit declines, which moderated to low double digits this quarter.","Looking forward, we expect unit declines to moderate which will continue to be offset by structural AUP increases, driven by an increasing mix of Gen10, which is now just over 50% of the portfolio and continues to ramp.","Storage revenue was up 1% year-over-year as we faced tougher second half compares. With that said, big data had another strong quarter with high double digit growth and entry storage growth was also solid.","Looking forward into Q4, we should start seeing the benefits of the increased number of new sales specialists that we hired earlier in this year. And as Antonio mentioned, we\u2019re excited about the recent enhancements we\u2019ve made to our offerings, particularly with HPE\u2019s InfoSight platform that has been extended to the 3PAR portfolio. Given this, we expect the growth rates in storage to pick up next quarter.","Data center networking revenue declined 6% in the quarter as growth rates can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis from the smaller business. But, we still expect to deliver solid growth for the full year.","HPE Pointnext revenue was down 1% year-over-year but orders were up 4% year-over-year with operational services orders up 8% that included a few large deals. As you think about the relationship between orders and units, keep in mind that roughly 25% of total Pointnext orders are related to new attach. And in new attach, we have been shifting our focus to more value-added offerings that drive up services intensity, which was up nearly 20% year-over-year. We\u2019re also growing other non-attach services like our consumption based offerings with HPE GreenLake, which was up over 40%. As a result, we have more than offset recent unit declines and grown operational services orders, our most profitable business, for three consecutive quarters.","In the Intelligent Edge, revenue was up 10% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency with strength across all regions. Operating margins of 11.6% were down 300 basis points year-over-year due to significant investments in sales and R&D, but up 510 basis points sequentially due to the operating leverage from higher revenue. Aligned to our strategy of pivoting to the Intelligent Edge, we have been making significant investments that have given us a leadership position in this high-growth market opportunity.","Aruba product grew 10%, with continued strong growth in campus switching and edge compute. Aruba services was up 14% on continued installed base growth due to strong attach of our software platform like ClearPass and AirWave.","HPE Financial Services revenue grew 3% year-over-year and 3% in constant currency, driven by strong residual sales and solid growth in our direct business. Volume remained strong, up 15% year-over-year across all regions and with growth in both our direct and indirect business. Operating profit increased 20 basis points year-over-year to 7.9%.","Now, turning to cash flow. Free cash flow was $751 million in Q3. The cash conversion cycle was in line with expectations and decreased sequentially by one day to negative 23 days. We expect our cash conversion cycle to show improvement in Q4, similar to last year, as we further bring on inventory levels following strategic positioning of key commodities in prior quarters. We also expect cash earnings to be higher in Q4 and are well on track to achieve our free cash flow outlook of $1 billion in fiscal year \u201818. We ended the quarter with an operating company net cash balance of $3.2 billion.","Moving to capital allocation. As part of our continued $7 billion capital return plan through fiscal year \u201819, which we announced in Q1, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. This includes the previously announced 50% dividend increase, totaling $170 million in dividend payments. We repurchased $936 million in shares in the quarter and will likely exceed our $3.5 billion buyback target for fiscal year \u201818 as we look to buy back shares opportunistically.","Now, turning to our outlook. As a reminder, we started the year with a fiscal year \u201818 outlook of the $1.15 to $1.25. In the past two quarters, we\u2019ve raised our outlook for operational performance we delivered in the quarter and onetime benefits. We will do that again in this quarter by passing through our Q3 operational upside and benefits and OI&E, plus we\u2019ll pass through additional operational outperformance in Q4 as we remain confident in our execution against a good market backdrop. As a result, we will increase our fiscal year \u201818 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to $1.50 to $1.55, and we expect fiscal year \u201818 GAAP diluted net earnings per share $1.85 to $1.90.","So, overall, I\u2019m pleased with the performance in the quarter. This was our third consecutive quarter with operational outperformance and another proof point to the strength of our strategy and financial architecture laid out for you at the security analyst meeting in 2017. I\u2019m looking forward to closing out the fiscal year with another strong quarter.","Now, before we open up the call for questions, I\u2019d just like to say, it\u2019s been a privilege to be part of this team, and I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. As I reflect on my time as a CFO, we launched HPE, we repositioned the portfolio with the ES and software spin, mergers, we accelerated our strategy with multiple acquisitions while returning $10 billion of cash to shareholders, and we created a significant amount of value. This year, we made great progress on HPE Next and we\u2019ve met or exceeded all of our key financial commitments.","I would like to say thanks for Antonio for being a great business partner, to Meg Whitman for giving me this opportunity, to the Board for all their insights during this transformation, and most importantly, to all of my HPE colleagues for their support and dedication to make all this happen. The Company is in an excellent position to continue to deliver.","Now with that, let\u2019s open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin to question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first questions will be from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good afternoon. How much of the $0.07 EPS beat this quarter would you attribute to operational or execution factors versus some of the one time and tax benefits? And given the guidance increase just flows through that 3Q beat, why not assume that that execution continues? Then, I have a follow-up on servers.","Tim Stonesifer","Sure. Thanks, Katy. So, as far as the beat goes, I\u2019d say, $0.02 of that was operational, $0.03 was driven by some favorable OI&E which was driven by primarily FX, and then another $0.02 was driven by the favorable tax rate, which is really just going to be a shift between Q2 -- or Q3 and Q4. Now, when you look at the total year-ago, going from the $1.40 to $1.50 up to where we are, I would say $0.02 of that was the operational improvement in Q3, which to your point, we passed through consistent as in prior quarters, $0.03 of that is the OI&E onetime benefit, but we are flowing through another $0.02 of operational improvements because we do expect to continue to execute in Q4 along with a good market backdrop.","Katy Huberty","And then, as we think about the server business, will revenue growth in the foreseeable future come entirely from mix shift and AUP increases or do you have any line of sight into units stabilizing year-over-year, or even returning to growth over the next year?","Antonio Neri","Yes. Good afternoon, Katy. This is Antonio. So, yes, we expect to continue to grow the business, despite the fact that we continue to deemphasize our focus on that commoditized server business. And this quarter, as you can see, we grew the business 5%, and if you take the tier 1, up 10%. And the reason why it\u2019s because obviously the demand is there. And ultimately, the strategic growth categories continue to grow at a healthy space, and we continue to gain share in this particular segment. And then, last but not least, we have made structural changes in our AUPs, and maybe Tim can reinforce that comment because he made the comment that 75% of that AUP increase was driven by structural changes.","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. So, again, our definition of structural is excluding everything that\u2019s associated with the pass through of increased commodity costs. So, as you look going forward, I would expect to continue to see structural improvements, primarily given by the fact that one, we\u2019re going to continue to attach to richer configs. And if you look at the Gen10 server mix today, it\u2019s roughly just over 50% of the overall portfolio. So, there\u2019s still room to grow there. So, I\u2019d expect that to offset any unit pressure that we see going forward.","Operator","The next question will be from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner, your line is open on this site. You maybe muted.","Andrew Simanek","I think she got disconnected.","Operator","Okay. We\u2019ll go on to the next question. It will be from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes. Thank you. It sounded like you felt you had a lot of profit tailwinds in Hybrid IT segment this quarter, excellent execution on HPE Next, DRAM pricing environment, better structural price improvements and volume sequentially was up a couple hundred million on and also, your mix of tier 1 was down which should have helped. So, I guess in light of those things, why did we not see more sequential improvement in operating margins in Hybrid IT? And I have a follow-up, please.","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. Again, I mean, if you look at the sequential improvements overall, it was driven by those things. So, if you look at the mix improvement, if you look at some of the -- as we right size across acquisitions, as we deliver the HPE Next. So, that was in line with our expectations. Keep in mind, we did do some recent acquisitions. So, there is a little bit of incremental OpEx in there as we take that into the system. But overall, we were pleased with our margin improvements. And again, this is a plan that has been built on that. We talked about that going back to Q1 and we see nice expansion in Q2, Q3, would expect that to continue in Q4.","Toni Sacconaghi","And then, I just have two minor clarifications. So, your tax rate, you\u2019re expecting to be 11% for the full year. I think, at the end of Q1, you said you expected your tax rate next year to be 16% to 20%. Should we still be thinking about that or are there discrete structural changes? And then, could you clarify what server unit growth was in total, and then ex tier 1 please.","Tim Stonesifer","So, as far as the tax rate goes, we would expect it to still be in that 16% to 20% range. And then, from a unit -- what was the second question?","Antonio Neri ","The second question was total unit growth. So, Toni, on that one, Tim made a comment in his remarks that the total units when you add everything, it was actually down low double digits. So, it\u2019s an improvement quarter-over-quarter. And we continue to see that moderate obviously on the growth areas that we are emphasizing. And that\u2019s mostly driven because of the tier 1, right, as we exit, year-over-year. But we are emphasizing and growing the aspects of the other portfolio. So, I think, as we go forward we expect that to stabilize, moderate to stabilize, and then continue to drive the structural price changes that we saw this quarter, which we expect to continue.","Operator","The next question will be from Rob Cihra of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Rob Cihra","It was mentioned a couple of times, you expect the storage growth to improve next quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering, apart from slightly easier compare, what\u2019s driving that? Is that market, is that HPE specific as you move past the Nimble acquisition now?","Antonio Neri","Sure. I mean, this quarter, we grew storage as a segment 1%. When you look with the combination of that segment plus the other platforms, including hyperconverged and composable, actually total growth is 12%. And within that also, we saw big base of storage growing 70%, because that\u2019s the demand. So, we see the explosion of data continue. And you have to store the data somewhere. And obviously more hybrid cloud capabilities are needed going forward. And that\u2019s the beauty about our Nimble platform, which provides cloud volume, so you can move data back and forth between on-prem and off-premises, provide an intelligent proper with HPE InfoSight. So, we expect the combination of the data growth, plus our increased productivity in our force, plus differentiation of the portfolio to continue to accelerate the growth","In storage. And obviously, each sub segment of that storage segment will play differently. But we are very confident about our ability to grow storage because we have a differentiated portfolio, very autonomous in many way, self healing. And then ultimately, we introduce new platforms now, as customers get more acquainted with those platforms. We believe we have a true value differentiated offer in the market.","Operator","Your next question will be from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate you reiterated the target for the full year free cash flow generation of $1 billion. I think, what I\u2019m trying to understand is how much of the pattern we observe on a quarterly basis is abnormal versus what you would think is normal, because it looks like you\u2019re generating much of that target in the fourth fiscal quarter. And I\u2019m really -- my objective here is to think about the longer term free cash flow generation. Maybe help us think about puts and takes around that trend?","Tim Stonesifer","Sure. Free cash flow is a tough one to model because of the complexity of the balance sheet and the timing. So, I mean, the way I would think about it, as we\u2019ve discussed before, when you look at this business and you go back the last couple of years, and \u201818 is no different. The first half of the year, we consume a lot of cash and the second half of the year we generate a significant amount of cash. And the profile has been pretty consistent, if you go back to prior years. And that has a whole host of reasons. But, I would just -- I think the trends that we\u2019re having are consistent. If you look at Q3, we generated $751 million. So, we\u2019re now, if you look at quarter to date, it\u2019s $70 million for the year. So, between cash earnings and then some continued improvement in our cash conversion cycle, we ended Q3 at negative 23 days. We\u2019d expect to be at the high negative 20-day range in Q4, very similar to last year. So, those are kind of the dynamics. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to really change as we go forward.","Simon Leopold","Great, thanks. And just as a quick follow-up. I wonder if we could get maybe a little bit of color commentary on your progress around hyperconverged infrastructure? Thanks.","Antonio Neri","Sure. We are very pleased with our progress in hyperconverged. Again, we grew the total segment 130% year-over-year, which is roughly 3 times the market. Our HPE SimpliVity platform continue to grow very, very, nicely driven by the efficiency of the software defined storage that\u2019s built into it with the industry leading HPE ProLiant server, which is the most secure server platform on the planet. In addition to our HP OneView, which is a software-defined data center infrastructure, which has significant capabilities in terms of provisioning, lifecycle management and more and more automated AI capabilities built into it. But also, let\u2019s remember that part of the hyperconverged as we move into what we call composable infrastructure, which is a superset of the hyperconverged, continues to grow very, very nicely. In fact, we grew triple digits, and now we have 1,600 customers on it. And so, that\u2019s a platform we are very proud of the work we have done. And again, bringing the innovation that really matters for our customers, which already are looking to deploy infrastructure that\u2019s efficient and cloud like with the same economics and the same way to consume it. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s resonated with customers.","Operator","And the next question will be Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","I wanted to just asked if you could give us any more color on why the Americas constant currency growth was down 3% in the quarter, and it\u2019s grown 4% in the last couple of quarters. So, you would you be able to comment on what\u2019s happening there, considering it seems like a pretty strong enterprise spending environment? And then, I have a follow-up.","Tim Stonesifer","Sure. So, if you look at the Americas, to your point, down 3%, if you look at tier 1, we have a significant amount of our tier 1 business is in the Americas. If you exclude that we were actually up 1%. And if you look at compute, again excluding tier 1, we were up 10% in the Americas. And if you at edge as well, we\u2019re up 10% in the Americas. You really need to take the tier 1 into account there. But overall, we felt pretty good about our growth across all of our markets.","Antonio Neri","And I will say, most of the concentration of tier 1 where the bills were created and so forth, they\u2019re all in the mostly in the North America region.","Rod Hall","And then, I wanted to just clarify your commentary around unit volumes and juxtapose that with the AUP commentary. I thought I heard you say that AUPs were up over 25%. But, I wasn\u2019t sure if that was for a total servers or some sub segment. And then revenues are up 5%, but you\u2019re saying that units are down low double digits. So, can you just piece those together for me, so that it\u2019s clear what the AUP contribution and the unit contribution was for the total?","Tim Stonesifer","So, the core -- the 25% is related to core compute, and that was pretty consistent with what we did in Q2. So, again, I think, the best way to think about it is if you look at the structural increases, so take out the effect of the pass through of commodity cost increases that attributes roughly 75% of the price increase. And then, if you look at units in core, they were down sort of low double digits, and that\u2019s kind of how you get to the numbers.","Operator","Your next question will be from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Ananda Baruah","Two, if I could. The first is just as regards to Next and the ongoing benefit from mix in the core business, what would be -- if you sort of flow the numbers through that you provided at the analyst day for that through next year, so fiscal \u201819 and I then I guess even holding all else equal, it would suggest potential for pretty nice jump up op income dollars in \u201819 from \u201818. And then, given how well you\u2019ve done repositioning the business, mix et cetera, Gen10 in \u201818, it would seem that there would even be a little bit more life behind that. So, could you -- what would be the reason -- I mean that\u2019s anecdotal, what would be the reason that maybe we would not be positioned to see a nice lift up in \u201819 EPS from \u201818 EPS? And then, I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Tim Stonesifer","Sure. So, listen, we\u2019re going to give you a plenty of color on \u201819, next month at the security analyst meeting or in two months. But, here is a couple of things to think about. I mean, the levers to your point, as you look at \u201819 versus \u201818 will be very similar to what we laid out at the security analyst meeting last year. So, HPE Next that will drive some nice improvements in \u201819 from a year-over-year basis. As we continue to make progress on that initiative and we\u2019re well on track. And that should be somewhat aligned to what we saw this year. Mix will also play impact. So, we\u2019re going to continue to mix up and grow the higher margin pieces of portfolio. We\u2019ve got some nice traction in \u201818, we would expect that to continue in \u201819, particularly against a good market drop. FX, you can look at the rates today and look at where we were before. That will probably, if those rates hold, that would be a headwind as you go into \u201819. So take that into account.","OI&E, we\u2019ve had a few onetime benefits this year. We had one in Q1, we just talked about one in Q3. So, I would take that into account as you look at a year-over-year view. I think rates are higher now than they were before. So, I would take that into account as well. And then, we\u2019ll see some pressure on the tax rate, because if we come in as expected between that 16% to 20% rate as compared to the 11% rate this year that will be a pressure point. And then lastly share account, I mean share account should be favorable next year as it was this year. So, again, we\u2019re going to give you all that color at the security analyst meeting but those are the levers that I think about.","Antonio Neri","And I will say -- just a comment here. I think Tim did excellent job in articulating the financial view of this. But I have to say, I\u2019m incredible proud of the work that we have done. We\u2019re executing HP Next further plan and they are executing well, despite all the transformation we\u2019re driving.","Ananda Baruah","Thanks for the detail. Tim, just quickly, I would love your view on normalized free cash flow. At Discovery, you guys gave for the first time a number related to the dynamics that you\u2019ve been talking about for a few quarters, the $1.5 billion. Could you just talk a little bit about normalized free cash flow and how we should think about that and when we can expect you guys to get there? Thanks.","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. Again, we\u2019re going to lay all that out at the security analyst meeting. Our view is still our normalized free cash flow is in the $2 billion range. We will not get there next year, as we\u2019ve talked about, because we have charges related to HPE Next, which again, are critical to transforming this business and positioning us for success going forward, but we\u2019ll give you plenty of detail at the security analyst meeting.","Operator","Certainly and that will be Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Aaron Rakers","Yes. Thank you. And Tim, congratulations. I wanted to go back to the ASP discussion a little bit and take it a little differently. If you just isolate out the 25% out of the 75% that\u2019s related to component pricing, I\u2019m curious of how you see the environment progressing over the next couple of quarters. And whether or not we should be assuming that that you have to start to pass through the possibility that component pricing starts to decline and your customers start to ask for that to be given back on the ASP side?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. I mean, certainly now, if you look at DRAM cost, it\u2019s certainly moderated, and we are passing through those incremental costs. So, I think going forward, if this thing was to move in a different direction, I would expect that to be passed through as well. My experience in prior industries is that when commodities go down, it\u2019s a little bit easier to hold on to them on their way down. So, we should get a little bit of benefit from that. But, we\u2019ll see what happens. And the other big thing too is, what are our competitors doing, and what is the competitive pricing landscape out there if that were to happen?","Aaron Rakers","And then, as a real quick follow-up, I apologize if I missed it. But you talked a little bit about storage and storage coupled with HCI, but I think in the past you\u2019ve provided some metrics around the growth of your all-flash business, I was curious if you could provide that this quarter?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. We typically don\u2019t break that out. All-flash is part of -- to your point, the overall storage, but we keep it at the overall storage level.","Operator","It will be Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Jeff Kvaal","Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. I wanted to first follow up on Rod\u2019s question about the decline in the Americas. You cited the tier 1s. Does that imply that the run off of the tier 1 customers has picked up, and how much of that is left to go?","Antonio Neri","So, this was at the peak. Remember, we said this was 15% of our total compute business. And so, there\u2019s still some way to go. And remember that there is seasonality in that business based on when that builds -- buildouts with these large hyperscale data center took place. So, we still have some business, and we are transitioning that business as we speak. But, as I said before, most of those build-outs are actually in the United States.","Jeff Kvaal","And then, secondly, as a follow-up, can I ask, we haven\u2019t talked about tariffs yet. And I\u2019m wondering if you have some thoughts on what might happen in the tariff landscape, and how you might be preparing for various eventualities and how we might want to prepare for various eventualities?","Antonio Neri","Sure. I mean, this is a very complex topic. Let\u2019s say, most of the U.S. tech firms relying on complex supply chain and HPE is not different. So, this system, call it, has been built over many decades. And we need to understand the details, honestly, it\u2019s too early. We don\u2019t have the full details. Obviously we are provided inputs in the right forums. And we believe there is different ways to address this problem. But, from our vantage point, we are looking at scenarios depending on where this is going to land. And once we have the details, we will let you know if there is an impact or not. But we have already kind of maneuvered through to different iterations of this, we\u2019re able to do good job in mitigating the latest one, we still have to wait till the end of September to see what happens.","Tim Stonesifer","Just to give you some financial context around that. I mean, less than 5% of our total cost of sales envelop comes directly from China. So, it\u2019s a big number, but it\u2019s not a huge number. To Antonio\u2019s point, after rounds one and two, we have been able to make some changes in our supply chain motion and think there is minimal risk from a financial perspective. When you look at rounds three and four, that would impact kind of the half of that 5% that I just mentioned. That\u2019s really going to be dependent on do they go with 10% or 25%. It will be dependent on whether we can make any more changes in our supply chain motion. And the other thing to keep in mind is this is not just an HPE thing, this is an industry thing, so, how will the competition in the industry respond with regards to passing that through on the pricing front. So, we think it\u2019s minimal impact at this stage, but to Antonio\u2019s point, we\u2019re keeping an eye on it to make sure we understand the changes.","Andrew Simanek","Thank you. I think we have time for one last question, please.","Operator","And that will be Paul Coster of JP Morgan.","Paul Coster","You\u2019re in investment mode as far as the Intelligent Edge is concerned. So, you must be under earning in that segment. Could you give us some sense of how much you\u2019re under earning by, whether it\u2019s in terms of margins or dollars? And then, I have a follow-up.","Tim Stonesifer","Sure. So, if you look at Q3, you will note that in edge that our margins were down about 510 basis points. That is primarily driven by the fact that we are investing in sales and in R&D. Again, the edge is a key pillar to our strategy. That\u2019s going to be a high-growth, high-margin opportunity for us. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest there. Now, what I will note is, if you look at it sequentially, they are up. So, they\u2019re up 510 basis points. So I think they\u2019re down 300 basis points year-over-year. Sorry. And they are up 510 basis points sequentially, which just shows you that that operating leverage and that revenue leverage is important, given the margin profile in that business.","Paul Coster","And can you give us some sense of what it is you\u2019re investing in? I\u2019m particularly interested in the sort of probable convergence of your technology with point-to-point, points-to-multipoint?","Antonio Neri","Sure. Obviously, we have a very strong platform with Aruba and which provides connectivity. But it\u2019s also a mobile first, cloud first platform. And we -- what we are doing there is invest in security and cloud consumption based models and analytics. Those are the three big areas. And if you think about the type of organic and inorganic investments we've made in the last, let\u2019s say 18 months with acquisition of Niara, which provides now AI security embedded in our platform, or whether it\u2019s Cape Networks, or even RASA Network, they are all geared into that direction. So, there is to continue to expand the adjacency around the core campus and really provide the digital platform that customers are looking for.","And then, on the industrial side, obviously, we see now new use cases in term of IoT applications, which customers are looking the convergence of what we call operational technologies and enterprise IT class technologies. Because ultimately, much of that data in the industrial space is analog data which has to be digitized and then analyzed. And in that space, we see the opportunity to bring what we call edge computing closer where the data is generating and yet provide [technical difficulty] for customers to deploy this new framework. So, we see that continue to grow, and it\u2019s going to be very industry-driven and obviously very use case-driven.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Paul. I think with that we can wrap up the call for today. Thanks, everyone, for joining.","Antonio Neri","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded.

At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Andrew Simanek","Good afternoon. I am Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And I would like to welcome you to our fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before handing the call over to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today.

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our Web site for details.","With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio.","Antonio Neri","Thanks, Andy. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. As you all know, February 1st marked my first day as the CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. As a 23 years veteran of the company, I am honored to take on this role and excited about the opportunities ahead. Many of those opportunities exist, thanks to Meg Whitman's tremendous leadership during past six and a half years. Meg set us on the current path and together we developed a strategy to take this company well into the future.","I look forward to executing on that plan and I am very grateful that Meg remains on our Board. Our strong Q1 performance is proof that we have the right strategy and improved execution. We have good revenue growth across every business segment, continued to execute HPE Next with no disruption to the business and delivered strong shareholder return in the form of share repurchases and dividends.","Overall revenue of $7.7 billion was up 11% from the prior year, driven by growth across each of our business segments. From a macro perspective, we are seeing some improvement in market conditions and a higher average unit prices, as pricing catches up to increases in DRAM costs. In addition, we have strengthened our execution across a number of fronts and are driving better attachment of core industry standard server business. While we don't expect these rates of growth to continue given tougher compares in the second half of the year, the go to market changes we have made in our [indiscernible] portfolio mix have put us in a strong position. I will talk more about the business segment performance in a minute.","From an overall profitability perspective, we are making great progress on HPE Next, which is running cost savings as planned. The actions we have taken are helping us offset the continue margin impact from elevated DRAM cost and competitive pricing pressure. Overall, non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 7.7%. And we remain on track to achieve our fiscal year '18 margin outlook of approximately 9.5%.","Looking forward, we expect HPE Next to deliver the results we laid out in October. We have completed several critical parts of the program, including the sales force transformation, which significantly reduce the spans and layers between the CEO and the frontline and streamline a number of sales compensation plans. The fact that we were able to deliver the results we did in Q1 is evidence of our ability to execute HPE Next without disrupting the business.","In addition to our strong revenue performance and continued cost discipline, we have a number of favorable onetime items that impacted our EPS, including benefits from tax reform. Tim will provide the details on those in a minute.","With all that in mind, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.34, which is $0.12 above the midpoint of our previously provided outlook. As a result of our performance in Q1, as well as continued benefits from a lower tax rate, we are raising our fiscal year '18 non-GAAP EPS outlook to $1.35 to $1.45 from our previously provided outlook of $1.15 to $1.25. In addition, given the tax reform, which provide easier access to offshore cash, we are increasing our shareholders return commitment and our investment in our employees.","From a capital allocation perspective, we now plan to deploy the excess cash on our balance sheet and expect to return $7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends by the end of fiscal year '19. This includes a [15%] [ph] increase in our dividend, beginning in the third quarter of this fiscal year. Tim will provide more details on capital allocation in a minute but I remain committed to following the same vigorous disciplined ROI based approach you saw under Meg\u2019s leadership.","We also plan to take advantage of tax reform to increase our investment in our employees, by significant increase in the company 401(k) margin contribution and creating new degree of systems programs to encourage development and learning.","Now, I will give some additional color on our performance in the quarter. As you know, we have defined our strategy, built our portfolio based on the market disruptions we\u2019re all experiencing, driven by the digital transformation and the resulting explosion of applications and data. At HP, we help our customers extract critical insights from their data to accelerate business outcomes. We enable our customers to harvest, store and analyze the critical data that improves customer experiences, drive new business models and increases employee productivity.","HP strategy is to help customer drive business outcomes by leveraging their data from the Edge to core to cloud, through our three strategic pillars; we power intelligent Edge, we make hibernating simple and we use our services expertise to accelerate successful business outcomes for customers. First, we power intelligent Edge. The Edge is the word outside the data center, and it is where digital transformation begins. It is where enterprises interact with their customers where employees come together and where companies manufacture their products.","We are seeing a data power evolution happening at the Edge as customers leverage the unprecedented amount of data being created to drive their businesses. We have highly differentiated offerings in this space, including wireless LAN, network switching and converge Edge systems that bring together compute, storage, security and artificial intelligence, allowing customers to create truly intelligent Edge environments.","In the first quarter, we saw continued momentum in our intelligent Edge business, which grew 9% year-over-year with strengths in campus switching and services. In wireless access, we got off to a slow start in the quarter and faced a tough compare due to the large Home Depot deal in the prior year. We saw momentum pick up as we move through the quarter and expect to return to growth with the help of our strong pipeline.","Given the significant opportunity we see, the intelligent Edge is the key area of investment for us and our innovation continues to be recognized in the market. For example, in January Aruba ClearPass was the first in industry to be awarded Common Criteria certification by the national information assurance partnership. Essentially, these validation provides the highest level of security certification an organization can achieve and demonstrate Aruba's commitment to providing customers with the industry\u2019s most secure solutions for moving under a wired and Wi-Fi network infrastructures.","And we continue to win new customers. For example, in Q1, Wellington Management, one of the world's largest independent investment management firms, purchased mobility access switches and Aruba ClearPass for secure network access control. We also had a win for Aruba ClearPass with the U.S. Airforce Academy, and Royal Dutch Shell selected Aruba wireless LAN for the new wireless standard worldwide.","Next, I will turn to the second pillar of our strategy, Hybrid IT. We believe the world is becoming hybrid as each customer embraces their right mix of traditional IT, private cloud and public cloud environments. HP help customers simplify this hybrid IT reality with secure software refined technologies and infrastructure solutions that they are optimized to the specific workloads and data needs. Overall, hybrid IT revenue was up 10% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in compute, storage and datacenter networking.","In compute, revenue grew 11% year-over-year, driven by growth in core ISS, high performance computer, hyper converge and synergy. While we are seeing some market improvement and higher AUPs, we also executed well and seen positive customer momentum around the new secure software refined solutions we have brought to the market. In storage, revenue grew 24% year-over-year, driven by the Nimble acquisition and improved 3PAR performance. As planned, we are seeing the positive impact from go-to-market changes we have laid, particularly in the United States.","And late last year, we rolled out HPE InfoSight across our entire converge and all-flash storage portfolio. HPE InfoSight is a predictive analytics platform that uses software refined intelligence to predict and prevent infrastructure problems before they happen. This product, which came two HP with Nimble, is a game changer for our storage business and is a major step on our journey to an autonomous datacenter.","In datacenter networking, revenue grew 27% year-over-year, driven by strong execution within our install base. Our differentiator in Hybrid IT is our software defined services led approach, which help customers navigate through the transformation challenges I talked about earlier. Our Pointnext services organization is at the heart of that approach. It is also key to our customers\u2019 growing interest in alternative consumption models that give financial flexibility through pay per use alternatives enabled by our soft innovation. I would talk about our newest offerings in this area in a minute.","In Q1, Pointnext revenue grew 2% year-over-year and orders were flat. We made progress on the initiatives we laid out during our security add-ons made in October, including rationalizing the number of countries that we offer services in an alternating our core operations.","On the innovation front, we continue to introduce exciting new solutions that bring together services, software and hardware capabilities in a way that only HPE can. For example, in December, we launched HPE GreenLake, a suite of pay-per-use solutions available for top customer workloads. Essentially, HPE GreenLake offer customers choice in where workloads and how to flexibly consume them. The offerings include Big Data, backup, open database, SAP HANA and Edge computing.","Also in December, we launched HPE OneSphere, a software management platform that lets customer deploy, operate and optimize on-premise private cloud environment and put the cloud capabilities through a simple unified experience. I believe that no one else in the market can match the platform we have created.","In November, we announced the world's most scalable and modular in-memory computing platform, called HPE Superdrome Flex. The platform enables enterprise of any size to process and analyze massive amount of data and turn it into real time business insights. And we announced an innovative blockchain-as-a-service solution. Enterprises are finding that the generic infrastructure in public cloud environments can now support the blockchain requirements that they need in terms of performance, security, scalability and resiliency. Our solution brings an enterprise grade capability to blockchain workloads.","I believe our portfolio is the strongest we have had in years, and customers are thinking of this. For example, just this week, we announced a $57 million win with the Department of Defense for supercomputers that it plans to use for tasks like designing helicopters and weather forecasting. Eni, the multinational oil and gas company, recently announced the industry's most powerful supercomputer, the HPC4 based on HPE's ProLiant servers. And as some of you know, I am a big soccer fan, so lot of that HPE's network and storage solutions are enabling Ajax, a professional football club in the Netherland, to analyze player performance in real time through artificial intelligence.","So overall, the year is off to a slow start. I believe Q1 is a solid proof point that shows we are doing the right things. But there's still more work to do. We remain focused on executing our strategy, driving HPE Next and continue to introduce innovative products and services our customers are looking for. As long as we sustain that approach, I am confident we will continue to deliver solid financial results and shareholder returns.","And now, let me hand the call over to Tim who will provide additional details on the quarter.","Tim Stonesifer","Thanks, Antonio. Q1 was a good start to the year with accelerated revenue growth, solid operating margins and better than expected earnings. Our results give me confidence that we\u2019ve been making the right moves with our go-to-market changes, operational refinements and cost cutting actions to deliver strong shareholders value.","Total revenue for the quarter was $7.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency. As Antonio discussed, top line performance was driven by combination of good execution, improving market dynamics, a strong backlog entering the quarter and favorable year-over-year compares.","From a macro prospective, we continue to see a broadly improving IT spend environment from improved customer demand and higher AUPs. Competitive pricing and commodities remain significant year-over-year headwinds, but we did make encouraging traction regaining some of the ground we lost last year. Exchange rates from favorably throughout the quarter leading to a 180 basis point tailwind to revenue year-over-year. If current rates hold, we now expect currency to be a 3 point benefit to revenue in fiscal year '18 versus the prior year.","By region, HPE\u2019s performance in the Americas continue to improve, growing 3% with strength in core compute and campus switching combined with a recovery in the organic storage results. Revenue in Europe was even stronger, up 11% in constant currency, driven by an acceleration in core compute and storage with double-digit growth in Germany and Scandinavia. Asia-Pacific grew almost 20% in constant currency, delivering solid core server revenue with double-digit growth in Japan China and Australia.","Turning to margins. The gross margin of 28.4% was down 370 basis points year-over-year and 130 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit of 7.7% was down 180 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points sequentially. We executed well this quarter and we're able to accelerate some incremental cost savings from HPE Next, but still have more work to do driving key improvements later in the year. We also delivered some additional operating leverage in Q1 associated with the strong revenue growth. These two items help offset normal seasonality, as well as those large year-over-year impact from DRAM, which didn\u2019t spike until late January last year.","We're still seeing some sequential increases but they are moderating, the pricing environment remains challenging but is showing signs of improvement with more ability of pass cost increases through to customers.","Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.34 is considerably above our previous outlook of $0.20 to $0.24 due to a few factors. First, we benefited by approximately $0.03 from a lower tax rate associated with tax reform that we will discuss in more detail shortly. Second, our other income expense was about $0.04 better than expected, primarily due to foreign exchange favorability related to our balance sheet hedging program. The remainder of the out-performance by driven by the strong revenue growth and acceleration of some HPE Next cost savings.","Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes pre-tax amounts for tax indemnification adjustments of $919 million, transformation and restructuring charges of $248 million and amortization of intangible assets of $78 million, offset by income tax adjustments, including tax reform of $2.2 billion. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.89 above our previously provided outlook range of $0.01 to $0.05 due primarily to non-cash income tax benefit associated with tax reform and adjustments to prior valuation allowances from our fiscal year '17 separation activities.","Before I discuss some results by business, I wanted to remind everyone that we\u2019ll be reporting fiscal year '18 results in three primary segments; Hybrid IT, which includes compute, storage, datacenter networking and Pointnext; Intelligent Edge, which includes campus and branch switching, wireless LAN, Edge compute and Aruba services; and lastly, financial services. This new structure more accurately reflects how we go-to-market and manage the business internally.","Besides modifying the reported segments, we also transferred costs including stock compensation expense from corporate investments and corporate unallocated and to the other reported business segments to better align reporting with how the businesses are evaluated for performance. Hopefully, you saw the 8-K we filed last week, which included reconciliation tables to restate fiscal year '16 and fiscal year '17 results into the new reporting structure.","Now turning to the results by business. In hybrid IT, revenue was up 10% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency with growth across all businesses and all regions. Operating margins were down 310 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially to 9.6% in line with our expectations. The sequential margin decline is a result of normal seasonality offset by HPE Next cost savings and operating leverage from revenue growth. Compute revenue was up 11% year-over-year and 14% excluding Tier 1. We executed well on our core server business, driving 16% growth as richer attach configurations and elevated commodity costs continue to drive AUPs higher. We saw continued momentum in our value businesses with high performance compute growing low double-digits and synergy up over 40% sequentially. Growth in hyper converged with SimpliVity continued at over 200% year-over-year.","Storage revenue was up 24%, driven by the Nimble acquisition and strong recovery in the organic business, which grew 11%. 3PAR returned to growth driven by significantly improved performance in the Americas as we saw the benefit from the go-to-market and leadership changes we made last quarter. We also saw strong double-digit growth in Big Data storage, which has been a growth driver over the last five quarters. All-flash arrays grew 16% year-over-year. We also expect to take back some share in total external disk. Datacenter networking revenue was up 27% and continues to reform very well with good sales execution.","Pointnext revenue was up 2% with operational growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Overall, orders were flat as growth in our attach business, driven by higher services intensity more than offset hardware unit declines. However, our install base orders were down due to push out of a few deals into the next quarter that have since closed and some weakness in renewals from ongoing declines in legacy business.","In the Intelligent Edge, revenue was up 9% year-over-year and 7% in constant currency. Operating margins were up 10 basis points year-over-year and down 960 basis points sequentially to 2.9%. While the rate was impacted by lower wireless sales in Q1, we\u2019re also managing the business for accelerated growth and share gains. Aligned to our strategy of pivoting to the Intelligent Edge, we have been making significant R&D and go-to-market investments that have given us a leadership position in this high growth market opportunity.","Aruba product grew 9% with strong growth in campus switching that continues to benefit from pull-through with the Aruba acquisition. Wireless LAN results were disappointing due to a slow start and a tough compare given the major wins in the first quarter of fiscal year '17. However, we have a strong pipeline and are confident revenue will rebound quickly.","Aruba services was up 6% as we continue to improve services attached with the goal of driving rates closer to those in Pointnext. HPE Financial Services revenue grew 8% year-over-year and 5% in constant-currency, driven by strong residual sales and improving direct business. Financing volume was up 7% as solid growth in our direct business was offset somewhat by declines in our indirect business. Operating profit declined 110 basis points year-over-year to 8.1% due to an unfavorable compare with the bad debt reserve release in the prior year period.","Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow was negative $412 million and in line with expectations. The cash conversion cycle increased six days sequentially to negative 21 days, driven primarily by purchasing linearity. We returned $862 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $120 million of dividend payments and $742 million of share repurchases. We also ended the quarter with an operating company net cash balance of $4.3 billion.","Before I move to the outlook, I wanted to provide some more details on how tax reform will impact HPE and the updates to our capital strategy that Antonio previously mentioned. Overall, the recently cash tax reform makes us more competitive with foreign peers and provides greater cash management flexibility. As you saw this quarter, we had several GAAP only non-cash items related to tax reform, which included adjustments to deferred tax assets and liability plus transition tax expense that we expect to offset with tax attributes.","From a non-GAAP perspective, given that our fiscal year '18 began before the end of the calendar year, we're not subject to the new foreign minimum tax for fiscal year '18. Therefore, we expect our fiscal year '18 tax rate to be 11% to 15%.","Beginning in fiscal year '19, we will be subject to the foreign minimum tax and expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 16% to 20%. Tax reform has also given us increased access to our cash balances offshore, enabling more financial flexibility. As Antonio discussed, we plan to deploy our excess cash and expect to return $7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends between fiscal year '18 and fiscal year '19. This will include a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend to $11.25 per share, starting in Q3 of this year from our current $0.750, as well as share repurchases of over $5.5 billion by the end of fiscal year '19.","The buyback will be more weighted to fiscal year '18 but we will repurchase shares in an efficient manner so that timing may not be linear. As always, we will continue to use our ROI based capital allocation framework. While this is currently biased to capital returns, retaining our existing investment grade credit rating is important and we'll also continue to take a disciplined approach to M&A.","Now turning to our outlook. We're increasing our non-GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal year '18 by $0.20 based on several factors. First, we'll see a significant benefit from a lower tax rate associated with tax reform. Second, given the Q1 benefit from our balance sheet hedging program and ongoing drop in hedge costs due to rising U.S. interest rates, we now expect OID to be only $200 million expense in fiscal year '18 versus $300 million previously guided at our Analyst Day. Third, we expect some minor benefit for incremental share repurchases that will likely be done towards the end of the year. Lastly, we are passing through the operational outperformance in Q1 that will be somewhat offset by the incremental investments in our employees that Antonio mentioned. As a result, we expect fiscal year '18 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.35 to $1.45 and we also expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $1.35 to $1.45.","For Q2 '18, we expect non GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.29 to $0.33 and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.10 to $0.14. We also continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $1 billion in fiscal year '18. So overall, like Antonio, I'm very pleased with performance this quarter, and I'm looking forward to executing the remainder of the year.","So with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question will be from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Katy Huberty","Congrats on a great quarter. The guidance implies that you don\u2019t think the strength in server and storage or the upside in server and storage that you saw this quarter continues into future quarters. So I just wonder whether you can comment on whether there were some onetime benefits from the manufacturing transition, catch up in execution around the storage sales force. What are some of the one-time benefits that you think helped in fiscal 1Q and that suggest to you that strength won\u2019t necessarily continue later into the year? And then I have a follow up.","Tim Stonesifer","Let me start off and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Antonio. So if you look at that 11% growth, I would say 4 points of that is related to foreign exchange and acquisitions, and the timing of the acquisition if you think about Nimble and SimpliVity. There\u2019s probably about - although this is always hard to measure, 4 to 5 points of better market and backlog, we did go into Q1 with a stronger backlog than what we typically have. And then I\u2019d say there\u2019s probably 2 to 3 points that\u2019s related to execution. So those are the drivers for Q1.","As you think about the total year, I just ask you to think about two things. First of all, particularly in the back half of the year as you recall last year, we had a big ramp in revenue in the back half of '17. So as we get into \u201918, that\u2019s going to be a tough compare. And then the other thing to take into account is backlogs will normalize and as they return to more normalized levels that will have an impact as well.","Antonio Neri","I will just only add that as we progress throughout the year, obviously the AUPs will be more normalized because of the DRAM cost and the pricing they\u2019re going to be more in line compared to the Q1, because the Q1 last year was DRAM had no impact to pricing. So that\u2019s one of factors we need to consider in. But as Tim said, obviously we have a tougher compare but our focus is really on the volume to value to growth execution. On the volume side of the equation, we continue to focus on profitable share and obviously improve that cost structure. And on the value on the pockets of growth we discussed before, particularly around hyper converged high performance compute and ramp of synergy.","Katy Huberty","And then just as a follow up when you consider the $7 billion of capital return, how do you think about that in terms of whether it limits you from doing multibillion dollar M&A deals or are you willing to take the business into a net debt position if the right deal comes along.","Antonio Neri","I'm very committed to apply the same rigorous disciplined ROI based approach that Meg laid out in her tenure here. And obviously right now we are obviously biased to share repurchases and increase in dividends. We talked about M&A before, but our right to emphasize our focus on innovation. Innovation is three step approach; one is our organic innovation where we obviously want to invest our own dollars there; second is through the partnerships and the focus on emerging technologies where we can invest small amount of dollars in this disrupting technologies and companies that we can bring in our ecosystems and shine them through our solutions in the go-to-market we have; and then last but not least is the M&A, if there is an opportunity with the right valuation, the right appeal, the right talent, we will obviously consider it. But I think we have enough flexibility in our financials to go do that. And let's remind ourselves when we talk about what the acquisition looks like, the Aruba likes or even smaller than that. So that's our focus. But right now, we are really committed to that ROI based capital allocation.","Operator","The next question will be from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein.","Toni Sacconaghi","I just wanted to clarify your guidance raise, so you beat by $0.12 this quarter. The lower tax rate should add $0.10 and the lower I&E -- and that's $0.10 starting in Q2 and not counting the lower tax rate in Q1, so I\u2019m not double counting. And then the better than previously guided OI&E would add $0.05. So just those three factors alone would add $0.27 to your EPS and yet you\u2019re raising your guidance by $0.20. Should we be reading into that that you are making incremental investments or that\u2019s something as weaker than you had expected?","Tim Stonesifer","You had me up until $0.27, so let me just take you through how we think about it. You are right, the tax rate think about the $0.03 benefit that we had in Q1 that should carry forward, so call that $0.12. The OI&E benefit is roughly $0.04. If you think about what the incremental share buybacks, those will probably be backend loaded given the fact that we are already front end loaded our previous commitment, so that maybe a penny or two. And then we\u2019re flowing through the Q1 operational improvement of $0.04 to $0.05 with the exception of the fact that we did accelerate or see some accelerated savings from HPE Next and then obviously we need to fund the investments in the 401(k) and the employee programs that Antonio spoke about. So that's how I think about the $0.20 raise, which we think is prudent at this point in time.","Toni Sacconaghi","And then can you comment on what your outlook for free cash flow is for the year? I think your previous guidance have been $1 billion, I'm not sure if I missed it or whether you've reaffirmed that?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, we did reaffirm the $1 billion, again, if you think about the $0.20 increase that I just walked through, more than half of that is tax driven. And as you know our cash tax rate is lower than our effective tax rate even with the revision will be still in that same range from a cash tax perspective, so no real benefit there. We should see some upside in the OI&E and the operational performance. But given the fact that it's only Q1 and that there is still a lot of work to do, we felt it was prudent to stick with the approximately $1 billion that we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting.","Operator","The next question will be from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner","You guys saw very strong growth this quarter and clearly you benefitted from an easy compare versus last year. I think at your Analyst Day you\u2019d guided to growth this year. I guess I am trying to understand how you think about growth as we move through the year? And I think you\u2019d commented that your long term growth outlook for the business is something like 0% to 1%. Is that still the right way to think about your opportunity to seek growth for the business?","Antonio Neri","So we obviously are committed to the financial architecture we laid out in October at the Security Analyst Meeting. Again, let's go back to the Q1 growth. Again, a lot of that was obviously the AUP increases we see, we saw in the market because of the pricing increasing, but also strong execution. I think when I think about the Q1 results is a proof point of we have the right strategy and focus. I think we have to see what the pricing environment is going to do. But overall, I think our focus is really to pivot the portfolio from the volume side of the house to the value side of the house, which obviously the growth rates are different. But as we look through the year, we're got to lap bigger numbers. And as I said earlier, the AUPs are going to be more in line to the cost increases we saw last year. So we don't expect that lift in the pricing we saw at the beginning of this year.","Sherri Scribner","And then maybe a question for Tim, thinking about the margins, you guys beat a little bit on operating margin line this quarter, but you maintained the full year outlook for operating margins of 9.5%. How should we think about margins trending as we move through the year? I assume this quarter is going to be the low point.","Tim Stonesifer","This quarter will be the low point as we talked about it. We did see a little bit of favorability. Again, we had some benefits that we pulled forward on the HPE Next savings. But our plan is going to be back half loaded. And the reason that is, is because if you think about HPE Next, we're being very thoughtful and deliberate as to how we execute those simplification actions because we want to minimize the business disruption. I think Q1 in the revenue performance we saw there was a good proof point. Secondly, the recent acquisitions we've done, those become more accretive throughout the course of the year as we continue to grow those businesses and right-size the cost envelopes. And then we should see a mix split. And as we continue to grow the higher margin parts of the portfolio, whether it\u2019d be hyper converge, all flash array, et cetera, we should get a natural mix of it. So Q1 will be a low point and then we'll continue to expand margins throughout the course of the year.","Operator","The next question will be from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","In your prepared comments, you talked about strengthening sales, which of course is helped by easier costs, then you also commented on strong margins. But when we look at the margins, if my math is right, it looks like they actually declined like a 180 basis points and it was across most of your segments, yet sales did increase a lot. So can you help us bridge the gap, I am sure memory prices are large part of it, or is it all the part, help us bridge the gap about why you didn't see some positive margin run rates despite the sales increase year-over-year?","Tim Stonesifer","I am not sure we said strong margin, we saw a strong revenue performance. To your point, we did see margin pressure and that's primarily driven by DRAM. So again, if you think about it, in Q1 of '18, we have a full quarter of elevated DRAM costs because those costs do not spike until January of \u201917, so that\u2019s a pressure point. We are also seeing a little bit of mix pressure in Q1 given the strong performance in high performance compute, so that obviously has a lower margin as compared to Edge and Pointnext, and that\u2019s been offset by some of the cost savings. So we are seeing margins pressure to your point. But again, margins will expand throughout the course of the year.","Jim Suva","And then as my follow up, it seems like the DRAM memory cost would impact, if I am correct, both Hybrid IT and Intelligent Edge segments, if you can clarify that. But I struggle about why would financial services be down, property margin so much despite their revenue growth.","Tim Stonesifer","So the operating margins and financial services that\u2019s primarily driven by a onetime bad debt reserve benefit that we had in Q1 of \u201917 that doesn\u2019t repeat in Q1 of '18.","Antonio Neri","And I will say on the DRAM since you have the part of the question there, is actually everything is in Hybrid IT. There is very little that impacts the compute Edge. But I will say the most if not all of that is in the Hybrid IT.","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Milunovich","Could you remind us about the cost savings from the HPE Next program this year and going forward, and how much you pulled into the first quarter relative to your expectations?","Tim Stonesifer","For 2018, we have about $250 million of net cost savings related to HPE Next. I would say probably a third of that is front end loaded in the first half and then the remainder is back end loaded. And then for the total program, because again this is a three year program, we should net about $750 million to $800 million of net cost savings.","Steve Milunovich","And as you go through the share repurchase and dividend increase, where do you expect to come out in terms of net cash position. Are you going to be in a cash position or there will be net debt on the core business?","Tim Stonesifer","So for this year, we will end up in a net cash position, over the long-term, if you think about '19 and beyond. Again, from a net cash position, we should be neutral, may be a little bit positive, but it will take us some time to work through that.","Operator","The next question will be from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","I wanted ask about linearity, and see if you could comment a little bit on the backlog existing the quarter, given you came into the quarter with high backlog. Did you exit with high backlog as well? And then I have a follow up.","Antonio Neri","I think we had strong execution. We continue to build a strong momentum and pipeline, and we exit slightly above where we normally expect by the end of the quarter. So we feel good about how we exited and most importantly about our pipeline.","Rod Hall","And then I wanted to just ask a broader question. Did you see acceleration at the end of the quarter after the tax bill passed? And do you believe that your customers have fully reacted to the tax saves, or do you think people are still out there planning what they might be able to spend as they go forward?","Antonio Neri","Well, I think it\u2019s too early to say or to call it. I will say our Q1 performance was steady, was consistent throughout the quarter, except the wireless comment we made earlier where we said the slow we\u2019ll finish strong. But in Hybrid IT, it was very consistent across all the businesses. And part of that is because obviously we have phenomenal innovation that customers are liking. Last week, I was actually in UK and hosted a Board of Advisor where we bring our key strategic customers to talk about vision, our strategy, get their inputs about the future. And they all made the same comment. We love your innovation. We need you to continue to position that innovation against our problems, and to see the value there. So we never have the position we have today in terms of portfolio and with the simplification of sales, remember we eliminated the regional layers, we eliminated people in the middle between me and the country. Actually, we believe that's helping us so the right the execution we talked early on.","Operator","The next questioner will be Shannon Cross at Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Shannon Cross","Antonio, can you speak a bit about what you've learned from HPE Next, because it's going through the business and the model. I'm curious as to response from your employees, currently it\u2019s not really impacting front facing employees because the revenue is coming through. But I'm curious is it in line with your expectations, are you finding more areas to cut overtime? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Antonio Neri","So first of all, let me remind what the HPE Next is all about. So HPE Next is initiative and launch, which I architected last year around the summer, and it's all about simplification, innovation and execution. And I have to say, I'm pleased with the first quarter performance where we executed well with no disruption. But this is an opportunity for me as the new CEO to establish a new culture as we transform the company, and to really architect the company from the grounds up with a clean sheet approach. And this is going to change the culture of the company.","What I learned is the fact that you can push more, you can do more. And the organization is actually very excited about what we\u2019re doing, because this is an opportunity to improve the way serve our customers. So it is very critical initiative for us and we are confident we\u2019re going to deliver not only the improvements in our cost savings but also the way we work and employee productivity. And most importantly that should reflect in our business performance and our customer satisfaction.","Shannon Cross","And then can you provide more details about the incremental investments you\u2019re making in your employees that you talked about with regard to the tax reform? Maybe some more specifics on what you are going to be investing. Thank you.","Antonio Neri","So in my prepared remarks and as Tim said, we are investing in two specific areas. One is in the 401(k) matching contribution. So we\u2019re raising that significantly. And we believe that's a more structural approach that will benefit our employees versus paying a one-time bonus I think that's a long-term benefit for our employees. And second is we live in the market that moves so rapidly and the need to risking our workforce has never been higher. So the ability to provide assistance learning to whatever degrees we want to put our employees through it is I think is a great investment for the future of the company and our employees. So they can fulfill their visions in our company as they progress with the carrier.","Operator","The next question will be from Lou Miscioscia of Pivotal Research. Please go ahead.","Lou Miscioscia","Can you go into little bit more detail on the storage side. It just seems that 3PAR bounce back so much faster than we had expected, and then also maybe just tie into that, what are you seeing on a quarter-to-quarter basis for pricing for DRAM and NAND?","Antonio Neri","This was a good quarter for us, in storage. We grew the business 24% year-over-year and in that obviously have the Nimble numbers. But as Tim and I stated in our prepared remarks, our organic storage grew 11%. And as we talked in the previous two calls, we talked about some of the execution challenges we had in our go to market, particularly in United States. And one of the comments we made in one of the calls is that we brought together the storage sales force from Nimble and 3PAR together under the leadership of an individual, called Keegan Riley, which has tremendous expertise. And we see now the benefits of that. When you go out to the market with a clear value proposition and a differentiated offering, it starts paying off. So this was all about focus and execution.","However, at the same time, we continue to bring great innovation. And so starting this quarter, we brought out the HPE InfoSight that came with the Nimble acquisition. And now we -- and as you know, InfoSight these days what we call AI or the autonomous technologies in the datacenter with predictive and preventative technologies and algorithms, now we made that available to the entire converged storage portfolio for Nimble, 3PAR and all-flash. So we believe we have a differentiated offering. We have a very focused sales force and we have a value proposition that I think customers are liking it.","Lou Miscioscia","I think maybe you want to hit on the DRAM question?","Antonio Neri","Yes, so on the DRAM question, we continue to see some nominal increases in DRAM, but these are low single digits cost increases. Starting this quarter, we have done a better job passing those increases to our pricing. And as the competitive market normalizes a little bit and become most rational, we are able to pass those it through. As I think about the remainder of 2018, we will continue to see some nominal increases but not obviously at the elevated levels we saw last year. And then we see what incremental supply will be available. As you know, there're transitions from 2D to 3D and new fabs that will be coming online, but it's all to be seen. So we factor in our plans the elevated DRAM for the remainder of the year.","Operator","The next question will be from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.","Ananda Baruah","Antonio and Tim, I guess just circling back to the potential for long term growth in the context of -- with the same guide was the 0% to 1%. I believe that what had been the headwind businesses, which were your Microsoft Tier 1 business and Unix have now bottomed out. And please correct me if that\u2019s inaccurate. But if it is accurate, particularly what feels like a secular mix shift up in the Window's Server business. What would be the reason that you wouldn't be able to now grow greater than that longer term, and maybe even some meaningful basis points, hundreds of basis points greater than that given that you\u2019re pretty well positioned now in markets that are growing, and you've gotten some really good traction? Thanks.","Antonio Neri","Let me answer first the Tier 1 question. As we stated, we are totally deemphasizing the focus on what we call the customized commoditized compute platforms. That does not mean that we're going to continue to sell the rest of the portfolio to those in large customers, because those are customers who buy everything, not just that type of platform with commoditization. So we are executing that strategy and we remain committed to that strategy, which obviously is a headwind because as you know the business was at a peak between 15% and 20% of our numbers. So that\u2019s point number one. Point number two as I said earlier right, as we see the first half versus the second half, you see the inflated AUPs in terms of compares. As you go to the second half, that\u2019s not going to be the case. And also we had -- remember we had Nimble, now in the second half fully baked in our results of 2017 second half. And so that compare will be harder.","That said listen I am optimistic and confident about our ability to compete and win in the areas we decided to pay focus and attention. For example, high performance compute, hyper converge, synergy, which has been a great success for us. But remember it\u2019s two place two rolls, one is what we call place only better and the other one is the composable infrastructure, which allows us to bring that public cloud experience on premises. And then we expect to see solid continued performance in storage. So I think the mix will play huge role here as we go along the way, but that\u2019s why at this point in time, we are little bit more cautious about that.","Ananda Baruah","I got it, that\u2019s really helpful. It seems like you\u2019re well set up that being said, relative to the model. I really appreciate, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question will be from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Wamsi Mohan","Just a clarification, on your pull forward of HPE Next. Is that just pull forward within the cost savings that you alluded that you would accomplish this year, or is the entire plan just tracking ahead and you can accomplish the entire HPE Next on a faster timeline?","Antonio Neri","That was really more of a Q2, Q3 into Q1. Again, we're early on an HPE Next. We\u2019re pleased with the progress, the teams are making tremendous progress but it\u2019s still early in that to say it will from Q2 or Q3.","Wamsi Mohan","And then just as a follow up. Could you give us some sense? I mean, Antonio, you mentioned this a few times about server configurations being busier, your mix HPC benefiting mix as well. Could you give us some sense of how server units trended on a year-over-year basis, just on to your ex-Tier 1?","Antonio Neri","These configurations gets smarter and bigger. Just to give you an example, our standard pro LAN server now, which is industry leading virtualized platform, called the Pro LAN 380. You can actually configure all the way up to half petabyte in various small factor. So those are massive technological advancement, both from the commodity perspective, from the system design perspective. And so customers are buying more rich configurations, because they were low on that also is a question of economics in term of power consumption and performance. So that\u2019s what aspect.","In terms of what we expect for units, listen the vast majority of the unit growth has been in there what we call the hyper scalar, but we see growth obviously in HPC. These are very large cluster configurations. But at the same time, we see the growth in value normalized with the decline in enterprise, so it\u2019s hard to give you a number, is going to come down to the mix. We believe the value units will continue to grow and the volume side of house will be a decline. And then ultimate is going to be mass exercise. But again let me emphasize where our focus is, our focus is profitable share growth.","Operator","And that question will be from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","I guess mainly to start on the compute side. Could you just talk about the 10% growth how much of that is units versus ASP for you guys. And broadly how do you think of the server market through fiscal '18? And is there a potential for a bigger refresh in the back half given all the security issues?","Antonio Neri","I will say the vast majority growth has been AUP driven. And I just I think provided some insight in the previous question where we expect some growth in units. But again, it's just the size deal that and a mix view of that. I think in terms of refresh, we\u2019re still early in what we call the Skylake refresh that refresh has not been different in any other transition we have seen in the past, whether this spectra and meltdown issues, which are an industry wide issue. Right now, we don\u2019t see any slowdown or any increase in demand. But as I think about the future and think about the performance impact to some of these patches could have on specific workloads, customer will have to think about how to cover that incremental capacity.","And we at HPE have already made available services offerings. So from the service perspective, we can help customers manage, those are patches and upgrades and also product upgrades modernization type of programs, as well as consumption based models with HPE GreenLake. So they can -- let's say, they need a 10% more capacity, we can offer that 10% on their premises and stay as you go. And so all those programs have been rolled out to our field and to our channel partners and we\u2019re going to monitor that as we go along.","Amit Daryanani","If I can just follow-up quickly on the tax rate dynamic that you talked about. I'm curious is there any change to you cash tax rate at all in fiscal '18 or in fiscal '19. I realized what's happening on the P&L. But on the cash tax rate, does that change over the next few years?","Tim Stonesifer","No, it doesn\u2019t really change over the next few years. But longer term, our cash tax rate will probably be more closer to our effective tax rate.","Andrew Simanek","Great, thank you, Amit. And I think with that, we can close down the call. Thanks everyone for joining us today.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

My name is Austin and I will be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Andrew Simanek","Good afternoon. I am Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And I would like to welcome you to our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HPE\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE\u2019s filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported on HPE\u2019s annual report on Form 10-Q for fiscal year ended October 31, 2017.","Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Throughout this conference call all revenue growth rates unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and beginning with fiscal year 2016 are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE\u2019s operational performance. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our website for details.","With that, let me turn it over to Meg.","Meg Whitman","Thanks, Andy, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. As you have all seen, we have just announced that I will be stepping down as CEO of HPE at the end of Q1. Antonio Neri, HPE\u2019s President will become President and CEO and join the HP Board on February 1, 2018. I will remain a Director on HPE\u2019s Board. I said for many years that the next leader of HPE should come from within the company and Antonio Neri is exactly the type of leader I had in mind. Antonio is a 22-year veteran of our company who began his HP career as a customer service engineer in the EMEA call center. He is a computer engineer by training, has a deep technology background and is passionate about our customers, partners, employees and culture. The Board unanimously agreed that Antonio should be my successor. This transition is possible because of all the work we have done during the past 6 years to transform HP. Many of you will recall the challenges the company faced when I became CEO and will recognize how far we have come.","During the first couple of years, we focused on strengthening the company across a number of metrics. We stabilized and strengthened the leadership team, improved productivity and reinvigorated the culture. We significantly improved customer satisfaction driving NPS scores from negative in some cases to an industry leading 80 for our services today. And we pivoted hard back towards partners, rebuilding our entire partner ecosystem and shifting resources to this critical go-to-market channel. We also rebuilt our balance sheet paying off the nearly $12 billion of operating company net debt that existed when I joined the company.","I am proud that today HPE is exiting the year with nearly $6 billion in net cash. Most importantly, we reignited innovation and delivered groundbreaking new technology solutions. For example, we invested in the machine research project, which is focused on creating an entirely new computing architecture for the Big Data era putting memory at the core. We introduced the first prototype earlier this year and have also begun incorporating certain technologies from the project into solutions available today. From a much stronger position, we then looked at our portfolio and made a number of strategic decisions to further sharpen our focus and accelerate performance.","The first critical step was the separation into two independent Fortune 100 companies, HPE and HP Inc. This was exactly the right decision, because it allowed both companies to optimize for strength and invest in core strategies. From there, we further separated the company by spinning off and merging our enterprise services business with CSC creating the world\u2019s largest pure-play IT services company. Next we spun off and merged our application software business with Micro Focus creating the seventh largest pure-play software company in the world. The ES and software transactions delivered more than $20 billion in value for HPE and our shareholders.","We also made a number of smaller divestitures, including Tipping Point and Mphasis and we divested 51% of our China business to Tsinghua Holdings creating New H3C Group, the leading Chinese provider of technology infrastructure. This unique approach has put us in a strong position to capitalize on the second largest IT market in the world. We also made a number of strategic additions to strengthen our portfolio in key growth areas. For example, in hybrid IT, we acquired SGI to strengthen our high-performance compute business, SimpliVity to bolster our hyper-converged offering and Nimble Storage to complete our storage offering from entry-level to the high-end and accelerate our transition to all flash.","We acquired Aruba, the leader in wireless networking, which has become the heart of our intelligent edge strategy. Since then, we strengthened Aruba with Niara bringing machine learning and big data analytics to network security and Rasa Networks for network performance management and analytics. And we have also enhanced our services capabilities. We acquired cloud technology partners to extend our cloud consulting expertise and Cloud Cruiser to enhance our IT consumption models like our flexible capacity offering. All of these acquisitions are highly complementary to our core business. These companies are all in growth markets and we are accelerating their performance by leveraging our go-to-market channels.","We also continue to invest organically and introduce exciting new products and services. For example, we launched the industry\u2019s first composable offering called Synergy, and we now have more than 1,100 customers on the platform. In high-performance compute, we launched Apollo, which is helping to bring supercomputing capabilities to the enterprise. To address the explosion in industrial IoT, we launched our highly differentiated Edgeline Converged Systems. With security becoming a board level issue, we launched the industry\u2019s most secure standard server. And beyond product innovation, we continue to introduce new service offerings like our flexible capacity, which provides flexible pay-per-use IT for customers. The industry recognizes the progress we have made. For the first time, HPE is a Gartner Magic Quadrant leader in all of its core business categories. As a whole, these moves have paid off and I am very proud of the shareholder value we have created along the way.","HP and then HPE have returned nearly $18 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends since 2012. And since the birth of HPE on November 2, 2015, we have delivered a total shareholder return of 89%, which is more than three times that of the S&P 500. I know Antonio will have the same focus on delivering value for our shareholders going forward. By fixing, improving and reposition the company I joined, HPE has worked its way into a strong competitive position ready to drive the next phase of shareholder value and you are starting to see the payoff in our results.","In Q4 FY \u201817 we grew revenue 5% year-over-year capping a full year FY \u201817 where we grew the top line 1% when adjusted for currency and divestitures. We have stabilized our core rack and tower server business, which grew 6% and 7% year-over-year in Q3 and Q4 respectively. Services grew 3% in Q4 and our investments in key growth areas like the intelligent edge, high-performance compute and all-flash storage are clearly paying off. Aruba performance continues to accelerate and outpace the market growing 19% in Q4 and 22% for the year. Our high-performance compute portfolio is the best in the industry and we continue to win deals and extend our market leadership position. HPC was up 28% in Q4 and 37% for the year. From a profitability perspective, we are on the right track towards getting margins back to historic levels despite continued challenges in commodity pricing.","In Q4, EG margins improved sequentially for the second quarter in a row to 10.6% as we executed our cost takeout plans and shifted resources to align with our market segmentation. We are confident in our ability to achieve our full year target of 11% to 12% in FY \u201818. At every turn, HPE is preparing itself for the future. In Q4, we moved into the execution phase of HPE Next, our program to redesign the company to be purpose built for today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s competitive environment. HPE Next is all about simplifying the way we work, driving execution and investing in innovations that will differentiate our solutions in the years ahead.","While executing HPE Next, we made sure to minimize disruption to the business and particularly our sales force. I am very pleased that we saw no disruption in Q4. In fact, HPE Next has galvanized the entire company around our vision to drive tremendous value for customers, partners and ultimately shareholders and all of this is being driven by the strong leadership team we have in place. In addition to Antonio, I hope it was clear at our Analyst Day last month what a deep leadership bench we have with Alain Andreoli, running hybrid IT, Ana Pinczuk, running Pointnext Services and Keerti Melkote, running Aruba, Phil Davis, our new Chief Sales Officer has already brought tremendous energy to the new role, and Irv Rothman continues to do an excellent job running financial services.","Together, this team has owned and refined our go forward strategy which is crystal clear and laser focused. First, the world is becoming hybrid and we make hybrid IT simple. We do that through offerings that help customers optimize their core IT environments with secure software-defined technologies that seamlessly integrate across traditional IT and multiple public and private clouds. Hybrid IT will give customers a new level of transparency and manageability for all their applications and data from the core to the cloud to the intelligent edge. But our vision doesn\u2019t end there. Simplicity ultimately means IT that is invisible and autonomous and that is exactly what we plan to deliver.","To that end just this morning, we announced that we have rolled out HPE InfoSight, our highly differentiated predictive AI technology across our entire 3PAR portfolio. This is going to be a game changer for our storage business. HPE InfoSight, which came with the Nimble acquisition, is the industry leading predictive analytics platform that brings software-defined intelligence to the data center with the ability to predict and prevent infrastructure problems before they happen. Leveraging advanced machine learning, HPE InfoSight is the next step in our vision for an autonomous data center. And next week at Discover Madrid, we will officially introduce Project New Stack. New Stack is all about what our customers want most, simplicity and control. It\u2019s a hybrid IT management platform that lets you deploy, operate and optimize public cloud and on-prem private cloud environments through a simple and unified experience and it will accelerate app development and deployment with integrated DevOps capabilities. This is what our customers have been asking for and no one else in the market can match the platform we have created.","Second, we power the intelligent edge. We have highly differentiated offerings in this area that are helping customers drive a revolution across their business from the factory floor to the retail store, whether it is with our wired and wireless connectivity offerings from Aruba that allow customers to securely connect edge environments and drive new experiences for their customers, employees and new revenue streams for their bottom line, our Edgeline Converged Systems that bring storage and compute directly to the source of the data that needs to be analyzed or our universal IoT software platform that seamlessly integrates data from disparate IoT systems at massive scale. These are all areas where we are well ahead of the market and the industry is taking notice. Earlier this fall, Aruba was named a leader in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless networking and placed first provision. This is the first time that Cisco has ever been displaced from this position.","Third, services are more critical than ever. More and more everything we do is driven by our services expertise across advisory, professional and operational services.

Look out for more news in this area at Discover next week.","Let me say in closing that it has been the privilege of a lifetime to lead the company Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard. I am proud of what we have accomplished during the past 6 years. We have laid out a strong foundation for a prosperous future and now is the right time for Antonio and a new generation of leaders to take the reins. I look forward to experiencing HPE\u2019s progress as a board member and I am very confident that Antonio will enjoy tremendous success.","And now, I will hand the call over to Tim who will provide details on the financial results.","Tim Stonesifer","Thanks, Meg. Before I jump into the results, I just want to thank you for your tireless leadership of HP and personal mentorship to me over the past 2 years. I\u2019ll miss our day-to-day interaction, but look forward to working with you as a board member and partnering closely with Antonio going forward. In fact, I joined HP as the CFO of Antonio\u2019s business, so we have a longstanding relationship that will make this transition seamless.","So, turning to our performance, in Q4, we saw solid revenue growth, sequential operating margin improvement and better-than-expected earnings. Our results in the quarter, gives me confidence that we are making the right moves to deliver our fiscal year \u201818 commitments and drive long-term shareholder value. Total revenue for the quarter was $7.8 billion. This includes $174 million or 1 month of software, which is accounted for in discontinued operations. Revenue from continuing operations was $7.7 billion, up 5% and when excluding Tier 1 server sales, was up over 11%. I will dive into the business segment performance in a minute.","From a macro perspective, we continue to see a broadly improving IT spend environment, but competitive pricing and commodities remain headwinds. The exchange rate improved in the quarter leading to a neutral impact year-over-year in Q4. By region, HPE\u2019s performance in the Americas remain steady as core compute stabilized and networking growth accelerated offset somewhat by softer organic storage results. Revenue in Europe was also driven by networking and continue to grow with mid single-digit growth in Germany, France and Iberia. Asia-Pacific delivered strong core server sales, with growth in Japan, Australia, India and China.","Turning to margins, the gross margin of 29.7% was down 210 basis points year-over-year, but up 40 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.2% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, but up 130 basis points sequentially. In addition to normal seasonality, we saw continued benefit from our cost takeout actions and from a better mix as we continue to shift our focus towards the value and growth segments of the market and away from custom commoditized servers. These benefits help offset the continued challenging pricing environment and elevated commodity costs, with DRAM increasing another 5% to 10% over the prior quarter.","Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.31 is above our previous outlook of $0.26 to $0.30 primarily due to more cost savings, a lower tax rate and favorable other income and expense. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes pre-tax amount for transformation of restructuring charges of $439 million, separation costs of $272 million, amortization of intangible assets of $96 million, and Hurricane Harvey related charges of $93 million offset by separation-related income tax adjustments of $785 million. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.32 above our previously provided outlook range of $0.00 to $0.04 due primarily to a non-cash income tax benefit as a result of transactions we undertook in connection with the software spin-merge and in anticipation of potential tax reform.","Now, turning to the results by business, in the enterprise group, revenue was up 1% year-over-year and up 7% excluding Tier 1 server sales. As we stabilized the core RAC and tower servers business and saw strong momentum in key growth areas like Aruba wireless, campus switching, all-flash storage and Point Next. Operating margins were down 270 basis points year-over-year. However, they improved 130 basis points sequentially to 10.6%. The sequential margin improvement is primarily the result of the cost savings plans we are executing and mix benefits from lower Tier 1 server sales and higher Point Next revenue. Server revenue was down 5% year-over-year, but grew 6% excluding Tier 1 as we executed our plans to exit the custom commoditized server market. We executed well in our core RAC and tower server business driving 7% growth as richer attached configurations through higher AUPs.","Looking forward, as discussed at our Analyst Meeting, we are changing our approach to the volume server segment by exiting custom commoditized servers and moving to a low or no-touch model for core RAC and tower. This will make us easier to work with and will help us further expand our profitability. In our value and growth portfolio which carries higher margins and better services attached, high-performance compute grew almost 30% with SGI and 2% organically. And Synergy also continues to ramp growing over 60% sequentially and now has over 1,100 customers. Storage revenue was up 5% driven by the Nimble acquisition. All-flash arrays grew 16% year-over-year with Nimble, up over 80%, which continues to outpace expectations. 3PAR performance was soft due to a tough competitive environment in the mid-range and some go-to-market challenges in America. We are addressing these challenges head-on by bringing together the Nimble and 3PAR sales team under a new leader, Keegan Riley, who led sales at Nimble and are aggressively hiring more storage specialists for the field.","As Meg mentioned, we are also rolling out InfoSight, Nimble\u2019s predictive AI technology across our entire 3PAR portfolio. We are confident that these actions will quickly turn things around. Networking continues to perform very well, with revenue up 21% driven by campus switching, which was up 28% and Aruba wireless solutions which grew over 19%. We continue to be encouraged by the very strong Aruba led pull-through of wired switching, reinforcing both the Aruba investment thesis and the strength of the new Aruba branded switching portfolio. We are also getting excellent feedback from our new Aruba core aggregation switch. In total, networking grew across all product groups and geographies. Technology services, including Point Next grew revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 3% year-over-year. Orders return to growth up 3% year-over-year led by better than 4% growth in support. Within support, both attach and non-attach orders grew with double-digit growth in flex capacity and data center care. We also continue to increase our services intensity, which offset lower hardware unit sales.","HPE Financial Services revenue grew 22% driven by a large one-time lease buyout and continued lease conversion. Excluding these items, revenue increased 1%, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Financing volume was down 2% as solid growth in our direct business was offset by declines in our indirect business. Operating profit declined 250 basis points year-over-year to 7.7% reflecting one-time items and the increased operating lease mix. Return on equity for Q4 was 13.2%, up 210 basis points sequentially.","So looking back at the quarter, I am pleased with the progress we have made and encouraged by not only our improving financial performance, but also many customer wins. For instance, the NASA Langley Research Center is now using our HPC clusters to test and help solve problems involving the physics of advanced propulsion. We expect our relationship with NASA to grow as we add capability to their new HPC data center going forward. CenturyLink, the second largest U.S. communication provider shows 3PAR with data center care support for recent IT refresh. Aruba announced a partnership with Purdue University\u2019s College of Agriculture to help develop and deliver a digital agricultural program that will revolutionize farming and food production for a growing global population. Point Next won a significant deal with the Walt Disney Company and we are helping the biggest and oldest bank in India, the State Bank of India with its digital transformation. These are just a few of the many wins we had in the quarter, but I think they demonstrate the solid momentum we are seeing and some of the opportunity ahead.","Now, turning to cash flow, free cash flow was better than expected at $370 million benefiting from continued improvement in working capital. The cash conversion cycle improved 6 days sequentially to negative 27 days driven primarily by increased payment terms. We returned $725 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $105 million in dividend payments and $620 million of share repurchases. For the full year, we returned $3 billion to shareholders in line with the commitment we laid out at the beginning of the year. We ended the year with our operating company net cash balance of $5.8 billion slightly below our guided range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion due to the timing of a payment associated with the spin-merge balance sheet true-ups. We anticipate receiving this payment of approximately $200 million in Q1 of \u201818.","Turning to our outlook, we recently gave detailed fiscal year \u201818 guidance at our Security Analyst Day and I encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. However, I think it\u2019s worth reiterating a few points. We continue to expect fiscal year \u201818 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.25. We expect normalized free cash flow of $2 billion and as reported free cash flow of $1 billion and we remain committed to returning $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of $2 billion a share buybacks and $500 million of dividends, which we just increased by 15% from $6.5 cents to $7.5 cents per share each quarter. Our board also recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $5 billion.","As we discussed at our Analyst Day, fiscal year \u201818 EPS will be backend loaded towards the second half. There are few reasons for this. First, the cost savings, the business implication benefits from HPE next will ramp throughout the year. Also the earnings contributions from our recent acquisitions will become more accretive as the year progresses. We\u2019ll also see the benefits from share buybacks, compound throughout the year. And we should get a natural mix benefit as our higher margin value products and services become a greater percentage of our business. As a result we expect Q1 \u201818 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share $0.20 to $0.24 and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be a $0.01 to $0.05.","Now, before I turn it over to Q&A, I want to briefly touch on our reporting structure for next year. Beginning in fiscal year \u201818 we\u2019ll report three segments: hybrid IT, which includes servers, storage, data center networking and point next. Intelligent edge, which includes wireless LAN, campus and branch switching, edge compute and Aruba services, and lastly financial services. This new cut of our business more accurately reflects how we go to market and how we\u2019ve begun to manage the business internally in fiscal year \u201818 we\u2019ll provide restatement tables towards the end of our first quarter. So overall like, Meg, I\u2019m very pleased with the performance this year. The work we have been doing over the past couple of years is paying off and we are well-positioned for fiscal year \u201818.","Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Sherri Scribner","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to dig a little bit into the different segments if you look at the storage business it decelerated a little bit and I guess I would\u2019ve thought that storage might have grown a little bit more sequentially. Was that primarily related to some of the issues at 3PAR because it sounds like the all-flash array and the Nimble business are doing well?","Meg Whitman","Yes, so \u2013 it\u2019s Meg, the storage revenue was up 5% driven by the Nimble acquisition and as you said the all flash arrays grew 16% with Nimble was up over 80%. So a good performance overall, but as Tim mentioned 3PAR performance was soft due to I think a very tough competitive environment in the \u2013 in the mid-range and then some sales challenges in the United States. So we are taking action. We are combining the Nimble and 3PAR storage sales teams which is going to give us more critical mass there and that\u2019s going to be led by Keegan Riley, who led sales at Nimble. And we are also going to aggressively add some more specialists to the field. So I think you hit it right on the head a little weakness in the U.S. and we are fixing it.","Tim Stonesifer","I think also InfoSight will help as we roll that across the 3PAR portfolio.","Sherri Scribner","Okay, great. And then just on the server business that also decelerated, but I know you have a strategy shift in that business. Was part of the decline in service related to that strategy shift and as we move into \u201818 should we expect the server business to decline because of the less focus on the lower margin business? Thanks.","Meg Whitman","Yes. No, I think you have got this exactly right. Servers had another strong quarter outside of Tier 1. Remember, we had quite a large Tier 1 service provider business that had a fair amount of revenue, but not much profit associated with it, but outside that, it grew 6% and I think that was execution, market improvement and some good traction in our higher value offerings. So in addition to stabilizing core rack and tower we are pivoting hard to our value and growth offerings like HPC, Synergy, SimpliVity, etcetera. But you will see some declines in the server business next year as that Tier 1 business continues to bleed off.","Sherri Scribner","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Katy Huberty","Yes, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the server comments. Curious whether Intel [Indiscernible] product cycle is impacting the business yet or is that a catalyst that you think hits in calendar 2018? And then when you think about annualizing the Tier 1 base of business, when do you think the server category on a reported basis can get back to growth?","Meg Whitman","So, why don\u2019t you take ex-Tier 1 server growth and I will take the other question.","Tim Stonesifer","Sorry about that. Yes, as far as the Tier 1 component, I would say that probably runs off to an immaterial amount probably in the late 2019-2020 timeframe.","Meg Whitman","Great. And then listen, our Gen10 server, which is on the new Intel chip called Skylake, is off to a good start. There is some concern in the industry that because there is not quite the features and functionality advancement that there normally is in their tick-tock that, that might be a slower ramp, but thus far we are not seeing that. So, we are cautiously optimistic about Gen10. What I will say about \u2013 based on Skylake, what I will say about Gen10 is we have a real point of difference in Gen10 which is we have produced the most secure server in the world. Security is built in as a root of trust into the silicon. No one else has anything like this and this is making a real difference, because security continues to be an enormous issue for everyone. So let\u2019s stay tuned on Skylake. We are not seeing any diminution of that tick-tock, but we will have to see how it plays out.","Katy Huberty","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Thank you, Katy. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes, thank you. One for Meg and then maybe one for Tim or Meg. Meg just in terms of the timing of your announcement to hand over the reins to Antonio, I got to say I am a little surprised I think in the last 3 months you have said things like I am not going anywhere and there is still more work to do and I have no plans to leave. And so this in light of those comments feels a little abrupt. I am wondering if maybe you can add some color in terms of was there a change of heart, I would certainly say that there is still a long ways to go in terms of improvement in the server business and margins were down almost 300 basis points year-over-year. So, there still is a lot of work. And so it\u2019s not entirely obvious to an outsider that HP is at some ready point for a change. So, maybe you could add some color?","Meg Whitman","Yes. So, Tony, I would say there hasn\u2019t been a change in sentiment. What I think is absolutely true is Antonio is ready to take the reins and go the distance. And if you think about it, we have a much smaller, much nimbler, much more focused company. And I think it is absolutely the right time for Antonio and a new generation of leaders to take the reins. We have got a very good leadership bench. We have got a strategy that is crystal clear and focused. And Antonio is a deep technologist. And I think I have added a lot of value here in terms of shareholder value creation, financial restructuring, nice ignition of the innovation engine, but the next CEO of this company needs to be a deeper technologist and that\u2019s exactly what Antonio is. He has been with the company 22 years. He is a trained computer engineer and has worked in almost every business of this company. So, I just think it\u2019s the right thing. And I also think Antonio is going to lead the next phase of value creation. We have created a lot of shareholder value here. I think over 220% shareholder value from right before the announcement of the turnaround in the fall of 2012, just HPE alone 89% increase since the separation, which is three times the S&P 500 and HPE Next and the simplification of our business and the execution of the strategy that Antonio and I put together between the two of us, he is going to lead that next generation of shareholder value creation.","Toni Sacconaghi","And then just secondly and separately, you had commented on DRAM prices being up another 5% or 10% this quarter. I am wondering, a) if you can comment on why that doesn\u2019t make you less confident about your ability to hit margin targets and, b) whether you can comment on whether the competitive pricing environment has improved at all? Quite frankly, I was looking for more in terms of sequential margin improvement in the enterprise group, especially giving all the cost-cutting you are doing. And I am wondering if you gave some of that back, because of DRAM and competition?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, I would say the margin expansion if you look at Q4 the 10.6 was up 130 basis points. So, we were to continue to improve margins primarily driven by the $200 million to $300 million cost actions that we talked about in Q2 of \u201817. What gives us confidence despite DRAM is up another 5% to 10% in Q4. As we look forward into 2018, we still have a lot of tailwinds, right. We talked about it at SAM. So if you look at HPE Next that $250 million of net savings we are on track to do that now. I will say that is roughly two thirds of that is in the back half of the year. So as you think about quarterly splits and margins I would take that into account, but we feel very good about what\u2019s going on there we continue to right size the cost envelopes of the recent acquisitions that we\u2019ve done those will become more, more accretive as we go through 2018. So we have a lot of things that we think will continue to improve margins and we still feel based on what everything you see today, we feel good about 11% or 12%.","Meg Whitman","The other thing I\u2019d add to that Toni is this strategy to pivot to the value in the growth segments of our portfolio is absolutely critical because, just a mix shift of a couple of percent actually increases the operating margin. And we anticipate that that will happen as we realign the sales force, as we focus marketing on the value and growth segment and we realize the potential of \u2013 of the portfolio. I would say the competitive pricing environment is maybe slightly mitigated, but it would be hard for me to gauge that, because it varies by country, it varies by product line and it shifts from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. So while I would say overall, there\u2019s been some mitigation in that pricing environment I would not say it is universal and we\u2019re not counting on that for the delivery of our operating margin in 2018. And then DRAM pricing appears to now be leveling out and you talk to people in the industry, it appears that supply is now beginning to match demand there is going to be more supply I think from the key vendors of memory and so we\u2019ll see what happens. We are not counting by the way on to deliver our results on a drop in DRAM pricing, we\u2019re also not counting on another 15%, 20% increase in DRAM pricing, but we feel pretty good about the way where we are and I got a lot of confidence that we are going to hit our $1.15 to $1.20 and the 11% to 12% operating margin.","Toni Sacconaghi","Thank you, Meg.","Andrew Simanek","Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Shannon Cross","Thank you very much. I wanted to dig a bit more into the issues on the sales side and how they sort of came to the forefront and obviously what you\u2019re doing to mitigate them, but then also just want to think about as you go through and really revamp your sales structure and collapse level that you talked about during the Analyst Day, what are you doing to make sure that you don\u2019t see softness in revenue around that shift? Thank you.","Meg Whitman","Yes, good question. So during Q4,we moved aggressively from the design phase of HPE Next to the execution phase of HPE Next and we are very focused on minimizing disruption particularly with the sales team, but other areas as well. And so we\u2019re leveraging a lot of the best practices that enabled us to deliver our recent separations on time, on budget it was the divestiture management office approach or the separation management approach. And so in Q4, we\u2019ve already begun implementing the sales changes, I mean those are done actually we started in November 1, with a lot of changes, but we did a lot of changes in Q4 as well. We dismantled actually the region overhead structure, we refocused our sales force, we put more specialists in the field and we saw no impact to frontline sales from those changes that we made in Q4. So that gives us confidence. And they went started November 1, all firing on all cylinders with the new organization and with a couple of months under their belt. So we feel pretty good about that. Outside the storage challenge in the U.S. was largely around not enough specialists in the field and frankly we need more scale in our storage sales here and combining Nimble and 3PAR under Keegan Riley, I think is going to really help here.","Tim Stonesifer","Outside the U.S. sales front is radically simplify in our comp plans. So we went from say 400s or so type of comp plans down to 25 core plans or so, so folks will be very focused. We simplified that. We think that will be helpful as well.","Meg Whitman","And lastly Shannon, I would say we didn\u2019t talk about it much, but Hurricane Harvey disrupted our supply chain in a reasonably dramatic fashion. Tim mentioned, it was $93 million of cost to recover from Hurricane Harvey and that does not include Puerto Rico. And so we had to divert a lot of our Houston manufacturing to Europe and then airfreight those products back into the United States. So, we have announced that we are no longer going to be manufacturing in Houston, any U.S. required manufacturing will be done in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin and then we are redistributing our manufacturing to locations around the world. So, that was another part of the weakness, some weakness in Q4. The good news is we go into Q1 with a nice backlog, because we just simply couldn\u2019t turn the supply chain on a dime. So, we have got a really nice backlog going into Q1.","Shannon Cross","Okay, thank you. And then Tim, can you just talk a little bit about maybe the progression of margins as we think about 2018? You said back-end loaded, but I am just kind of curious given all the cost-cutting we have done now and that how we should really think about the ramp and do you think you can get back to some of the more historical levels when we get towards the end of the year? Thank you.","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. I think \u2013 again I think we feel very good about the 11% to 12% in \u201818. We will be low in Q1. I mean if you go from Q4 to Q1 we have typical seasonality. So, if you go back to \u201817 or \u201816 or \u201815 and look at the EGOP, you will see some of that seasonality. The other thing that you have will be when we took out that $200 million of $300 million of costs in the second half of last year, not all of that was run-rate. So, although we will see cost savings going forward when you compare Q4 to Q1 we will be a little bit lighter. So, Q1 margins will be still pressured, but then as you go forward again if you look at that $250 million of cost savings as I said earlier roughly two-thirds of that or so is in the second half. So, you can load it up that way. The M&A again as we continue to right-size the cost envelopes of that, that will continue to progress as we go out through the course of the year. So \u2013 and then mix, nice point as we continue to grow Aruba all-flash high-performance compute and those product lines become a heavier mix, we should get a natural lift. So, we would expect to see Q1 margins somewhat pressured, but those will continue to improve throughout the course of the year and wound up in the 11% to 12% range.","Andrew Simanek","Perfect. Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. First a question for Antonio, then a question for Tim and I will kind of ask them at the same time. Antonio since you had a very tough\u2026.","Andrew Simanek","We just have Meg and Tim on the call.","Jim Suva","Got it. Okay, well, I guess given his very prevalent stage time, is it fair to say that internally the strategy of HP is what we heard from you, Meg at the Investor Day or sometimes with the leadership change they say hey, we have the HPE Next program analysis and HPE Next 2 program or something like that? And the question for Tim is on financial services that went up a lot and can you help us understand about that? I think it was up over 20% year-over-year. Yet you talked about volumes relatively consistent \u2013 are you offering more advantageous terms or how do we connect the dots of what\u2019s going on there with that financial services?","Meg Whitman","Yes, let me answer the strategy question. So, the strategy will remain entirely consistent. It was crafted by Antonio and I. he has been leading HPE Next. So, I don\u2019t think he is going to lead another one in terms of reinventing that. And we are completely aligned on the strategy. As is the sales team, as is the entire organization and by the way it\u2019s working, you can see it working in the field. So, you can expect entirely consistent strategy from Antonio.","Tim Stonesifer","And as far as financial services goes that 22% was driven by two things. We did have a large one-time lease buyout as well as the fact that we have a heavier mix of operating leases as compared to last year. So, that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the 22%. If you strip those two items out to get a more normalized view, we have about 1% growth. But that business continues to perform well. We are growing and that was our sixth consecutive quarter. If you look at our loss ratios and our remarketing capabilities, the team is doing a nice job.","Jim Suva","Thanks so much for the details. It\u2019s greatly appreciated.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Jim. Can we go on to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Milunovich","Thank you. My two questions would be first of all for Tim, can you quantify the impact on gross margin from the higher commodity costs during the year and the NAND you had some issues earlier and you\u2019re just getting enough NAND for storage is that no longer an issue and then second for Meg maybe you could just kind of step back and think about over your tenure at HPE. How your \u2013 what you have heard that\u2019s different from customers both in terms of how they think about their investing in technology and also how they view HPE?","Tim Stonesifer","Okay. On the commodity cost 10% lift its hold for the course of the year again assuming the same pricing dynamics is probably couple $100 million. So over the course of the year and as far as NAND goes we have had supply constraint earlier in the year those are fairly minimal now and there have been some limited price increases there, but not to the extent of the memory.","Meg Whitman","Yes, so what I would say is that HPE is a whole lot more relevant to customers and partners then it was. This was an enormous conglomerate and you would go in front of customers he\u2019d be talking PCs Superdome Integrity X servers, Enterprise Services, Software and they weren\u2019t sure what we stood for and it was just way too broad and we were not executing with the right R&D against any of those segments. So now HPE is more relevant they know what we stand for and the core value proposition is the software defined data center on-prem with public cloud like economics. This whole moved to flexible capacity and a pay-per-use model is actually encouraging people to say, do I need to move every workload to the public cloud. And then our new stack offering, our new stack announcement discovered next week, I think it\u2019s going to be a milestone and a cap stone in some ways to the innovation and agenda that\u2019s we\u2019ve driven over the last 6 years. So I\u2019d say that those are the main things, I would also say the speed at which we move this company was a slower company then I would have like to seen 6 years ago, and now we jump on opportunities on problems it\u2019s far more nimble, far more agile and I think you frankly just a better run company than it was 6 years ago.","Andrew Simanek","Perfect. Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","Hi, thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess couple of questions from me as well. When I look at the fiscal \u201818 guide, which you guys are talking about the Q1 historically, Q1 is the kind of about 20% to 23% of full year EPS and implications about 17.5%, so it seems like a much more back end loaded year than normal. Could you just talk about what other lever that give you comfort that back half will be so much better and is it all really around the restructuring initiative, is it different levers of growth vector that you have in the back half that give you confidence here?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes. Again, I will go back to two things. As far as looking at last year\u2019s seasonality as an example, it\u2019s a little bit skewed because of one, the memory costs increases, so again remember last year that increase didn\u2019t happen until call at the latter part of January. So whereas when you look at this year we have a full year impact or full quarter impact of that elevated DRAM costs pressure. Again I\u2019ll go back it\u2019s really I think the biggest driver is HPE Next. So when you look at that $250 million of cost savings again two thirds of that are roughly two thirds of that is in the back half of the year and the reason that is when we\u2019re doing this clean sheet exercise we\u2019re being very thoughtful as one how can we implement this correctly, and then two how do we minimize business disruption. So if you think as an example the simplification of the regional structure the reducing the platform, the SKU rationalization, that does take a little time to work through, because we want to make sure we get that right. So we minimize any business disruption, so that\u2019s really the primary driver along with the M&A that I spoke about and some of the other things, but the HPE Next is the big driver.","Meg Whitman","And I think you mentioned that but just it\u2019s important to note that the number of these acquisitions when we acquired them, were actually losing money and so we have now worked that of and I think virtually all of them will be accretive in 2018.","Amit Daryanani","That\u2019s really helpful. If I just follow-up on the storage side, maybe I missed it, but could you quantify how much of a headwind or how much revenues you think you left on the table, because of some of the go-to-market challenges that you alluded to and the timeline to resolve it you think it\u2019s done in 90 days or is it a bit more of a longer timeframe?","Meg Whitman","So, we can\u2019t. I don\u2019t think we will quantify that on this call. What I would say is I think the sales team is hitting the ground running on storage. Phil Davis who is our new Head of Sales comes from a storage background. So, I think you will naturally see him pivot harder to storage than perhaps some of our earlier sales leaders. And so I think you will see improvement in the U.S. And by way, we did very well in EMEA, very well in APJ. So, I think you will see an improvement in the U.S. in the storage space.","Amit Daryanani","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thanks, Simon. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead.","Lou Miscioscia","Okay, thank you. Maybe if you could just mention to us what you are planning to do with all your extra time and maybe not mention that you will spend more time with family. And specifically, any chance or do you have a restriction from going to competitor? And I have a follow-up?","Meg Whitman","So, first of all, I am going to work with Antonio through the transition at the end of January and then I will be a very active board member. And actually after a 35 year nonstop career, I have actually come to take a little downtime, but there is no chance, I am going to a competitor, no chance. Listen I have to say I become quite loyal to Hewlett-Packard and to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, I love this company and I would never go to a competitor.","Lou Miscioscia","Okay. Then my follow-up to hit on I guess storage again I am obviously very familiar with the Analyst Meeting that you just had and that you have had at Nimble has done very well, but when you look at the product line, I think it\u2019s much more block associated not as much unstructured and unstructured data is really where the majority of the growth is. So, I am just wondering is it really a sales problem or do you actually possibly have to add more products to the product line and\/or possibly do another acquisition?","Meg Whitman","Yes. So, listen I think the storage business is benefiting from the explosion of data and we are seeing that every single day. We are also benefiting by storage becoming embedded in server architecture. InfoSight I think is going to be a major game changer for our storage business is part of the reason that Nimble is growing at 80% is because it\u2019s AI for the storage arrays in a way that does predictive analytics and predictive maintenance. With regard to acquisitions, you know what, when I came to this company I think we had a somewhat less than stellar reputation on acquisitions. And I think the acquisition profile that had been successful for us whether it\u2019s Aruba or SimpliVity, etcetera is the following. Is there a complementary technology to one that we already own that can benefit by being \u2013 by leveraging our distribution channels, listen Aruba has accelerated its growth rate under HP, because we can introduce the Aruba product line to customers. They had no way to get into before and also customers tell me everyday that they buy Aruba, because it\u2019s not a standalone small startup company, it\u2019s backed by big HP from a service perspective, from a warranty perspective etcetera. So, those are the kind of acquisitions that we look at. So, if we found something that we thought was important in the storage business that benefited from our distribution channel and we saw a good business case and it was priced right, we might think about doing it. But I think you have seen Tim and I would be very disciplined about acquisitions, returns based by the company right and have a very clear business case, whether it\u2019s cost take-out or acceleration. And I promise you that Antonio and Tim will continue that disciplined approach to acquisitions. And I will be on the board to make sure they do.","Andrew Simanek","Perfect. Thanks, Lou. I think we have time for one last question please.","Operator","Our last question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tim Long","Thank you. Just move to the networking business for a little bit. Two here. First on the campus switching side, could you talk it\u2019s obviously done really well the last few quarters and the synergies with Aruba have helped. Could you talk a little bit about Cisco\u2019s new product portfolio with kind of the pay-as-you-go model? What impact do you think that will have on that business will be an opportunity for you? Will it move your business to more recurring revenue models as well? And then secondly, if you could just update us on the data center piece and how the partnership with the rest is going? Thank you.","Meg Whitman","Yes, so you are right. Aruba, both wired and wireless, has had a really great fiscal year \u201817. And the thesis when we bought Aruba was the wireless would actually drag along the wired and that has actually turned out to be the case, particularly in the United States, where the wired portfolio had a great \u201817 in a particularly strong Q4. Increasingly, we see demand for Aruba on a flexible capacity model. And just like any other product that we sell, we are happy to do a flexible capacity model pay-as-you-go, annuity-based revenue stream for people who want to buy that way for Aruba. We also I think are benefiting from the Gartner Magic Quadrant that I referred to or Tim referred to in the script where we are for the first time a leader in networking in the vision category and it\u2019s been \u2013 this is the first time in three decades that Cisco has not owned that top spot and we can feel the momentum in the marketplace. So, listen a number of our competitors are talking about a clone of flex capacity, would we dig into it, it is actually not the same thing as we are offering, it\u2019s not entwined with services and it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s really just sort of glorified leasing model and that\u2019s different from what we are offering. So, we think we have a competitive advantage. With regard to Arista, so that partnership continues to go along. We are opening up our channel in our direct sales group to the data center opportunity. And I think it\u2019s going along nicely. I think we can do better. At the moment it\u2019s going along quite nicely and I think we are both pleased with where we are, but there could be more there.","Tim Long","Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thanks, Tim. I think with that, we can wrap up today\u2019s call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today.

I would like to welcome you to our fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tarek Robbiati, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before handing the call over to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast.

As mentioned the earnings presentation can be found posted to our Web site and it is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call.","With that, let me turn it over to Antonio.","Antonio Neri","Thanks, Andy. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. Hewlett Packard Enterprise deliver another strong quarter in Q4, concluding a very successful fiscal year 2018. As we close my first fiscal year as a CEO, I\u2019m thrilled with where we\u2019re stand in the marketplace; and I\u2019m very excited about our team and our strategy.","Our strategy should be familiar to all of you at this point. We are accelerating growth in the Intelligent-Edge, delivered in profitable growth in a hybrid IT space; and continue to grow operating profit and expand margins all while investing for growth in the future.","To do that, we\u2019ve been driving a better delivered strategic shift of our portfolio. Which we first laid out for you are the Security Analyst Meeting in 2017. We have been focused on executing against our strategy and we\u2019ve delivered on what we said we will do. In fact, we exceeded the revenue growth, non-GAAP, operating profit, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow tied to get that we said at the Security Analyst Meeting over a year-ago.","We are driving both meaningful top line growth and margin expansion, fueling shareholder returns, and we're doing all of that while simultaneously advancing our innovation agenda, laying the foundation to deliver value in the future to customers, partners, and shareholders.","Fiscal year 2018 shows this strong momentum I\u2019m talking about. For the full-year, we grew revenue 7%, well above $30 billion, which is even slightly higher than I predicted on our 2018 Security Analyst meeting in October. We achieved 13% growth in our strategic Intelligent Edge segment for the year with $2.9 billion in revenue.","We grew our large Hybrid IT business this year by 6% to over $25 billion. Our growth this year was nicely balanced from a geographic perspective with particular strength in EMEA. I commend our team in Europe for executing very well on their go-to-market priorities and getting traction in value segments, which are particular strong results against a backdrop of political and economic challenges in that region throughout the year.","At the same time, even as we drove impressive growth, we also expanded profitability in fiscal year 2018 generating $2.8 billion in non-GAAP operating profit. That is an increase of $576 million in profit over the prior fiscal year. This profitability enabled us to exceed our free cash flow targets generating $1.1 billion for the year, largely powered by strong cash flow from operations of $3 billion, which more than doubled over the prior year.","Lastly, we also returned more than $4 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2018. Our performance in fiscal year 2018 tells me we have the right strategy at the right time, and that we have the right leadership team driving innovation and execution. We have strong momentum across our differentiated portfolio as we head into an expected healthy IT spending environment in 2019.","Let's take a quick look at our portfolio. Our competitive differentiation is becoming increasingly clear to customers, it should be to all of you as well. At Discover Madrid last week and at the Security Analyst meeting in New York in October, we talked a lot about our unique ability to advance our customers businesses.","We do this through a strategic mix of product and services that address their current needs while also them transition to an edge-centric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven enterprise of the future. So how are we doing that? First, we believe the Intelligent Edge is the next frontier and it is our top strategic priority. 75% of the data is created at the Edge and our customers increasingly need help to tuning all their data from the Edge to the Cloud into intelligence they can use in real-time. This business is growing double digits, up 15% for the full-year.","All three categories within this business campus and branch, edge compute and Aruba services are demonstrating meaningful growth. And as more compute capacity moves to the Edge, we expect this business to continue to be a driver for us. Our Hybrid IT business, which includes compute, storage, data center networking and our Pointnext services business also had solid year-over-year growth in fiscal year '18 of 6%, coupled with meaningful operating margin expansion of a full percentage point.","The secret of our success in Hybrid IT is that we continue to focus deliberately and successfully on portfolio mix. Our compute value offerings grew 9% for the year included 25% growth in high-performance compute. Also, our composable offerings with HPE Synergy have an incredible year growing over 280% and reaching an annual run rate of over $1 billion.","And even as we orchestrate the shift from volume to value, we still posted better-than-expected results in -- for compute volume offerings that were up 7% for the year. We are also continuing to be very focused on our storage business and we saw 15% growth in the business.","As we move into fiscal year '19, customers continue to see strong value in our Nimble and 3PAR platforms with HPE InfoSight and are enabling customers to operate more efficiently in our autonomous data center. Finally, our HPE Financial Services business continue to serve a strategic role for our customers. It is a critical piece of our overall offering affording customers flexibility in how they consume technology, and often helping them to unlock value trapped in their own balance sheet.","HPE Financial Services' core capability that stands behind our HPE GreenLake model, and every GreenLake contract includes 100% attach of our Pointnext operational services offerings. We are delivering these benefits for customers while growing our financing volumes in achieving a double-digit return on equity. In short, we are becoming more selective in where we are investing for growth and improvements you see in overall margin shows these approaches paying off.","Tarek will take you through our Q4 results in a moment. But before I turn the call over to him, let me offer some final thoughts on the opportunity I see for Hewlett Packard Enterprise moving forward.","The ongoing explosion of data is powering intelligent edge, creating a $140 billion opportunity. As you know, we have committed to invest $4 billion over four years to capitalize on this market. Meanwhile Hybrid IT market opportunity remained enormous at $185 billion. And we see no end in sight for the mix shift from volume to value.","We continue to see great momentum in ongoing shift to hyperconverged and composable infrastructure, which is driving our customers portfolio mix. The other major trend we're benefiting from is customers increasing demand for flexibility, both in terms of how they deploy infrastructure and how they pay for it. By desegregating the hardware and software elements of the infrastructure, we can give customers the cloud experience in economic on-premises with applications deciding where they should run in the most efficient way.","HPE GreenLake is a flagship offering here, combining a cloud like experience for on-premises infrastructure, let the customers pay as they go and only for what they consume. To date, we already have more than 400 customers using our consumption based model. We estimate this is over $2 billion of total contract value, including hardware.","Along with our HPE Synergy platform, this solutions has our customers decide how they use infrastructure and run the application in the most efficient way. One of the recent development, I want to highlight is the acquisition of BlueData, which takes our consumption model a step further in through AI, machine learning and Big Data analytics.","BlueData has developed an outstanding as a services software platform that uses continue technology to make a simpler and more cost-effective to deploy large-scale machine learning and big data analytics environments. It is complementary to our Apollo systems and professional services, extending our data first strategy. By seamlessly combining their software platform with our existing software defined infrastructure and services we will be able to help our customers accelerate their AI and big data transformations and better extract insights from the data, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid architecture.","Overall, our unique offerings have positioned us right where I want us to be, a powerful force as we show the way customers are generating and utilizing data in their businesses. Across all area of the business, we're putting our customers at the center of everything we do and that\u2019s reflected in our performance, customer feedback, and recent customer wins. For example, we recently support an extensive technique to create a wireless access point for an in-flight entertainment system, utilizing our eight mobile-first campus products.","These wireless access point mobile is one of the most advanced in-flight wireless network in the sky. HPE also signed two multimillion dollar contracts, we grew for sometime there in Spain and Mexico. For the deployment of Santander's mobile cloud based on HPE Synergy and we had the significant HPE GreenLake win with Danfoss, the largest manufacturing company in Denmark.","Looking ahead to 2018, I\u2019ve a great confidence that we will continue to build on all this momentum. We will continue our work to accelerate growth in Intelligent Edge, deliver profitable growth in Hybrid IT, and balance all of this with continued cost savings from HP Next, a resulting margin expansion.","Now before I turn the call over I will like to formally welcome Tarek to his first earnings call as a CFO. As you know by now, Tarek joined us in September 17 and jumped right been quickly getting up to speed on HPE's Strategy and financial commitments so that we can continue to deliver for our customers and partners and rise significant value for our shareholders. Hope many of you have the opportunity to meet and speak to Tarek at the Security Analyst meeting. We're very fortunate to have him on the team and we will continue to benefit from his financial expertise, his customer centric mindset and insight and his industry segment knowledge. Tarek?","A - Tarek Robbiati","Thank you very much, Antonio. It's a real privilege for me to report Hewlett Packard enterprise quarterly earnings for the first time in my new role as CFO. In my view, there is a great potential at HPE. No other company has the full suite of assets and channel capabilities needed to compete across the extra cloud continue.","During the half month into the role, I'm very excited to be part of HPE's leadership team as we got the company and our customers into the next phase of a technology led transformation. But before I share with you our results in detail, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my predecessor Tim Stonesifer for the hard work stands behind HPE strong fiscal year '18 performance and a great handover between us.","Now let me share with you our financial results for the quarter. I will be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to better highlight the strong momentum of the business throughout fiscal year '18. Starting with Slide one, you will see that our Q4 financial results were very strong. We ended the fiscal year with robust revenue growth, significantly improved operating margins, better-than-expected non-GAAP-earnings and free cash flow.","Our results demonstrate our ability to grow free cash flow by accelerating growth in the Intelligent Edge, driving profitable growth in Hybrid IT and continuing to grow operating profits by expanding operating margins through HPE Next and also by shifting the portfolio mix, higher margin and better services attached offerings. The punch line is that our resulting growth of 49% year-over-year in cash flow from operations demonstrate that our strategy is bearing fruit.","From a macro perspective, IT spend continue to be strong and customer demand remains healthy heading into fiscal year '19. The market remains competitive, but pricing remains rational and we are holding onto favorable pricing with improving commodities costs to expand gross margins.","DRAM cost have peaked and are starting to come down. NAND prices who are less of an impact on our portfolio continue to decline. Currency drove a 50 basis points tailwind to revenue year-over-year. Having said that, foreign exchange rates continue to move unfavorably in the last couple of quarters. And we now expect currency to be a headwind of closer to two points of revenue growth in fiscal year '19","Looking at Slide 2, total revenue for the quarter was $7.9 billion, up 4% year-over-year and 3% in constant currency. Top line performance in fiscal year '18 was driven by strong execution in a healthy demand environment that we expect to continue heading into fiscal year '19.","Slide 3 and 4 give you a geographic breakdown for the quarter. Regionally, HPE's performance was solid across the globe. Americas revenue was up 3% in constant currency. Core compute, which excludes mission-critical systems and Tier 1 and Intelligent Edge both grew double digits in constant currency.","Revenue growth in EMEA continued to be strong, up 8% in constant currency with double-digit growth in the U.K., France, and Italy. Performance in EMEA was robust across all business segments with notable growth in Core Compute at 24% and Intelligent Edge at 14%.","Asia-Pacific was down 4% in constant currency due to our focus on profitable share in the China market. Growth in APJ, excluding China was up 2% with solid results across all business segments with notable strength in Core Compute, which grew 18%.","Slide 5 shows our performance in the quarter by segment. I won't take you through every number, but the key takeaway is that from a portfolio mix perspective, we're winning where it matters. We maintained robust double-digit growth in our strategically important Intelligent Edge segment.","In Hybrid IT, our compute value portfolio grew over 20% this quarter. And within HPE Pointnext, our operational services business grew orders and revenue by 2% in fiscal year '18. Overall, we're confident in sustaining robust revenue growth as we continue pivoting our business towards higher margin, higher value offerings and improve our performance in our services business in fiscal year '19.","Turning to margins on Slide 6, we continue to deliver significant margin expansion as a result of focusing on profitable growth in Hybrid IT, shifting our portfolio towards higher value, higher margin offerings and continuing to drive HPE Next initiatives.","Gross margin of 30.9% was up 120 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin of 10.1% was up 190 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points sequentially. HPE Next has been an incredible success story for us this year and we expect to continue reaping the operating margin expansion benefits delivered by HPE Next for years to come to drive operating leverage and cash flow growth.","Moving on to Slide 7. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.45 in Q4 of fiscal year '18 was above the high-end of our previous outlook of $0.39 to $0.44 per share due to strong operational performance, favorable other income and expense and a lower-than-expected tax rate. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter we exceeded the high-end of our outlook range.","GAAP diluted net earnings per share was a $0.52 loss, below our previously provided outlook range of $0.16 to $0.21 per share, primarily related to the impact from U.S Tax Reform which was a drag of over $0.85 to GAAP earnings this quarter. Without the impact, we would have exceeded our outlook on this metric as well.","Now turning to the segment and business units, starting on Slide 8. In the Intelligent Edge, revenue was up 17% year-over-year and 15% in constant currency with strength across all regions. Operating margins of 10.1% were down 240 basis points year-over-year due to the ongoing significant investments in sales and R&D as we continue to manage this business for growth and share leadership in the $140 billion Intelligent Edge market opportunity.","Aruba product grew 17% with continued strong growth across all product categories, including Campus Switching, Wireless LAN and Edge Compute. We continued gaining share in the Campus Switching business recording seven consecutive quarters of share gain and saw an audible triple digit growth in our Edge Compute business.","Aruba services was up 16% on continued installed base growth due to strong attach of our software platform like ClearPass or Secure Network Access Control. As you can see from the revenue mix chart, Aruba services represents today a small portion of Aruba's total revenue, which highlights a great potential for the upcoming years.","Moving on to Slide 9, in Hybrid IT, revenue was up 5% year-over-year and up 4% in constant currency. Operating margins were 11.9%, up 210 basis points year-over-year and 130 basis points sequentially in line with our expectations. Compute Revenue was up 9% year-over-year and 14% excluding Tier 1.","As a reminder, Tier 1 was over 20% of our compute portfolio couple of years ago and is now under 10%, which is a proof point of our commitment to improving our portfolio profitability mix.","Our Compute Value business, which has higher margin and better services attached has continued momentum growing at over 20% year-over-year. This was driven by our hyperconverged portfolio, which includes synergy up triple digits and currently at over $1 billion revenue run rate. Also our high-performance compute category, which was up over 50% and finally mission-critical servers which was up 14%.","Revenue growth in our volume business was once again higher than planned in the high single digits excluding Tier 1, driven by strong growth in core rack and tower. Also we continue to drive higher AUPs in total compute, which was up 20% excluding Tier 1 by increasing our mix of Gen10 servers with richer attach configurations maintaining pricing power and to a lesser extent passing through elevated DRAM costs.","As expected, unit declines excluding Tier 1 moderated to mid single digits this quarter and we're confident that we can continue to offset moderating unit declines with structural AUP increases heading into fiscal year '19.","Storage revenue was up 6% year-over-year as customers embraced our intelligent storage offerings embedded with our AI-based predictive analytics InfoSight platform and we improved our go-to-market execution.","Big Data had another strong quarter growing at 92% year-over-year, which will further benefit from a recently announced acquisition of BlueData. Entry storage growth was also solid. Looking forward into fiscal year '19, we are pleased with our full portfolio across Nimble and 3PAR and we expect to gain share in the external storage market.","HPE Pointnext revenue declined overall 3% year-over-year due to our continued intentional exit from low-margin countries in the advisory and professional services business, but was flat on our full-year basis and would have been up 1%, normalizing for those country exit. If you look at our higher margin operational services business, revenue was up 2% on a full-year basis.","Looking into fiscal year '19, we see continuous growth in operational services orders as we expect favorable mix from our value offerings that have better services intensity and from our consumption based offerings with HPE GreenLake, which grew orders at a 30% year-over-year rate in constant currency this quarter.","Moving to Slide 10, HPE Financial Services revenue declined 7% year-over-year and 5% in constant currency due to a large one-time lease buyout deal in the prior year period. Normalizing for this one-time buyout, revenue was up 3% year-over-year. Financing volume remained strong across all regions and was up 8% year-over-year with solid growth in our direct business. Operating margin increased 20 basis points year-over-year to 7.8%. We are very pleased with HPFS performance and look to accelerate its contribution to the business for years to come.","Now turning to cash flow on Slide 11, free cash flow was $1 billion in Q4 in line with our expectations and consistent with prior year seasonality. Cash flow from operations growth has been significant in fiscal year '18, driven by HPE Next and shifting our portfolio mix to where we want to win. That is where we have higher margins and better services attached.","In fiscal year '19, we expect free cash flow to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion as we announced at SAM a significant improvement compared to this year. We also expect our cash flow seasonality to be similar to prior years where the first half is a use of cash with particular emphasis on Q1, and then we generate significant cash in the second half of the year, primarily in Q4.","With respect to our capital management strategy and as part of our continued $7 billion capital return plan through fiscal year '19, which we announced in Q1, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. This includes the previously announced 50% dividend increase, totaling $164 million in dividend payments. We repurchased $983 million of shares in the quarter and exceeded our $3.5 billion buyback target for fiscal year '18.","Finally, as you can see from Slide 12, our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with an operating company net cash balance of $3.1 billion. Looking into fiscal year '19, we expect to return approximately $2.9 billion, which is the remainder of our $7 billion capital returns program thus delivering on our commitment to shareholders.","Antonio provided our fiscal year '18 performance overview, but let me recap it here now that you\u2019ve seen the quarterly results. Fiscal year '18 was really an outstanding year as you can see from Slide 13 through 16. For the full-year, we grew revenue by 7% year-over-year with notable growth in compute value at 9%, storage at 13%, and edge at 13%.","We grew non-GAAP operating profit by 26% and delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 9%, which was up 140 basis points year-over-year and in line with recent communications. We executed well HPE Next, pivoted our portfolio mix towards higher value, higher margin offerings, which came with better Pointnext services attached and grew our consumption based services business.","Also we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.56 above our most recent outlook of $1.50 to $1.55 and well above our original SAM 2017 outlook of a $1.15 to $1.25, a growth of over 60% year-over-year from continuing operations.","Cash flow from operations were $3 billion, a growth of over 120% year-over-year, while free cash flow came in at $1.1 billion significantly above our fiscal year '17 levels and above our fiscal year '18 guidance. In summary, we're far exceeded our full-year revenue, operating profit, and cash flow commitments outlined at SAM in 2017. This demonstrates that we have the right strategy and our execution remains robust.","Now turning to our outlook on Slide 17, at our recent Securities Analyst meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '19 and I would encourage you to review representation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. It's worth reiterating a few points for this call.","Our top line perspective, we expected to grow our fiscal year '19 revenue adjusted for lower margin Tier 1 business and currency fluctuations. Also we expect to grow our fiscal year '19 non-GAAP operating profit by 6% to 8%. As a reminder, we will be removing nonservice pension costs and benefits from our non-GAAP results. Consequently, our fiscal year '18 non-GAAP EPS adjusted for pension accounting and taxes would be a $1.45.","We finished the year better than what we flagged in our 2018 SAM. Looking forward, our fiscal year '19 guidance is unchanged with diluted net earnings per share of a $1.51 to $1.61 for non-GAAP EPS and 8% improvement over the prior year. In our GAAP EPS outlook remains $0.73 to $0.83 per share. Finally for Q1 '19, we expect diluted net non-GAAP EPS of $0.33 to $0.37 and diluted net GAAP EPS of $0.19 to $0.23 per share.","So, overall, I'm very pleased with the performance not just in the quarter but the full fiscal year. We have the right vision and execution and the results show that we are winning where it matters.","With that, now let's open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question will be from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good afternoon. Sorry about the voice. Just two quick questions, I will ask them at once. The first is how would you breakdown the server revenue growth in the quarter between units and ASPs. Then you mentioned a couple times in the call that you expect robust demand that continue into next year. Who are those signals that give you that confidence given everything that's going on in the macro environment. Thank you.","Antonio Neri","Hi, Katy. This is Antonio. First of all, I hope you guy will soon -- I will answer the second question first about the macro environment. That is why I\u2019m confident is because we see ongoing demand from customers and their demand is driven by the amount of data we are creating, we are generating. And obviously regulations like privacy, and others, requires that data to be stored, to be managed, to be managed to be curated, and obviously extracted value as soon as possible. So it's a function of the data. And if you look at the charts actually, the data growth outpaces the compute growth, which means that compute growth has to catch-up sooner or rather than later. So from my vantage point, as long as that data continue to grow and I mentioned this before, two years from now we\u2019re going to generate twice the amount of data we generated in human history. That means that data has to be computed and today only 6% of the data has been utilized. The other 94% is not being utilized. So from that point I feel very good and confident about the ongoing demand and we see that in the momentum we have in the last few quarters, and at this point in time, I think that will continue. In terms of the server AUPs, listen, as we said before, is all structural. This quarter actually if you recall two quarters ago, I said as we exit 2018, we will see mitigated declines in units and that's exactly what happened here as being very low single-digit decline in units. And the rest is all structural AUP driven by the mix shift to Gen10, which drives more option attach. And then ultimately the elevated DRAM price is still there, although now started declining. But the fact of the matter is that these servers, this computer platform will continue to add more and more options and therefore, the AUP structural changes are permanent as we go along.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Katy. And we have the next question please.","Operator","Yes. Next question will be from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Simon Leopold","Hi, guys. I wanted to see if you could speak about how you see the trajectory of the server markets, excluding the hyperscale portion you know and then how much this is imposed by the macro and then other factors and just when -- I will just add in there, are you expecting any changes in the competitive dynamics with Dell considering its plan to come back into the public space now. And it's a search in the integration with EMCs is complete?","Antonio Neri","Yes, I mean, we have a very deliberate strategy to shift from volume to value, despite that the volume business grew 7% for the year, which is good and our value business grew 20% year-over-year and that's because the software-defined infrastructure is the perfect architecture to deploy on-premises against these specific optimized workload solutions that customers are looking for. When you look at that value business, our HPC business, our high performance compute business grew 25% and that\u2019s driven by the big data analytics and specific segments like government, oil and gas, weather, and academia. If I look at hyperconverged business grow in triple digits. If I look at our synergy business, it grew 280%, but now is already a $1 billion run rate. All these platforms actually drive higher services attach with Operational Services. And so we continued that to -- we continue to believe that\u2019s going to continue to grow. And everything we have gone is deliberated to shift to that model not just from the engineering perspective, but as well as from the go-to-market perspective, because the way we actually incent our people is to go sell solutions that there were load optimize. So I feel very good about that and we expect that to continue whether its on-prem, cloud infrastructure or mission-critical applications. In fact our mission-critical business think about workloads like HANA or SQL, or Oracle. Actually that business grew 35%, which is very, very strong. So I feel good about that. Now in term of the Tier 1 business or the hyperscale, we made our decision almost 2 years ago. And to Tarek's comments, it used to be 20% of the business, now it's less than 10% of the business and we\u2019ve been better delivered about that because there was no margins to be made or least not the one that we wanted to make. And number two there was no services of postal associated with that. So we are certain our strategy and that's what we're executing. Dell, listen I'm focused of my strategy and listen I am very pleased and proud that we\u2019ve done here in the first year with a team, we're growing revenue of the company on the high single-digit. We're expanding profitability by 63% or now earnings per share, we are returning $7 billion of cash or capital to shareholders. And we are validating our strategy with customers every single day. Last week, at HPE discovered in Madrid, we had more than 10,000 customers coming and telling us we are on the right path.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Simon. Can we go to the next question please?","Operator","Yes. Next question will be from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Toni Sacconaghi","Yes. Thank you. Two questions, please. First, I\u2019m wondering if you can comment at all on the impact of tariffs. I think as of November 1, you increased pricing on Aruba by 10%. And I'm wondering would you continue to increase price if there were change in tariffs and did you see any kind of pull in, in advance of the price increases that benefited Aruba in the quarter? Could you comment on that, please.","Antonio Neri","Yes, Toni. So, yes, we increased prices like any other competitor has done. Remember, in the U.S tariff they were four faces. The first two faces we manage it that was no impact to us. The third face is exactly the one you\u2019re talking about at the 10%. And as you read, the last few days is uncertain what they're going to happen on January 1. We see the outcome of the negotiation. But we increase the prices 10% and we saw no follow-up because of that price increase expected on November 1st. So there was no incremental benefit for Q4. So that's the bottom line. As these new whatever the new tariff comes in play, we\u2019re already working on two aspect of it. One obviously is the pricing side, but the other one is the supplier side. So we continue to work with our supply chain or suppliers to figure out what is the long-term strategic option here, but we need to wait what\u2019s to happen and with the negotiation, because of 10% it makes no sense to change anything. A 25% obviously you have to consider other options.","Toni Sacconaghi","Okay. Thank you for that. And then I\u2019m just wondering, I don\u2019t think you commented on what the or maybe I missed it and I apologize on what the services operational support growth was specifically in Q4? And I understand the move to value, but I was under the impression that support services are largely correlated to unit growth and with unit growth down again mid single digits this quarter and down I think double digits for the year, is it really realistic to believe that high-margin operational services can grow in fiscal '19? And if so, why? Thank you.","Tarek Robbiati","Right. So with respect to the operational services orders, in Q4 they were down as we pulled through some of those orders into Q3. In the course of the fiscal year '18 overall, OS services orders were up 2% as I mentioned in my script. Moving forward to fiscal year '19, Toni, the thing that one has to factor in is what Antonio said with respect to the categories of products that we\u2019re selling, they drive higher services attached. We do expect continues growth in OS services in fiscal year '19 as a result of a shift in the category mix that we are driving right now with our strategy.","Antonio Neri","Yes, Toni, another point I want to make is that units is one thing, but also remember the operational services ratio of the, what we call, the intensity rate is a percentage or a correlation to the average unit price of the unit. So you can just use units, right. You have to use the penetration rate and intensity rate associated with that. And as AUP goes up, the reality on the compute side, the reality is that you\u2019re supporting more components in that platform. Therefore the services component of that goes with it as the ratio. So that\u2019s why we are confident that in 2018 our operational services orders or the bookings will continue to grow as we continue to shift through a more blocks of IP, which is value-oriented.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Toni. Can we go on to the next question, please.","Operator","Yes. Next question will be from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.","Shannon Cross","Thank you very much. I want to talk a bit about operating cash flow and free cash flow. Both AP as well as AR were uses of cash benefit from inventory. If you can just talk a bit about some of the moves there. And then how we should think about fiscal 2019? I know you reiterated your guidance, but maybe if you can provide some reminders about what's nonrecurring that hit this year that gives you comfort and the higher guidance for next year or the growth next year?","Tarek Robbiati","So you can refer to the presentation and specifically on Slide 11 with respect to the operating cash flow trends versus the total free cash flow trends. The one thing that you wanted me to comment on is the role of inventory in the quarter. We have sold more of our own manufactured products and that's why when you calculate the impact of free cash flow you have to factor in the movement in inventory. The growth in overall operating free cash flow is very, very tangible and the best way to see the sources out for the growth in operating free cash flow is to look at the margin expansion in our operating profits between the first quarter '18 versus the fourth quarter '18 exit. You can observe, for example, that the first quarter '18 we finished OP at $593 million and whereas, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '18 we exit with close to $800 million in operating profit. That was standing behind the growth in overall free cash flow. That is sustainable. That is what is being driven by the HPE Next program. And we keep a tight lid on the benefits and run rate benefits that HP in excess delivered to us. And this is what stands behind the growth that we foreshadowed at SAM in October 2018 for fiscal year '19 and beyond. With respect to the nonrecurring item on free cash flow, there will be more of that in the 10-K that we will file in the upcoming days, but suffice to say that there are recurring charges in the amount of $531 million that we took for the full-year. Some IT costs, some consulting fees that were one offs and other nonrecurring charges, a total of which is about $800 million give or take you'll see all that breakdown in the 10-K that we will file in the upcoming two weeks.","Antonio Neri","I will say, Shannon, I mean, we\u2019re very confident about our '19 and '20 guidance as you recall at the Security Analyst meeting we said we\u2019re going to grow 50% free cash flow between '18 and '19, and we\u2019re going to double it by 2020. And that\u2019s because all the leverage that we get through HP Next, the portfolio mix shift, that we talked about it and I will say we have executed and exactly where we committed a year-ago and this year has been really good from that vantage point.","Shannon Cross","Thank you. And then can you just talk a bit more about China and some of the pressure you\u2019re seeing there? I'm curious if the declines we saw this quarter on year-over-year basis sort of give us an idea of the magnitude of what you're walking away from to the foreseeable future or what specifically is going on there as you walk later on profitable contracts? Thank you\/","Tarek Robbiati","Yes, so let's remind our self with a model for us is in China. We have a joint venture, although we own only 49% of that joint venture and we resell our products through H3C or the new H3C, while the new H3C which is a company that we actually sold to the unit group, couple of years ago. And so they make their own choices right. So they\u2019re trying to balance profitability and growth and there were demand in certain areas of the portfolio including hyperscale as they decided not to participate. So from that perspective, we are actually kind of an [indiscernible], if you will. We just sell through them and they make their own choices. So we work with them on an ongoing basis, because ultimately they are the ones that make those decisions.","Andrew Simanek","Perfect. Thanks, Shannon. Can we move to next question please.","Operator","Yes. Next question will be from Paul Coster with JP Morgan. Pleases go ahead.","Paul Coster","Thank you. I wonder if you can just give us a little bit color on the Edge compute growth trajectory, but it's something else. And do you see any cross selling, some synergies with your broader Hybrid IT offerings?","Tarek Robbiati","Yes, so the Edge Compute business is growing significantly. This driven by the used cases in specific verticals. We see that the manufacturing that the hospitals as the IoT part of this in the convergence of both the OT, operational technology in IT becomes a reality that's a big advantage that we have. We are one, the only vendors that have a true converge OT and IT platform. And I can tell you it's growing triple digits. And obviously, we expect that to continue to be the case. But more and more is a vertical solution, top to bottom from infrastructure to software to analytics to connectivity and security. And that\u2019s why the combination of Aruba with networking, connectivity, and security with an Edge Compute allows us to provide a full blown solutions for customers. So that that\u2019s what we see at this point in time. And definitely there are dissynergy because all the large deals that we see with Aruba are the reasons that have been through our cross synergy and our go-to-market with Hybrid IT. More and more, we sell an edge to cloud architecture. We sell the campus and branch solutions with Aruba. In verticals we sell Edge Compute and then we sell the cloud. The cloud -- call it on-premises or hybrid, if you will. And in that context, we see the whole pull through. A great example of this is the announcement I made with the Golden State Warriors, although we do it the Formula 1 just to bring it to reality. We provide them the cloud for the factory. We provide them the edge, the circuit and so in other use cases. So it's a big opportunity and its all driven by this experience we need to provide with the edge and the fact you need to extract value and deliver outcomes from the data that generate at the core. And so that\u2019s why I'm very excited about our strategy.","Paul Coster","Are there any special incentives around the data center products inside that Intelligent Edge team?","Antonio Neri","Yes. So there's a -- definitely there's a compensation that the account manager sells everything. They get paid on selling the full blown solution. And then obviously while you bring the specialist, they\u2019re paid on the specific components of it. But the reality it is cross incentives that goes back and forth, but let's be clear. The edge people are just the specialist people. Really the people who bring to bear the solution and the Hybrid IT people sell everything, edge to cloud. And so, that\u2019s why the strategy is working and more and more pull through for Aruba is happening and the same the other way around, because once you have connectivity, you have to do some sort of processing of data and that\u2019s why we bring the Edge Compute to bear.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thank you, Paul. Next question please.","Operator","Yes. The next question will be from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. In your prepared comments, you made a reference to some efforts in China that I believe impacted your margins a little bit. Can you just give us some color on what's going on with your efforts there and the margins and the outlook, especially as it relates to who knows what's going to happen with trade wars and stuff, and does this relate at all to H3C, which historically we\u2019ve known or is it something different? Thank you.","Antonio Neri","Yes, no, so again, we don't sell directly in China. We actually moved to this new model almost 3 years ago now and H3C is the sole distributor of HPE products and they represent us in China, but they\u2019re sold as a part of the HPC portfolio and what we are doing like they\u2019re doing is focus on profitable growth. As they focus on the entire portfolio, they pick and choose where they believe is the best thing to do and we\u2019re very happy actually, incredibly happy with the performance of H3C, because as you know we collect dividends and they\u2019ve done really well performance wise.","Jim Suva","Yes, what I was getting was more forward-looking is, what you've seen going on is that something we should expect into 2019 or is it a new change from what we\u2019ve heard in the past?","Antonio Neri","No, I think it continues 2019, and honestly, listen, China is the second largest IT market now. There are a lot of opportunities, but you\u2019ve to be very focused on where to spend your energy to drive profitable growth, and they\u2019re the ones that make those decisions.","As you recall, we\u2019ve actually rights in the governance, because obviously, we are a part of the Board, but the reality is that that market will continue to grow. Then, there will be some seasonality viability quarter-to-quarter depending on the pipeline, but in the end, we believe China is a great market going forward, and we rely on them and very happy with what they are doing.","Jim Suva","And just housekeeping, tax rate was lower this quarter, and other income was better, how should we think about for 2019, those items?","Andrew Simanek","Hey Jim, so I would refer you to what we said at the Security Analyst meeting. We basically guided other income and expense at a $250 million expense that includes the equity interest. And then if you remember, the tax rate, we basically said from a non-GAAP perspective would be 13%. So I would continue to use those going forward.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for the details and clarifications. It's greatly appreciated.","Andrew Simanek","Sure, thanks, Jim. Next question, please.","Operator","Next question would be from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Jeff Kvaal","Yes. Thank you, gentlemen, for taking the question. I would like to lead off with an Aruba question. Obviously, that's been a source of great strength, both naturally and also some upside. Can you talk a little bit about where you think that strength is coming from? Obviously, there's a decent amount of good IT spending, there's a little bit of a switch refresh under way from your competitors. Does that help and then how much is share gain a factor there? And then, secondly, Tarek, maybe for you, but I think you had mentioned earlier in the script that the FX headwinds had stiffened a little bit for you over the course of the quarter. That doesn't appear to have changed your guidance at all and I'm wondering if you could talk us through that, please.","Antonio Neri","Sure. I will take the first question and then Tarek will take the second one. So we continue to see strength in the Aruba business because the reality is the edge is where we live and work and everybody is looking for providing a whole different experience and the mobile first, cloud first approach that Aruba has is actually resonating with customers and allows them to provide these new experiences whereas in hospitals or venues or retail verticals they are looking to provide that connectivity with an application experience that collects data and obviously extracts value out of that data and Aruba is perfectly suited for that because it has a platform driven approach. And that drives switching, it drives the new architecture for wireless connectivity with Wi-Fi 6 that's going to be available here soon and obviously the expansion in through these IoT-led use cases, for example, smart buildings and so forth. That\u2019s why we are so bullish about the business and then when you bring Edge Compute to that platform, then you add incremental capabilities because it is easier to move cloud compute where the data is, not the other way around. That\u2019s what we see and it's all experience driven and architecture we have actually enabled that.","Tarek Robbiati","Yes, on FX, good observation. the FX rates have moved somewhat unfavorably relative to the prior month when we were at SAM. When we were at SAM the Euro was trading at about $1.15, and now the new spot rates are pointing to $1.13 trending a little bit lower. Remember, then we said we would face a headwind of one to two points, now it's going to be looking closer to two points for fiscal year '19. That's what we can say at this stage given where the rates are trending.","Jeff Kvaal","But Tarek \u2026","Tarek Robbiati","[Indiscernible]. We can change.","Jeff Kvaal","All right. Great. Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Next question will be from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Rod Hall","Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to ask a question about the cash flow. I see that the proceeds from the sale of PP&E almost more or less doubled in the quarter off of last quarter. And I wonder if you could give us any color on what drove that increase and then I have a follow-up to that.","Tarek Robbiati","Yes, that is correct. We did have quite a unique transaction during the course of the quarter. There was a -- overall in the year, there's about $400 million of real estate gains and most of which happened in Q4. We effectively sold the campus that we occupy right now in Palo Alto and we're moving into a new location during the course of fiscal year '19, at the beginning of the calendar year of '19. You will see all of that explained and disclosed in our 10-K for greater details, but that's a one-off. We will continue to optimize our real estate, but that is quite a unique transaction that has happened in the fourth quarter.","Rod Hall","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on that, I wanted to -- I know that the underlying business there is -- or at least a lot of that is the leasing business, and I know some of that is HPQ related leasing and I wondered if you could say, what proportion of that leasing business in the financial services arm is related to HPQ and how much is HPE, I just don't really know the split between the two things.","Tarek Robbiati","We don't disclose the split of the receivables in financial services between HPE and HPQ, but it has been trending around at the same levels that historical data prior to the split. There hasn't been any major change in that regard, we continue to drive significant growth in volume. We pointed to 8% volume growth in financial services of this year and I am very pleased with how that is going.","Rod Hall","Okay, great. Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Thanks, Rod. I think we\u2019ve got time for one more question, please.","Operator","All right. And our last question today will be from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Amit Daryanani","Thanks for squeezing me in guys. I guess the two questions will be one on storage. Was that 13% year-over-year that's fairly impressive. Can you just talk about what enabled that and how do you think that trends going forward through fiscal '19? And then secondly on Pointnext, I think it was down 3% year-over-year. How much would it be down or what are the extra divestitures, [geos] that you\u2019re exiting from on Pointnext?","Antonio Neri","Yes, let me talk about storage first. Listen, I'm very pleased with our performance in fiscal year '18. We grew 8 -- 13% for the full-year, which is faster than the market, so we expect to gain share in external storage and that's driven by a cohesive strategy with both Nimble and 3PAR enabled by a phenomenal platform called HPE InfoSight, which provides predictive analytics for storing and managing that data. And last week I announced that we're extending that platform now to the rest of the on-premises infrastructure including both compute and networking. The customer sees the value of predictive analytics, fix the problems before they happen and obviously now we keep adding features to both the InfoSight and the two platforms both Nimble and 3PAR with the availability of new flash storage and so forth. If you are the hyperconverge part of that on top of storage, well, actually we will be growing almost 20%, 19% and so the combination of different infrastructure for different use cases plus our intellectual property is paying off. And again, we expect that to continue to be the case in 2019 and beyond because we\u2019ve some exciting solutions that are coming to market, and some of them we announced it last week at HPE Discover in Madrid. I don't know, Tarek, you want to talk about the Pointnext question?","Tarek Robbiati","Yes, if to add a little bit more color on revenue for Pointnext in the quarter, revenue from operating services was down 1% overall for the full-year it was growing at 2% equally orders for the full-year were growing at 2% and that was reflected in my script as well.","Amit Daryanani","Perfect. Thank you.","Andrew Simanek","Great. Thanks Amit. I think with that we can close up the call, please.","Antonio Neri","Well, thank you for the time and thank you for the questions and I just want to wrap by saying I\u2019m very pleased with fiscal year '18 performance with our growth and expanding profitability and our innovation. I think we make great progress as we transition, and this was all 100% execution driven. 100% of what we did here was about executing our strategy which is clear, and resonating with our customers and partners.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our call for today.

So let\u2019s dive right in.","Overall, I am very pleased with our Q3 performance. We saw strong momentum across key segments of the portfolio. Execution continued to improve and our profitability increased over last quarter as we reduced costs across the organization and we successfully closed the spin merge of our software business late last week. With that milestone behind us, we are off and running. ","In Q3, we delivered total revenue of $8.2 billion which includes a final full quarter of revenue contribution from software. Future HPE, which now consists of Enterprise Group and Financial Services was $7.5 billion, up 6% year-over-year and if you remove tier-1 revenue was up 10%. From a profitability perspective, we made good progress on improving our operating margins as we began executing the cost reduction plan we outlined last quarter. ","Tim will provide more detail, but our EG margin improved sequentially to 9.3% as we work to mitigate increased commodity prices, stranded costs from divestitures and dilution from acquisitions. We expect to see even greater improvement next quarter. With the strong revenue performance and improved profitability we were able to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.30 above our previously provided outlook of $0.24 to $0.28 per share.","Free cash flow was also strong at over $400 million in the quarter putting us in a good position to achieve our full year outlook. ","Turning to the business performance, while we have seen some improvement in the market overall, our strong Q3 performance was driven primarily by better execution and a compelling portfolio resulting in solid growth across key businesses. For example, core server revenue was up 13% year-over-year and we expect to gain share in calendar Q2.","Since its launch, late last year, Synergy is experiencing very strong momentum with over 600 customers to-date. As a side benefit we are also seeing an uptick in blade sales as customers move on to the path to become Synergy ready. We are also experiencing continued strength in High Performance Compute with our combined HPE and SGI portfolio. ","And early this summer we launched the first fully integrated HPE SimpliVity hyper converged offering. Hyper converged is core to our strategy of making hybrid IT simple for our customers and we saw over 200% growth in Q3 although off a small base.","All-Flash storage grew 30% year-over-year driven by Nimble, which exceeded both revenue and profit plans for the quarter. With Nimble and our marketing-leading 3PAR portfolio, HPE delivers a full range of superior flash storage solutions for customers across every segment. We are already seeing the benefits of the combination of Nimble and HPE and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the potential.","Aruba continues to perform exceptionally well. Wireless LAN solutions grew over 30% in the quarter and Aruba won approximately 70 new logos. Aruba continues to take share from competitors like CISCO by introducing truly breakthrough solutions for the intelligent edge. For example, in June, Aruba announced a fundamentally new core aggregation switch called Aruba 8400. ","This differentiated solution has a completely redesigned operating system to support the new requirements of modern networks. It enables simplified operations for the network operator, a more powerful and scalable core to support the influx of data, faster time to remediate issues and granular visibility into what\u2019s in the network. ","We estimate the market for this technology is nearly $4 billion and technology services which includes Pointnext continued to perform well with Q3 revenue up 2% over last year. We\u2019ve now seen five consecutive quarters of order and revenue growth in consulting as we put more emphasis on advisory and transformed services post the ES split.","To further strengthen our consulting capabilities, just this morning we announced our intent to acquire Cloud Technology Partners, a leading cloud consulting company that helps its Fortune 500 customers move to a cloud, build new cloud-based solutions and manage their cloud environment. CTP\u2019s consulting, design and operational advisory services for cloud environments will strengthen our hybrid IT consulting expertise in a fast-growing market.","As I mentioned earlier, while executing our business plan for the quarter, we also completed a major milestone. On Friday, we officially closed the spin-off and merger of our software business with Micro Focus on time and below budget. This deal delivered approximately $9 billion in value and I am confident that this was a great move for the new Micro Focus and for HPE.","With that transaction now behind us, we have the right strategy and the right portfolio to succeed in today\u2019s environment. Our strategy is clear, to make hybrid IT simple, to power the intelligent edge and to provide the services to make it all happen. It is based on what customers are asking for today and where we see the market moving. ","Now as a smaller organization with fewer lines of business and clear strategic priorities, we have the opportunity to create an internal structure and operating model that is simpler, nimbler and faster. To that end, this quarter we announced a program we are calling HPE Next. The goal of HPE Next is to produce an organization that is precisely built to compete and win in the marketplace.","To do so, we are clean sheeting the operating model and organization structure to simplify how we work. We are improving core business processes to clarify accountabilities and make the company more efficient and effective. We are rightsizing the end-to-end cost structure to ensure we deliver on our financial architecture. ","All of this will be done with a continued commitment to operational excellence and to our customers. These efforts will simplify everything from how we engage with customers to how we process orders and compensate sales. For example we are reducing the layers in our customer-facing organizations and shifting resources to the geographic markets that will drive the vast majority of our business. ","These changes will be better for HPE and for our customers. We will have much more detail on this program and the associated financial impact at our Security Analyst Meeting in October. But as discussed on previous calls, we do expect to accelerate most of the $200 million of cash payments originally planned for fiscal year 2018 into Q4 2017 to help quickly enable this program. ","Looking forward, we aim to offset a portion of the funding requirements associated with HPE Next through lower than expected separation costs and real estate sales enabled by the spin merge transactions completed this year. For example, we recently sold our Roseville site for approximately $100 million and are now leasing back smaller offices there.","Ultimately, HPE Next will produce the long-term operating and financial blueprint for our company with cost discipline built into the system. While we work to create the strong internal structure, we cannot lose sight of innovation. Innovation is our life blood and the investments we make now will drive HPE in the future. Our innovation is at the core of some of the most significant technology trends in the market today like cyber security, internet of things and artificial intelligence.","And today, more than ever, we are able to make focused investments in the areas where we see the most opportunity for growth in the future. For example, security has become a board level issue for customers across industries and market segments. In June, we announced the world\u2019s most secured industry standard server. HPE is the only company that embeds proprietary silicon-based security into its industry standard servers. ","This approach addresses firmware attacks, which are one of the biggest threats facing enterprises and governments today. We are also integrating the behavioral analytics based security software from our recent acquisition Niara, across Aruba\u2019s networking portfolio. ","In the internet of things and in particularly the industrial internet of things, we see a tremendous opportunity as customers are looking to transform everything from retail environments to manufacturing floors.","Our solutions and services capabilities are allowing customers to connect, monitor and analyze these environments, enable new customer experiences, new revenue streams and reduced cost structures. We are already seeing growth in our Aruba Wireless Connectivity business driven by IOT and we are seeing significant emerging interest in our highly differentiated edge compute business known as Edgeline driven by these same trends.","Another example is artificial intelligence, which is transforming industries from retail to manufacturing. We help our customers use AI to simplify operations and drive business outcomes in a number of ways. ","For example, we are incorporating Nimble\u2019s predictive analytics technology that uses machine learning to predict and resolve performance issues across our storage portfolio. Also our High Performance Compute systems provide the power that is required to crunch the massive amount of data used for AI applications.","As the amount of data grows, we have a strong roadmap to memory-driven computing based on our machine research project that will exponentially extend these capabilities in the future. ","Finally, there is one commonality our customers have, it\u2019s that they live in a hybrid IT world. They run a mix of workloads in their datacenter as well as private, managed and public clouds. Our top priority is to help them succeed in this environment and that requires a single data management plan across different environments. ","At Discover we unveiled our vision for our new hybrid IT stack which brings together our industry-leading one view platform with a new multi-cloud management capability as well as key software assets like Cloud Cruiser to create a truly unique, software-defined approach to hybrid IT management. This new platform will allow customers to simply manage assets across traditional IT, private cloud, managed and public clouds and optimize their right mix of hybrid IT.","We already have a number of beta customers and this platform will be widely available by the end of the year. So, overall, I am very pleased with the quarter and we now have achieved most of our significant milestones for the year. While we have more work to do, I continue to be excited about the future of HPE. The markets where we play today offer tremendous opportunity and with laser focus and a world-class portfolio we are positioned to win. ","We will have a lot more to tell you at our Security Analyst Meeting on October 18 in San Francisco. Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to quickly touch on the devastation we are seeing in Texas caused by Hurricane Harvey. HPE has been part of the Houston community for decades and our nearly 3400 employees are deeply rooted in that community. ","The well-being of our employees and their families has been our top concern over the past week and we are providing support to many of them. From a business perspective, we are continuing to assess the impact. But Tim will provide a bit more color on that. I want to thank our amazing team in Houston who has been working around the clock to get our office back up at running, answer customer enquiries and make sure their colleagues have the support they need. So thank you to them. ","And with that, I will turn it over to Tim. ","Tim Stonesifer","Thanks Meg. Performance in Q3 was strong with solid revenue growth and sequential operating margin improvement in line with our expectations. We achieved better than expected cost savings from the plan we described last quarter with more improvement expected to come next quarter. ","Total revenue for the quarter was $8.2 billion. This includes a full quarter of software which going forward will be accounted for in discontinued operations. Revenue from Future HPE was $7.5 billion, up 6% adjusted for divestitures and currency and up over 10% excluding Tier-1 server sales. I\u2019ll dive into the business segment performance in a minute.","From a macro perspective, we are seeing some overall improvement in the market, but continue to see competitive pricing in a challenging commodities environment. Currency remained unfavorable, but to a lesser extent than prior quarters with a 70 basis point year-over-year headwind to revenue in Q3. HPE\u2019s performance in the U.S. excluding Tier-1 improved as core servers returned to growth and networking performance accelerated but storage remain challenged. Revenue in Europe has also returned to growth with strong results in Germany and broad stabilization across Western Europe. Asia Pacific similarly improved with double-digit growth in Japan, China and India. ","Turning to margins, gross margin of 33% was down 340 basis points year-over-year and down 80 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.4% was down 150 basis points year-over-year but up 60 basis points sequentially. ","As mentioned, we are seeing the initial results of our second half cost savings plan with sequential improvement in EG margins. However, we continue to be negatively impacted by a challenging pricing environment, commodities costs, and to a lesser extent currency. We also had a full quarter impact from strategy costs and short-term dilution from recent acquisitions but we are making good progress and still expect both to be eliminated by year end.","Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.30 is above our previous outlook of $0.24 to $0.28 primarily due to cost savings, software performance and favorable other income and expense. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes pretax amounts for our separation charges of $190 million, restructuring charges of $165 million, and amortization of intangible assets of $132 million.","GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.10 above our previously provided outlook range of negative $0.02 to $0.02 primarily due to an enterprise services spin merger-related non-cash income tax benefit. ","Now turning to the results by business. In the Enterprise Group, revenue was up 3% as the go to market changes we made at the beginning of the year combined with recent product rollouts more than offset pressure from a competitive market. EG revenue grew over 9% year-over-year excluding tier-1 server sales with strong growth in ISS Core, Aruba, and All-Flash storage.","Operating margins were down 350 basis points year-over-year. However they improved 50 basis points sequentially to 9.3%. The sequential margin improvement is in line with the cost savings plan we outlined on the Q2 earnings call, which call for savings of $200 million to $300 million in the second half of the year.","Server revenue was flat and grew 12% excluding tier-1, thanks to better execution, easier comparison of the prior year and some improvement in the overall market. We also have strong portfolio in the growing and more profitable areas of the market. High Performance Compute grew more than 40% with SGI and over 10% organically. And synergies momentum is generating strong pull through for blades that were up double-digits. ","We are also seeing good traction in hyper converge that grew triple digits. Storage revenue was up 11% driven by the Nimble acquisition, offset by continued challenging markets. All-Flash arrays grew 30% year-over-year primarily driven by the Nimble acquisition, which is performing ahead of expectations. We continue to expect NAND supply constraints through the end of the year but they have started to moderate. ","3PAR revenue declined 9% due to a more competitive market in the U.S. Networking revenue grew 16% driven by Aruba Wireless Solutions which grew over 30%. We are also seeing Aruba lead to strong pull through of wired switching that grew mid single-digits demonstrating the combined strength of Aruba and HPE. Networking is now seeing growth across all product groups and geographies. Technology services grew revenue for the fifth consecutive quarter, up 2% year-over-year. ","While overall orders were down slightly, we continue to improve service intensity or attach dollars per unit which help offset pressure from declining hardware unit sales. HPE Financial Services revenue grew 10%, its fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth driven by lease conversions and an increase in operating lease mix.","Financing volume however declined 8% due to lower indirect business. Operating profit declined 210 basis points year-over-year to 7.8% reflecting one-time items and the increased operating lease mix. We continue to see the strategic importance of financial services to our customers as flexible consumption pricing models gain momentum.","Software revenue was down 1% as growth in licenses and SaaS was offset by declines in professional services with more emphasis on higher margin products. The operating margin was 24.9%, a 710 basis point improvement year-over-year. ","Looking back at the quarter, I am pleased with the business performance and believe we have a strong portfolio of solutions and services that\u2019s clearly gaining traction with customers. Increasingly, we are seeing customers turn to us for a comprehensive IT strategy from hybrid IT to the campus to services. For example, last month, we announced a new project with NASA focused on developing a supercomputer that can withstand the harsh conditions of space. ","We also recently announced that HPE has been selected as the official IT networking and wireless infrastructure partner for the Tottenham Hotspur Football Club\u2019s new state-of-the-art stadium being built in London. And Point Next continues to add logos from around the world including Siemens, Travelers and Saudi Telecom Company in Q3. Overall, we feel good about the momentum we are seeing and the opportunity ahead. ","Now to cash flow. Free cash flow was better than expected at $428 million benefiting from continued improvement and working capital management and favorable CapEx. The cash conversion cycle was down five days sequentially to negative 17 days. Capital allocation during the quarter included $107 million in dividend payments and $625 million of share repurchases. ","We\u2019ve now returned $2.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date and are on track to fulfill our full year commitment of $3 billion. ","Moving to our software spin merge transaction, we completed the software spin on September 1 on schedule and under budget. We continue to make progress moving stranded costs and remain confident will eliminate all costs on a run rate basis by the end of the fiscal year. ","Turning to our outlook, as the software transaction is now complete, consistent with prior divestitures, the fiscal 2017 earnings outlook will no longer include software for the last two months of the year. As a reminder, the impact of removing two months of software from the full year fiscal year 2017 earnings outlook is $0.13 including $0.12 of earnings contribution and $0.01 of stranded costs. With that, we expect to finish fiscal year 2017 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.40. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be negative $0.11 to negative $0.07.","Please note that our outlook does not include a likely material, non-cash tax benefit associated with potential corporate tax reform. We expect to undertake tax planning actions next quarter and are still working through the details, but we expect them to result in a material benefit to our Q4 2017 and fiscal 2017 tax rate. ","Also, as Meg mentioned, Hurricane Harvey has had a substantial impact to our Houston operations. Our top priority has been ensuring the well-being of our employees during this challenging time. From a business perspective, we are continuing to assess the impact. Fortunately, we have a limited amount of production in Houston which we\u2019ve been able mostly shift to other locations. So we don\u2019t expect the disruption to our customer deliveries. ","Of course, we will bear uninsured cost associated with lost inventory or repairs to our campus, but have not incorporated anything into our outlook at this time. ","Finally, turning to the cash flow outlook. Year-to-date free cash flow was almost equal to our full year target. However, Q4 cash flow will likely be lower than in prior years due to less seasonal earnings uplift following the software and ES divestitures and the additional restructuring charges were accelerating from fiscal year 2018. ","As a result, we are maintaining our full year fiscal year 2017 free cash flow outlook of negative $1.8 billion, but do acknowledge there could be some upside. Additionally, we\u2019ll need to make payments for previously agreed upon balance sheet adjustments to DXE and Micro Focus that are still being finalized but still expect to end the year with an operating company net cash balance of approximately $6.5 billion.","Before we turn to questions, I wanted to briefly address a few topics which may provide helpful context going into our October 18th Analyst Day. First, we gave a view of fiscal year 2017 Future HPE earnings during our last Analyst Day of $1.25 to $1.35. ","However this did not account for $0.06 of stranded costs and the first quarter earnings takedown for currency and DRAM pricing of $0.12. Those two items will bring the fiscal year 2017 outlook midpoint down to $1.12. We\u2019ve also seen further commodity pressure, a more competitive pricing environment and some dilution from M&A that reduced of fiscal year 2017 outlook for Future HPE closer to just over $1. ","Second, we are in the process of settling outstanding tax disputes that have already been reserved against but will result in approximately $300 million of cash payments in fiscal year 2018 that we think can be partially recovered through foreign tax credits and future years. ","And lastly, with regard to the HPE Next program Meg discussed, I want to provide some additional color on high level expected savings before we provide the full details at our Analyst Day. Based on our current assessment, we are committed to $1.5 billion of gross savings over the next three years. Keep in mind that this is a gross savings number and the net savings could be impacted by incremental investments, ongoing commodity pressure and a continued competitive pricing environment.","We are still working out the funding requirements for HPE Next, but we expect to partially offset any cash cost with real estate sales including the Roseville site completed this quarter and lower than expected separation costs. While we\u2019ll provide more details about the HPE Next initiative at our upcoming Analyst Day, it\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do and we\u2019ll achieve a very attractive return on the required investment.","Overall, like Meg, I am very pleased with the progress made this quarter and I am confident that our plan is the right long-term strategy to position us for success. I look forward to discussing the future of HPE at our upcoming Analyst Day. ","Now let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Katy Huberty ","Thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to start with a clarification, Tim and make sure I understand your commentary around fiscal 2017 [indiscernible] earnings. So the way I read it is $1 of earnings in fiscal 2017. If you back out software and services, and so we should think about growing off of that base by some amount in fiscal 2018, is that right?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, that\u2019s correct. I mean, if you take into account the stranded cost, the $0.12 take down, obviously we have some short-term dilution that we\u2019ve been talking about these recent acquisitions and then we continue to see commodity pressure in a very competitive pricing environment, the combination of those four things takes it down to about $1 by the end of the year. ","Katy Huberty ","Okay, great. And then, just a question as well, how much of the $200 million to $300 million of savings were you able to capture in the third quarter? And on the same lines, have you been able to pass through some of the higher component costs in the third quarter versus what you saw in the second quarter?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, let me start with the $200 million to $300 million, so last quarter, when we announced that we thought roughly a third of that would happen in Q3 and two-thirds of that would happen in Q4. I just say we are tracking ahead of schedule. I mean, when I look at all the metrics, whether it be travel as an example is down 21%, if I look at contractor headcount, down 14%, rehire rates so how many jobs we fill, which is typically something very difficult for our leadership team to do because obviously there is a lot of work that needs to be done, that\u2019s roughly half of what it was last year. So, we are seeing very good progress there. Like I said, I\u2019d say more than a third is hitting in Q3 and we are confident that we\u2019ll get the rest in Q4. ","As far as the pricing components, we still see a very competitive environment out there, particularly in the U.S. So that is something we are not passing though as much as we like. Again, longer term, we think that we\u2019ll be able to pass this pricing, the commodity cost pressure through, because as an industry, I think folks are going to need to make money. But we are not gaining the traction that we had anticipated and that\u2019s why you are seeing the pressure. ","Katy Huberty ","Thank you.","Andy Simanek","Great, thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Toni Sacconaghi ","Yes, thank you. I have a question and a follow-up. I think your guidance for fiscal Q4 implies enterprise group operating margins at around 11%. I think at Discover, Meg you had commented on EG margins rebounding to similar levels as last year or 12% or 13%. Has your outlook for the recovery in Q4 changed over the last three months? And can you help address that apparent disparity?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, sure, I mean, first of all, let me start with Q3 and we were pleased to see that margins were up 50 basis points sequentially. Again, a lot of that was driven by the cost savings that we had laid out on the 2Q call offsetting the pressure that we\u2019re sitting from a full quarter of stranded cost as an example in ES along with the short-term dilution. ","So, as I look into Q4, I would expect those margins to improve. As we get more cost savings in Q4, as compared to Q3 although not as much as we had expected that\u2019s certainly going to be helpful from a margin perspective. ","As you will know, Toni, if you just look at seasonality in EG if you look at the last couple of years, we do see a - fourth quarter is our most profitable quarter. So we should expect to see that same type of lift in Q4 of this year and again as we continue to eliminate the stranded costs and the short-term dilution as we right-size the cost envelopes of those acquisitions that will drive some margin improvement as well. ","But, to your question, I would expect to see those margins at the end of Q4 to be closer to 11% and the primary reason is we continue to see commodity cost pressure. I mean, if you just look at memory as an example, we are still up another 5% or 10% versus last quarter. And again, we are not getting the pricing traction that we had anticipated and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the incremental pressure. ","Toni Sacconaghi ","Thank you.","Meg Whitman","And adding to that Toni, I think we can return to historic levels in 2018 but we are going to be probably a quarter or so delayed and we\u2019ll see what happens in commodity pricing and those other things, but I also think HPE Next will certainly help.","Toni Sacconaghi ","And then, just to follow-up, Meg, I was wondering if you could maybe clear the air on your commitment to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. There is obviously a lot of press, speculation about you are potentially accepting a role at Uber as CEO you had made statements saying that you are remaining at HPE. I was wondering if you could just clear the air on the apparent reporting discrepancies in your statements and where do you stand in terms of your commitment to HPE? Thank you.","Meg Whitman","Yes, sure. There has been some press. So, listen, I thought, I was called in very late in the Uber search and I thought it was a very interesting business model to me. It\u2019s actually quite similar to Ebay in many ways. It\u2019s very disruptive, that relies on a community of drivers just like Ebay relies on a community of sellers and the growth prospects reminded me of Ebay in its early days and as you know, I am also an investor in Uber and \u2013 but, in the end that wasn\u2019t the right thing. ","And but I would say, that has really nothing to do with HPE which is quite special in its own right and we have a very focused strategy and a path forward to build a very big business on what I think is a quite compelling strategy, hybrid IT, edge computing, IOT and much more. And we also have a remarkable customer base and partner base. ","So, the other thing is I have dedicated the last six years of my life to this company and there is more work to do and I am here to help make this company successful and I am excited about the new strategy. So, lots more work to do and I actually am not going anywhere. ","Toni Sacconaghi ","Thank you. ","Andy Simanek","Great. Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","And our next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Sherri Scribner ","Hi, thank you. I am sure you will talk about this at the Analyst Day, but when we think about potential fiscal 2018 earnings through the business now, clearly we\u2019ve got somewhere around $1 in earnings this year for the remaining business. And when we think about things like stranded costs and higher commodity costs it seems like those things probably should abate to some extent next year. ","So I guess, I am trying to understand how much of that are you expecting to abate, I think Meg just said, DRAM and commodity cost probably improve in fiscal 2018 but maybe it takes a quarter longer. Stranded costs should go away, should we be able to add at least some of that to that dollar number in fiscal 2018?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, fair question and we will certainly give you plenty of detail and the security analysts meeting. But just to help you frame it up, we should see some significant uplift from an EPS perspective in 2018 and let me just start with the tailwinds that we should see. So to your point, stranded costs and also the short-term dilution from those, the recent M&A deals that should come back and provide some tailwind for us in 2018 and you guys can quantify that based off of the color we have given. ","The other thing that we should see some headwinds, although I am a little bit hesitant is foreign exchange. I mean, if rates stay where they are today and hold, then that would certainly provide some tailwinds for us. Now we\u2019ll have to see what happens at the beginning of the year, but as I said, if they hold where they are today, that should provide some uplift. ","Obviously, we are excited about HPE Next. We think that\u2019s going to yield some significant savings. Now we\u2019ll have to figure out the difference between the gross and the net, but overall, that should be positive. And then we should see some benefit from the lower share count. So those are all the positives we have going into the year. ","As far as some of the pressure points that we\u2019ll continue to see, although DRAM may soften a little bit, just keep in mind, we are going to have a full year impact of that versus what we had this year. So we do expect that to be a significant pressure point going into 2018, when you compare year-over-year, I mean, DRAM cost will be roughly double. ","We are expecting and we will see what happens but we continue to expect to see a very difficult pricing environment. We are not anticipating that easing up in the near term. So that would provide some pressure and then we are obviously going to continue to invest in the business. But, net-net, hopefully that helps you frame it up, but given the positives and the negatives, we would certainly expect to see a significant uplift in 2018. ","Sherri Scribner ","Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up. Can you maybe provide some additional detail on the strength that you saw in the server business? It seems that was much better than expected and it sounded like from your commentary that that was more specific to HP and that you gained share. But maybe some additional detail would be helpful. Thank you.","Meg Whitman","Yes, I\u2019ll take that and Tim can follow on. So, the results were quite a bit better in servers. Flat overall, but grew 12% to 13% excluding tier-1. And I\u2019d say there is a couple of things going on. One is better execution, particularly in Americas, but actually across the board. And I think that execution will continue and we expect as we said to gain a bit of share in the second quarter. ","There was also some improvement frankly in the overall market and in all \u2013 or easy compares in Q3 than they were in Q1 and Q2. But I also have to say the portfolio that we have worked hard to create that we have pivoted over the last couple of years, that is in faster growing more profitable areas in the markets is starting to kick in and you can see that in High Performance Compute, you can see it in synergies momentum that is not only, the actual product of Synergy, but it\u2019s actually accelerating the core blade business. ","We are also seeing good traction in hyper converge that grew triple digits, albeit off a small base. And then across Aruba continues to do very well. And interestingly on Aruba in the U.S. it reignited the wired networking business which was part of the thesis of the acquisition, but it\u2019s actually playing out very nicely in the United States. ","So, listen, I mean, I think the market is going to continue to be competitive. We are going to continue to face some headwinds from Tier-1s that was down versus Q3. But we are feeling much better about that core business and you really need to think about this as stabilizing the core transactional rack and tower business while we pivot the portfolio to higher margin and higher growth segments in the marketplace and that\u2019s working. ","The only thing I will say is what I\u2019ve learnt over the last six years in this business, there is always something that could happen here, whether it\u2019s floods in Thailand, floods in Houston, I mean, this is a remarkable situation that we face in Houston I have to say. And so, I feel good about our execution. I feel good about what we can control. ","Andy Simanek","Great. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Steve Milunovich ","Thank you. First question on CTP acquisition. It\u2019s quite interesting and I think a very, very good company, their primary business that I believe is trying to move on-premise customers to the cloud and particularly the AWS which is a kind of threat to your core business, but I guess you feel that having that as part of a services offering, helping customers with hybrid cloud is more important. ","Meg Whitman","So, listen a core part of our strategy is we make hybrid IT simple. And what CTP does very well is very consistent with our strategy which is what customers think to do is they just with their applications and their workloads. ","First, make sure that they\u2019ve got, they\u2019ve rationalized those workloads as fast as they \u2013 and as much as they can and then decide where each of those workloads should go based on a total cost of ownership and how they want to pay for it, whether it be on a consumption based pricing model or CapEx. ","So, that\u2019s what this team does and we will add our expertise on on-prem private cloud. We\u2019ll add our expertise in \u2013 because we do some of this today and it\u2019s an opportunity to scale that practice. But listen, there are some workloads that customers probably should move to a public cloud and you know Azure is our public cloud partner. ","We are excited about Azure\u2019s stack on-prem. We aim to be the leader in infrastructure behind Azure stack on-prem. And so we want to make sure that we help customers find their right mix of hybrid IT and this is a nice way to scale that business for us.","Steve Milunovich ","Thank you and then on the storage side, could you give us a sense of how much Nimble contributed to that revenue? I think you said 3PAR it was down, was it 9% year-over-year? Is that an effective Nimble at all? Because I think you separated where those two are going into the market. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see too much effect from Nimble on to 3PAR?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, I would just say, All-Flash in general was up about 30% and roughly 6% organically. We did see some pressure on 3PAR to your point, that\u2019s primarily, again, we are seeing a very competitive pricing environment particularly in the U.S. in storage in 3PAR. ","Steve Milunovich ","Thank you. ","Meg Whitman","Yes, listen, we are excited now about our storage portfolio. 3PAR plus Nimble, we get incremental scale, we get InfoSight which is obviously AI for the datacenter in the context of Nimble and I think one plus one here is going to equal more than two and we are really pleased, we are going to combine the R&D. ","We are combining the sales specialist teams. We are leveraging, I think the strengths of both companies to give us more scale particularly in the All-Flash segment in the market which is growing. And you will recall that only about 10% of datacenters have moved to All-Flash. So there is a lot of running room there and we are a leader in that marketplace and we aim to continue that trend.","Andy Simanek","Great. Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. ","Shannon Cross ","Thank you very much. I am sure you will get into in more detail at the Analyst Day. But can you talk a bit about your thoughts on cash and use of cash? Clearly, some will be used to fund the restructuring, but what are you thinking about in terms of acquisition strategy going forward and other ways to return cash to shareholders?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, Meg you can jump in here afterwards. I think we are going to continue to operate within the framework that we have and we are going to be very disciplined. It\u2019s going to be returns based and it\u2019s going to be sort of a three-legged stool. So we are going to continue to focus on organic investments, because when we do that well, and we do it right, it\u2019s good for customers, it\u2019s good for partners, it\u2019s good for shareholders. ","Think about All-Flash, think about Synergy and those types of things. Obviously, we are biased toward share repurchases right now. And then we\u2019ll also look at M&A. Again, M&A that\u2019s complementary IT that helps leverage our distribution where we can then blow out some profitable growth. So, I would expect this to continue to operate within that framework and like I said, we\u2019ll give some more color as we get into the Analyst Meeting in October. ","Shannon Cross ","Great. And then, I am just curious when I look at the cost reductions that you are talking about travel down 21%, contract is down 14%, how much of this is sort of recurring or can be continued and how much of it is just sort of a near term reduction in your spend? And I am just trying to figure out, does it make sense to travel down 21% to support the ongoing business or is this just sort of in the interim while you are getting HP Next in place?","Meg Whitman","Let me give you a little context on that. So listen, there is obviously some short-term cost reduction that we are doing. But I have to say what we have done to the $200 million to $300 million in Q3 and Q4, I do not think it\u2019s actually hurting the business. I think we are executing better than we were before and you can see that in our results. ","But as we move into HPE Next, it is a much broader initiative than sort of normal cost reduction. We are essentially rearchitecting the company to be precisely built to compete and win in our markets and we are actually clean sheeting both the operating model and the organizational structure to simplify how we work and we want to take actions that optimize business processes and operations. ","And let me just give you a couple of examples of that and this has all become very obvious as ES has moved out. When ES went to DXE on March 31, a $28 billion business on 110,000 people left this organization and it was in some way is like the tide going out. You could see where there were real opportunities to improve and I\u2019ll give you a perfect example. ","Think about platforms and SKUs and options. So we have about 50,000 live configs, live configurations in our server business. The old 80-20 rule applies. And so, as we are to really focus on the configurations that make the most difference. This will \u2013 think about it, inventory, nodes, purchasing, supply chain, everything gets simpler and easier. ","Think about decreasing the layers in our customer-facing organization, so there is more accountability and decision-making closer to the customers. Reducing the number of markets that we operate in to prioritize the customers and the countries that are driving the vast majority of the business today and we\u2019ll drive almost all the growth. ","So this is the kind of thing we are doing. So, yes, I think the travel and the contractors are interesting and have not hurt the business, but the fundamental rearchitecture and reengineering of this business is I think very, very exciting. I think it\u2019s going to be good for customers and it\u2019s going to be good for our speed and nimbleness and agility as a company.","Tim Stonesifer","And the only thing I would add to that is to Meg\u2019s point, a lot of the HPE Next stuff is very structural. So that will obviously be more run rate related. But keep in mind that savings \u2013 the $1.5 billion savings is a gross savings number. ","So, again, we are going to continue to see commodity cost pressure, one of the things you\u2019ll see that we did very effectively with ES is we are going to hire people as we shift rules from high cost countries to low cost countries, we are going to be out hiring people and then we are going to continue to invest in the business. But net-net, it should drive some significant savings for the business going forward. ","Andy Simanek","Great. Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. ","Jim Suva ","Thank you very much. Thinking back from looking at a bigger picture of things, is Brexit now still a headwind for the company? Are we turning the corner on Brexit? Can you talk a bit about kind of your overall demand trends? As I know for a while there is a little bit of a pause or hesitation there. Thank you.","Meg Whitman","Yes, so, listen, I think when Brexit was first announced, we did see a pause in the demand in the UK market. No question about it because customers were trying to decide do they want to build their next datacenter in the UK or should they be building that datacenter someplace else in Europe. I think we are still feeling some after-effects from Brexit, because it\u2019s not clear exactly how this is all going to work. So I would say, the UK market is a bit challenged for us. ","It\u2019s not only Brexit, it\u2019s also the public sector that is cutting back spending quite dramatically. So the UK is not one of our stronger markets. It\u2019s a very important market for us. But I wouldn\u2019t say it is doing as well as the rest of Western Europe and frankly the United States, Canada, Latin America and Asia are all outperforming the UK right now. ","Jim Suva ","Great. Thanks so much for the details. ","Andy Simanek","Perfect. Thanks, Jim. Can we have the next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from James Kisner with Jefferies LLC. Please go ahead. ","James Kisner ","Thank you. So, very nice work on servers. It\u2019s nice to see that business doing better. I was hoping you can dig into the success there. I mean, how much of that is really attributable to just product cycle with Synergy. ","I was just kind of curious how you might extract the year-over-year growth rates in servers would trend over the next couple quarters as the comps get a lot easier here in a couple quarters from now? And just separately and relatedly on Cloudline, are you still committed to that product line and tell us how much of the business is coming from Cloudline? Thank you. ","Meg Whitman","Yes, so, listen, I\u2019d say we are cautiously optimistic about our server business. So you are right. Synergy has made a difference, High Performance Compute has made a difference, SimpliVity has made a difference and so there is \u2013 and we talk about Synergy is also really helping our blade business. It\u2019s interesting people are buying more C-7000s because there is a roadmap to a future state. ","So we are excited about that. I would also say Gen-10 is a real opportunity for us. I mentioned in my opening remarks that Gen-10 is now the industry\u2019s most secure server. This is a big issue now for everybody and we are the only server company that has built security into the silicon in our servers. So we are cautiously optimistic. ","I think, I would add commodity pressure, currency, it\u2019s a very competitive pricing environment still. So, the only reason I am not even more enthusiastic is just there is challenges that remain in the market. We are executing a lot better here. Thanks to the U.S. team. Thanks to EMEA and APJ and Latin America. We are executing a lot better here than we have in the past with the stronger portfolio. Cloudline, you had a question about Cloudline. ","So, listen, Tier-1 continues to be a headwind for us. It\u2019s a very lumpy business with not much profit attached to it. And so, we need to figure out what the long-term answer is on Cloudline. And so we are evaluating that right now. We will, I think have an answer by the Security Analysts Meeting about what we want to do about Cloudline on a go forward basis. And Tim you might talk a little bit about how much \u2013 I think he asked a question about\u2026","Tim Stonesifer","That\u2019s roughly, call it 10% to 15% of our Tier-1 revenue. ","James Kisner ","Thank you very much.","Andy Simanek","Great. Thanks, James. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ","Ittai Kidron ","Thanks. Sorry to beat the dead horse. But I am going to think it\u2019s the servers yet again. Can you perhaps give us the year-over-year growth rate actually excluding your acquisitions as well, because there are two of them in the numbers which you did not exclude?","Meg Whitman","Okay, let\u2019s see. So, you\u2019d like to know the number. So, I can tell you, High Performance Compute with 40% with SGI and 10% organically. ","Ittai Kidron ","I am talking servers in total. You gave the number of 10% assuming Tier-1 and divestitures, but can you give it also excluding M&A and I guess, the second point Tim, how much of the growth here is \u2013 I mean, you\u2019ve managed to roll some of the price increases in DRAM into customers. I understand not all of it, clearly absorbing some of it. But, how much of the growth here is price driven versus units driven?","Tim Stonesifer","So, on the organic piece, the M&A activity is roughly three points call it. And I am sorry, what was the second question about price?","Ittai Kidron ","Yes, how much of the growth is driven by units growth versus ASP growth? Because you have managed to increase some prices. I understand not to the full extent of the DRAM increases but prices have come up to a certain degree. I am just trying to gauge how much of the growth here is really unit driven versus ASP driven?","Tim Stonesifer","Yes, I would say, it\u2019s ASP driven. But again, as we \u2013 it depends on what product line you are talking about. If you are talking servers it\u2019s ASP driven, so I\u2019ll just leave it at that. ","Ittai Kidron ","Got it. Okay, and then for you Meg, on storage, I mean, good results there. At the same time, when you get compared on the All-Flash progress compared to a net app or pure you are still well behind from a growth standpoint. I guess, I am trying to gauge relative to the size of the business you have there, what in your opinion should the All-Flash array business grow at as we think about next year?","Meg Whitman","Yes, so, I think actually, I think did a very good job of getting to All-Flash early with 3PAR and then of course Nimble and then the two competitors that you mentioned actually showed up with an All-Flash product quite recently and they\u2019ve been able to mine their installed base which we understood would happen. ","So our objective is we got to go mine our installed base and then when a customer is thinking about upgrading to All-Flash, we got to make sure that we are in a competitive position there. I can\u2019t give you an estimated growth rate of All-Flash. What I can tell you is, it\u2019s faster, better, cheaper. ","And that is usually a winning formula for CIOs and we are seeing a huge amount of interest in All-Flash as CIOs continue to be under cost pressure and performance pressure, All-Flash is a natural opportunity for them. So, I don\u2019t know whether this will continue at a 30% growth rate, but it will be at least double-digits, I think for the foreseeable future, this is a fundamental trend in the datacenter. ","Ittai Kidron ","All right, good luck. ","Meg Whitman","Thank you.","Andy Simanek","Thanks, Ittai. Next question please?","Operator","Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Simon Leopold ","Thank you for taking my questions. I\u2019ve got one question and a follow-up. First, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on the federal vertical and help us understand the sizing and what assumptions you\u2019ve made or thoughts you have in terms of potential risk if there is a government shutdown?","Meg Whitman","So, the federal business is an important part of our business in the United States. I think it\u2019s roughly 10% to 15% of our revenue in the United States and we have an excellent position there. We\u2019ve got longstanding relationships with almost every agency and every part of the federal government. So, a government shutdown would probably a blip honestly for us. There would be a speed bump there. ","What I will say is a lot of these purchases are long head, they buy and then the delivery is over a long period of time. So probably that would not \u2013 if there was a government shutdown in October, that probably wouldn\u2019t affect us until a little bit later in 2018. But listen, the government shutdown I don\u2019t think is our friend or anyone else who sells to the government. That\u2019s not our friend and we certainly hope that will not happen. ","Simon Leopold ","Great. And then, in terms of the follow-up, I wanted to get a better understanding of how you are thinking about the campus environment, because you did talk about very strong Aruba business and you mentioned some pull through sales of upgrades, but if we look at the campus switching environment by itself, how is that trending for you? You\u2019ve mentioned a couple of data points, but I want to see if we could quantify it. Thank you.","Meg Whitman","Yes, let me talk a little bit about Aruba and why I think Aruba is seeing the traction that they are seeing. First is, you hear about CIOs digitalizing their environment and their interactions with customers. How many times have you heard a CIO saying I\u2019ve got to digitize my environment. In many ways, Aruba is the wedge of how that gets done. ","Either they are transforming their employee environment in their campuses across the world. So that it is a more modern work environment, mobile first and fundamentally changing their employee experience or it is a customer who is saying, I\u2019ve got to change my interaction with my customers and whether that is a retail environment, fast food, hospitals, government interaction. ","So, Aruba is on the cutting edge of this digital transformation that every organization is undergoing and that is fundamentally what\u2019s driving demand. There is two things that differentiate Aruba. One is security. Whether that is ClearPass or Niara, we win on security virtually all the time. We have the most secure wireless network and that is an important decision criteria. There is also interesting things built into Aruba. ","They bought a company called Meridian which is way finding and GPS. So whether that is way finding through a large big box retail environment, whether that is way finding through a hospital, this is a very important application that rides on top of Aruba. ","The other thing is asset tagging. If you think about a hospital environment, where are- most of their assets are mobile and at the end of everyday they are never where they are supposed to be and the ability to asset tag and work to the wireless network has been a big selling point for a number of different customers. ","So, listen, we compete hard every day there. But it is a very rapidly growing market and we are gaining share in the campus branch and edge. So, listen, we expect that to continue. I think that the Aruba team would also tell you they have benefited by part of being a part of Hewlett Packard, because when they were Aruba people loved the product, but some big companies were a little bit hesitant to sign on to a small independent start-up while part of HPE, they know we will stand behind Aruba and that has totally helped the revenue trajectory of Aruba. ","So listen, we remain optimistic and they have a fantastic product, well priced with an excellent sales force with terrific white glove service and that\u2019s another differentiator.","Andy Simanek","Great. Thanks, Simon. I think we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Your last question today will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. ","Ananda Baruah ","Hi, yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. What I\u2019d really love to get a little bit more of a view on is regards to HPE Next, like what are some of the revenue initiatives that we might expect, if you can to sort of touch on them in your dialogue earlier, but what are some of those and what might \u2013 not quantify, but the types of impacts be that you guys are looking for? Thanks a lot.","Meg Whitman","Yes, so listen, we think HPE Next will have positive revenue accelerators and it really goes to two major initiatives, one is how do we make decisions on accountability much closer to the customer. So that frontline sales executives can make the decisions in the field faster. And that by increasing the agility and the decision-making, I think actually, we will do more business. ","Another case on revenue acceleration is our ability to quote configurations much faster. We\u2019ve made progress on this over the last several years, but we need to make more progress. And how we change our pricing and our quoting to be much more customer-focused and customer-friendly, I think is an important element for us. ","If you think about reducing the number of SKUs and options, this also makes it easier to sell, and faster to configure on offering and I think that will accelerate. And then I mentioned, probably like most companies, a small number of countries account for the vast majority of revenue and profit and will account for the growth in our industry over the next five to ten years and we want to make sure we are allocating the resources correctly to the largest countries with the countries that have the most growth and profit potential for us. ","And so, I think that actually will accelerate. As you can imagine a 1% increase in the United States dwarf just about if you think of the long tail of countries that dwarfs the revenue in those long tail of countries. So those are some of the initiatives that I think by extension will impact revenue to the positive. So, we are very focused on, how do we be simpler to the business with, faster to the business with, which should result in revenue increases.","Ananda Baruah ","Really appreciate. Do you think you could see an impact in 2018 from any of these initiatives?","Meg Whitman","We do, actually we really do. We aim to go into FY 2018 with a clean sheet operating model in a way that I hope customers will see a difference right away and frankly it would be easier for our employees to get things done. If you think about what was required to hold this company together when it was a very large multi-business company, some of those ways of doing business, we need to let go off. And I understand why it was here, it was necessary in terms of growing together such a large company, but now that we are more focused with a focused strategy and a smaller company, I think we can do better in terms of making it easier for our employees to get things done. ","Ananda Baruah ","Really appreciate it. Good luck.","Meg Whitman","Thank you very much.","Andy Simanek","Thank you, Ananda. Appreciate it. I think with that we can close the call ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you and enjoy the rest of your day."]}}
