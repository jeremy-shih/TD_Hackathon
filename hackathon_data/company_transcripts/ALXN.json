My name is Alisha and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of your conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I\u2019d now like to introduce Dr. Leonard Bell. Please proceed, sir.","Leonard Bell","Thank you, Alisha. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss Alexion\u2019s performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2011.","I\u2019m joined by members of Alexion management, Steve Squinto, Executive Vice President and Head of R&D; Vikas Sinha, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; David Hallal, Senior Vice President, Global Commercial Operations; and Tom Dubin, Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer.","We also welcome our entire Alexion team working around the world including our new colleagues in Cambridge and Montreal who have joined us just this week from Enobia. Vikas, David, and Steve will join me on today's call to report on our financial, commercial, and R&D accomplishments in the fourth quarter and the year and to discuss our strategic initiatives and accelerated execution plans for 2011.","Before we begin, Tom will apprise you of our potential to make forward-looking statements. Tom?","Thomas Dubin","Thanks, Lenny. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements such as expected financial results; medical benefits, regulatory milestones, and commercial potential of Soliris, Asfotase Alfa and our other product candidates in the U.S. and other territories. Plans for development and clinical trials of Soliris, Asfotase Alfa in our other product candidates and operations, reimbursement, price approval and funding processes in different territories.","Forward-looking statements are subject to factors that may cause our results and plans to differ from those expected, including decisions of regulatory authorities regarding approval or limitations on the marketing of Soliris and our product candidates for various indications, the possibility that results of clinical trials are not predictive of the safety and efficacy of Soliris or our product candidates in broader patient populations in the disease studied or other diseases; the risks that third parties won\u2019t agree to license any necessary intellectual property to us on reasonable terms or at all, the possibility that initial results of commercialization are not predictive of future results, the risk that third party payers will not or will not continue to reimburse for the use of Soliris at acceptable rates or at all, and a variety of other risks set forth from time-to-time in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. We do not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements after this call, except when a duty arises under law.","I'd like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP numbers conform to U.S. GAAP except in three respects. First, our non-GAAP numbers exclude share-based compensation. Second, we exclude non-cash tax adjustments associated with utilization of our U.S. net operating losses, and third with completion of three recent acquisitions, we also exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets and costs associated with acquisitions. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the press release we issued this morning. Thanks, very much. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Tom. In the fourth quarter and full-year 2011 Alexion exceeded its objectives and significantly advanced our mission to provide life transforming therapies for patients with severe, ultra-rare and life-threatening disorders. Our continued progress expand three major growth initiatives. First, during Q4 we continued the strong Soliris growth trajectory, serving a substantial number of new patients with PNH, primarily in our core territories of United States, Western Europe and Japan.","Second, we significantly progress our mission to serve patients with aHUS. In late September, following FDA approval, we began to serve initial patients with aHUS in United States. And in November Soliris received European commission approval for patients with aHUS. With these regulatory steps now completed, we look forward to transforming the lives in the increasing number of patients with this life-threatening ultra-rare disorder in 2012 and beyond.","And third, as we expand our initiative to serve more patients with more disorders that are severe and ultra-rare, we have progressed our lead development programs, which now include four other highly innovative compounds in addition to Soliris. In all, our five novel compounds are currently being investigated across eight severe and ultra-rare disorders in addition to PNH and aHUS.","As we enter 2012, Alexion has the widest commercial operation and the deepest development pipeline in the company\u2019s history. Importantly, as we expand our commercial and clinical initiatives, with a focus on sustainable long-term growth, we remain tightly focused in areas that we know well and do well.","Developing and commercializing first-in-class high value therapies that transform the lives of patients with disorders of extreme severity and rarity. With our proven skills and severe and ultra-rate disorders combined with our sense of urgency regarding patients who lack other treatment option. We're on track to pursue our growth strategy throughout this decade and into the 2020s.","As we look ahead to 2012, I would like to turn first to our work with Soliris, the world\u2019s only approved terminal complement inhibitor. Our goal is to maximize the potential of Soliris in current and future indications. First, by accelerating the global rollout of Soliris in PNH and now aHUS, our two currently approved indications. And simultaneously, by driving forward to investigate the use of Soliris in four additional severe and ultra-rate complement EDA disorders.","In PNH, Soliris is providing life transforming benefit, and the potential for a normal lifespan to patients around the world. In Q4, we again achieved steady quarter-on-quarter growth in our four territories of United States, Western Europe and Japan. In U.S. in particular, revenue growth from Q3 and Q4 was positively impacted by the initial effect of the expanded U.S. field team, and the more rapid identification of previously identified, unidentified PNH patients in Q4 compared to Q3.","As we expect the rate of patient identification in Q1 to be similar to Q4, we do not expect to see the same incremental rise in revenue in Q1 over Q4. Separately in Europe, I would point out that despite the near-daily news headlines on the macroeconomic environment; we continue to see steady demand in our core Western Europe countries.","However, even with our success today, we know that the majority of PNH patients who can benefit from Soliris in the United States, a country in which we have been operating the longest, are still not receiving appropriate treatment.","On a global basis, the number of PNH patients not yet diagnosed or receiving appropriate treatment is even greater. We look forward to expanding our presence in our core territories, while serving more patients in additional countries.","In aHUS, we\u2019re at the very early stages of beginning to serve patients in United States and are on track to service steadily growing number of U.S. patients throughout 2012. In Europe, we expect to complete the reimbursement procedures for aHUS in initial countries during 2012, in further European countries through mid-2013. As we complete these reimbursement discussions, we\u2019ll be able to begin individual launches in aHUS on a country-by-country basis.","As we have noted before, we expect that the use of Soliris in aHUS in United States and in Europe, was first grow only gradually due to the low prevalence and low awareness of the disorder.","Due to the life transforming impact of Soliris in PNH and aHUS, we are increasingly committed to the development of Soliris in other severe and ultra-rare disorders of uncontrolled complement activation.","We\u2019re currently focused on clinical programs in four such disorders, acute humoral transplant rejection STEC-HUS, neuromyelitis optica and myasthenia gravis. And we will drive these programs forward throughout 2012.","As we look to expand our ultra-orphan product portfolio beyond Soliris, we\u2019re moving on parallel tracks. First, we\u2019re applying our world-class expertise to expand our portfolio of complement inhibition therapeutics. In addition, beyond our core focus on complement inhibition, we are simultaneously expanding our development efforts to target other sever and other ultra-rare disorders including those caused by inborn errors of metabolism.","In 2012, we will progress development programs in four highly innovative first-in-class therapies beyond Soliris. These include ALXN1007, our anti-inflammatory antibody and importantly three other innovative compounds added to our pipelines through our highly selective acquisitions in 2011. Asfotase alfa, investigational target enzyme replacement therapy with strong Phase II data as a potential treatment for patients with hyperphosphatasia a severe ultra-rare genetic and life threatening metabolic disorder.","cPMP replacement therapy which has shown dramatic early results in treating newborns with MoCD Type A, an ultra-rare genetic and fatal metabolic disorder, and TT30, a unique targeted inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway. Steve will provide update of our development work with these four additional compounds and Soliris later in the call.","Turning to our financial performance, our core regional businesses each performed well and revenues in Q4 grew to $228 million, bringing our revenues for 2011 to $783 million, which was an increase of 45% compared to 2010.","That showed an increasing number of patients while maintaining a rigorous financial discipline and control, we achieved 2011 non-GAAP net income of $1.38 per share or $266 million, a 59% increase year-over-year.","Turning to our 2012 guidance which was tale in this morning\u2019s press release, we\u2019re forecasting 2012 revenues in the range of $1,040,000,000 to $1,070,000,000 an increase of approximately 35% over 2011.","We expect continued strong gains in revenue in each quarter. I would note, however, that Q4 to Q1 revenue growth will occur at a somewhat slower rate due to fewer days in Q1, and in part to the already apparent negative impact of European exchange rates.","As we grow the scope of both our commercial and clinical operations and prepare for continued expansion over the course of many years, we are also strongly focused on maintaining our financial discipline.","Despite our increasing global growth in investment, we expect to continue to reduce non-GAAP SG&A, as a percent of sales from 35% in 2011 to approximately 33% in 2012. This indicates our growing operational efficiency as we serve more patients with additional severe and ultra-rare disorders.","As previously described, 2012 R&D is forecasted approximately 21% of sales reflecting the additional investment related to asfotase alfa drug development, and largely related to initial drug inventory production. Following this trends in one year increase in 2012, we expect R&D to return to our target levels of 17% to 18% of sales in 2013. Strong revenue growth and continued financial discipline are expected to result in 2012 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.60 to $1.70.","I would also note, as we look forward, we expect to realize substantial financial benefits from the structuring of our organization as we integrate Enobia. A long-term positive impact on our operating results will follow from our one-time GAAP tax charge of approximately $80 million to $100 million during 2012, which is not reflected in our GAAP tax guidance.","In 2011, we set and reached our goal of accelerating all of Alexion\u2019s key growth initiatives. Our sense of urgency as we enter 2012 is just as great. We are constantly mindful of the number of patients with PNH and aHUS worldwide who are still not receiving the life transforming benefit of Soliris. And we're likewise driven by the exciting potential of the eight lead programs under development in our pipeline, and the need to accelerate these initiatives as we prepare to serve patients throughout this decade and into the next.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a more detailed look at our financial results. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Lenny. We concluded 2011 with another quarter of strong sales profitability and cash flow. Looking first at revenues, we achieved steady top line growth during Q4 primarily in our core geographies of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan augmented by serving small number of patients in other countries. Net product sales of Soliris was $228 million in Q4, 2011, an increase of 46% compared to Q4, 2010.","PNH contribution to Q4 revenues was higher than our expectations in all of our core regions, while the aHUS launch in the U.S. was inline with our expectations. For the full-year 2011, we recorded sales of $783 million, an increase of 45% compared to 2010.","The U.S. represented 34% of sales, Europe 43%, and ROW 23%. In the fifth year of the Soliris launch, the U.S. again achieved a high growth rate, primarily due to continued addition of new PNH patients and a small contribution from the initial few months of the aHUS launch. Turning to Europe, despite the recent macroeconomic issues and observing the full-year impact of the 2010 increase in the industrywide, government-mandated discounts in Germany and Spain; European revenue growth also remained strong.","Turning to operating expenses, non-GAAP SG&A was reduced by 3% from 38% of sales in 2010 to approximately 35% of sales in 2011. R&D expenses for 2011 was $128 million as we re-prioritize certain programs following the initiation of our STEC-HUS study in Germany.","Turning briefly to taxes, our GAAP tax rate for 2011 was approximately 24%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 8% each of which included the benefit of foreign and orphan tax credit that we recognized in Q3.","As a result of exceeding our revenue targets while maintaining financial discipline, we were able to report 2011 non-GAAP EPS of $1.38 per diluted share. This was an increase of 55% year-on-year.","Turning to our balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities grew from $362 million at the end of 2010 to $541 million at the end of 2011. The year-end balance does not reflect the purchase price for the Enobia acquisition, which will be paid for through a combination of cash and debt to be reflected in our Q1 results.","We will incur expenses related to the Enobia acquisition and integration of approximately $20 million to $25 million in 2012. These costs will be recorded in various amounts throughout the year, and will be excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Looking further at the balance sheet, we continue to have strong cash collections and global DSOs remain consistent.","With regard to our 2012 guidance, I\u2019d like to highlight some key points. First, we are again guiding strong top line year-on-year revenue growth. Revenues for 2012 are forecasted in a range of $1.04 billion to $1.07 billion, an increase of approximately 35% compared to 2011.","PNH will be the primary source of revenues with a small, but growing contribution from aHUS. We expect continued strong gains in revenue in each quarter, I would note, however, that Q4 to Q1 revenue growth will occur at a somewhat slower rate due in part to fewer days in Q1, and the already apparent negative impact of European exchange rates.","Second, as the global operations continue to become more efficient, our forecasted SG&A of $345 million to $355 million will be approximately 33% of sales of further improvement from our level of nearly 35% of sales experienced in 2011.","Third, 2012 R&D is forecasted at $220 million to $230 million, which will be approximately 21% of sales reflecting additional expenses related to asfotase alfa drug development and largely related to the initial manufacturing of drug development.","Following these trends into one year increase in 2012, we expect R&D to return to our target levels of 17% to 18% of sales in 2013, despite a significant increase in our pipeline activities.","Fourth, the forecasted 2012 GAAP effective tax rate of 32% to 34% excludes the tax impact of the integration and structuring of the Enobia acquisition that we will undertake throughout 2012. We expect to realize substantial financial benefits from the structuring of our organization as we integrate Enobia. A long-term positive impact on our operating results will follow from a one-time tax charge of approximately $80 million to $100 million during 2012, which is not reflected in our GAAP tax guidance. We are guiding a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 8% to 10%.","Finally, by growing revenues strongly and maintaining a financial discipline, we're guiding 2012 non-GAAP EPS of $1.60 to $1.70 per share. This forecast is based on 197 million average shares outstanding during the year.","Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our financial performance in 2011. We\u2019re especially gratified to have accomplished three strategic acquisitions, each well within our conservative financial parameters. We expect that these patient-centered investments will contribution significantly to our performance as the decade proceeds.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David who will provide an update of our global commercial operations. David?","David Hallal","Thanks, Vikas. During 2011, we achieved Soliris growth of 45% compared to 2010, driven by continued strong performance in our global PNH operations, and an initial small contribution from aHUS, which was in line with our expectations.","Q4 capped the solid performance of our commercial operations during the year with a 46% increase over Q4, 2010; reflecting steady and continued growth in PNH in our core territories of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan augmented by small contributions from a number of other countries, which are in the earlier stages of our disease awareness and diagnostic efforts.","In our 19th quarter of PNH commercialization, we continue to observe the same strong update across each of our core territories that we have experienced since 2007. In Q4, as in previous quarters, a significant number of patients in the U.S., Europe and Japan who were newly started on Soliris were also newly diagnosed.","More patients are being tested for PNH, and we know that once patients with PNH have received an accurate diagnosis, physicians are more likely to rapidly start them on Soliris. Thus patient care is being optimized as treatment decisions are increasingly based on the growing body of clinical data regarding the morbidities, and premature mortality associated with PNH, as well as the positive long-term outcomes demonstrated with Soliris therapy.","Our education initiatives continue to be supported by new data that underscore the severity of PNH, and the impact of Soliris on survival. New data presented at the ASH conference in December show that hemolysis is a strong and independent predictor of severe complications in PNH including early death. The analysis of over 300 patients in the South Korean national registry show that any patient with elevated LDH is at risk for serious complications due to uncontrolled complement activation, reinforcing the need for early intervention.","Separately, a diagnostic study presented at ASH confirm the frequency of PNH clones in high-risk patient populations with various other diseases. This aligns well with emerging clinical practice in the PNH diagnostic pathway.","Looking forward in our PNH operations, despite our substantial progress over the past five years, we continue to observe that the majority of patients with PNH are not yet receiving appropriate treatment even in those countries where we have been operating the longest. As we continue to expand our diagnostic and education efforts, we look forward to serving an increasing number of patients with PNH around the world.","Turning to our aHUS launch with Soliris, in the United States, we are pleased with the dynamics we are observing thus far, which is in line with our expectations. In these very early stages, I note three factors in particular","First, as in PNH, our early focus in aHUS is on disease and treatment education. Among both nephrologists and hematologists, these programs are focused on the morbidities and mortality of aHUS, the role of chronic uncontrolled complement activation which causes TMA in these patients, and the compelling clinical benefits that Soliris can provide the patients with aHUS by inhibiting complement mediated TMA. We are observing both interest and receptivity as we conduct our disease awareness programs.","Second, we are benefiting from our decision to have a single unified sales team in the United States, cross trained in both PNH and aHUS. Because the overall team is larger, each represent and manages a smaller territory than in the past, and is able to call on more hematologists for both PNH and aHUS, while also calling on adult in pediatric nephrologists to educate them on aHUS.","In the United States, revenue growth from Q3 to Q4 was positively impacted by the initial effect of the expanded U.S. field team and the more rapid identification of previously unidentified PNH patients in Q4 compared to Q3. As we expect the rate of patient identification in Q1 to be similar to Q4, we do not expect to see the same incremental rise in revenue in Q1 over Q4.","And third regarding aHUS, we\u2019re observing that thus far, nearly half of the new prescribers of Soliris for patients with aHUS our hematologists indicating that this specialty is indeed managing a substantial number of aHUS patients.","Significantly, the ASH Hematology Conference in December included important disease presentations on aHUS as well as a presentation of final data from one of our prospective studies further reflecting strong interest in this disorder in the hematology community.","As we have discussed, we are confident that we will serve an increasing number of patients with aHUS overtime; however, we continue to expect that the initial use of Soliris and aHUS will grow only gradually due to the low prevalence and low awareness of the disease.","Turning now to Europe, in November, the European commission granted marketing authorization for Soliris to treat pediatric and adult patients with aHUS. Like the label in the United States, the SmPC in Europe supports broad use of Soliris in patients with aHUS regardless of age, clinical profile, presence of genetic mutations or history of supportive care.","In addition, recognizing the life long risk of severe complications due to the uncontrolled compliment activation in aHUS, the EU label specifically states Soliris treatment is recommended to continue for the patient\u2019s lifetime.","Our next step in Europe is to begin reimbursement discussions with healthcare authorities in major European countries as we expect to start serving patients with aHUS in the initial European countries during 2012 with additional countries commencing through mid-2013.","While we are confident that we will serve an increasing number of European patients with aHUS over time, we expect that as in the U.S., the initial use of Soliris and aHUS, will grow only gradually due to the low prevalence and low awareness of the disease.","To prepare for the EU launch, we are now expanding our European field teams on a country-by-country basis with professionals who have experience in rare disorders and relevant medical specialties.","These European country teams will be fully cross trained in both PNH and aHUS. As we enter 2012, we remain focused on expanding our PNH initiatives around the world while we want Soliris for aHUS, for both children and adults by executing our plans to meet the needs of patients who suffer from these severe ultra-rare and life-threatening diseases.","Our global commercial organization has the experience, skill and talent to achieve our objectives with Soliris, and our four other highly innovative compounds including most recently asfotase alfa for hyperphosphatasia. I look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Steve who will review our expanding pipeline initiatives. Steve?","Stephen Squinto","Thanks, David. In 2011, in addition to supporting our PNH and aHUS operations Alexion\u2019s R&D team made significant progress on behalf of patients suffering with a number of other severe, ultra-rare and life-threatening disorders. We entered 2012 with the most robust and innovative pipeline in Alexion\u2019s history with Soliris and four additional highly innovative compounds currently being investigated at various stages of development across eight severe and ultra-rare indications beyond PNH and aHUS.","I would like to update each of these programs, starting with the four disorders under development with Soliris or eculizumab and starting first with STEC-HUS. During Q4, Dr. Rolf Stahl, lead investigator of the STEC-HUS study reported interim data at the ASM meeting in Philadelphia.","The interim results were very encouraging showing the eculizumab treatment for eight weeks substantially improved serious morbidities in STEC-HUS patients. 95% of patients in this study achieved a global response, 94% of patients improved their kidney function, 85% of patients improved neurologic function, and 100% of patient eliminated dialysis.","A rapid large and sustained reduction in thrombotic microangiopathy or TMA in reversal of organ damage with Soliris supports the central role of uncontrolled compliment activation in the TMA process, which contributes to sever morbidities in patients with STEC-HUS.","Patients in this study will be observed for 28 weeks. We expect final data from the STEC-HUS later this year, and if consistent with the interim, we then expect to have discussions with regulators regarding a regulatory pathway of profiling in sBLA.","In our kidney transplant program with eculizumab, we have now commenced enrolling initial patients in our company sponsored multi-national living donor kidney transplant trial, in patients at elevated risk of antibody mediated rejection. Patients in this study will be dosed with eculizumab for nine weeks post transplant, and then we observe for 52 weeks following transplant. In addition, we expect to initiate a disease donor study in the first half of 2012.","Finally with eculizumab, we have two neurology clinical development programs ongoing in severe and refractory neuromyelitis optica and in myasthenia gravis. Data from the investigator initiated space to clinical trail of eculizumab in severe refectory NMO is expected later this year.","With regard to myasthenia gravis, data from our company sponsored Phase II study was presented in the fall of 2011. The data showed a strong disease improvement signal in a group of 14 patients with severe and refractory myasthenia gravis, an ultra-rare debilitating form of the disease. We expect to discuss the plans for a larger prospective placebo controlled study with regulators in 2012.","Turning to our rare-disease pipeline programs beyond eculizumab, I know that these programs are evaluating new highly innovative compounds that build on our world-class expertise in complement inhibition, as well as other novel compounds that target disease mechanisms outside of complement. With the acquisition of Enobia, we\u2019ve added asfotase alfa, a highly promising and innovative late stage product candidate to our pipeline.","Asfotase alfa is a first-in-class targeted enzyme replacement therapy in Phase II clinical trials for patients with hypophosphatasia or HPP, an ultra-rare genetic and life-threatening metabolic disease with no effective treatment options. Asfotase alfa directly addresses the morbidities and mortality of hypophosphatasia by targeting alkaline phosphatase directly to the deficient tissue. In this way asfotase alfa is designed to normalize the genetically defected metabolic process, and prevent or reverse the severe crippling and life-threatening complications of this regulated mineral metabolism in patients with HPP.","Based on a highly encouraging Phase II data, seem thus far with asfotase alfa in children, we will focus our efforts on the following key areas to accelerate the development program as rapidly as possible. First, optimizing the commercial scale manufacturing process for asfotase alfa, second, completing the clinical development program in children prior to an anticipated regulatory filing for pediatric patients in 2014, and third, expanding the development program in adults. I look forward to updating you on our asfotase alfa program on future calls.","We are also accelerating the development of cPMP for the treatment of patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A, another severe ultra-rare and genetic metabolic disorder that is fatal in newborns.","In 2011, we made substantial progress on our GMP manufacturing process for our cPMP replacement therapy. With material now in hand, we are currently conducting IND enabling studies, and will also be collecting retrospective data from patients already receiving cPMP therapy.","Our third pipeline candidate beyond eculizumab is TT30, a unique inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway with a mechanism of action distinct from Soliris. We are now enrolling patients in a Phase I study to characterize TT30\u2019s mechanism of action, and to develop initial safety data.","Once we have the data from this study, we can better evaluate the overall therapeutic potential of TT30 for various disease targets. Lastly, we have also started clinical studies with the novel anti-inflammatory antibody know as ALXN1007, which is a product of our antibody discovery technology.","Our Phase I study of ALXN1007 is underway to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this compound in healthy volunteers. Before closing, I would like to acknowledge the innovative and diligent work of the colleagues who have joined us from Enobia. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet with most members of the Enobia team, and they display the same passion and drive that is part of the Alexion culture; allowing us to do whatever it takes to bring a life transforming therapy to patients.","2011 was indeed a noteworthy year for our R&D team, and I want to thank each member for his or her contribution given the breadth of our activities, our potential in 2012 is even greater. I look forward to updating our progress on upcoming conference calls.","I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","","Thanks, Steve. In 2011, we continue to grow our global PNH operation, received United States and European approvals for Soliris and aHUS, advanced key R&D programs and executed three business development initiatives that are highly focused on bringing life transforming innovation to patients.","We entered 2012 with the widest commercial operation, and the deepest development pipeline in the company's history. We\u2019ll now drive forward with the same passion and commitment we\u2019ve demonstrated over the years to transform the lives of more patients and families suffering with more disorders that are severe, devastating and ultra-rare.","As always, we thank all those who make our work possible, our employees, researchers and physicians around the world, and of course patients and their families.","Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi. Yeah, thanks very much, and congratulations on another fantastic quarter. Just on the guidance, maybe you can give us a little bit more color, your average quarterly increase in Soliris sales in 2011 was about $18 million, and your guidance implies kind of a $13 million to $16 million average quarterly increase.","So I mean, it just seems pretty conservative, and maybe you can just take a step back, and also talk a little bit about the aHUS launch compared to where you were at the same time in PNH, and whether we should be thinking about demand increasing overtime with aHUS, kind of being steady from current levels? Thanks.","Leonard Bell","Thanks very much, Rachael. I'll take the first part, and then David will fill the second part, then will bounce around the table. So in regard to our guidance, as Vikas and I each said, we recognize that certainly as we move from Q4 to Q1 as we identified, there really are three pieces that we have identified, that in each one in part will pen result in a slightly lower increase, Q1 over Q4 as oppose to Q4 over Q3. And those three pieces are, first, as David mentioned, and I mentioned as well, in the United States, we saw a higher increase from Q3 to Q4 due to the increased patient identification from the immediate effect of the increased sales force, but we don\u2019t expect that same quarter-on-quarter increment to occur in Q4 moving to Q1.","Second as we mentioned, there are fewer days in our markets around the world, in Q1 as always are compared to Q4. And third, although we are hedged we recognize strongly the impact of the very negative euro weakness on our revenues in Q1 to date and anticipate continued effect of that throughout the quarter.","Given that as you know, we always examine and forecast our revenues and expenses based on our interpretations of risk and opportunities as we see them at that time and that show in that result.","David, do you want to talk about aHUS?","David Hallal","Yeah, Rachel, so as expected the uptick of Soliris and aHUS in the U.S. was slower than what we experienced in PNH really given the fact that there is lower prevalence of the disease. We do see that, as I mentioned during the call that, treating physicians are really at the earlier stages are becoming more aware of the signs and symptoms of the disease and even which patients might be higher likely for having the diseases. So clearly through our efforts in reaching more physicians, we think it will ultimately lead to more diagnostic evaluations and treatment for Soliris, but again as mentioned during the call, we see it being slow and gradual due to the fact that it is certainly a lower prevalent population out there.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Fair enough.","Leonard Bell","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company","Hello, thanks for taking my question. Another one on the launch in aHUS, I know that you\u2019re seeing only slow gradual very limited early adoption. But I was wondering if you can comment on whether the clinical patients have been transitioned successfully in the U.S. at least two commercial drug whether you can see and actually track the number of new patients who are diagnosed. And then in terms of the additions that you\u2019ve had under the drug, are they coming more from new diagnoses or old, lets say, more earlier diagnosed patients?","Leonard Bell","","David.","David Hallal","Yes. So Eric, yes we did transition the clinical trial patients in the U.S. over to commercial supply. And I think that again is something that I observed is one of the reasons for our nice quarter-on-quarter growth that we won\u2019t necessarily think that we would see obviously moving forward.","As far as the patients that are being treated, again, given the fact that there is a lower population of prevalent patients, what we are seeing obviously is patients with a variety of clinical profiles, younger patients, some adult patients and with the signs and symptoms of TMA, physicians making diagnostic and treatment decisions and moving those patients on to ultimately the Soliris therapy.","Leonard Bell","Eric, is that a healthy answer.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company","That\u2019s terrific, but since you prompted me, Lenny, I\u2019d loved this, the cost might come in on the longer-term outlook for non-GAAP taxes. They continue to be lower than we have modeled at least in 2012.","Leonard Bell","It was a good experience (inaudible) conference on the phone like that. Non-GAAP gliding towards 8% to 10% and the reason is that, as we continue to absorb more of the U.S. NOLs, the GAAP tax, whenever it goes up, there\u2019s a counter impact on non-GAAP going down, primarily because the U.S. still has a significant NOL. So as we\u2019re guiding a little bit higher on the GAAP tax rate you saw that, you will see that impact of the benefit in the non-GAAP. Does that help?","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company","Yes, I was specifically interested after 2012, whether that non-GAAP rate can stay low or when we\u2019ll see a transition upward?","Leonard Bell","It was two thing, I think two three years, we will still be at our 8%, 10% ranges. And I\u2019ll give you a better guidance of that, there\u2019s still a $450 million of NOLs still there.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thanks very much.","Leonard Bell","Very good, thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. A couple for you, so the model, first data at ASH, I know docs already use this as one of the predictors of PNH, but I\u2019m curious to what degree you guys can leverage these data, and maybe some of the newer launch countries? And then the second question on NMO, I know we\u2019ll get Phase II data soon, but may be help us out with how you guys give the registration trials, and how they could look with respect to things like compare it or if any dose duration endpoint things like that?","Leonard Bell","Yes. So I\u2019ll take the first part of the question. Obviously, the South Korea national registry data that was presented at ASH was very important and is helping us in our global rollout of our PNH initiatives.","When I think about the earlier stages of the launch back in \u201907, \u201908, we didn\u2019t have this type of data that obviously suggested that those elevated levels of hemolysis were clearly aligned with higher risk of premature death. So it is aiding us in our efforts in educating physicians around, which patients can most benefit from treatment. And as I stated, I think that more so over stagnalis when patients are diagnosed with PNH, there were generally more rapid treatment decisions that were being made.","David Hallal","","Scott, regarding the NMO question, probably laid out, I think last patient, last visible probably occurs sometime this first quarter and then of course know as we would do for any clinical trail have to collect the data, clean the data, lock the database essentially then evaluate the final data. And I would hope that it would be positive enough then for submission to appear at a medical conference probably later in the year.","As you probably recall, we are looking at a decrease in exacerbation rate, comparing the rate of exacerbations prior to eculizumab therapy to the rate on eculizumab therapy for one year. And I think we would expect and hopefully see a pretty dramatic change in exacerbation rate to be encouraged to go forward.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","In your sense is that from your discussions with FDA on this, is that a reasonable end point you think for a registration study?","David Hallal","","At this moment in time and so we have the data and actually see the data we won\u2019t have discussions with the regulators until we know where we are from the trial data.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","Got you. Okay, great. Thanks.","David Hallal","","Okay.","Leonard Bell","","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Sapna Srivastava with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Yogesh Ahuja \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, this is Yogesh on behalf of Sapna. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on another great quarter. Two quick questions, one, what are your thoughts on the potential for Asfotase alfa to be used in moderate or even mild forms of HPP. And then two, can you give us any color on how we should think about the growth and SG&A spend going forward, now the year has passed 2012? Thanks.","Leonard Bell","","I will take one, Vikas you\u2019ll get two. So I think that obviously it\u2019s very early we just closed I think in the last 48-hours and we\u2019re very excited to spend and increasing the amount of time with our new colleagues in Montreal and in Cambridge at Enobia. And as we\u2019ll look to understand, our focus really as we kind of laid out competitively is that really focused on those disorders that are really of extreme rarity and extremes severity.","And I think that regarding hyperphosphatasia that's clearly our key focus, we are acutely focused as we mentioned in late December, when we announced the pending acquisition, we\u2019re acutely focused of course on those children, who just haven\u2019t absolutely devastating disorder and we\u2019re focused on all of them of course.","At the same time we also are focused on identifying those adults who will have very severe manifestation of the disease and we\u2019re clearly going to be focused on them after we evaluate data to bring forth a therapy to provide them the same life transformation that we believe we\u2019ll provide to children with hyperphosphatasia. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Yes, our SG&A came down from 35% in 2011 to we\u2019re guiding towards 33% in 2012. Our view is that over time we need to get it closer to 30 or less. And that is where we have to find more efficiencies in what we do.","Yogesh Ahuja \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Friedman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just talk quickly unless you may not be able to discuss yet, the NMO patients, there is a fairly wide variability of relapse rates in those patients. So I was wondering if you could just quickly discuss any sort of baseline characteristics for these patients, and how severe their disease is? And then just quickly also second was any differences between the disease in moving kidney transplant trials that have separated out their starting over month?","David Hallal","","So let me take the first question, I think which on NMO first. So patients that came into the investigator-initiated trial, first of all, all had to be aquaporin antibody positive, and the reason for that is, they are good evidence that the aquaporin antibody is a compliment activating antibody, so it makes the sense. Those patients also tend to be more severe form of the disease. So there has to be a required number of exacerbations over a six-month period prior to entering the trial as part of the inclusion criteria. So we, much as Lenny was describing regarding hypophosphatasia patients, we purposely selected out some of the more severe patients that really were refractory to other forms of therapies.","Leonard Bell","And then regarding the transplant program, I think as we announced probably, a quarter ago or maybe even two quarters ago at this point, with the STEC-HUS program emerging in 2011, there were few programs that were purposely shifted out really more for budgetary reasons and one of them was the disease donor trial, which we now expect to get going in the first part of 2012.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks. And just a quick follow-up, is there any, I mean was there a specific reason why disease was pushed out, versus living, is there a\u2026","Leonard Bell","","Yeah, I think it\u2019s pretty clear. We had a fair amount of data as you probably know David. In the living donor patients from the investigator-initiated trial that was going on at the Mayo Clinic with Mark Stegall, so we had lot of confidence in what we might see in the living donor. We had less that information about disease donor.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Leonard Bell","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Collins Stewart. Please proceed.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Collins Stewart Llc","Thanks for taking my question. So in term of aHUS, you\u2019ve mentioned that the sales force needs to educate physicians on a number of misconceptions, including that chronic therapies required. So just wanted to get a sense of how the physicians are responding to this and whether you\u2019ve seen any evidence that there are effecting uptick to date that these misconceptions are effecting uptick to date?","Leonard Bell","Yeah, it\u2019s a great question. So obviously we have centered our disease awareness campaign around, our key learning\u2019s preapproval through market research. And as I mentioned, not in a lot of detail on the call, but we\u2019re very pleased thus far with the interest and receptivity of those disease awareness programs, either from our ramps or sometimes in educational setting and forums. As it relates specifically to dosing, as I mentioned I think based upon the label that we have in the U.S. and certainly through a press release from the FDA ODAC, that highlighted that indeed aHUS is a chronic disease, I think there is growing awareness amongst physicians that patients should and will require chronic treatment. And again that\u2019s centered in our disease awareness efforts around the genetic permanent nature of the deficiency that the aHUS patients have.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Collins Stewart Llc","Great. And then just a question quickly for Vikas. How should we think about the FX impact for 2012, just based on the guidance that you\u2019ve provided?","Vikas Sinha","We are looking at with all the macroeconomic issues in Europe as we move into 2012, we\u2019d definitely will see impact of the euro, and that has been built into our guidance and we\u2019re looking at and obviously \u20ac1.3 factored into our guidance.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Collins Stewart Llc","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question. First to Steve, could you just talk a little bit about whether we should be assuming there is no further development in AMD, TDT and other forms of MPGN? I just want to sort of close this out. And then Vikas, could you just talk a little bit about gross margin, what happened in Q4 versus the earlier periods and the earlier periods are the basis that we should use or should we be thinking that Q4 is the basis going forward? Thanks.","Stephen Squinto","","So, let\u2019s see if I can remember now. So AMD, I think as we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019ll expect to see and hoping to see some data on the trial being done down in Florida, probably later in 2012. Regarding dense deposit disease and I think there were some encouraging data presented at ASN last fall I think as we\u2019ve said though it\u2019s probably not for all, dense deposit disease patients I think we\u2019re going to look to find those that have a rapid course disease and are the severe. If we can identify that patient population then we are going to look forward to going forward there as well. And I forget the third \u2013 the third that you mentioned Geoff.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Just other forms of MPGN.","Stephen Squinto","Yeah, I think I throw that into the same basket with dense deposit disease, obviously MPGN type II, MPGN type I as well, again, looking for patients that have a very severe rapid deterioration of disease. Those patients might be good candidates for further eculizumab development.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And just on the gross margin Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Yeah, Geoff. The gross margin for the full year, it was well on the guidance of 12%. And we normally find this in quarter-to-quarter ups and downs because of specific inventories that are related to certain countries go up and down because of the country requirements. And that kind of a little bit fluctuations will continue to happen, but I am pretty confident that we will be very close to 12% in 2012 too.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Please proceed.","Matt M. Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Congrats on a very nice quarter here and thanks for taking my questions. So as you look to expand PNH into other geographies such as Brazil, Turkey, Russia. That was interesting some of the comments made by GSK on their call on Tuesday, give or take, whether or not you think their former experience is applicable to your efforts and specifically, two things that they\u2019ve mentioned. One is, that they\u2019re seeing \u2013 they see very strong initial growth for three, four years timeframe followed by very intense scrutiny over government spending levels. And then secondly, they\u2019re seeing the majority of their sales in the EM, emerging markets as cash payers\u2019 minority government reimbursements. So to what extend do you think that their former experience is applicable to yours and with Soliris and to what extend do you think that your ultra-orphan model basically immune to that sort of scrutiny as we\u2019ve seen in the emerging markets?","Leonard Bell","This is Lenny. I will respond it, for us it\u2019s fairly easy. I don\u2019t think that we have similarity \u2013 similar businesses in anyway.","Matt M. Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi thanks for taking my question and my congrats as well on another great quarter. It seems like lot of European countries are revising your approaches to drug value assessments. So I was just wondering if there are any health technology assessments either ongoing or planned in any European countries for Soliris and PNH, which might potentially reduce any restrictions out there on the use. Now we\u2019ve got a lot more data in hand on survival versus historical and association between hemolysis and death, or at the same it also potentially lead to some kind of reevaluation of the pricing and reimbursement.","Leonard Bell","","Yeah, so thank you, it\u2019s a very important question of course. As regards PNH actually don\u2019t know across Europe, any current new health technology evaluations that regarding Soliris, there certainly was one that\u2019s often been included I think this was in 2008 I think that was done. And you\u2019re absolutely right though I think that the emergence of additional data it is of course very, very important to consider as new health technologies as I am sure will be done over time, probably outside the major European countries I would anticipate.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks very much.","Leonard Bell","","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey (inaudible) showing in for Robin. Congrats on the strong quarter. Just a couple of questions, so we\u2019ve heard that some centers are administering Soliris to all patients, just because it takes a longer time to diagnose the typical form. So we\u2019re wondering what was the average time to diagnosis this and how wide spread does this impact us. And what\u2019s the current average dose being given to patients.","Leonard Bell","Okay, yeah, so I think I\u2019ve shared certainly that there is an approach that physicians are taking to identify patients with aHUS, and it clearly involves really two tests, one is an ADAMTS13 deficiency test, which helps to potentially understand whether or not the underlying cause of the TMA is either severe ADAMTS13 deficiency below 5%, consistent with our label in our clinical trials, would point to TTP.","And above 5% would certainly point to the underlying cause of the TMA being chronic uncontrolled complement activations, therefore leading one to a diagnosis of aHUS. Now, as it relates to aHUS, which I think I heard you say, certainly we are educating physicians that one would perform a sugar passing test to determine whether or not the reason for the uncontrolled complement activation in that case maybe related to an infection.","And so we are getting a better understanding that physicians are becoming educated on this, and follow that process. In terms of the \u2013 I think your question was related to the dosing, and I would just point that, obviously in the aHUS population, we expect a fair number of patients to be that of a pediatric. And the recommended dosing schedule is by a patient\u2019s weight.","So certainly while the aHUS dose is higher for adults and in PNH, we expect that a substantial number of patients are going to be at a dosing range below PNH, because of the pediatric population. And we\u2019re observing that certainly in the early stages.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","M Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thank you and congratulations on a great quarter. Just a question on the R&D guidance. Can you just speak to the incremental $100 million moving into 2012 in terms of R&D spend, how much of that is just related to the inventory build? And the larger question, I'm trying to answer I guess for myself is, as you think about 2013 and the R&D guidance you have given, are we underestimating the cost of the clinical trials or overestimating the cost of clinical trials as we move into 2013 for the other indications for Soliris on the pipeline or we underestimating the revenue outlook for that year?","Vikas Sinha","Yeah, this is the Vikas. Lots of subsets of the question, but I will try and answer as many as I can on that. First is, this years guidance has a significant portion of R&D cost for asfotase alfa drug developments both manufacturing and inventory build plus the absorption of the Enobia organization also into our company, right? So, that's a significant chunk of growth. And if you take that growth off, it\u2019s fairly $30 million, $40 million growth from our own business that is moving forward with so many indications going into 2012 from \u201911, and I think Steve laid it out most of the programs pretty carefully there. And going from \u201912 to \u201913, it\u2019s too early to comment on that because our intention is to bring it down to 17% to 18% in 2013. We do not provide guidance for 2013 right now. Operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Swann. Please proceed.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann Llc","Thanks very much. What\u2019s the magnitude of the change or the plan change of the sales force in U.S. and Europe, and why would the positive impact sustained for more than one quarter?","Leonard Bell","","Yeah, Howard. So, as I mentioned, the expansion of our sales team I\u2019d say, that we added probably about 50% to it, 50%, 60%. And why I don\u2019t think that you would see it continue to grow over time as this that we positioned our regional account managers in the U.S. in what I would consider to be geographic cool spots they were still major areas there maybe we had less coverage because of the larger territories. And what we observed in the quarter in those spots is that we identified some patients with PNH that were previously unidentified. Now, we believe we\u2019ll continue to have success in those areas but it would be similar to what we saw in this quarter and not necessarily growth over this quarter which is what we observed in Q4 versus Q3. Does that make sense?","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann Llc","Yes, do you expect to see a similar impact in Europe?","Leonard Bell","","In a smaller sale of course, because they are actually each on in your countries be at different time.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann Llc","Thanks, very much.","Leonard Bell","","Thank you. We have time for one more question.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Bret Holley with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Bret Holley \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Thanks. My questions regarding any assumptions you have in the \u201812, the 2012 guidance regarding additional EU price pressures. Or how should we think about that or how do you forecast that?","Stephen Squinto","","So Lonny, I\u2019ll take the first shot, and you know as I mentioned actually the very, very first question, more it seems like a very long time ago. We are obviously on a routine basis build risk and opportunities into our expense, revenue and EPS guidance. And we adjust that throughout the year, so we of course weigh those, risks and opportunities on all sides of the letter with a proposition, and then come up with what we think is our best judgment at the time of our guidance. And so regarding macroeconomic issues as we said, we currently, obviously are very sensitive to that and we also see continued strong demand in the larger countries at this point. Nonetheless we certain consider the potential for changes across obviously, different countries. And we weigh that in as we then provide our guidance, which as we\u2019ve done today.","Bret Holley \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for you participation in today\u2019s conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. And now, your host for today's call, the Executive Director for Corporate Communications, Mr. Irving Adler. Mr. Adler, please go ahead, sir.","Irving Adler","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the third quarter of 2012 and our outlook for the remainder of the year.

During the third quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our mission to develop and deliver life-transforming therapies for patients with severe and life-threatening, ultra-rare disorders.","In Q3, our growing global team continued to make significant progress across 3 key initiatives: first, we again provided Soliris with a substantial number of new patients with PNH, with a steady addition of new patients in Q3, similar to Q2; second, we continue to be encouraged by the steady quarter-on-quarter addition of new aHUS patients in the early stages of the U.S. launch; and finally, we are encouraged by the recent presentation of eculizumab clinical data in patients with severe and relapsing neuromyelitis optica or NMO.","Other development highlights of the quarter include important progress in our asfotase alfa and cPMP programs. Due to our solid performance in this past quarter, we announced this morning that we are increasing our revenue forecast and significantly increasing our earnings guidance, despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe.","Turning to the quarter, I'd like to start with our growing PNH operations in the United States. In Q3, as in prior quarters, our U.S. team helped to optimize patient care, as our growing presence among hematologists again resulted in a significant number of new patients starting on Soliris. As in prior quarters, the positive impact of our disease awareness programs and diagnostic initiatives resulted in more patients being tested for PNH, as well as more newly diagnosed patients with PNH being started on Soliris. These dynamics reflect the increasing understanding among physicians of the progressive life-threatening complications of PNH and the transformative clinical benefits of Soliris.","In our PNH operations beyond the United States in Q3, we again observed a steady addition of new patients in our core countries in Europe and Japan. Beyond these core territories, we continue to expand our global operations into emerging markets, most recently into Turkey and Brazil. As expected, following the small initial bolus of PNH patients in Turkey and Brazil in Q2, in Q3, and in line with our plans for continuing long-term growth, the rate of new patient additions in these countries returned to a more steady pace.","Q3 also marked the first anniversary of the U.S. launch of Soliris in aHUS. During the quarter, our field team continued to expand our aHUS disease education programs for both hematologists and nephrologists, resulting in a meaningful increase in the number of aHUS patients in the United States who initiated treatment with Soliris.","Outside of the U.S., during Q3, we continued with our anticipated pre-launch plans. In Q3, as in Q2, a small number of new patients with aHUS began therapy in Germany. We expect that reimbursement of Soliris in the hospital setting in Germany will be in place early next year and lead to a continued increase in treated patients.","We're also serving initial patients in Italy through our pre-launch early access program. Significantly during the quarter, in France, Soliris also received the very high ASMR II rating in aHUS, the same rating that Soliris received in PNH prior to the granting of full reimbursement in that indication. This strong confirmation of the medical benefits of Soliris in aHUS is an important achievement as we progress through the reimbursement process in France.","In addition, and as planned, we are progressing reimbursement processes in other countries, and we expect to launch in all the major European countries by mid-2013.","Turning to our plans to open important new market opportunities for Soliris in aHUS outside U.S. and Europe, and based on progress of our global development team during Q3, we now expect to file for regulatory approval in Japan by early 2013. Thus, the current solid start to our aHUS launch in the United States brings a strong foundation for our upcoming global launch. We expect continued solid growth in the U.S. and, in front of us, we see similar opportunities to launch Soliris in aHUS across Europe, Japan, Latin America and Australasia.","As we execute on our commercial initiatives, we are keenly focused on the need to serve more patients with more innovative therapeutics in the years ahead. In Q3, we continue to make strong progress across our lead programs within our focus to develop highly innovative and life-transforming, first-in-class treatment for patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders.","A special note during the quarter, we are highly encouraged by the recent presentation of eculizumab clinical data in patients with severe and relapsing NMO at the ANA meeting earlier this month. NMO is a devastating life-threatening, ultra-rare neurological disorder that can lead to blindness, paralysis or death, from which there is currently no effective treatment option.","The eculizumab NMO study met its primary efficacy endpoint with high degrees of both clinical and statistical significance. Clinically and statistically significant improvements were also observed in the key secondary endpoints. On upcoming discussions with regulatory authorities, we look forward to commencing a company-sponsored study near mid-2013.","We are also pleased with important progress in our asfotase alfa program for patients with hypophosphatasia, and our cPMP program for newborns with MoCD Type A, which Steve will describe later in the call.","Turning to our financial performance. Revenues in Q3 were $294.1 million, an increase of 44% compared to Q3 2011. We are pleased that we achieved this strong performance despite a substantial year-on-year, euro-based headwind and other macroeconomic factors. While serving an increasing number of patients while maintaining rigorous financial controls, we achieved Q3 2012 non-GAAP net income of $0.60 per share, or $120.7 million, a 66% increase in net income year-over-year.","Importantly, I would note that our non-GAAP EPS of $0.60 in Q3 excludes the $0.13 net benefit attributable to the patent settlement with Genentech and the impairment of our ophthalmology program announced this morning. We continue to recognize and manage the ongoing macroeconomic risk in European countries. This includes managing the continued volatility in the euro and the ongoing challenges in collecting receivables, and also, the potential for government spending changes beyond those in recent years.","In particular, we have in place 5 proactive strategies that we expect will mitigate these risks: first, in Europe, as around the world, our sole focus is on serving the very few patients with life-threatening and very rare disorders with whom we can provide life-transforming therapies; second, our disciplined focus and commitment to serve more patients, one at a time, continues to be the largest driver of our ongoing performance; third, we continue to proactively and successfully mitigate payment risks and closely aligning our collection initiatives with evolving market environments; fourth, we know the bottom line benefit provided by the natural hedge we obtained through our euro-denominated expenses, in addition to our targeted hedging activities, which has successfully mitigated a significant portion of the top line currency risk; and finally, we continue to aggressively expand our global platform into strong and growing emerging markets outside of Europe.","These strategies reflect our experience in having continually and successfully navigated through a difficult economic environment since the launch of Soliris in 2007, 5 years ago. Throughout this period, we have successfully managed a changing landscape in the United States, Europe and other regions. We will continue these efforts to achieve our larger goal to develop and deliver life-transforming medicines for those severely ill patients, who would otherwise have no effective treatment options.","I will now turn to our revised 2012 guidance. With an increased revenue forecast, coupled with projected improvements in operating and manufacturing expenses, we are now guiding significantly increased earnings for the full year 2012. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, we are now raising our 2012 revenue guidance from the previous range of $1,110,000,000 to $1,125,000,000, now to the higher range of $1,120,000,000 to $1,130,000,000. This forecasted improvement in revenue performance, coupled with our ongoing financial discipline, is enabling us to meaningfully improve our 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance from the previous range of $1.78 to $1.88, now to the meaningfully higher range of $1.99 to $2.04.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a more detailed look at our financial results. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Lenny. Following strong performance in the first half of the year, the third quarter of 2012 was a period of sustained growth in revenues and profitability. Net product sales of Soliris were $294.1 million in Q3, an increase of 44% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the steady addition of new patients during the quarter. We are pleased that we achieved this strong performance despite the substantial year-on-year euro-based headwind and other macroeconomic factors.","In addition to the year-on-year comparison, Q3 represented steady sequential in-quarter revenue growth. The growth in Q3 over Q2 was similar to the sequential growth in Q2 over Q1, after adjusting for nonrecurring revenues that occurred in Q2.","SG&A was below our forecasted level in Q3, mainly due to continued expense management, and R&D was lower than expected during the quarter as we prepared to ramp up certain programs later in the year. Overall, expenses were also reduced by an exchange rate benefit on our euro-based expenses in the early part of the quarter.","Strong sales and tight control of expenses enabled us to report Q3 2012 non-GAAP net income of $0.60 per share, or $120.7 million, a 66% increase year-over-year. Importantly, I would note that our non-GAAP EPS of $0.60 in Q3 excludes the $0.13 net benefit attributable to the patent settlement and the impairment of our ophthalmologic program announced this morning.","With our strong operating performance during the quarter, cash, cash equivalents at the end of Q3 were $906 million compared to $806 million at the end of Q2. We formed this strength in our balance sheet by reducing our total debt from $228 million at the end of Q2 to $161 million at the end of Q3.","Turning to our guidance. With an increased revenue forecast, coupled with improvements in our operating and manufacturing expenses, we are guiding to significantly increased earnings for the full year 2012. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, we are now raising our 2012 revenue guidance from the previous range of $1,110,000,000 to $1,125,000,000, now to the higher range of $1,120,000,000 to $1,130,000,000.","Based on a combination of factors, including the terms of the recent patent settlement and our expected manufacturing costs, we are -- we expect an ongoing improvement in COGS. We are now forecasting an improvement in our guidance for COGS to 10% for Q4. This will improve overall full year 2012 COGS to 11%.","We're able to forecast further improvement in our net operating results due to our projected reduction in our 2012 non-GAAP SG&A guidance with the range of $345 million to $355 million. As a reminder, we expect that Q4 SG&A will be higher than Q3 due to the continuing expansion of our global operations and our participation in major medical conferences during the quarter.","At the same time, we are lowering our 2012 non-GAAP R&D guidance to the range of $210 million to $220 million. Q4 will be higher than Q3 due to the expected increase in expenses for asfotase alfa production and the ramp-up of key development programs in Q4.","This improved revenue performance, coupled with reductions in our operating and manufacturing expenses, is enabling us to meaningfully improve our 2012 non-GAAP EPS guidance from the previous range of $1.78 to $1.88, now to the higher range of $1.99 to $2.04.","As noted in our Q2 call, shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 204 million shares in Q4 and approximately 201 million shares for the full year 2012.","Overall, we are pleased with our financial performance in the first 9 months of 2012. We will continue to maintain the financial discipline with which we are expanding our commercial platform and our development programs.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to David, who will provide an update of our global commercial operations. David?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Vikas. In the third quarter of 2012, global revenues from our Soliris operations increased by 44% compared to the third quarter of 2011. Q3 revenue growth was driven by the steady addition of new PNH patients starting on Soliris, combined with a continuing solid start, with steady new patient additions, to our U.S. launch in aHUS.","In PNH, Q3 revenues reflect steady additions of new PNH patients in our core territories of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan. Importantly, we continue to observe the ongoing positive impact on patient care of our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. In Q3, as in previous quarters, a majority of PNH patients, newly starting on Soliris, were also newly diagnosed. This demonstrates that broad education about PNH, as well as PNH diagnostics, positively influences the entire cycle of care, from a patient newly diagnosed with PNH to a patient newly starting on appropriate treatment.","As we noted on our Q2 call, we are successfully expanding our operations into emerging markets. As expected, following the small initial bolus of PNH patients in Turkey and Brazil in Q2, in Q3, the rate of new patient additions returned to a more steady pace. Over the longer term, we expect that ongoing disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives will result in a steady rate of patient identification and Soliris treatment initiation.","While we are gratified by our progress to date, we know that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have not yet received an accurate diagnosis, let alone appropriate treatment, and we remain committed to optimizing care for more patients in more countries around the world.","Turning now to aHUS and our launch in the U.S., we continue to be pleased with the progress of our team. In Q3, as our U.S. field team continued to present our aHUS disease education programs to more hematologists and nephrologists, we again saw a significant number of new aHUS patients initiate treatment with Soliris. We are encouraged by the steady progress to date and expect to serve an increasing number of children and adults with aHUS moving forward.","Outside of the U.S. during Q3, as in Q2, a small number of new patients with aHUS began therapy in Germany in the outpatient setting. In line with the annual reimbursement application period in Germany for new hospital-based therapies, we expect that reimbursement for in-patient Soliris treatment will be in place early next year.","Elsewhere in Europe, we continue to proceed through the country reimbursement processes as planned. In Italy, we are already serving initial patients through a pre-launch early access program. And in France, as Lenny mentioned, we are very pleased that Soliris has recently received the very high ASMR II rating in aHUS, an important achievement as we progress through the reimbursement process in France.","We are advancing our pre-launch plans and selectively adding to our field teams as we continue to prepare for our aHUS launches across the other large European countries by mid-2013. Thus, the current solid start to our aHUS launch in the U.S. creates a strong foundation for our upcoming global launch. We expect continued solid growth in the U.S., and in front of us, we see similar opportunities to launch Soliris in aHUS across Europe, Japan, Latin America and Australasia.","The very early stages of our aHUS launch are supported by the growing body of clinical data regarding the devastating clinical consequences of the disease and the life-transforming benefit that Soliris can provide to patients. At ASN next month, researchers will present 2-year data from 2 long-term extension trials. In these studies, aHUS patients with both shorter and longer durations of disease, after starting on Soliris, experienced continued improvement in renal function, no new dialysis and sustained inhibition of complement-mediated TMA with permanent discontinuation of plasma exchange during the 2-year study period.","Separately, an established group of European aHUS clinical experts published diagnostic and treatment recommendations earlier this month. These experts concluded that eculizumab may be considered as optimal first line therapy in patients with a confirmed aHUS diagnosis.","In addition to aHUS, our nephrology team is continuing their efforts to better understand the disease and diagnostic patterns of STEC-HUS in preparation for a possible launch in 2014.","Looking ahead to commercial opportunities beyond hematology and nephrology, we are now starting to build our team in metabolic diseases, as we plan for a launch of asfotase alfa in hypophosphatasia or HPP. Our plans reflect our goal of a pediatric filing in 2014, based on the rapid progress of our R&D colleagues. In moving this program forward, we continue to identify the needs of the HPP community, mindful that diagnosis can be missed and the natural history of the disease may be misunderstood, given the rarity of the disorder and the wide range of clinical signs and symptoms.","We are pleased with the continued growth in our global PNH operations and the early progress of our aHUS launch. In the fourth quarter, we expect to selectively invest in our global commercial operations as we prepare to serve more patients with PNH and aHUS in 2013.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Steve, who will review our expanding pipeline initiatives. Steve?","Stephen P. Squinto","Thanks, David. In Q3, we made significant progress in advancing our pipeline across both our approved indications and clinical development programs. First, we are continuing to progress our global introduction of Soliris in aHUS. Based on progress of our global development and regulatory teams during Q3, we now expect to file for regulatory approval in Japan by early 2013.","In Q3, we also continued to advance our 8 lead pipeline programs, which include 5 highly innovative therapeutic candidates currently being investigated at various stages of development across 8 severe and ultra-rare indications beyond PNH and aHUS.","Of particular importance, we are encouraged by the recent presentation of preliminary clinical data from an investigational study with eculizumab in patients with severe and relapsing NMO. NMO is a devastating, life-threatening, ultra-rare neurological disease that leads to severe weakness, paralysis, respiratory failure, loss of bowel and bladder function, blindness and premature death.","In patients with NMO, uncontrolled complement activation causes destruction of myelin-producing cells, leading to severe damage to the central nervous system, including the spinal cord and optic nerve. Patients with NMO have a lifelong exposure to this uncontrolled complement activation, due to chronic autoimmune attack and most patients experience an unpredictable, relapsing course of disease with cumulative disability as each attack adds to the neurologic morbidity. Within 5 years of disease onset, 50% of relapsing NMO patients have been reported to sustain permanent, severe disability, including blindness and paralysis. In one report, 30% of patients with NMO died within 5 years of disease onset. There are no approved treatments for this devastating and life-threatening disease.","As Lenny mentioned, we are very encouraged by the preliminary results of the investigator-initiated Phase II trial presented at the ANA meeting. The 12-month open label study enrolled 14 patients with severe relapsing NMO and met its primary efficacy endpoint with high clinical and statistical significance. The median annualized attack rate was reduced from 3 attacks per patient, prior to eculizumab therapy, to 0 attacks per patient during 12 months of chronic treatment with eculizumab.","After 12 months of treatment, 12 of 14, or 86%, of these severely affected patients were completely attack-free. A further note that the investigators characterized the 2 relapses that did occur on eculizumab as only possible attacks, since they did not conform to the definition of a clinically-confirmed relapse in the study protocol.","Clinically and statistically significant improvements were also observed in key secondary endpoints, including EDSS, ambulatory function and visual function. Based on the results of this study, we will be meeting with regulators early next year to discuss our plans for a company-sponsored trial. Our expectation is that we will conduct a larger placebo-controlled study in patients with severe and refractory NMO, likely commencing in mid-2013.","Our other neurology program, myasthenia gravis. We've made meaningful progress with investigators to design our next clinical study, and we have now scheduled a meeting with regulators for the first half of 2013 to discuss plans for a larger, prospective controlled trial in patients with severe and refractory MG.","Turning now to STEC-HUS, 28-week data for the full cohort of 198 enrolled patients across 23 sites in our trial in Germany, will be presented at the American Society of Nephrology meeting on November 3. As a reminder, the 8-week interim results in 148 patients from 9 sites were presented at last year's ASN meeting, and showed a rapid, large and sustained reduction in thrombotic microangiopathy or TMA, and reversal of organ damage with eculizumab treatment.","In addition, we are having ongoing discussions with the EMA and the FDA regarding a pathway to apply for marketing authorization for eculizumab in the treatment of STEC-HUS, which we now expect to submit near mid-2013.","In our kidney transplant program with eculizumab, we are enrolling patients in our company-sponsored, multinational living donor and deceased donor kidney transplant trials, in patients at elevated risk of antibody-mediated rejection. Patients in both studies are being dosed with eculizumab for 9 weeks, post-transplant, and then will be observed for 52 weeks following transplant.","I would like to turn now to our other lead development programs with highly innovative therapeutic candidates beyond eculizumab and starting with asfotase alfa. We continue to accelerate the development of asfotase alfa, as a treatment for a broad spectrum of HPP patients, focusing first on completing the clinical development program in the pediatric setting. A natural history study in infants, which will supplement the existing open label trials, is ongoing.","In addition, we are finalizing the protocol for a 6-month placebo-controlled study in juveniles with HPP and expect to initiate the trial next year. As we have stated in the past, we will be discussing the registration process for pediatric patients with regulatory authorities in the early part of 2013, with an eye towards a pediatric filing in 2014.","Importantly, we have already successfully implemented several steps to optimize a commercial scale manufacturing process for asfotase alfa and will be making continuous process improvements as our clinical studies proceed. We will continue to update you on our asfotase alfa program on future calls.","Beyond asfotase alfa, we are also evaluating 3 additional highly innovative therapeutic candidates as treatment for patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders across a wide range of therapeutic areas.","Looking briefly at these programs. First, in our metabolic disease area, which includes asfotase alfa, we're also accelerating the development of our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A, a severe, ultra-rare and genetic metabolic disorder that is fatal in newborns. We expect to complete pre-IND toxicology studies required to commence normal volunteer studies in early 2013.","Second, we continue to enroll patients in a Phase I study to characterize the mechanism of action and develop initial safety data for ALXN1102 and ALXN1103, IV and subcutaneous versions, respectively, of our novel alternative pathway complement inhibitor. With the data from these studies, we can better evaluate the overall therapeutic potential of these product candidates for various disease targets. We expect to meet with regulators about this development program in 2013.","And finally, we continue to enroll subjects in a Phase I clinical study of ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, which is a product of our internal antibody discovery technologies. This Phase I study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this compound in healthy volunteers.","In closing, Alexion's R&D team will continue to drive our R&D programs forward with urgency to help patients and families suffering with severe and ultra-rare disorders. I look forward to updating you on our progress on future conference calls. I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Steve. We are pleased with the momentum of our ongoing global introduction of Soliris in PNH, and the early stages of our U.S. launch in aHUS. Equally important, we are gratified by our ability to drive forward simultaneously on multiple high-value development programs. We look forward to ending the year strongly in each of our opportunities with our current and future patients.","As always, we thank all those who make our work possible, our employees, researchers and physicians around the world and, of course, patients and their families, who are always at the forefront of what we do.","Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to David Friedman with Morgan Stanley.","Sara Slifka - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Sara for Dave. Just a quick question on SG&A. Looking at what you spent in the first 9 months of the year and your new guidance today, it seems like you're assuming a pretty significant step-up in 4Q, something in the realm of $20-plus million. I was just wondering if you can go into a little bit more detail about what's the main driver of that step-up and what kind of programs or increases in sales force are happening in 4Q to drive that?","Vikas Sinha","Sara, this is Vikas. There are 2 key factors that comes every year from going from Q3 to Q4. The first one definitely is the medical conferences, and, as Steve and David had mentioned, we are now into more than one therapeutic area of ASN, ANA, several conferences that happen in Q4, which is -- which takes a substantial portion of the expenses. And as you heard from David and Lenny, the ongoing expansion in 30-plus countries adds significant headcount, going into Q4 and beyond.","Operator","And we go next to Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Lenny, you indicated steady increases in PNH patient numbers and increasing increases in aHUS numbers, and I understand some of the factors that Vikas noted that prevented that from necessarily showing up in the revenues on a quarter-on-quarter basis. But what does steady and increasing refer to? Is it quarter-on-quarter growth or year-on-year growth? How should we think about that? And then second, if I could just squeeze one in for Vikas, he did guide down cost of goods, operating expenses and taxes, all in 2012. I'm wondering whether we should rethink some of the numbers that are out there for 2013 as well. I'm sure he's not going to give guidance, but were any of the cost savings not necessarily following through into the next year?","Leonard Bell","Eric, I'll take A and Vikas will take B. So yes, thank you for the question. The steady, certainly, refers to the increment in PNH patients in Q3 compared to Q2 being similar, and the steady for aHUS refers to the increment in Q3, in this case, in the U.S., being similar to that in Q2. And increasing, of course, would just reflect that Q3 generally, obviously, is larger than Q2, right? In terms of number of patients.","Vikas Sinha","Eric, just let me just walk you through on the growth from Q1 to Q2, which I mentioned was very similar to Q2 to Q3. Moving from Q1 to Q2, we had $29 million growth, and there were 2 factors that contributed above and beyond just the patient growth. One was the $3.3 million in Q2 related to prior year. And so -- and the second one is that normally Q1 to Q2, Q2 gains one extra day compared to Q1. That adds another $4 million to $5 million in growth going from Q1 to Q2. So approximately the growth rate, if you look at $29 million, was approximately around $21 million, $22 million from Q1 to Q2, which was very similar to the patient growth -- patient-driven revenue growth that we experienced from Q2 to Q3. Now going towards the expenses that you were asking, cost of goods sold, we gained, based on this patent settlement and some ongoing manufacturing expenses, we will now be looking at, going forward in 2012 Q4 and onwards, at 10% level. But for Q2 -- 2012, the average, because of the first 3 quarters, will be around 11%. And in general on the operating expenses side, we saw that several factors came in. In terms of SG&A, we looked at a few factors that came in like the euro was definitely weaker in Q3 compared to Q2, and we saved some money there. We also had the integration-related expenses that came in, in Q2. We were better able to manage it going from Q3 onwards, and we saw some synergies come in within our own company. And in general, we also are looking at a very rapid expansion addition in our talent in the key functions across 30 countries to support a global growth. And over the last few quarters, we have improved our processes to recruit the most talented individuals in the territories in which we operate. And this has actually given us, on the scheduling of the hiring, given some opportunity on the savings front. And we anticipate that this will be reflected in increased future investments and corresponding revenue growth in the future.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And taxes, Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Yes. And taxes-wise, we continue with the non-GAAP rate being around 7% to 8% level, that's what we have guided right now for the year. We'll probably see similar levels in 2013. And going into 2014, we will have exhausted our NOLs and we will then move up to more towards a 28% GAAP rate, being very similar to the non-GAAP rates.","Operator","And we go next to Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess just 2 quick questions. On R&D, I just wanted to better understand, is that lower because you're actually having problems manufacturing asfotase alfa? I just wanted to better understand like how -- whether that's just being shifted out or if there's any fundamental issues there. And then just going back to aHUS, can you just give us a little bit more color on what's going on in the U.S.? I guess just everything you had to say about the comments, it seems like it's a steady progress, and that 2013 is really going to be the big driver as all these European countries come online. But just wanting to understand if you can take some of the learnings from your U.S. launch and apply a faster growth rate in Europe, or if you can do something more specific with the disease, or it's just going to be more challenging?","Vikas Sinha","Let me take the first asfotase alfa part. As you heard from David and Lenny, the launch of asfotase alfa is in 2014. And we're trying to align the production as closer to the launch as possible. So we are looking at Q4, Q1, Q2 where most of the releases of asfotase alfa will happen.","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes. And I'll just make a real quick comment. Certainly, there's no technical issues or problems with regard to the production of asfotase alfa. We continue to make pretty significant improvements in our process, and we're quite pleased with where we are.","Leonard Bell","And then in a tag team approach, Rachel, just as an introduction before David gives more color, you're absolutely right. Our U.S. launch is progressing very nicely with aHUS, and we've obviously learned an enormous amount over the last several quarters and they are really doing a fine job of serving an increasing number of patients quarter-on-quarter. And as David and I each laid out in the earlier part of the call, we anticipate, particularly with the good news on the ASMR II rating in France, we anticipate that laying out in Europe and David will give you a little more color.","David L. Hallal","Yes. Thanks, Lenny. Thanks, Rachel. So what we've learned in the U.S., obviously, is aHUS is both a hematology and a nephrology business and as such, our commercial team is focused on both specialties. We see them both contributing greatly to the diagnosis and then subsequent treatment of patients with aHUS. On top of that, obviously, I've indicated observations in the U.S. relate to a broad population of patients. Those who have had much lower prevalence than PNH, those patients who are out there with longer-term disease, being able to demonstrate and, as I mentioned at ASN, there will now be 2-year data that, over time, those patients can benefit from treatment. But at the same time, when patients present with their initial TMA clinical presentation, what easy steps can hematologists and nephrologists take to diagnose patients rapidly and initiate treatment. And I think taking those key learnings from the U.S. in 2012, we are in, obviously, ongoing sharing of information from U.S. observations with our European team, who is now -- they are now beginning to expand their field teams and preparing for, as we mentioned, a launch by mid-2013.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I've got a couple for you on aHUS and one on asfotase alfa. aHUS, it seems like the awareness is pretty high in Europe, from what you guys are talking about, especially with expanded access. And is there a reason to expect a bolus of reimbursable patients as we progress through next year, not really a steady addition? And then the question on asfotase alfa is that in the juvenile protocols, is there anything you guys have learned when you finalize this? And really, since the deal that helps inform your strategy for carving the more adult patient population?","Leonard Bell","David, you want to address the aHUS and then Steve?","David L. Hallal","Sure. So Geoff, no, we wouldn't expect a bolus. And I think as we've indicated now on several occasions, that it's expected that we would see addition to patients over time, and that, that would be gradual, due to the much lower prevalence of the disease. Nonetheless, our observations in the U.S. certainly encourage us, that we'll have the opportunity to serve an increasing number of children and adults over time, and we would expect that pattern to follow in Europe as we get started.","Leonard Bell","Obviously, just to layer in one last thing as, certainly, Europe itself will be layered as -- it'll go, country by country. So in addition to no bolus in a particular country, there will be no European bolus because of the series of country initiations.","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes, just to make a comment on the juvenile program for asfotase alfa. Obviously, after the acquisition, we acquainted ourselves with a lot of the KOLs and the physicians that see these patients, with a fairly deep dive into the clinical data, from both the infant trial as well as the juvenile trial. I think we came away with that -- from those discussions believing that a placebo-controlled trial will probably be important. I think it will strengthen overall, our program. I think we've looked hard at the clinical profile of the patients in the juvenile trial, where about half the patients have been diagnosed before the age of 5. The other half were after the age of 5. I think what's very important to note is that the drug worked very, very well in both populations of patients, meaning that we can look at a more severe patient population going forward, which is probably something we will do. But we're meeting with those KOLs now to finalize the program, and we'll meet with regulators in the early part of '13 to get this trial moving by mid-'13.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Salveen Richter with Canaccord.","Salveen J. Richter - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I just have 2 pipeline questions. So one is, in terms of NMO, what specific population here are you targeting in terms of severity of disease with relapses in the Phase III? And then could the immunosuppressants here have effect, that the patients were on, in the process study, that we saw have affected the vaccine for meningitis? Just wanted to get some color on that. And then secondly, asfotase alfa, the Phase II, III infant study that's ongoing, should we expect data for that by year end next year?","Stephen P. Squinto","All right, so we have patient population, the infection and what was the third part of your question?","Salveen J. Richter - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Just the pediatric data for asfotase alfa.","Stephen P. Squinto","Okay. All right, so let's take it one by one. So in terms of patient population and NMO, I think the good news is, I think we learned from this relatively small 14-patient investigator-initiated trial, that the drug seems to have a pretty strong efficacy signal in a pretty ill population of NMO patients. About half of those patients were completely refractory to the immunosuppressive therapies that they were on prior to eculizumab. So I think you can look for us to go into a very severe refractory population of NMO patients moving forward, as we lay out placebo-controlled trial. The second part was, sorry?","Leonard Bell","Could the immunosuppressives have altered the vaccines...","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes. No, I don't think that's probably the case. I think there was one patient that did develop a meningococcal infection. They were vaccinated with a quadrivalent vaccine. It turns out that they were infected with the serotype b, which the vaccine doesn't cover. We've done studies and we are doing studies in transplant as well, where patients are very severely immunosuppressed, and we've not seen a signal in terms of meningococcal infections. So I don't really think it was the immunosuppressive therapies. I mean, this just happens in a very, very small number of patients. We do see once in a while, a breakthrough from vaccine. And then the last question was the...","Leonard Bell","Timing of the infant natural history study.","Leonard Bell","Yes, I would look to, hope to see some data maybe mid-'13.","Salveen J. Richter - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Actually, sorry, it was timing on the infant Phase II, III study that you're going to use to file on.","Stephen P. Squinto","The study -- sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question. We have actually reported out, actually, it was in the New England Journal of Medicine, the infant study data. Those patients are in an extension study. And in addition to that, we have a trial going, a 10-10 trial going for very severe patients, which we'll probably get a read on next year as well.","Operator","And we go next to Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A question on 1101 -- sorry 1102, 1103. I'm just wondering your latest views, now that it looks like you have a subcu formulation there, on the future role of this agent, where you envision that, putting it in? What the role might be, both for an IV and\/or a subcu form? And how maybe the half-life versus the eculizumab, and the formulation might influence where this might move forward?","Stephen P. Squinto","I think, as you know, the trial is still ongoing so it's a little early to comment on the data. I think we're encouraged. I think, what I can say so far is, it looks to be relatively safe in a small number of patients that are in the trial. I think, as we have said probably in the past, we believe the subcu formulation will probably be the more important formulation, potentially going forward in development, as we look to commercialize the product as well.","Operator","And we go next to Ying Huang with Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First of all, can you give us a little bit color in terms of the breakdown for aHUS patients in the U.S.? Now you have about one year experience in the U.S. marketplace, do you have more pediatric patients than adult patients on therapy? And then secondly, is it your intention to run the NMO trial next year as a pivotal trial here? And then lastly  if you could provide any comment on ViroPharma's C1 inhibitor in PNH, they intend to do some work over there?","Leonard Bell","Yes. So as I mentioned during the call, we are currently serving both pediatric and adult patients with aHUS but we do not provide specific breakdown on patients. Steve?","Stephen P. Squinto","I think the second question was related to NMO and whether the next trial would be a pivotal trial. I think, as we said in the call this morning, where we are with the program, we're encouraged by the 14-patient data. We're meeting with investigators that will hopefully participate in our next trial, really around the globe. And we expect to meet with regulators to talk about this program as well, and hopefully initiate this trial by mid-'13. But until we have discussions with regulators, it's impossible to comment on what the next trial will be.","Leonard Bell","Was there another third part of the first question?","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, can you provide your comment on the ViroPharma's C1 inhibitor program for PNH?","Leonard Bell","Well, there's no clinical program that I'm aware of for ViroPharma for PNH. There are obviously data, looking at calacrine inhibitors like that, at very, very high doses, trying to block complement and the data is published, suggests perhaps a lot more drug required to block complement than to block other enzymes that are apparently useful in HAE, so that's the only comment I can make, just from the published literature. Steve, do you have any further comments or...?","Stephen P. Squinto","No, I don't. I think that pretty much covers it.","Leonard Bell","Yes, so a lot of drug to block complement in upstream part, for which a good part of the immune system that protects us is downstream. So that's what science is about, and we'll see.","Stephen P. Squinto","I think maybe the only comment is I think what we've learned from an enormous amount of clinical experience now that we have, with the complement blocker, is the critical need to absolutely shut down the complement system and not leave even a little bit left. We've learned that the hard way over the years, but an important lesson.","Leonard Bell","That's well described in PNH, sort of partial complement blockade, is probably somewhat worse than no complement blockade.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We go next to Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's on NMO. Steve, you mentioned the reduction of attacks in the period after cessation of dosing. Do these data teach us anything with respect to whether or not it should be dosed for a defined period of time versus chronic dosing? And then related on NMO, do you think that there's an argument here for the use of your drug to prevent disability and blindness in NMO, as opposed to stabilizing established disease in severe patients? I mean, I realize this may run counter to your focus on severe, ultra-rare disease, but it seems like a reasonable question raised by an investigator.","Stephen P. Squinto","I think, to take the first part of the question, I think what the data suggests, when patients come off of eculizumab, there were several patients that experienced a re-exacerbation of their disease, I think, really highlights, what I said this morning on the call. And I think maybe Lenny also said the same thing, that these patients really have -- are experiencing chronic uncontrolled complement activation. This is an autoimmune disease, complement is sort of constantly on in this disease and so it's really, in my view, maybe not that surprising that when you release complement inhibition, that they're now susceptible to yet another attack. And the problem is, in NMO, maybe unlike in MS, for example, each attack could be devastating, could lead to blindness and\/or paralysis. So I would imagine we're going to start to look at this as chronic therapy for NMO. Second part of your question, I forgot...","Leonard Bell","Certainly, we made clear, as Steve said, to clear as well, in his description of the current NMO investigator study which is that 1\/2 the patients were refractory to all of the therapies they had tried. We find, really, as a mission, as we've laid out very clearly, those are the types of patients that we seek to focus on, those patients who really have no other possible outcome and there may be other approaches that others would take or that we would take but, frankly, for us, this is what we're well-focused on and we will remain focused there.","Operator","And we go next to Geoff Porges with Bernstein Research.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","One question, Vikas, spectacular operating margin performance this quarter. And it sounds as though you're guiding that operating margins will be down somewhat in Q4. But can you stay in the sort of low to mid-40% range going forward, as you look at all the different dynamics and moving parts in the business?","Vikas Sinha","That's a very good question, Geoff. But the thing is, we have to look at it from the right investments in the company. And as we embark into our growth strategies and also fund our research and development. So as we had mentioned earlier, to our operating margin targets next year is to achieve 40% for sure, and we will be focused in achieving that.","Operator","For our next question, we go to Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.","M. Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just on, I guess, on the pipeline front on 1102, 1103, maybe following up on Brian's questions. I guess, you've given us some sense of what the differences are going to be from an administration standpoint. But I -- I've always remembered you mentioned that there are other goals in mind in developing a follow-on, and I was hoping you could maybe just share some of those from a product profile perspective and potentially from a therapeutic perspective.","Stephen P. Squinto","I would say, if I understood your question correctly, you're sort of asking, I think, more broadly about a life cycle management plan, which is a good question. I think we take sort of a multipronged approach to life cycle management. We are working very, very hard on alternative versions of eculizumab that could potentially serve as follow-on products. We look at ALXN1102 and 1103 as part of that overall life cycle management program. And I guess, earlier in the development phase, our research group continues to focus its efforts on new and improved complement blocking approaches as well, given the long history we've had as a complement inhibition company. So I think it's really a multifaceted approach to life cycle management.","Operator","And we go next to John Sonnier with William Blair.","John S. Sonnier - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Here's the first one, Lenny, 5 years or so into the launch in PNH, what have you learned about, I guess, the realistic ability to identify a population of patients, misdiagnosis? Also I'm trying to get at, maybe you have somewhere in the ballpark of 2,500 patients or so on now, how big globally, do you think the addressable market is?","Leonard Bell","I think what we've learned is we've essentially relearned what we kind of thought was true 5, 6 years ago, which is that the limiting factor, unfortunately, for patients with severe, life-threatening, rare diseases, very rare diseases, the limiting factor for their treatment is that the medical community has a relatively low awareness and that improving their awareness and education in understanding the disease, improves the identification of patients and then the decision by physicians about who should be treated or not treated. So that's facts we thought were true 5, 6, 7 years ago and, I think, probably every day, we re-learn that, that's actually true. So we're not sure that we learned anything there new, other than it continues to be true. And I think that really is aligned with all ultra-rare disorders, not just PNH. And that's why we continue to have steady additions of patients here, 20-some-odd quarters out there, and we continue to anticipate and expect and forecast going forward. So we are driving there, and at the same time, as David described, as we're also moving into new countries and though we expect it will be the same slow rate, steady as she goes in each of those new countries and that's what we anticipate doing over the next substantial period of time.","John S. Sonnier - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So globally, how big do you think the addressable population is now?","Leonard Bell","We don't really provide that type of guidance, actually. But I think certainly, we're demonstrating now that most of what we serve, obviously, are PNH patients and we're also quite confident that, well less than 1\/2 the patients are currently served in the areas where we are active.","David L. Hallal","Yes. I think as I've stated before, even in the countries where we've been operating the longest, what we're encouraged by and what drives us is that each quarter, we are identifying similar numbers of patients. And those patients tend to have a broad range of severity of disease. So we see over time, patients who are very sick with PNH who probably have the disease for some time, are being newly diagnosed and then advanced to treatment. And that clearly gives us a conviction on the opportunity moving forward.","John S. Sonnier - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","That's actually helpful. And then real quick for Vikas, a lot of questions about expenses. I guess mine is a little bit different. You're essentially guiding $25 million lower than you were on July 25. So my question is what's not happening operationally, that maybe you expected would be happening?","Vikas Sinha","So a few things that -- as I mentioned earlier, when Eric had asked the same question is, obviously, we definitely got some synergies out of the acquisition and integration, that was one, and that's generating some value towards the end. But also, as we have mentioned, some timing on the asfotase alfa production and releases. And third, as we mentioned, is the headcount growth planning, as we have refocused and looked at bringing in -- improving our processes to bring in more talented people in the company, it definitely has generated some space for us. And one more thing, lastly, I must say about this, the cost of goods improvement by 1% also contributes to that.","Operator","And we go next to Howard Liang with Leerink Swann.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Just on NMO. If I heard Steve correctly, I think he said that it will be -- the next will be a placebo-controlled trial in severe population and it seems like placebo may not be necessarily consistent with the severe patient. Is the population defined by the severity or previous treatment?","Stephen P. Squinto","Well, I think it will be placebo on top of standard of care. It will be in severely affected NMO patients. I think having a control arm is going to be required, moving forward, in terms of our discussions with the regulators, although we have had those discussions, that's our anticipation that, that will be necessary to continue the development of the program.","Operator","And for our final question, we go to Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just real quick, I don't think I caught you mentioning TT30, and I'm just wondering if you can give an update on when we might see data and the importance of that product in the life cycle management?","Stephen P. Squinto","So TT30 is referred to now as ALXN1102 and 1103. 1102 is the IV formulation, which was the initial formulation that Taligen had developed. We now have a subcu formulation of the product as well. Both formulations are currently being tested in clinical development. The trial is continuing and enrolling, so really can't comment on the data from the trial. As I said earlier, to someone else who asked the question. What I can say is so far, the drug is proving to be very safe in a small number of patients, which is very encouraging. So I think we can maybe look forward to having something to report out next year.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question. This concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Elena Ridloff, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's second quarter 2017 performance and strategic update.","Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Dave Anderson, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul Clancy, who will assume the CFO position on July 31; Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial Officer; and John Orloff, our Head of R&D. You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website.","Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today, and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after the call. I'd also like to remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, our GAAP results.","Thank you. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Elena, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We have an important agenda today. We will report on the strong second quarter performance and discuss our strategy that will drive our next phase of growth.","Before we get started, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to our new executives on today's call. Paul Clancy, who will assume the CFO role at the end of the month; Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial officer; and John Orloff, Head of R&D.","Starting on slide 5, I want to start by discussing four key areas that we focused on during the second quarter. First, we continued our focus on execution and serving patients, which led to strong Q2 commercial, R&D and financial performance. Second, we strengthened our leadership team, bringing in highly qualified, talented and experienced executives to complement the strong team already in place. Each of our executives is highly engaged and aligned on our strategy.","Third, we conducted a comprehensive review of the business. It will be moving quickly to realign the organization with our focus strategy in the third quarter. And fourth, we have further enhanced Alexion's strong commitment to compliance and culture. We've made changes in our policies, processes and governance to reinforce our commitment to the highest ethical standards.","Continued execution generate a strong commercial and financial performance in the quarter, as shown on slide 6, including year-over-year revenue growth of 21%, volume growth of 23% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 38%. Second quarter revenue reflected a benefit of approximately $35 million due to favorable timing of orders compared to our prior forecast. To reflect the strength of the first half of the year and outlook for the remainder of the year, we're raising our 2017 guidance. Dave will provide a full financial update later in the call.","Our commercial performance in Q2 was driven primarily by continued strength in our Soliris franchise across geographies and continued momentum of Strensiq. We also assessed our Kanuma strategy and made important changes, which Brian will discuss later in the call. On the R&D side, we received a positive CHMP opinion for Soliris for refractory gMG and advance a ALXN1210 development program. We are also very pleased to have completed enrollment in the Phase 3 PNH na\u00efve study, and expect data early in the second quarter of 2018.","We also initiated enrollment in the PNH Switch study in the second quarter and expect to complete enrollment in Q3. The Phase 3 study in patients with aHUS is approximately 25% enrolled and we expect to complete enrollment in early 2018. We're not targeting an approval of ALXN1210 IV in patients with PNH in the first half of 2019.","The second quarter results position us well for a strong 2017. We are in a great position to build on our strength by implementing a well-defined and disciplined strategy to generate long-term growth with a clear goal of delivering increased value for our shareholders.","Turning to slide 7, we have been working to evaluate how we can strengthen Alexion building on our strong foundation. Four key areas will be instrumental to our success. First, we continue to see meaningful opportunities to grow and maximize our rare diseases business. This includes growing Soliris, Strensiq and Kanuma, extending our leadership position in complements and more effectively leveraging our IP, infrastructure and global operating platform. Second, to enhance productivity, we will focus internal research efforts on our complement expertise and development efforts on our core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders.","Third, we will pursue disciplined business development with the focus on clinical stage programs to expand our pipeline. And fourth, we see an opportunity to optimize our infrastructure to deliver margin expansion, EPS growth and increased cash flow in the near and long-term.","Focusing on these key drivers will help us reach our financial goals of delivering continued double-digit revenue growth, increase operating margins and growing EPS faster than revenue. We're building a company that is anchored by a culture of compliance and driven by passion and dedication to patients. With the clear strategic roadmap in place, I believe that Alexion is well positioned to achieve our ambition of being the global leader in rare diseases.","I will provide more details on our strategy later in the call, but first let me turn it over to Dave to review the second quarter financials. Dave?","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Ludwig, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with a few comments on the strong performance that Ludwig highlighted, which combined with the strong first quarter that we've already delivered represents a great start to 2017 and sets us up well for the remainder of 2017.","Starting with slide number 9, we're clearly pleased with the continued strong revenue and EPS performance of the business, as our employees remain focused on our core mission. Total reported revenues of $912 million for the quarter grew 21% year-over-year.","Let me just take a few minutes to walk you through some of the factors that contributed to the strength of this quarter.","First, we saw strong volume growth.","Second, the quarter reflected a benefit of approximately $35 million due to favorable timing of orders compared to our prior forecast. This is important, I'm going to come back to that and give you a little bit more color on that in a moment.","And third, while we're able to rapidly complete the enrollment of the ALXN1210 PNH na\u00efve study, the revenue impact to Soliris was lower than we expected due to the timing, ramp and geographic mix of that enrollment. We're also very pleased with the second quarter non-GAAP EPS of $1.56 per share, a growth of 38% year-over-year.","Moving to slide 10, you can see on the left-hand side of slide 10, our product sales were driven by growth across all geographies particularly highlighted by growth in the U.S. Looking at the right side of the slide, you can see we delivered a 23% increase in volume partially offset by currency headwinds of 2% compared to the same period last year. And importantly, price was flat in the quarter, however, we expect that headwind to increase in the second half, and again I'll take you through that in a little more detail.","Turning to slide 11, you see we're now providing sales by product and by geography. Soliris revenue was $814 million and year-over-year volume growth was 18%, driven by growth across geographies in both PNH and aHUS. And as a reminder, Soliris revenue in the quarter included approximately $35 million benefit due to the favorable timing of orders compared to our prior forecast. We reported Strensiq revenue of $83 million, which benefited from patients, starting treatment in previous quarters, as well as new patient additions.","Looking at Kanuma, we achieved revenues of $15 million. The quarter also benefited from patients starting treatment in Kanuma in previous quarters, as well as new patient starts. And during the second quarter, we assessed the carrying value of Kanuma. And as of June 30, there is no impairment based on our current estimated undiscounted net cash flows compared to the net book value associated with Kanuma.","Turning to operating margin on slide 12, during the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 47%, which benefited from strong volume growth, the favorable timing of orders compared to our prior forecast and also the focus on operating expenses. Non-GAAP R&D was $179 million and 20% of total revenue. The increased R&D spend year-over-year compared to the second quarter of 2016 was largely due to investments in ALXN1210.","Non-GAAP SG&A in the quarter was $227 million, a 25% of total revenue. The year-over-year increase in SG&A was partly attributable to infrastructure spend, inclusive of legal, compliance and IT expenses and you've heard us talk about that before.","Non-GAAP EPS of $1.56 per diluted share grew 38% year-over-year. The EPS growth in the quarter largely reflects strong revenue growth, but also in operating leverage. In addition, we generated over $410 million in free cash flow and repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares during the second quarter.","Briefly on GAAP EPS, we reported second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.73 per diluted share, which included the recognition of an impairment of $31 million related to our SBC-103 acquired in-process research and development asset. As such, the SBC-103 asset has now been fully written off.","So now, let's turn to slide 13. I want to provide some context around our expectations for the second half. The left side gives you a summary of the strengths of the first half; importantly, the right side highlights the dynamics for the second half of the year. First, we expect continued underlying volume growth. However, we're expecting Soliris revenues to be lower in the second half of the year when taking into account the favorable order timing in the second quarter as well as an accelerating impact from the ALXN1210 trials.","The ALXN1210 headwind increases in the second half are due in large part to the PNH Switch study. In addition, we now assume a full-year pricing headwind of 2% to 3% versus our prior assumption of 1% to 2%. This translates to approximately a 4% headwind of pricing in the second half with nearly two-thirds of that headwind attributable to Strensiq.","Last quarter, we indicated that we expected Strensiq revenue per patient to be less than 2016, as a result of both pricing assumptions and younger patients initiating treatment compared to our first year of launch. We did not see these two factors materialize significantly in the second quarter as we previously expected. But since we're seeing a consistent proportion of higher dose patients, we're in the process of working with payors in the U.S. to better align the value across those patients. As a result, we expect more limited sequential revenue growth in the third quarter with sequential growth increasing in the fourth quarter to a level similar to what we saw in the second half of 2016.","For Soliris, we anticipate full-year pricing headwind of approximately 1%, which is consistent with our prior forecast and what we've experienced in the past. So, taking a step back, we continue to expect annual pricing headwinds in the low single-digits longer term. If you factor in all of these considerations for the second half of the year, we expect operating margins to be below the full-year guidance range and for EPS growth year-over-year in the second half to be in the single digits.","So with this background, let's turn now to slide 14 on the full-year guidance. We're raising our 2017 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the strength of the underlying business as well as the timing of orders. And importantly, our internal forecast remains at the midpoint of guidance, and it's a process that Paul and I have jointly developed and are providing today.","We're raising total revenues to be between $3.45 billion and $3.525 billion, up from our prior guidance of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. At the midpoint, this represents 13% total revenue growth year-over-year. It includes an updated estimate of $40 million to $50 million of currency headwinds, and it also includes our expectations for the impact of ALXN1210 and other trials on Soliris. If you exclude these headwinds, revenue growth would be approximately 17%.","For Soliris, we're raising our revenue guidance to $3.075 billion to $3.125 billion compared to our prior guidance of $3.025 billion to $3.1 billion. This assumes we'll continue to identify a steady number of new patients with PNH and aHUS globally. We now estimate the ongoing ALXN1210 trials as well as other studies will have between a $70 million and $100 million impact on Soliris revenue for the full year compared to our prior assumption of $70 million to $110 million. In the first half, we estimate the impact from these trials was approximately $20 million.","Turning now to metabolics, we're reiterating our guidance of $375 million to $400 million for the full-year as we continue to identify new patients with HPP and LAL-D. We're also reiterating our non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 43% to 44% and increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.55 from the previous range of $5.10 to $5.30. This increase in EPS guidance represents approximately 19% growth at the midpoint of the range. And by the way, the guide range assumes a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 13% to 14%.","So, let me just wrap by saying, we're obviously very impressed with the strength of the first half business performance of Alexion and the commitment that has been demonstrated by the organization. The company is well positioned as I hand the CFO role over to Paul.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brian for the commercial update.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. I am excited to be back in rare diseases, and I'm really pleased to be leading the commercial organization at Alexion. Since joining, I've been struck by the profound impact that our therapies have on patients and their families. And I've spent much time with the commercial team and out in the field, and I'm very impressed with the strong focus and commitment that this team has on serving patients with rare and devastating diseases.","I want to start by sharing the commercial highlights from the quarter, starting with Soliris on slide 16. Our global commercial operations continued to serve more patients with PNH and aHUS during the quarter leading to 18% volume growth over the second quarter of 2016. In PNH, we're still seeing that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed and still believe that the majority of patients with PNH have yet to initiate treatment. In aHUS, we continue to see a growing number of new patients starting on Soliris, and believe that the opportunity with aHUS is even greater than that of PNH. We're very pleased with the Soliris performance and expect continued growth ahead of us in both PNH and aHUS, even as we're simultaneously enrolling patients into the ALXN1210 trials.","Turning to our metabolic therapies and starting with Strensiq, in Q2 we continued to identify new patients with HPP in the U.S., Germany and Japan. And earlier this month, we were pleased to announce that we reached a national funding agreement with NICE and NHS England, based on a Managed Access Agreement, which provides access to Strensiq for patients in England with pediatric-onset HPP in most need of treatment regardless of their current age.","This decision to provide access to Strensiq is an important milestone for patients in England in their families, and we're working diligently to ensure that patients with HPP in other countries also have access to the transformative benefits of Strensiq.","Looking at Kanuma, we continue to believe that there is a significantly under diagnosed LAL-D patient population who can benefit from Kanuma. To improve the diagnosis in treatment of patients with LAL-D, we've made strategic adjustments to our commercial initiatives. First, we've expanded lab testing to target in enriched patient population that are at likelihood for having LAL-D, such as those with NASH or NAFLD and FH who have elevated ALT and LDL levels.","We've also established additional lab partnerships to drive an increase in testing. And second, we've split the metabolic field team and now have dedicated sales teams for both Strensiq and Kanuma in the U.S. and Germany.","We believe these changes will have a positive impact on patient identification, and we'll be monitoring and rapidly adjusting as we assess the effective on Kanuma performance. In addition, outside of the U.S., we're continuing to progress the funding processes in additional European countries to secure access later this year and into 2018.","Turning to slide 17. Our next avenue of growth for Soliris will come with potential launch in patients with refractory gMG, which will enable us to enter the neurology therapeutic area. Now as a reminder, despite existing treatment options, patients with refractory gMG have difficulties walking, talking, swallowing and even breathing.","Exacerbations and crises of their disease may require hospitalization and intensive care and maybe life-threatening. If approved, Soliris will be the first and only complement based therapy to treat refractory gMG.","In Q2, we were pleased to receive a positive CHMP opinion for Soliris for the treatment of patients with refractory gMG who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive in the European Union, and we expect a final decision from the European Commission in the third quarter.","In the U.S., the FDA accepted our supplemental biologics license application and set a PDUFA date of October 23. And in Japan, our supplemental New Drug Application was accepted for review by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, and we expect a decision in early 2018.","So, our commercial organization is now preparing to serve patients with refractory gMG in the U.S., Germany and Japan. We're building a specialized and dedicated field team to educate neurologist who manage patients with refractory gMG, including neuromuscular specialist on the critical role of complement-mediated destruction of the neuromuscular junction as well as the benefits of complement inhibition with Soliris.","Our focus is shown in slide 18, will also be on patients diagnosed with anti-AChR positive refractory gMG, which represent approximately 5% to 10% of the total MG population. And we estimate the total MG population to be 60,000 to 80,000 patients in the U.S. Based on what we observed in the Phase 3 REGAIN study, we estimate that approximately 60% of these refractory gMG patients will respond to treatment with Soliris.","We look forward to working with regulators to bring this potentially life-transforming treatment to patients with refractory gMG who are anti-AChR antibody-positive and who are in urgent need of effective treatment.","So, to close, I'm very pleased with the commercial team's performance in the second quarter, and believe we're well positioned to deliver continued growth in the remainder of 2017 and beyond.","And with that, I'll now turn it back to Ludwig. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. I would now like to report on the progress of our business review and the steps we're taking to drive the future growth and profitability of Alexion.","First, I want to make it clear that we are not changing our longstanding mission which is to bring hope to patients and families affected by rare diseases by delivering innovative life-changing therapies. This is a legacy of which we're extremely proud and which will continue to define who we are and what we do.","We will be making improvements to how we operate and executing on a refocused corporate strategy to be the leader in rare diseases. We will leverage our expertise in complement and our capabilities in hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolics to bring life-changing therapies to patients. This strategy will strengthen Alexion and drive long-term growth, greater efficiency and increased profitability.","As I mentioned earlier, our strategic roadmap, as shown on slide 21, is focused on four objectives. Growing our rare disease business, focusing research on a complement expertise and development on our core therapeutic areas, pursuing disciplined business development to expand the pipeline, and optimizing our infrastructure to deliver margin expansion, EPS growth and increase cash flow.","I will discuss our plans to grow our leadership in complement and expand our metabolic footprint. I will turn it over to John for a closer look at the R&D strategy, followed by Paul who will discuss our financial ambitions.","So turning to slide 22, let's look more closely at how we will grow our rare disease business. As you heard from Brian, Soliris provides an exceptional foundation as we continue to grow year-after-year. We're also excited about the potential new indications with Soliris in patients with refractory gMG and NMO. To drive continued innovation, we're rapidly progressing the development of ALXN1210, our next-generation C5 inhibitor that has the potential to address important patient needs.","I'm very pleased with the progress in enrolling the ALXN1210 IV studies. We're targeting an approval in PNH in the first half of 2019. To provide more optionality for patients, we're also in the process of engaging with regulators on the registration program to support approval for a high concentration formulation of ALXN1210 subcu and look forward to providing an update on this program later in the year. Our ambition is to establish ALXN1210 as the new standard of care for patients with PNH and aHUS and expand to additional indications.","The other existing complement programs we see a significant opportunity to expand into new indications. We are also advancing developments of multiple preclinical complement inhibitors with novel mechanism of actions. Our strategy, moving forward, will be to expand from the ultra-rare disease space to rare diseases, which will open opportunities to further explore new indications within our core therapeutic areas.","As we continue to grow our complement franchise, we also continue to strengthen our global patent position for both Soliris and ALXN1210. As shown on slide 23, we have strong IP for Soliris, which was further strengthened in Q2 when we received three additional notices of allowance for patents that, if issued, will provide important additional protection from biosimilars through 2027. For ALXN1210, our composition of matter patent is in effect until 2035, and is issued in more than 40 countries.","Beyond complements and turning to slide 24, we're continuing to expand our global metabolic access. Strensiq is a key driver of growth as we continue to identify and serve new patients with HPP and expand access as we progress funding agreements.","With Kanuma, we have assessed our strategy and are taking immediate action to drive improved results. As Brian mentioned, changes are being implemented to more quickly identified patients with LAL-D, and we are also in active discussions with governments to expand access in key European countries. We believe in a transformative benefit of Kanuma and will continue to evaluate its long-term potential and the impact of the changes.","I will now turn the call to John to discuss R&D strategy. This is an area where we have focused a lot of attention as we recognize that we need to deliver enhanced productivity to drive long-term growth. John?","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Ludwig. And let me start by saying that I'm honored to be part of the Alexion team and have been impressed with the talent and depth of expertise within the R&D organization and their dedication to our mission.","I've had a busy first month working with Ludwig and others in the R&D organization, evaluating the optimal strategy to advance our rare disease pipeline to position Alexion for its next chapter of growth to serve more patients.","Turning to slide 25, our refocused R&D strategy will, first of all, focus on our core expertise to grow our leadership in complement, drive greater R&D efficiencies and returns and execute on disciplined business development to build a portfolio that is diversified by stage and risk.","First, starting with our leadership in complement on slide 26, we will apply our more than 20 years of experience and expertise in complement biology to pursue novel molecules and targets in the complement cascade and expand into new complement indications within hematology, nephrology and neurology.","We've evaluated over 90 complement-mediated rare disorders and are targeting to initiate up to two proof-of-concept studies in 2018 with ALXN1210 in additional indications beyond the Soliris therapeutic footprint. We will also leverage our proprietary bioinformatics to strengthen disease understanding and provide insights into the epidemiology of rare diseases.","Second and moving to slide 27, we will drive greater R&D efficiency and returns. R&D efforts will continue to leverage our rare disease drug development capabilities to rapidly progress our pipeline programs. Moving forward, we will focus our internal research on complement and our development activities in core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders which we believe will enhance productivity. We have decided to out-license or discontinue programs that are outside of our strategic focus. To that end, we are in the process of seeking to out-license our immuno-oncology program, samalizumab as well as ALXN1101, or cyclic PMP replacement therapy for patients with MoCD Type A, and are terminating certain partnerships including Moderna, Arbutus and Blueprint.","And third, now that we have prioritized the pipeline with our strategic focus, we will pursue disciplined business development to build the pipeline over time that is diversified by clinical stage and risk. Our BD strategy is to strengthen our complement portfolio and additional complement targets, identify non-complement assets primarily in our disease areas of focus and target clinical stage opportunities.","Turning briefly to slide 29, our current pipeline now focuses on our core strength and complement. With the strategic parameters in place, I'm confident that we'll be able to build a leading rare disease pipeline. I look forward to providing an update on future calls.","Now, I'll turn it over to Paul to comment on our financial goals.","Paul Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, John. I also am extremely excited to have joined Alexion and very much look forward to working with the senior team in the entire organization to tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead. Over the last month, I've been working closely with Dave and the finance team to establish our 2017 guidance and evaluate the business.","Moving to slide 30, we've outlined the potential areas to optimize the infrastructure of the company. As you know, over the last four years, operating expenses have grown at or above revenue growth. Inefficiencies have crept into the business. The result has hampered operating margin expansion and we do feel there is a clear need in opportunity to address the inefficiencies.","John outlined the refocused R&D pipeline. We'll further align our R&D infrastructure and spend with that new focus. Additionally, we're looking at the entire operating expense base and expect opportunities for cost reduction in SG&A and operations. We expect to provide the full set of actions prior to the end of the third quarter that will position us to deliver non-GAAP operating margin of 50% in 2019.","Turning to slide 31, we've outlined the ambitions for our financial profile over the next three years. As the company has outlined previously, we see the business capable of double-digit revenue growth over the 2017 to 2019 time period. As Dave shared, the ALXN1210 enrollment will be a headwind for the balance of this year. And we expect this will also impact 2018, a welcome headwind nonetheless.","We're planning for the launch of gMG and continued patient additions for Strensiq (34:53), which combined provide revenue momentum over the next few years. Our revenue outlook assumes relatively constant FX and low single-digit price declines. The actions outlined by John for the R&D portfolio will result in operating leverage. We're targeting R&D spend of 18% to 19% of sales in 2018 and 2019. Importantly, included in this thinking is a reinvestment earmarked for business development and additional complement programs.","With these anticipated infrastructure savings, we expect operating margin growing to 50% in 2019 in leverage from the top line to the non-GAAP bottom line. This articulates a pragmatic three-year financial profile, which invests in the pipeline and provides operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share momentum.","Moving to slide 32, as or more importantly, we plan to be focused on creating long-term intrinsic value through all elements of the strategic roadmap, including disciplined capital allocation; and, I look forward to working closely with Ludwig and the board on this.","I'll now turn the call back to Ludwig.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. I would like to extend a sincere thank you to Dave Anderson, who has made significant contributions to Alexion since becoming CFO last December. We wish Dave all the best in the future.","Let me conclude today's call by saying that I'm confident we're on the right path to unlock significant value. We have a clear strategy that is designed to deliver innovation and sustainable shareholder return. I believe that Alexion is well positioned to achieve our ambition of being the global leader in rare diseases.","I would like to thank our talented employees for their dedication to our mission. Together, we aspire to bring hope and innovation to the families affected by rare diseases who are counting on us. I look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls.","We will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we will now turn to the question-and-answer portion of our call. Our first question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead, sir.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Congrats to the Alexion team for all the progress that you've made here in the last quarter. Maybe for John, could you just sort of map out the type and, in particular, the scale of R&D pipeline that you think a company of Alexion's size should have in the future? And maybe as a quick throw-in question, do you expect an AdComm meeting for Soliris in MG? Thank you.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","To answer the \u2013 thanks for the question \u2013 the last question first, so far, our review at FDA is progressing. We have an action date in October, and we've not been notified about an AdComm. So right now, we're not planning one.","With regard to the overall R&D strategy, I think what you heard is that we've pruned the pipeline to create the space for us to bring in additional assets to further balance the portfolio, particularly clinical stage assets that will fill our early and mid-stage clinical pipeline in the therapeutic areas of focus, say, hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders, and diversify the risk. And as Paul noted, we're targeting overall R&D spend of 18% to 19%, and that includes the buy-up opportunities for internal programs and additional indications in complement as well as external BD in-licensing opportunities.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. It's important to mention that our business development is going to be very disciplined, and that we have very strong fundamentals. So, we're going to make sure that we apply the right filters and that we're going to make the right decisions here.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for all this color today, and the breakout in geography is awesome. And, hey Paul; and, I'm really sad to see you go, Dave. I guess I'm just curious when you discontinued some of these partnerships, I think we're trying to get a grasp on how you're thinking about future partnerships and arrangements. So, I guess, what kind of drove decisions around some of the ones that you discontinued? Thanks.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, this is John, again. I think this is really driven by our new strategy for focusing on our core areas in complement, as well as in the therapeutic areas of focus. And for strategic reasons, we decided to discontinue those programs. It doesn't say anything about our assessment of those technologies.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question, and also for the helpful update strategy wise. So, Ludwig, for the BD strategy, I know difficult to be precise, but would you view the Enobia deal that brought in Strensiq as a model for future deals? I'm just trying to think here more of an in-licensing or earn-out versus a bigger cash deal.","And then, second question for ALXN1210, obviously, we have to see final data, but would you guys view the ultimate launch as an opportunity to reset with payors outside the U.S.? Just trying to think of some of the geographies where you've had some issues more recently? Thank you.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","With respect to the BD strategy, we're going to work on this cross-functionally. So there is a financial piece that the strategy, there is a medical piece to it. We're going to be very disciplined with what we're going to do. Our objective is to bringing assets in the clinic that could be a pre-POC or post-POC. As you know, we have healthy fundamentals. We believe that our revenue can grow double-digit in the next years to come with our current portfolio. If we deliver on MG, hopefully, we can do NMO. So, we're going to be very much disciplined there. Paul is going to play a critical role on the BD side. Paul?","Paul Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Geoff. I mean, to your specific question, I think, in retrospect Enobia looks perfectly on strategy and great return on invested capital. So, I would say, just to echo what John, Ludwig has said is, again, this looks like a combination of licensing, partnership, tuck-in acquisitions kind of in that Phase 1, Phase 2 sweet spot. Complement will likely be \u2013 we'll look at opportunities there, but the companies expertise, best that I can tell is, really strong there, so that's a high bar. So, looking at the other kind of rare disease areas in those areas of interest is probably were guided by and I think, we're all excited to kind of get going on that.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. And on the payors side, Brian?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. For ALXN1210, and good morning, Geoff, this is Brian. First of all, I would just say that we see this is a truly exciting product in our future. And we're really encouraged by the progress that you heard about that John and his team are making in terms of the clinical development. The way that we think about ALXN1210 is, it's a next-gen C5 inhibitor. Our ambition is obviously to make this the new standard of care for complement inhibition.","And the obviously benefit that we expect will come out of the clinical program is this transformation moving from two-week treatment to eight-week treatment. The way we think about the future of ALXN1210 is, the clinical benefits we believe can go well beyond that. And we will continue to focus on lifecycle development to bring those benefits to life. And our expectation is that the combination of clinicians, patients, of course, and payors will see that value as we bring it to market.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Brian. Next question?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Terence Flynn, Ph.D. - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two for me. I just wanted to clarify the double-digit growth, what you guys are assuming there for both MG in Europe, obviously post the CHMP decision, but also in the U.S. And then is NMO included in that as well? And then, Paul, I was wondering if you had a chance to think about the tax rate and maybe help us think about how to frame that on the forward? Thank you.","Paul Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Good question, Terence. I mean, included is an assumption as we go through the next kind of 36 months that MG is approved both in Europe \u2013 well, it's approved (44:22) if that comes to market, as well as approved in the United States. We cross our fingers on that one obviously.","NMO, the reality of the development program is it's actually not meaningful in this time period. So, it can't be meaningful beyond the time period. And I think the way to think about the tax rate at this point in the way we thought about it in our forward-looking modeling is the 13% or 14% from a non-GAAP tax rate is expectations over the next few years. There may be some pressure up, but there may be a little bit of way that we can kind of mitigate that inherent pressure up.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. We'll take next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a quick one on gMG approval. You guys got the positive opinion from CHMP. How much read through should we have on the FDA approval in October? And then a quick one on ALXN1210 subcutenous formulation. You're progressing that formulation to clinic, can you talk about the dosing frequency you planned to test on? Thank you.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, with regard to the gMG review, we've obviously got the positive CHMP opinion. We're waiting for the European Commission approval. That should happen in the third quarter. The regulatory review at FDA is proceeding to an action date in October. Likewise, we're also under review in Japan where we're anticipating action by the 1st of 2018.","With regard to subcu, we have already disclosed that we've completed a Phase 1 study that was successful with good viability that positions us to take that forward into a pivotal program. We will be looking at various dosing intervals for the subcu that range from daily to weekly with different device combinations that will allow us to proceed forward with that program.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","To add to what John was saying, we're using a higher concentration as you know. And this will allow us maybe even to go beyond once a week. So, we're looking at that option as well, but we keep all our options open. But overall, we're very excited with the program. So, give us another couple of months till we get all the feedback from both Europe as well as the U.S. so that we can design our Phase 3 program.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Appreciate the question. I have sort of two-parts here. So, just building on the ALXN1210 question, I noticed in the slides you talked about multiple indications for ALXN1210 in subcu. I was wondering if that was because you were thinking about different frequencies for some of the additional proof-of-concept studies you're going to look at in complement and is ALXN1210 subcu the strategy there?","And then separately, just on the financials. Dave Anderson, can you just comment specifically on the Latin America component that you made in terms of second half guidance? I think you said we should look for it to be at the 4Q 2016 run rate in the second half. Can you just remind us sort of where that was, and what we should look for there? Thanks.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, with regard to ALXN1210, as Ludwig said, we're in the process of getting feedback from regulators in terms of the scope of that program and how we would design it as well as frequency. We are looking at pursuing the indications that are in parallel and in alignment with the Soliris menu of indications. And beyond that, as we said, we're considering pursuing two additional proof-of-concept trials in other areas in 2018.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","It's not clear if we will go for IV or subcu, with this new indication, of course it will depend on the patient journey about what's the best fit for the patient. So, we'll keep you posted on our direction forward.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. So, maybe should I go to the...","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Absolutely, Anderson. Go ahead.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","...Latin America. So, just following up on that, we experienced moderate revenue growth in Latin America in the second quarter, but we also continue to experience what we've talked about in terms of just the underlying challenges in that market with respect to both access as well as new patient starts.","We also got the benefit, though, of the timing, we got some of the rev rec benefit you recall in the first quarter, which some of that was LATAM. And we also got some timing benefit of both quarters attributable to LATAM in the second quarter. So, we got some strength despite some of those continued underlying challenges. We expect the second half to not have the benefit obviously repeating of those larger orders and we expect that the run rate is going to be about what we experienced as we exited 2016. So, there's no counting on LATAM for additional strength in the second half.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Robyn Karnauskas, Ph.D. - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on really doing a great quarter and outlining a new strategy for the company. So, just quick question on EU patent filings. I noticed you have some new patent filings in the U.S., should we expect any EU patents updated, have you filed anything?","And second, when you talk about new complement areas, can you give us any hints as to examples of that and are you thinking beyond orphan or just thinking orphan or ultra-orphan? Thanks.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. With respect to the EU patent filings, the way to think about this is, we were successful on the U.S. side. As you heard, we have notice of allowance for three additional patents and hopefully that will be issued soon in the next weeks, months to come. We're following a very similar strategy ex-U.S. including Europe as well as Japan.","Now with respect to the new indications, we will stick within rare diseases, orphan diseases, but John, I don't know if you want to add any color to that?","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, I think what I would add is, within the therapeutic areas that we've outlined our areas of focus.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks. Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Just on the gMG opportunity, I know you've had a lot of question on this. And I've actually asked this question before, but maybe with Brian's sort of fresh eyes from a commercial perspective, and the launch prep that you guys are describing, this indication would seem to differ, I think, from prior Alexion launches and that patient identification, it's not really a key part of the launch. These patients are already by and large under the care of a specialist physician, it's arguably a warehouse type situation.","So, just curious especially with Brian's perspective, assuming approval in the U.S. should we expect the trajectory of this launch to be much steeper than PNH or aHUS or are there other factors that we should think about as governors maybe on that trajectory? Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Chris. This is Brian. It's an interesting question, and I think you went right to the heart of how we're thinking about the launch which is, it is different from PNH and aHUS. The similarity, of course, is the complement foundation on the ideology of the disease. However, that's not well understood by clinicians certainly not by patients. And so, we see a significant need for education that will be required in the uptake of the product for launch. The other differences are that as you noted, it's not so much about patient identification, there are number of known patients already in the clinics already own some form of treatment, though, as I noted in the prepared remarks, there are no FDA approved treatments currently available.","And the other dynamic is that we know from the REGAIN study that about 60% of the patients would be expected to respond and the window for that is up to 12 weeks. So that's also quite different from the current therapies which can take 6 to 12 months, as well as from the response that we would typically see in PNH and aHUS. So, I think you've really identified some of the key differences with this launch versus the others, but again, a tremendous opportunity.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I'll just follow-on on the last question where if you could expand on a little bit on the payor market research efforts you have going on here for MG, and how that might impact the launch curve? Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. What I'll say in regard to this is that it's also important for the recognition, especially with payors that we're not talking about the entire MG population, we're talking about a subset, as I mentioned, it's about 5% to 10% of the total MG population. So, it's really in our Alexion sweet spot. And the expectation is that as we focus in on those patients who are by definition refractory, as was identified in the REGAIN study that the real value of Soliris and what it offers in a complement-mediated disease will be recognized by the payors and that's what we're seeing so far and that's what we expect towards the launch.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. We might be dealing with bigger patient populations. We have a very strong pricing strategy with Soliris. And so, we're going to stick to our pricing strategy. Clearly, we see opportunities short-term once we get the approvals to launch in the U.S., Germany, Japan and some other countries, smaller countries, but we're going to stick to a pricing strategy moving forward.","Next question?","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Geoff Porges with Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for the question, and congratulations on the focused strategy and all the disclosures, very helpful. Paul, nice to hear your voice. Could you just answer the question whether can you hit the double-digit revenue growth and the margin improvement guidance if you don't get MG because after all you did have double-digit underlying business growth this quarter?","And then, just for John, as you talked through about other complement opportunities, are you contemplating other complement targets beyond C5 or is your focus pretty much what you can do with C5 inhibition? Thanks.","Paul Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I'll start, Geoff. Great to hear your voice as well; and I think it obviously makes it harder. I mean, it's in the core assumption. I don't think it makes it impossible. So, I think we would have to sort things out and something would have to break a different way on aHUS or something \u2013 or another thing. So \u2013 but certainly, we'll relook at the LRP if that's the outcome. That obviously is not the core assumption that we're dealing with right now. You never know until the PDUFA, nevertheless.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Geoff, it's John. So, with regard to other targets, yes, we are pursuing other targets in the complement cascade. Clearly, Soliris has set a high bar with efficacy and safety and 10 years of marketed experience and 15 years in the clinic, and then with ALXN1210, our next-generation C5 inhibitor opens up a number of opportunities in new indications, as we've touched on. Going beyond that, we've got assets in our preclinical pipeline that target other elements in the complement cascade more approximately that open up the opportunity for us to pursue indications that may not be optimally served by a C5 inhibition approach. So, we're definitely interested in that and we will be pursuing those assets into the clinic in the not-too-distant future.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Martin Auster with UBS. Please go ahead.","Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Couple of quick ones on ALXN1210. First on the subcu Phase 1 PK study, will that be presented later this year? And then secondly, on the PNH Switch study, is there kind of a natural selection in this trial that you're seeing or that you would expect where the Soliris patients who might enroll that switch over to ALXN1210 might be having suboptimal responses, or is there a wide berth to show differentiation for ALXN1210 beyond frequency of administration that you see in the study? Thanks","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, with regard to the first question, the studies are designed as non-inferiority studies, both the na\u00efve as well as the Switch study relative to LDH normalization and transfusion avoidance, which are the primary endpoints for the na\u00efve study, and for the Switch study it's a percentage change in LDH. The studies are not powered to look at some of the other secondary endpoints; although, we are looking at breakthrough hemolysis as well as LDH normalization as a point of differentiation. We will be looking at that carefully, but as needed, we'll also pursue additional profiling studies to tease out that differentiation, which we think can be demonstrated with ALXN1210 based on its mechanism of action, it's prolonged half-life and the fact that we'll be able to achieve a higher C trough (58:52) levels at the end of dosing intervals, which should help us in terms of addressing those issues.","With regard to the publication plans, we haven't disclosed exactly when we are sharing the results from the PK study.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","But the most critical results are already public. So \u2013 which is 42-day half-life; which is the 60% bioavailability; and then, the tolerability, which is acceptable to move into Phase 3.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks. Next question, please?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Peters with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on all the progress. So, a question on underlying demand in kind of the core PNH and aHUS markets. You, again, highlighted that the majority of patients in PNH have yet to initiate treatment. So, is the same true in aHUS?","And then, just a related question, as you think about ALXN1210, are there diagnosed PNH or aHUS patients who are not on Soliris now, but may be more amenable to a treatment with an eight-week or subcu option? Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. I can take that. This is Brian. On the question about aHUS, the dynamic is absolutely there. In fact, I'll just comment. I was in the field recently and met with a key opinion leader who commented that aHUS, in his opinion, is one of the modern masqueraded diseases that they see where there is a belief that there are many, many patients that are still under-diagnosed and, certainly, undertreated. And that's why, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we continue to believe not only with PNH that there is a significant opportunity ahead where the majority of patients are in the same light under-diagnosed and undertreated, but definitely the same is true with aHUS.","And the second question, I'm sorry, can you...","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","It's about the treatment options. I think what we're trying to do is to differentiate ALXN1210 from Soliris. As Brian was saying, this is our next-generation C5 inhibitor. We're raising the bar. So, we're going to look at different ways of differentiation. Clearly, subcu is an important one. Number two, the eight weeks versus \u2013 so the dosing frequency is an important one.","John talked about a secondary endpoint of breakthrough hemolysis and so on. So, our objective is to differentiate ALXN1210 from Soliris. And by the fact that we will have different formulations, hopefully, it will create treatment options and this might address, hopefully, some of the important patient needs that we still see in aHUS and in PNH.","So, we're going to take two more questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yatin Suneja from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Yatin Suneja - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, guys. Congrats on all the progress, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe I'll switch gear to Kanuma and I'll ask you a question on that. I mean, now that you've had more time with the drug, potentially able to understand the market a little better, could you maybe comment on the eventual potential for this drug? How big the opportunity do you think it is? What sort of a contribution we should anticipate from this drug in the next three years to five years? And when can we expect an inflection, if at all? Thank you.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. Hi, Yatin. This is Brian. I'll start with what's most important, and we see this across our portfolio, and that is that this is a product that clearly has a transformative benefit impacting the lives of patients. It is amazing how often we hear this. Essentially, every week we get these compelling stories about how important that product is. So, our essential belief is that there is great potential ahead for Kanuma.","With regards to what exactly that looks like, it's still is early because we've made some pretty profound commercial adjustments. And just to name what those are as I've commented, one is, splitting the field force team, so we have dedicated focus on Kanuma. It's a complex discussion. It requires intensive work for patient identification and to pull through the transition to therapy. So that was an important step, but that was recently adjusted.","Secondly, are these very important lab partnerships in enriched populations as I'd mentioned. Here we're talking about NASH, NAFLD and FH. And also that is recent enough that we don't yet have the quantification of exactly how that'll play out. But we have clearly seen enough in terms of green shoots of more efficient patient identification that needs us to believe that these are important adjustments to have been made.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And we're working towards opening doors in Europe. So, we hope to get more countries on board before the end of this year. So, we do need a little bit more time as Brian was saying, a couple of quarters to see what the impact is of the changes and how big this can be.","We'll take one more question.","Operator","And our last question comes from Christopher Marai with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Christopher N. Marai - Nomura Instinet","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. So, I was wondering if you can comment a little bit on the growth of Soliris here that we've seen and potential impact from those ALXN1210 trials. Are those trials helping potentially identify new patients, perhaps you can discuss screening failures.","And then secondarily, can you walk us through how you look at with differential pricing on the subcutaneous ALXN1210 formulation? Obviously, looking at less ultra-orphan diseases for a subcutaneous ALXN1210 could make a premium pricing difficult. I would like to hear your thoughts there. Thank you.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. On the subcu, as we said, we're still going through the regulatory process to get the input, that will help us to define what are our regulatory, our go-to launch strategy is. So, it's too early to give you an answer on what we're going to do there, but clearly we believe it's the great treatment option, it could be a great treatment option for patients.","With respect to ALXN1210, does it open up more opportunities, and I would say, yes. Because we're still working on driving a disease awareness, education in PNH as well as aHUS. It does help us to get into, I would say, hospitals, investigators and so on that are still working on getting familiar with the disease. So, yes, it does help us to create that awareness.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And just to follow-up on the screen failure rates. In the na\u00efve study, that screen failure rates are actually are very low, well below 20%; in the switch study, even lower than that because they're pre-identified.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. So, as Dave was talking about $20 million impact of the ALXN1210 studies on the first half, we gave you an updated financial impact for the full year. But I'm really pleased with that because it means that we're successful with enrolling those patients, and switching them from Soliris to ALXN1210. So, I'll take it.","Operator","And that was the last.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. So, we're going to end the call here. I want to thank all of you for calling in. I hope we were able to provide you with more clarity in the direction forward that we're really, really pleased, really happy with a very strong quarter. So, thank you.","Operator","And that was our last question. And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Just as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Elena Ridloff, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Elena Ridloff","Thank you, Sarah. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to discuss Alexion's performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 and our plans for 2016.","Today's call will be led by David Hallal, our CEO. David will start the call with an overview of our global performance and be joined by Vikas Sinha, our Chief Financial Officer; Carsten Thiel, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Martin MacKay, our Global Head of R&D. Also, with us today are Saqib Islam, our Chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer; and Julie O'Neill, our Global Head of Operations.","You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call, by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website. Before we begin, I will refer you to Slide 3. We will be making forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filings with the SEC and our subsequent SEC filings.","Any forward-looking statements apply only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after this call. I'd also like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP operating results are adjusted from our GAAP operating results for certain items that we described in our press release issued this morning. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release. Thank you. David?","David Hallal","Thank you, Elena. 2015 was a transformative year for Alexion, and we entered 2016 with two new launches just now underway on top of our strong and growing Soliris-based business. Our breakthrough therapies are the foundation of our continued success as we grow and expand our complement franchise, while building a premier rare metabolic disease franchise.","In Q4, we achieved many significant commercial R&D and financial milestones. First, we received FDA approvals for both Strensiq and Kanum under breakthrough therapy designation and also received two Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Vouchers with the approvals. Second, our commercial team continued to serve a consistently high number of new patients, with PNH and aHUS with Soliris.","Third, we completed enrollment in the DGF registration trial. Fourth, we advanced the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech and present a new clinical data for three new highly innovative product candidates being studied in PNH, MPS IIIB and GI-GVHD. And fifth, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance.","We are pleased that Soliris continues to deliver strong volume growth. As we enter our 10th year since the initial Soliris launch, we delivered 28% year-on-year volume growth in 2015 and continue to see the majority of the opportunity ahead of us, for both PNH and aHUS.","In PNH, in Q4, as in prior quarters, our global commercial organization continued to identify and serve a consistently high number of new patients across our 50 country platform. In aHUS in Q4, we once again served a consistent number of new patients, supporting our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.","Turning now to our metabolic franchise. Strensiq was approved in the U.S. on October 23. We are now in the very early stages of launching Strensiq in the U.S., Germany and Japan. Our launch is supported by the strong labels, which reflect the highest level of medical innovation. Strensiq addresses the underlying clause of HPP by replacing the vital enzyme of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase enabling babies to have a 97% survival rate at one year compared to 42% of historical controlled patients.","On Strensiq, 100% of juvenile onset patients had substantial bone healing, improvement and weight and short stature and were able to perform a six-minute walk tips comparable to matched healthy peers. We are pleased with our early performance in the Strensiq launch in Q4, which indicates that applying our unique rare disease expertise from PNH and aHUS has been effective in elevating the awareness of HPP.","While we have observed early progress, we continue to expect that the launch trajectory for Strensiq will be slow and steady, consistent with the launch of therapies for ultra rare diseases. This is due to the low incidents and high mortality of HPP, as well as the very low awareness of the disease.","Now, turning to Kanuma, which is our second highly innovative enzyme replacement therapy that was approved by the FDA on December 8 and launched in the U.S. in January. Like Strensiq, our Kanuma launch has supported by the very strong labels in the U.S. and Europe, which again reflect the highest level of medical innovation.","Kanuma addresses the underlying cause of LAL-D by replacing the vital enzyme of lysosomal acid lipase, enabling babies to have a 67% survival rate beyond 12 months of age compared to 0% of historical controlled patients, all of whom died by eight months of age. Patients also had improvements in multiple liver and lipid parameters including a reduction in liver fat content.","As we launch Kanuma, we will bring these compelling clinical benefits to patients with LAL-D and thus far we are pleased with the early progress we are making since the acquisition. Patient identification is central to our success in reaching patients with ultra-rare diseases. And this is what we know well and do well.","We saw early on that the LAL-D diagnostic pathway needed to be improved and tailored to pediatric patients to increase rapid and accurate diagnosis. We made our enhancements to the pathway in Q3, and began the rollout in Q4 and we've observed the following: first, more selective testing of high-risk patients; second, a higher rate of positive diagnoses driven by pediatric testing; and third, an increasing number of patients with LAL-D have been identified.","As we move into Q1, we are looking to extend this meaningful progress. We aim to serve patients across our 50-country platform with HPP and LAL-D. However, for the first year launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, we expect that the majority of patients we serve will be in the U.S. and Germany.","We have initiated the country-by-country reimbursement processes throughout Europe, as we look to obtain funding and start serving patients in other countries in the second half of 2016 and 2017. We are excited about our opportunity across our metabolic franchise and are committed to working with urgency to serve patients with these two devastating diseases. Carsten will provide more color on the launches later in the call.","While we expanded our commercial portfolio, we also advanced the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. In Q4, in addition to completing enrollment in the DGF registration trial, we also presented initial patient data for three of our highly-innovative molecules.","First, ALXN1210 data from the initial patients with PNH showing a rapid reduction in LDH; second, ALXN1007 interim Phase 2 data from patients with GI-GVHD showing an 80% overall response rate at 28 days; and third, SBC-103 interim Phase 1\/2 data, showing a dose dependent reduction in heparan sulfate and CSF and patients with MPS IIIB at 12 weeks, indicating that the NAGLU enzyme administered IV is crossing the blood brain barrier.","Looking ahead to 2016, we will have multiple R&D milestones including: data from two registration trials of eculizumab in MG and DGF; completion of enrollment in the NMO registration trial; additional data for ALXN1210 and PNH and initiation of an aHUS clinical program; six month heparan sulfate data for SBC-103; and additional data for ALXN1007 and GI-GVHD. We look forward to providing updates on our expanding pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to six additional product or indication approvals through 2018.","Looking now at our strong financial performance for the full year, we achieved total revenues of $2.6 billion or 29% increase in volume compared to the prior year, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses and a small initial contribution of $12 million from Strensiq in Q4.","In 2015, we delivered 21% total revenue growth compared to 2014 in-year sales. Our robust volume growth was partially offset by 8% or $165 million in currency headwinds. We also achieved non-GAAP EPS of $4.99 per diluted share.","Turning to our 2016 guidance. On a constant currency basis, we forecast revenues of $3.17 billion to $3.22 billion or 22% to 24% constant currency revenue growth year-over-year. For 2016, we forecast $120 million in currency headwinds. Factoring this in, we are guiding 2016 total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, which reflects continued strong underlying demand for Solaris, as we serve an increasing number of patients in 2016, as well as strong first year metabolic revenues of $150 million to $175 million.","These metabolic approvals are the first two of up to eight new product or indication approvals that we committed to deliver through 2018 to drive our next level of growth. Beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS growth, driven by the continue growth of Soliris and the metabolic franchise, and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 from our 2016 forecast of 44%.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, David. We are pleased with our financial performance in Q4 despite continued currency headwinds, as well as macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries.","Q4 revenues reflected the continued steady growth of Soliris in PNH and aHUS, and the small initial contribution of Strensiq in the U.S. Total revenues increased to $701 million in Q4. This revenue growth was driven by a 25% increase in volume partially offset by 8% or $45 million in currency headwinds net of hedges in Q4 over the year-ago quarter, resulting in 17% revenue growth above the year-ago quarter.","Soliris volume growth of 23% was driven by continued growth in PNH and aHUS across all geographies in Q4. However, volume growth was partially impacted by $15 million in Latin American countries due to end of year local government budgetary constraints.","Turning to Strensiq, we were pleased with the initial contribution in the revenues of $12 million in the fourth quarter, as we started serving the first group of HPP patient in the U.S., Germany and Japan. As a reminder, we served initial LAL-D patients in Germany in Q4. However, Kanuma was just launched in the U.S. in January 2016. During the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.13 per diluted share.","Turning to the full year, 2015 revenues increased to $2.6 billion, driven by a strong 29% increase in volume, partially offset by 8% or $165 million in currency headwinds net of hedges in 2015 over the prior year. On a reported basis, this represents 21% revenue growth compared to 2014 in-year sales. In 2015, we achieved non-GAAP EPS of $4.99 per diluted share.","Our strong financial position and future cash flows provided us with the financial flexibility to support our pipeline growth, service our debt, take advantage of external opportunities as they may arise, and repurchase stock opportunistically. In 2015, we purchased 2 million shares and so far this year we have purchased an additional 0.5 million shares in January. We have an additional $675 million remaining in our share repurchase program.","Turning to our 2016 guidance, on a constant currency basis, we forecast revenues of $3.17 billion to $3.22 billion or 22% to 24% revenue growth year-over-year. This robust revenue growth reflects serving an increasing number of patients in PNH and aHUS, as well as the first year of the Strensiq and Kanuma launches, where we forecast metabolic franchise revenues of $150 million to $175 million.","For 2016, we currently forecast $120 million or negative 4.6% in currency headwinds. Factoring this in, we are guiding total revenues of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion.","Looking at other elements of our 2016 guidance supported by continued Soliris growth, the anticipated strength of first year metabolic sales and an ongoing financial discipline, I would highlight the following points. First, we will be advancing our robust rare disease pipeline, while maintaining our R&D spend of approximately 22% of revenue, similar to the second half of 2015 level.","Second SG&A expenses will be approximately 26%, which is significantly reduced from second half of 2015 SG&A expenses of 28%. Third, we are significantly improving our non-GAAP operating margin in 2016 to 44% from 42% in second half of 2015. And fourth, our non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the range of $5 to $5.20. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would have been 31% higher. For other elements for 2016 guidance, I'll refer you to our press release that was issued this morning.","Turning briefly to Q1 guidance, on a constant currency basis, total revenues would be $735 million to $745 million. On a reported basis, Q1 revenues are expected to be in the range of $700 million to $710 million, which includes our $35 million FX impact year-over-year. On a sequential basis, there is a $10 million negative FX impact, as well as few infusion days in Q1 2016 versus Q4 2015. For Q1, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.10 t $1.15.","Looking beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS growth driven by the continued growth of Soliris and the metabolic franchise and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018 for March 2016 forecast of 44%.","In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance in 2015, as we achieved strong Soliris volume growth executed on the Synageva integration, successfully launched Strensiq and prepared for the initial launch of Kanuma.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?","Carsten Thiel","Thank you, Vikas. In 2015, our global commercial operations continue to serve more patients with Soliris, as we delivered a strong 28% volume growth year-on-year, reflecting the underlying strength of our core Soliris business, while also initiating the launch of the Strensiq and Kanuma for patients with HPP and LAL-D.","Starting with Solaris and PNH, the ongoing success of our diagnostic initiatives is driving a steady addition of new patients. In 2015, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH across our 50 country platform. We also continue to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. In 2016, we will continue to execute our PNH diagnostic initiatives with urgency to reach more new patients.","In aHUS, we also continued to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now four years from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH.","We continue to see the same trends in Europe. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time this trend will continue and perhaps even widen, confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH.","As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, we are focused on three key initiatives: first, increasing the number of patients with TMA tested for aHUS; second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris as first line treatment; and third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic life long nature of aHUS. With the majority of our opportunity in PNH and aHUS in front of us, we are confident that we will serve an increasing number of patients with both diseases in 2016 as in prior years.","Now, I would like to turn to our global metabolic franchise. Starting with Strensiq, in Q4, we saw an initial group of patients commencing treatment and are pleased with our earlier results as we apply our unique ultra-rare disease expertise to serve patients with HPP.","In the U.S., we are pleased with the initial observations in the early stages of launch. First, we are benefiting from having a dedicated metabolic field team, which enables us to reach more physicians who are seeing patients at a higher likelihood of having HPP.","Second, our team is focused on overcoming the low awareness of HPP with our disease education initiatives. Our programs address the morbidities and high mortality of HPP, the role of Strensiq in addressing the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme, and the compelling clinical benefits that Strensiq can provide to patients with HPP.","Third, our diagnostic pathway is helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP. And fourth, payers are recognizing the value of Strensiq based on the compelling clinical benefits included in the label.","The launches of Strensiq are also underway in Germany and Japan and we are planning a similar approach as in the U.S. We have now served initial patients in both countries. Our efforts globally are supported by the growing body of medical evidence [technical difficulty] to further support the HPP community.","At the upcoming annual Clinical Genetics Meeting and Endocrine Society Meeting researches will present new longer-term data from multiple studies on the benefits of Strensiq in entrants, children and adults with HPP. As a reminder, we continue to expect that the initial use of Strensiq will grow gradually due to the low incidence, high-mortality and low awareness of HPP.","Turning now to Kanuma. We received FDA approval in December and launched in the U.S. just a few weeks ago in January. We are pleased that the approved label allows patients of all ages to be eligible for treatment and includes a survival benefit for the youngest patients, as well as benefits in multiple liver and lipid parameters, including a reduction of ALT and liver fat contents.","As the Kanuma launch is now underway in the U.S. and Germany, we are applying our deep experience in ultra-rare diseases to serve the LAL-D community. Following the Synageva integration, we enhance the LAL-D disease awareness programs. Our more targeted diagnostic pathway helps pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having a LAL-D, which is important because the medium age of disease onset is 5.8 years.","Rapid and accurate diagnosis of LAL-D is of critical importance, as 50% of non-entrants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just three years of symptom onset. From our early experience thus far, we've seen an increased rate of patient identification, supported by more children obtaining an accurate diagnosis.","Although, there's still very low disease awareness for LAL-D, we are observing both interest and perceptivity, among the physicians we are reaching. While we are in an earlier stage of initiating our LAL-D disease awareness programs, we see a meaningful opportunity to serve patients, supported by the known prevalence of LAL-D of eight to 12 patients per million in the general population.","Our global efforts are further supported by the growing body of medical evidence for Kanuma. Upcoming WORLDSymposium meeting, researchers will present two-year survival data in infants with rapidly progressive LAL-D.","Turning to the timing of additional country launches for Strensiq and Kanuma, we have initiated the funding processes with healthcare authorities in other major European countries. We expect to start serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of 2016 with additional countries to follow in 2017.","Also, in Japan, we expect regulatory approval for Kanuma in the first half of this year. As we demonstrated by achieving access to Soliris for patients with PNH and aHUS across our [technical difficulty], we are committed to working with healthcare authorities around the world to ensure that patients with HPP and LAL-D will have access to Strensiq and Kanuma.","In closing, the commercial organization has the expertise to achieve our objective for our three products. We see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS, and we are leveraging our ultra-rare disease expertise to serve initial patients with HPP and now LAL-D.","Now, I will turn the call over to Martin who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?","Martin Mackay","Thank you, Carsten. In 2015 we continued to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in the industry, which includes 10 clinical programs and 30 preclinical programs with at least four moving into the clinic in 2016.","Starting with our late-stage complement pipeline, our three ongoing registration trials with eculizumab continue to progress as planned. In Q4 in kidney transplant, we completed enrollment in our delayed graft function registration trial and expect preliminary data in the second half of 2016.","In neurology, we have completed enrollment in our refractory Myasthenia Gravis trial and expect to have preliminary data in mid-2016. And we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder trial this year.","In addition to Soliris, we have eight additional complement inhibitors that we are developing with urgency. Our lead program ALXN1210, a longer acting C5 antibody, that has a half-life nearly three times that of Soliris, has shown rapid, sustained and complete inhibition of free C5 in healthy volunteers.","We have two ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH, receiving the ALXN1210 at varying doses and dosing intervals. And these two studies we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals. In December, we announced preliminary data from the initial PNH patients, which showed a rapid reduction in LDH of 88% and 85% just three weeks after treatment, which is consistent with what we saw in the pivotal Phase III TRIUMPH study with Soliris.","We have now completed enrollment in our Phase 1\/2 study of ALXN1210 in patients with PNH and expect data in midyear. And we are also focused on rapidly enrolling our second PNH study. We will also be initiating a clinical program in patients with atypical aHUS this year, as well as evaluating other indications. We are targeting an approval for ALXN1210 and PNH in 2018.","Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a we progressed our Phase 2 study in patients with Gastrointestinal Graft-versus-Host Disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare autoimmune disease.","In Q4, we shared interim data, which showed a 28-day overall response rate of 80% and a 28-day complete response rate of 70% compared to historical response rate of 56% and 49%, respectively. The interim data support the continued advancement of ALXN1007 including the evaluation of higher doses in additional patients with GI-GVHD.","Turning now to our robust metabolic pipeline and starting with SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, produced with the unique and proprietary protein expression platform, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB or MPS IIIB. MPS IIIB is a rare devastating disorder, characterized by CNS and systemic accumulation of heparan sulfate due to a genetic deficiency in the NAGLU enzyme.","In Q4, we presented interim three months data from our Phase 1\/2 study. This study showed a dose-dependent reduction of heparan sulfate levels in cerebrospinal fluid in three dosing cohorts with a mean reduction of 11% observed at the highest 3 milligram per kilogram dose. We are encouraged that SBC-103 has a potential to provide both systemic and CNS clinical benefits due to blood brain barrier penetration.","We will now look to see if the dose-dependant response is maintained over a six-month dosing period and are pleased that the data will be presented at a late-breaking poster at the WORLDSymposium next month. The interim data for SBC-103 provides evidence that our unique and proprietary protein expression platform could enable other enzyme replacement therapies to cross the blood brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for patients.","We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS morbidities and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets by evaluating the severity of patient CNS symptoms, applicability of technology for CNS transport for each disease and the potential to provide a transformative benefit to patients. I look forward to providing updates on our progress with our platform in future calls.","Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns, we have initiated a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016.","Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline and expect four of these programs, three metabolic and one additional candidate from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio to enter the clinic this year. We are excited about the multiple catalysts in our expanding pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to six additional product or indication approvals through 2018.","I will now turn the call back to David. David?","David Hallal","Thanks, Martin. We are very pleased with our performance in 2015 and are entering 2016 from a position of strength. We are off to a strong start, as we execute on our two new metabolic launches and continue to grow our Soliris business. We also look forward to the multiple development milestones in our robust rare diseases pipeline that is poised to produce transformative therapies for patients with rare and devastating diseases. As always we thank our talented employees for their dedication, to our mission, as we work to transform the lives of patients around the world.","Now, let's open up the line for questions operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Eric Schmidt of Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt","Just two quick ones perhaps on Soliris trajectories in 2016. I guess first, Vikas, I think you mentioned the impact from Latin America in Q4 and I assume that was mostly Brazil related. Has that issue been fixed in that region? And what does your 2016 guidance imply with regard to continued shipments into Brazil?","And then, second, maybe a broader picture on the guidance. If I do the math looking at 2014 sales into 2015 sales, I guess, if you correct out for the net stocking effect in 2016 and the FX impact, you actually would have grown sales up $600 million year-over-year in 2015. Yet the 2016 guidance is calling for, again, netting out the FX impact about $450 million in year-on-year growth. So trying to reconcile that with David's comments that the new patient adds are very steady. I'm sure there's some issue with my math, maybe you could help figure that out.","David Hallal","Yes, sure. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","So we had a bet with Martin that I'll get the first question, so thanks a lot for that. I won the bet. So let's talk about Brazil first. We had a $15 million impact in Brazil as a yearend. Government restrictions delayed our orders. We feel that we have sorted out the issues right now in February. So we have to factor that into our guidance in 2016. So we think that the business is usual is ongoing from February onwards.","Regarding the broader picture of -- and your math is absolutely right, $600 million and $450 million. So if you recall in the beginning of 2015, I talked about the impact of foreign exchange overall for us is going to be $320 million going into 2015 compared to 2014, right? Out of that the hedge is going to take half of it out. So the hedge definitely helped us in 2015, but going into '16 and '17 that the remainder $160 million is going to get impacted.","So what you see here is the $450 million growth is now adjusted for that FX impact that was felt between '14 and '15. And so now from '15 to '16, there will be an additional $120 million. Now, it is not purely attributable to the growth. It is actually the base results are getting impacted.","So if you really think through the two phases, if you look at 2015 number once again, what you see is $2.6 billion was a starting line, and when you suddenly get to January 1 that number is $120 million less, so you're starting from that number, and you're adding that $450 million. Does that answer your question?","David Hallal","Eric, I would just add on top of that, all of those dynamics are actually impacted by the fact that in 2015 we added a similar number of patients with PNH and aHUS, as we did in the prior year, and we expect moving into 2016, we will see that very same dynamic, a similar consistent high number of new patients commencing treatment with PNH and aHUS with Soliris, as we've seen in prior years as Vikas is saying, not only the impact of FX, and the impact of hedging, but the larger base that we've accumulated over that time as well.","Vikas Sinha","And just to add to that, given that $320 million, we got the $165 million, we got $120 million small proportion of $40 million to $50 million is going to be impacting '17 and onwards.","Eric Schmidt","I'm sorry, what was the '17 impact, Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","If we look at the $320 million, $165 million came in 2015. We are absorbing around $120 million this year. So approximately $40 million, $50 million will be left, which will get felt in 2017, if the currency is stays where it is.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Anupam Rama of JPMorgan.","Anupam Rama","Maybe just a quick one on SBC-103. Are there additional efficacy markers we should be looking for at world beyond heparan sulfate declines? And I noticed that the press release said, that the natural history study had also completed enrollment, should we expect any natural history data at the conference?","David Hallal","Martin?","Martin Mackay","Just to say, Anupam, thank you for your question, and really we will be focused on there heparan sulfate levels. As you know, Anupam, this is the bad player in this disease and while it's a biochemical marker, it's directly related to the pathophysiology of disease. So we will be concentrating on that, and no intention to produce more natural history data at this stage.","Operator","And next from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we'll go to Ying Huang.","Ying Huang","A quick one for, Vikas, first. So you guys are looking at potentially 48% to 49% op margin in 2018. When I looked at your 2015 R&D guidance, it's a little bit above street numbers. So can you talk a little bit about the path forward in terms of achieving that 48%, 49% op margin?","And then for, Martin, I know you will present the six-month data, but can you give us a little bit color in terms of since you presented the three-months data for SBC-103, are you seeing more pronounced effect in the CSF heparan sulfate reduction or not?","David Hallal","Yes, Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","So what we're looking at it is -- let's address the R&D expenses first that relates very closely with the 48% to 49%. If you look at second half of last year, where we integrated Synageva, so average run rate per quarter in the second half is $150 million of R&D expenses. So when we look at annualizing that for 2016, it's approximately starting from a $600 million base.","So what we have looked at here is a very financially disciplined growth of literally 10% to 12%, much, much lower than what the topline growth is going to be. And we'll continue this process, as we go forward in '17 and '18. So we take that 22% of sales down, below 20% by the time we get to 2018.","Similarly in SG&A, we came down from 28% in the second half of last year to 26% this year, and as the sales move forward and we have our topline growth coming over in 2017 and 2018 and lesser FX impact, we will start seeing the improvements in those reads, also from 26% further down by few percentage, taking us down to 48% to 49%. Can I pass it on to Martin?","David Hallal","Yes, Martin.","Martin Mackay","Yes, in terms of the second part of your question, thank you, Ying. Obviously, we'll be presenting those data at the meeting, so we can't discuss them now. But if you remember the three months data that we did present, we were really very excited by, and just as a reminder, if you think about it in a 3 milligram per kilogram dose where we saw an 11% reduction, really showing that we were able to cross the blood brain barrier.","This has two impacts for me really. One is to look at the six month data to see what we see in this disease. But it also speaks to the expression platform that we're using here and that notion of being able to use the platform for other diseases where we need to get large molecules across the blood brain barrier, so in both levels we were really excited by these three months results and look forward to presenting the six months data at that in time.","Operator","We'll go to Matt Roden of UBS.","Matt Roden","I do have one question that just happens to have a couple sub-clusters. It's all for Martin about the SBC-103. So first, at your Investor Day, you showed a nice linear dose response with SBC-103. But I'm not sure. Do you have any evidence for a time-dependent response? In other words, did you look at any time points prior to 12 weeks in the lead-up to those data?","The second sub-cluster is, I think what you're saying about the data update at WORLD is it will be six month follow-up on the doses that we've already seen, but is it possible that we'll see any doses over 3 mgs per kg? And just can you just talk about your plans to further dose escalate?","And then, the related third part is how high of a dose is really feasible for 103? What are the limitations to dose escalation? Is it just safety, volume or some other practical matter that we're not thinking about in terms of getting up that dose curve?","David Hallal","Yes, Matt. Before I turn over to Martin, as a reminder, right that one thing that was really nice that we showed back on Investor Day, was the consistency of what we saw in the patients compared to what we saw in our preclinical models, which Martin indicated. And there is a prescribed, as you might imagine, taking a sample of the CSF, it's not something that is done so frequently. So Martin can talk you through that.","But the reason why I mentioned the preclinical data, remember we also show the preclinical data at the 5 milligram and the 10 milligrams per kilogram dose, showing more reduction in the preclinical models of heparan sulfate in the brain, and so that's the intention of the program moving forward. But Martin, can provide more color on the frequency of the CSF in the next steps.","Martin Mackay","No, I think you articulated very well, David. And thank you Matt for those three questions, buried nicely into one question, very admirable. Really, as we alluded to, this was a six month study, which is the data that we will present at the WORLDSymposium, but we did have a 12 week look, we didn't' look at dates before that. So that answers the first part of your question.","In terms of the second, we won't present any higher doses at that six months. This will be the six month data for 0.31 and 3 milligrams per kilogram, but as you alluded to and David mentioned our ability to go to higher doses makes complete sense in this devastating disorder.","And then your third one is really a basic pharmacology question about how high can you go up with dose escalation. And this applies to any program, as you know better than I do, given the devastating nature of the disease, the encouraging results that we see, particularly the 3 milligram per kilogram dose, our ability to go higher than that is clear and it's something that we want to do. We will also, as always, be very careful. We'll be looking at safety along the way such that we do proper dose escalation studies, and these will unfold over the next period.","Operator","Yatin Suneja of SunTrust has a next question.","Yatin Suneja","I have a question on Phase 3 REGAIN trial in Myasthenia Gravis. Could you help us maybe understand what sort of improvement in MG-ADL score you think might be clinically meaningful? And then how should we think about the performance from the placebo arm, any particular endpoint other than MG-ADL that we might be looking for? I have a quick one for Vikas as well. Could you maybe tell us what sort of European pricing discount have you assumed in the guidance?","David Hallal","So why don't I start, then I'll go to Martin and then over to Vikas. Remember in the Myasthenia trial, the patients that we enrolled were failing multiple immunosuppressive therapies. And so despite the use of aggressive standard of care, they were progressing with refractory disease and progressing the MG-ADL of at least six or even more.","And of course, we leveraged our Phase 2 proof-of-concept data to help us design the trial and agree with regulators on what we thought the right endpoint would be, which is changed in MG-ADL at 26 weeks from baseline. In terms of magnitude, Martin, do you just want to talk through what we saw in the proof-of-concept study and then as we bring that through the registration trial?","Martin Mackay","Absolutely, David. And again, you highlighted the fact that MG-ADL, we agreed with the regulators. So this would be the most meaningful clinical endpoint for the patients. And to answer a kind of subpart of your question clearly, we'll be measuring exactly the same things in the placebo arm. And as we also said, we will aim to report data from the study in mid-2016.","In terms of what we saw in the investigator studies around the Phase 2 data, you may recall that we showed an 85% difference in the MG-ADL between eculizumab and placebo. The trial has gone very well in terms of the mechanics of it. We exceeded our enrollment. And we believe we've got a really good clinically meaningful endpoint and that we're really looking forward for the data to readout, as mentioned, midyear this year.","Vikas Sinha","And Yatin, on the European pricing discount side, we normally don't break it out by region. But on an average, we have seen 2% to 3% decline in the prices over the past. And that's what we factored into our forecast going forward. However, we will see that in 10-K that will be submitted soon, but it was less than 2% in 2015.","Operator","We'll move next to Chris Raymond of Raymond James.","Chris Raymond","Just one question on SBC-103, so Synageva used to talk about this, but I haven't really heard you guys mention this, I think there is a four-week temporary interruption phase as part of the Part B of the Phase 2\/3. And just kind of curious, when do you think we would be able to see data from that?","And knowing what you know now with the preliminary data that you presented at your R&D Day and what we'll see at WORLD, do you think that will be a meaningful event in terms of -- do you think four weeks is enough time to see sort of a reversal of the heparan sulfate effect or would you design this differently, perhaps, now?","David Hallal","So Chris, I'll get started. As you know that what we've laid out was the patients are going to carry through on their original dose through the six-month period, right. Then those patients are all going to move for a period of time to the highest of the initial three doses, the 3 mgs per kg.","We are then, as we indicated at Investor Day, going to re-randomize the 11 patients to the five or the 10. But yes, there will be a period of time in which -- I wonder if this is what you're asking, there will be a period of time in which all 11 patients will move up to eventually the 3 mgs per kg dose for a short period of time on their way to what we've now amended the protocol to do is test even higher dosage. Is that your question?","Chris Raymond","No, I'm sorry. So what I'm asking is originally as this trial was designed, there was a four-week interruption period on the Part B Phase. Is that still part of the plan? And if so when should we expect to see something from that?","Martin Mackay","No, you won't see anything from that, Chris. In answer to, if I heard you correctly at the start, we've really gone beyond that and that's why we haven't discussed it, based on the data we saw in the 0.3, 1 and 3, and as David alluded to the move to the higher doses with 5 milligrams and 10 milligrams, we believe we've gone over that. As I said, we'll show the six month data at the WORLDSymposium, and then clearly the 5 milligram and 10 milligram doses will come out in due course.","David Hallal","Which in a way, Chris, right, we've got a couple of shots at looking at this, right. The first is what was the dose-dependent response at 12 weeks, hold the patients at that very same dose, see what the impact was in terms of additional time through an additional 12 weeks to get to six months, and then we'll dose escalate from there.","Chris Raymond","But to be clear, no dose interruption phase then?","David Hallal","No.","Operator","Morgan Stanley's Matthew Harrison has a next question.","Cyrus Mahloudji","This is Cyrus calling in for Matthew. So regarding the pipeline for the path forward for SBC-103, can you guys move directly to Phase 3? And then when you're going to meet with regulators? And when could they offer some feedback? And then for 1210, how would you define the bar for LDH reduction? And what can you tell us about trough levels, because we only got a couple weeks of data at Analyst Day?","David Hallal","I'll just say that I think we've laid out our plans for 103, and I think it's just too early at this point to sort of speculate on what the registration plan will be. Clearly, we have a like what we've seen so far through 12 weeks. We look forward to taking look at the six month data. And all of this we'll inform with some other secondary endpoints in the Phase 1\/2 what our plan is moving forward. It is a devastating disease, so we look forward to ultimately reaching patients as fast as we possibly can. In terms of 1210, Martin?","Martin Mackay","As we've said before, Cyrus, what we're looking for here with 1210 is rapid sustained and complete inhibition. As you know 1210 is an antibody, it's behaving very well in the study so far. And as you know we've had a single ascending dose study, multiple ascending dose and volunteers at two studies and patients, one of them where we've completed enrollment, and clearly we're following the data along the way now and expect to clearly continue to see the data that we showed at Investor Day showing that this antibody continues to be well behaved.","David Hallal","And I would just add that, so that's precisely why we're running two trials in PNH patients, one of which as Martin indicated today, is completely enrolled. We're looking at a variety of induction and maintenance doses and looking at intervals of once monthly and longer. We will be evaluating those different dose levels and looking at trough over time. And as Martin said, we look forward to presenting a more fulsome look at the data for 1210 for the first time near mid-year in PNH patients. And so there will be more to certainly discuss then.","Operator","We'll go next to Geoff Meacham of Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Got a few on 1210, but they're all related. So I guess to get to a 2018 PNH approval does the current Phase 2 have to rollover to a registration trial? That's the first one, the first part. Second part is, would you guys expect to have a switching trial in the initial NDA or what's the plan for that in PNH? And then the third part, and probably not a lot of visibility in this, but are there any subtleties in the regulatory sort of path or requirements when you look at 1210, the approval path in the EU or rest of world?","David Hallal","Yes, maybe I'll just start and then Martin can jump in. So our view on 1210 PNH in 2018 is that certainly these two trials are be supportive, but not necessarily the rollover trials for registration. But all of it will be informative both to our registration trial plan and design, and the dose in the interval that we ultimately select. I'd just sort of leave it at that, and do we feel comfortable that the way that we've laid it out that these timelines certainly fit nicely with what our plans are.","Martin, maybe I'll just say that, and I know you'd say the same thing, Geoff, it's too early to really talk about the plan for the registration trials at this time, whether or not it's na\u00efve or switch or a combination of the two. I think that we're assessing that as we speak. And I think that as we developed Soliris and eculizumab in PNH, regarding your question about subtleties, I think we'd be looking like we normally do to develop a global program that would be ideally suited for all of the regions and territories and countries in which we operate.","Martin Mackay","I think you've really cracked it there, David. I mean, in terms of the two volunteers studies and two patient studies will really help us inform the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of 1210, which will allow us exactly to decide on the Phase 3 program. We're very confident in the timeline that we've laid out based on everything that we've seen today.","And then secondly, just to really reinforce David's point; we're clearly in discussions with regulators. These will be global studies as we did with eculizumab and no expectations really of any nuances over and above what you regularly see talking with different regulators.","David Hallal","I think, Geoff, the other thing I'd just comment on is when we think about our timelines and such, obviously we have an extremely strong vantage point, as it relates to the global PNH arena, the investigators, the physicians, the patients, which all enable us, obviously to do outstanding development work in this area.","Operator","Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs has a next question.","Terence Flynn","Just one for me on Strensiq. I was wondering if you're willing to offer any insight here with respect to the types of patients you're seeing on drug at this point, and also the contribution from new starts versus any clinical trial transition patients?","David Hallal","I'll start Terence and then Carsten will come in. I think that Q4 was certainly supported by -- the program's been in our hands for a while. We've been applying our PNH and aHUS know-how to HPP for some time. And as a result of that, right, as we indicated that in any single country, because the trials were generally small and global in nature, not any one country is necessarily disproportionately impacted by clinical transitioning patients.","But at the same time, with our introduction in the U.S. in Q4, we did benefit from some clinical trial patients moving over, and then through our efforts, some patients that we had identified along the way commencing treatment. So as I think, Vikas, and Carsten indicated earlier in the call, an initial group of patients, but Carsten can fill you in a little bit more on the types of patients, beyond whether or not they're clinical trial or not sort of the dynamics and what we're saying at the types of patients commencing treatment.","Carsten Thiel","Yes. Thank you, David. So with our focus on the pediatric patient population and our disease education efforts on that population, certainly what we have seen so far is a lot of newly diagnosed patients in the pediatric onset in a HPP setting.","Operator","And our final question today will come from Alethia Young of Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young","One just on Strensiq. I wondered if you maybe could provide a little bit more color on the kind of incidents numbers. I know you've mentioned the prevalence. And then just also on Myasthenia Gravis, the refractory population, can you remind us of kind of the numbers and the potential market opportunity there as well?","David Hallal","So Carsten, so I'll just say that one thing we mentioned on HPP is it's, unlike PNH and even LAL-D, where there are publications on prevalence, they're really in both aHUS and HPP, it's been a little lighter. There has been some indications of what the incidence might be and the youngest population of patients, right, a range of 1 and 100,000 to 1 and 300,000 live births being impacted by HPP.","There haven't been -- and Carsten and the team working with Martin's team trying on to better understand some of the mutations that are identified in the HPP space to try to give us a better understanding of what the prevalence might be. But at this point we don't really have much more to work on. Even some of these incidents numbers I'm sharing with you are from as long ago as the 1950s with the Fraser publication, and more recently a French publication. Regarding MG?","Martin Mackay","Yes, just to say briefly, Alethia, I think as you know that the patients that we have are refractory patients for Myasthenia Gravis that failed treatment with at least two treatments, so they are the more severe. In terms of the estimate, we estimate a subset is a small proportion of the broader MG population. Maybe a few thousand patients in the U.S., as you may imagine. So it's very much in the area where we work these ultra-rare patient populations, the most devastating and the most severely affected by the dieses.","David Hallal","Yes, and where these patients have really no other hope, because they have been worked through the system and the standard of care.","End of Q&A","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that was our last question.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Irving Adler, Executive Director, Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Irving Adler","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the first quarter of 2014, and our outlook for the rest of the year. Today's call will be led by Dr. Leonard Bell, our Chief Executive Officer.","Lenny will be joined by members of Alexion management: Vikas Sinha, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; David Hallal, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Martin MacKay, Executive Vice President and Global Head of R&D; Steve Squinto, Executive Vice President and Chief Global Operations Officer; and Saqib Islam, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.

In the first quarter of 2014, Alexion's global team advanced our mission to provide life-transforming therapies to patients with severe and rare disorders. Our accomplishments in the quarter spanned our commercial development and operational initiatives.","Our commercial team provided Soliris an increasing number of patients with PNH and aHUS worldwide. With continued steady progress in the United States, we're also particularly pleased with our aHUS operations in Europe during the quarter.","Our development team reached a number of significant milestones across our pipeline. Among these, we announced this morning that, based on our discussions with the FDA, we have commenced the rolling submission of our BLA for our next product, asfotase alfa, which we expect to complete in the fall. And separately, we have now commenced registration trials for eculizumab in 2 additional indications, NMO and MG.","Finally, as reflected in our financial performance during the first quarter, we continue to execute on our initiatives to achieve long-term operational and financial efficiencies. Looking first at our commercial operations. In Q1, we continued our steady growth trajectory. Additionally, we were especially pleased to announced an agreement with the French government, that provides Soliris reimbursement for patients with PNH and aHUS.","Importantly, as we have previously announced last month, the agreement reflects the government's recognition of the transformative medical benefits of Soliris, as indicated by the ASMR II ratings for Soliris in both PNH and aHUS.","In March, we likewise progressed the process in England, as we announced that NICE strongly confirmed that the positive impact of Soliris on qualities [ph] is of a magnitude rarely seen for any new drug. Strongly affirmative value of Soliris.","With unequivocal clinical endorsements now, from both AGNSS and NICE. We look forward to working with the health authorities to conclude the reimbursement process in England. Most importantly though, new and existing patients with aHUS continue to gain access to Soliris through the current, broad, government reimbursement policy.","Looking across our global commercial operations. We continue to see significant growth ahead of us in both PNH and aHUS. In PNH, we will continue to expand our presence across our commercial platform, driven by the knowledge that, globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone begin appropriate therapy.","Moreover, the ongoing strength of the early stages of the global launch in aHUS further reinforces our confidence that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is at least as large as our opportunities to serve patients with PNH, and perhaps larger. This view is supported by our continued observation that matched for the time, since their respective approvals. There are more patients in the United States currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH.","Our success in serving patients with PNH and aHUS, reflects our commitment to focus exclusively on developing a life-transforming therapies for patients with severe and life-threatening rare disorders. During Q1, we advanced several of these development programs. First, based on our ongoing discussions with the FDA as part of the breakthrough therapy process, we are pleased to have commenced the rolling submission of the BLA for our next product, asfotase alfa.","We have already submitted the CMC section of the dossier, expect to submit initial clinical components this quarter, and anticipate completing the entire dossier during the fall. As you look to build a strong label for asfotase alfa to serve patients with HPP. Based upon our rolling submission of Breakthrough Therapy designation, we anticipate launching in the United States in early 2015.","Additionally, we are on track for our pediatric-onset HPP filing in Europe near mid-year, and for our Japan filing later in 2014. Supporting our expected launch in an initial European countries in the first part 2015, with Japan to follow later next year. Second, in our eculizumab neurology programs, we are now enrolling patients in our NMO registration study, and we have begun screening patients in our MG registration study.","And finally, we have now completed enrollment and have indeed overenrolled our eculizumab-AMR study in a living-donor setting. In addition, we have advanced our deceased-donor study toward an expected enrollment completion in Q3. These accomplishments, just during this quarter, keep us on track as we drive toward our anticipated series of as many as 7 new indications or product approvals through 2018.","Starting with our next product, asfotase alfa, and then followed by Soliris for AMR and DGF in kidney transplant, and for both NMO and MG. Our third product, cPMP for infants with MoCD Type A. And we expect approval of one or more of our next-generation follow-on product to Soliris within the same period.","In early April, we announced our plans for future expansion, with additional facilities to Ireland, as we continue to optimize our global supply chain operations to best serve patients worldwide. Separately, and following our continued improvements in our Rhode Island manufacturing and quality operations, earlier this year, we submitted our request for inspection to the FDA, and we are waiting the reinspection of our manufacturing facility.","Looking in our financial performance, and excluding the onetime positive impact of $88 million in pre-2014 sales, we achieved 41% growth in revenues in Q1 2014, compared to a year-ago quarter. Turning to our earnings, and also excluding the onetime positive impact for the pre-2014 sales, we reported 78% growth in non-GAAP EPS in Q1 2014, compared to the year-ago quarter.","Looking forward, and based on our strong revenue performance anticipated for the year, coupled with our forecasted improvements in COGS, SG&A and non-GAAP tax rate, we are now raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year from the prior range of $4.37 to $4.47, now to the higher range of $4.75 to $4.85.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance in Q1, as well as our expectations for the remainder of 2014. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Lenny. We are pleased by our strong start to 2014. I would like to discuss our revenue and earnings performance in Q1, as well as the factors driving to this upward revision in EPS guidance.","Our revenue of $567 million and non-GAAP EPS of $1.53, were positively impacted by $88 million in revenue associated with shipments of Soliris in France before 2014. Excluding this item, our in quarter sales of $479 million or 41% increase compared to the prior year. This $88 million in revenue also contributed $0.37 to our non-GAAP EPS. Our non-GAAP EPS, excluding this item, was $1.16, which was an increase of 78% over Q1 2013.","Again, excluding this $88 million in revenue related to previous years, I note 5 factors in particular that positively impacted Q1 earnings. First, our earnings were significantly augmented by the strength of our top line revenue performance across all our territories.","Second, I would like to note that our Q1 revenues and sequential growth benefited from the significant number of patients in France, who entered the quarter already on treatment.","Third, COGS during the quarter, at approximately 6.5% of sales, were lower than the anticipated 9% as we modified our royalty agreement enabling us to reverse prior accruals. COGS were also improved as we were able to use increased inventory from our third-party manufacturers based in Singapore.","Fourth, SG&A for the quarter was 24% of sales as we continue to make improvements in our operations across our commercial platform. And fifth, our non-GAAP tax rate of 8% was lower than the previously anticipated 10% to 11%, largely due to the utilization of foreign tax credits earlier than anticipated.","These improvements in Q1 in COGS, SG&A and our non-GAAP tax rate, reflect the positive impact of our long-term initiatives to increase operational and financial efficiencies. And also -- and are also expected to positively impact our financial performance in the remaining quarters of 2014. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.55 billion in cash and cash equivalents.","Now, turning to our 2014 guidance. I note in particular, 3 areas of continued benefit that we expect from our ongoing operational and financial initiatives. First, based in part on our Q1 performance, we are guiding to a lower full year COGS from the previous 9% of sales to approximately 8% of sales for 2014.","Second, increasing efficiencies across our global platform have enabled us to reduce our 2014 SG&A guidance to the lower level of $550 million to $570 million. As in the past, we expect SG&A in the remainder of the year to be higher than Q1, reflecting costs associated with the organizational buildout for asfotase alfa and major medical conferences across 3 therapeutic areas.","Third, we are guiding to a lower non-GAAP tax rate from the previously guided range of 10% to 11%, now to the lower full year 2014 non-GAAP tax rate in the range of 8% to 9%. Beyond 2014, as previously noted and following utilization of our remaining tax credits, we continue to expect that our non-GAAP tax rate will gradually rise to a range of 16% to 18% by 2016.","Given our strong revenue performance and the improvements in our COGS, SG&A and tax rates, we have to revise our 2014 non-GAAP EPS guidance from the previous range of $4.37 to $4.47, now to the higher range of $4.75 to $4.85. We're very pleased with the strong start to 2014, which is reflected in our financial results and our outlook for the year.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to David. David?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Vikas. During Q1, we achieved strong Soliris in quarter revenue growth of 41% over the year-ago quarter. This reflects continued steady growth in PNH and our ongoing launch in aHUS, now further supported by the recent reimbursement progress in Europe.","Looking first at PNH in Q1. We were pleased with our steady performance in our core territories of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan. And we also observed consistent growth in serving new patients in Turkey, Brazil and Russia.","In all territories, including those where we have operated the longest, we continue to observe that the majority of patients with PNH, newly starting on Soliris, were also newly diagnosed. The consistent number of newly diagnosed patients and continuing uptake of Soliris in PNH, reflects the ongoing positive impact of our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. These educational efforts are supported by continued new medical evidence and are vital to patients. Given that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commenced appropriate therapy.","Now turning to aHUS. During Q1 we were pleased with the ongoing strength of the early stages of our global launch. Importantly, the transformative clinical benefits of Soliris for patients with aHUS, and the overall value proposition with Soliris, are recognized by public and private reimbursement authorities in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan.","In the U.S., our aHUS disease education and diagnostic initiatives, again resulted in a steady increase in the number of new patients commencing Soliris therapy. Our U.S. team continues to implement our plan with urgency to help more patients with this devastating disease. In Western Europe, we were especially pleased to achieve an agreement with the government in France. And combined with our strong progress in other Western European countries, we remained confident that we will further extend our aHUS launch across the region in 2014.","In England, and following the strong confirmation in March by NICE of the efficacy and value of Soliris, we look forward to working with the U.K. government to conclude the reimbursement process. Importantly, during the NICE process, new and existing patients with aHUS in England continue to gain access to treatment through the broad NHS England interim policy.","Beyond the U.S. and EMEA, we made steady progress with our Japan aHUS launch in Q1. We continue to ramp-up our disease education and diagnostic initiatives to hematologists and nephrologist, and look forward to a steady uptake of Soliris for aHUS patients in Japan, as the first year of launch progresses.","Globally, the ongoing strength in the early stages of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH, and perhaps larger. As one measure, we continue to observe that match for time, since their respective approvals, more patients in the U.S. are currently receiving Soliris for aHUS, than there had been for PNH. These results support our belief that the incidence of aHUS is higher than the incidence of PNH.","In line with this dynamic, we will continue to accelerate our efforts to support rapid diagnosis and treatment of more patients with aHUS, as well as continue to educate physicians about the genetic lifelong nature of the disease.","Beyond our current commercial operations, I would like to now turn to our preparations for the launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, for patients with hypophosphatasia or HPP. Importantly, in addition to the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation, our market research confirms our view that there is a strong need for transformative therapy for patients with pediatric-onset HPP, including those adults who had their first symptoms prior to the age of 18.","As we continue to establish our metabolic therapeutic area for our anticipated launch of asfotase alfa early next year, we have started to selectively add initial field-based medical teams in the U.S. and Western Europe. Additionally, we expect to begin hiring and training our initial in-country metabolic commercial teams later this year.","To best serve patients with HPP, we are leveraging our learnings and expertise in PNH and aHUS to develop commercial programs upon launch to support the HPP community. We recognize that in very similar to our current operations. Physician education is essential to optimize care for patients with an ultra-rare disease.","Beyond planning for the launch of asfotase alfa, we are beginning to establish commercial teams to assess and plan for our opportunities in AMR, DGF, NMO, MG and the next-generation Soliris molecules. These teams will work closely with our R&D colleagues as they advance these programs through the development process.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our development programs. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Thanks, David. I am pleased to provide an update on our lead development programs, as we drive towards our goal of achieving up to 7 new indications or product approvals through 2018.","To begin, and based on our ongoing discussions to date with the FDA as part of the breakthrough therapy process, we announced this morning that we have recently commenced the rolling submission of our BLA for asfotase alfa. Specifically, we have submitted the CMC section of the dossier, expect to submit initial clinical components later this quarter, and anticipate completing the entire dossier during the fall as we look to build a strong label for asfotase alfa. We are on track to file a dossier with European regulators near mid-year. Likewise, we continue to expect to file our dossier for asfotase alfa in Japan before year end.","Our goal in all territories is to work collaboratively with regulatory authorities to obtain marketing authorization for pediatric-onset HPP as quickly as possible. As we proceed with our asfotase alfa filings, we continue to build the growing body of clinical data on the devastating nature of HPP and the transformative impact of this noble therapy for patients.","Next month, researchers will present new data from the first natural history study of the severe perinatal and infantile forms of HPP at the joint meeting of the Pediatric Academic Societies and the Asian Society for Pediatric Research. These data show the very high mortality rates in this patient population and are supportive of our filings.","Researchers will also present new data from the extension phase of 2 clinical studies examining the long-term efficacy and safety of asfotase alfa in infants and juveniles with HPP. These abstract show that infants and young children with life-threatening HPP, treated with asfotase alfa for 3 years, had sustained improvement in bone mineralization and respiratory status, and have improved probability of survival.","In addition, data from the juvenile extension study show that children with rickets and weakness from HPP, treated with asfotase alfa for up to 3 years, showed significant, early and sustained improvement in bone mineralization and radiographic evidence of healing of rickets, as well as early and sustained improvement in gross motor function and stamina. We are pleased that these data are consistent with earlier results and support the life-transforming potential of asfotase alfa for HPP patients.","And finally, the natural history study in juveniles with HPP is ongoing and is expected to be completed in the fall, enabling us to complete our rolling submission for the U.S. BLA.","I would like to discuss the progress of our development programs with eculizumab. Looking first at antibody-mediated rejection, or AMR, in kidney transplant patients. We have now completed enrollment, and have indeed overenrolled, and our living-donor study and dosing is ongoing. We also continued to enroll patients in our expanded deceased-donor study, and expect to remain on track to complete enrollment and dosing in this program in the second half of the year.","Earlier this month, the Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Commission, granted orphan drug status to eculizumab for the prevention of graft rejection following solid organ transplantation. Also, in the area of transplant, in Q1, both the FDA and the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to eculizumab for the prevention of delayed graft function or DGF. Following positive discussions with regulators in the U.S. and EU, we expect to initiate a single multinational DGF registration trial in mid-2014.","Turning now to neurology. Our program in neuromyelitis optica, or NMO, is on track as we have now initiated dosing in our anticipated single registration trial with eculizumab in relapsing NMO, a life-threatening ultra-rare neurologic disorder. Our study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted across multiple sites, with the primary outcome measure of time to relapse in patients who continue to have relapses regardless of which therapy or therapies they may have received.","We have now also commenced screening in our single registration study in refractory myasthenia gravis, or MG. This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study, in which the primary outcome is change in total MG-ADL score from baseline to week 26.","Finally, with regard to lifecycle management of Soliris well through the 2020s, we expect to initiate clinical studies with 2 or more next-generation Soliris molecules in 2014. With another molecule at an earlier stage of development.","I will now turn to our lead development programs with our highly innovative therapies, cPMP and ALXN1007. In our metabolic disease area, we continue to accelerate the development of our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A, an ultra-rare genetic metabolic disorder that causes catastrophic neurologic damage in newborns.","We have now commenced the synthetic cPMP switch study in patients with MoCD, who previously received the E. coli derived form of the drug. And we are continuing our retrospective data collection and enrollment in our natural history study, which are both programs we expect to complete in 2014.","With regard to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, we will commence our first Phase II proof-of-concept study in Q2. And will commence the next proof-of-concept clinical study in another severe and ultra-rare disorder later this year, with the expectation of having initial data near year end in at least one of these studies.","Beyond our current late-stage clinical development program, we are pleased to note that we have now initiated 2 targeted programs as part of our long-term exclusive strategic agreement with Moderna for the discovery and development of messenger RNA Therapeutics to treat patients with rare diseases.","As we look ahead in 2014, we are well on the way toward the 10 or more development milestones we expect to reach in our in-house programs. And we plan to continue enhancing our R&D capabilities through disciplined research collaborations, licensing and acquisitions. Our focus remains on developing therapeutic candidates with life-transforming potential for patients with rare and severe disorders.","I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Martin. In the first quarter of 2014, we had strong performance across our commercial development and operational initiatives. Throughout remainder of the year, we'll build on these accomplishments as we seek to serve more patients with PNH and aHUS around the world, complete the regulatory filings for asfotase alfa and prepare for a robust launch in HPP. And to simultaneously drive forward our lead development programs for the benefit of patients with additional severe and rare disorders. As always, we thank our employees for their dedication to our mission. As we work to transform the lives of patients.","Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe for Vikas, if we pull out the $88 million for France in Q1, it looks like the quarter-on-quarter gross for Soliris in absolute dollars is around $37 million. I know you spoke to a little bit of bolus and new patient starts from France, but we're also expecting Q1 to be seasonally slow. So how do we think about that $37 million quarter-on-quarter increase in sales and what does that mean going forward?","Vikas Sinha","Thank you, Eric. So let me just explain the $37 million sequential growth and how it will look like going from Q1 to Q2. There were 2 factors that impacted Q1. That sequential growth was there from Q4 to Q1, but will not continue into Q1 to Q2. First is, as you mentioned, we entered Q1 with a significant number of patients already receiving Soliris in France. And second, we also saw a reduction in rebate in some European countries. Excluding these 2 items, that will not contribute to the sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, our growth would have been approximately $20 million to $21 million. And then as you're moving from Q1 to Q2 as -- and obviously, as compared to Q1, there will be 1 additional infusion day in Q2. So that -- if you factor that in on top of $20 million to $21 million, you'll get a sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. Does that make sense?","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, it does. Perfect.","Operator","And we'll now move to Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to talk a little bit about HPP. Just with respect to the patient community or advocacy groups, so I guess it would be helpful if you can compare the contrast the level of disease awareness that, in your experience, compared to PNH and aHUS. So just help us, I guess, with the launch and the visibility for HPP.","Leonard Bell","David?","David L. Hallal","Yes. Geoff, thanks for the question. We see it -- what I was referring to a little bit earlier in the call, we want to run our PNH and aHUS as a playbook across the opportunity to serve patients with HPP. We see it as being similarly low. And it's, frankly, across more than 1 or 2 specialties. As you know, with PNH, we launched into a single specialty, largely the hematology audience. With aHUS, we launched into the nephrology and hematology audience. And now, with HPP, there is a variety of different specialties, where these patients visit. Often times, unfortunately, without an accurate diagnosis. And so our pre-approval plans around disease awareness will be very, very important for us, as well as, obviously, targeting the right physicians with our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives.","Operator","And we'll now move to Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I was just curious, so you talked about launching in adults who's been diagnosed before 18 in the U.S. Did Europe reached a similar agreement? And do you see expansion for the technology for asfotase alfa into other indications?","Leonard Bell","Martin?","Martin MacKay","Okay. Thanks, Lenny. Well, clearly, as I mentioned on the call, we're working through this now and gathering more data. Of course, the key part here was the recognition of onset being important, whether it's perinatal, infantile or juvenile. This is the important piece of it. So we see the treatment of any patient that onset comes earlier than, for example, adults. Hopefully that helped.","Leonard Bell","We, certainly, Robyn. It's Lenny, adding in. We certainly see our keen focus from a development and commercial perspective, making sure that we don't lose focus on the primary objective, which is the pediatric-onset hypophosphatasia, which we see as a very significant and devastating disorder. So we're really keeping our focus on that disorder, as we then look to expand further after that into other areas potentially.","Martin MacKay","Yes.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Chris Raymond with Robert W. Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just -- I have a reminder here in my calendar that, I think, in this half we're expecting a reinspection in the Rhode Island facility. Can you just talk about -- has that happened already or is there an update there?","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes. Now I can answer that, this is Steve. So I think, as Lenny mentioned on the call, first I'll say we're extraordinarily pleased with some of the remediation plans we put in place in Rhode Island and the improvements that we've already made to the Rhode Island facility. In fact, such so, that we informed the FDA that, from our point of view, we're ready for a reinspection. They have not yet visited and has not yet been scheduled.","Operator","And we'll now move to Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So having looked at the clinicaltrials.gov entries for the NMO and MG studies you announced this morning. Looks like in both cases, the entry criteria differs a little bit from the Phase II studies, in terms of prior treatment experience among other things. Just wondering, Martin, if you could speak to the refined entry criteria in Phase III, what that implies to the practical matter of getting the trials done and ultimately, the size of the addressable populations if approvable?","Martin MacKay","Thanks a lot, Matt. And really, you touched on it in your question. We've had extensive discussions with investigators globally and of course, with regulators. And those clinical endpoints much more matched the population that we'd be looking to treat. So we believe that this study is really perfectly attuned to that patient population, in both neuromyelitis optica and myasthenia gravis. Thank you.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And is there anything you can say about whether or not this represents, still, sort of ultra-severe, ultra-rare patient populations or is this in any way sort of a little bit of a broader patient population than what you had initially studied in Phase II?","Leonard Bell","Yes. It's Lenny, just chiming in as well. It's potentially a little broader population, but frankly, at the same level of severity.","Martin MacKay","Yes.","Operator","And we'll now move to Ying Huang with Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First one is on the rolling submission for asfotase. We noted that the natural history study for juvenile patient is still ongoing. So do you expect to finish that study in the fall, when you complete the rolling submission? If not, would that have any impact on the labeling discussion with the agency or not? And then secondly, I want to ask a question about the treatment protocol for the recently initiated NMO study in Phase III. Would you allow patients to receive drugs like CellCept or Rituxan for NMO?","Martin MacKay","Thank you. Let me take the rolling submission question first, and maybe just going to a little more detail here for clarity. We have identified a path to get to the best label to serve patients with HPP. Through our continued dialogue with the FDA, and as both Lenny and I mentioned on the call, as part of the Breakthrough Therapy process, we recently expanded our juvenile natural history study. We really feel that this expansion of the juvenile natural history study will position us for a strong and comprehensive label in the pediatric-onset indication. The timing of the discussion with the FDA and the decision to expand the trial, is such that we now expect this expanded study to complete in the fall. As part of this discussions, we agreed on a rolling submission to allow earlier review of available components of the dossier with the clean objective of shortening the overall review period. And in fact, as we noted, we have submitted the CMC section, we'll submit parts of the initial clinical package this quarter, and plan to complete the submission in the fall. We know that by virtue of the Breakthrough Therapy designation, the FDA is interested in moving asfotase alfa forward as quickly as possible. So while the expanded juvenile natural history study may result in a short delay in the time to the completion of our U.S. filing, we believe this expanded study will bring a lot of value to the product label. Based on our rolling submission and Breakthrough Therapy designation, we anticipate launching in early 2015. I would add one other part to the question and that is, we are still on track for submitting for pediatric-onset HPP in the EU near mid-year and in Japan later in 2014. With an expectation to launch asfotase alfa in the EU in 2015, but Japan to follow later that year.","Leonard Bell","So the short answer is it works well. As being someone who's had -- read the notes also, I think it's a -- yes.","Martin MacKay","Thank you. Thank you, Lenny. Yes. As to your question on Rituximab, we do anticipate after the obvious clear out period of studying severe relapsing NMO patients, including those that have failed Rituximab. So hopefully, that handles both your questions, the second being slightly shorter than the first.","Operator","And we'll now move to Howard Liang with Leerink.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","cPMP or Alexion 1101, this study -- the current study with the synthetic version is characterized as a bridging study. Is that -- are you planning to do another study with another version as a pivotal study for its intention to use the E. coli data for potential filing? And can you talk about is the bridging study with 4 patients?","Martin MacKay","Yes. Let me try and break that question down. I think there's 2 or 3 components in there. As you rightly know, we do have the switch study and in fact, we've started the study with the synthetic form of cPMP as a natural bridge. We will continue with the study, as we noted on the call. In terms of filing, clearly, the switch study, I will be part of that filing. And we will look to conduct a naive study sometime next year, as part of the filing package for MoCD. I would say it's just a little premature to know exactly how that will pan out. Again, as I've noted, we have a Breakthrough designation for this cPMP and MoCD, and that's going allow us again to have these interactions with the FDA to plan for the best way forward in this devastating disease.","Operator","And we'll now move to Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'll tackle the commentary about the aHUS and PNH markets. So, Lenny, you overcast, could you give us some color on the net growth in Q1 from Q4? How much of it came from aHUS and how much from PNH? And then secondly, are you saying that the revenue from aHUS can exceed the revenue in market from PNH? And then lastly, when would you expect that to happen on a market-by-market basis, is that within 4 or 5 quarters or a longer period of time after the aHUS launches? When do you think that will actually happen?","Leonard Bell","Steve, you want to start to give some color?","David L. Hallal","Sure. So, Geoff, we -- typically, we don't break out our growth between PNH and aHUS. I would say, yes, as to one measure that we're utilizing, that is the number of active patients in the U.S. on treatment for aHUS for time-adjusted intervals against the launch pattern in PNH, where we see that exceeding. Obviously, we think at some point, aHUS may likely exceed that of PNH. But it's very difficult to tell when because there is such an opportunity to continue to grow our operations in PNH with so many patients not yet diagnosed. So both businesses are growing. Do we expect that the lines at some point would cross? aHUS exceeding PNH? Maybe at some point, but the PNH opportunity remains very robust.","Operator","We'll now move to Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Quickly on asfotase, you mentioned you submitted the CMC package. I was hoping you could remind us where you are with respect to manufacturing from a process and supply perspective as the launch approaches. And then, in bigger picture, as you move Soliris into later stage trials in multiple orphan indication, I was sort of curious if there are ways you might be able to leverage your expertise and complement pathway science to potentially explore some of the less ultra-rare opportunities where there is still an unmet need in the division of the component that the complement pathway could benefit patients?","Leonard Bell","Steve, you want to address the manufacturing question?","Stephen P. Squinto","I'll take it quickly on the asfotase alfa manufacturing. I think, I've mentioned on prior calls or we've mentioned on prior calls, that we put a lot of effort into building a very robust manufacturing process for asfotase alfa. We're quite -- feeling quite good about that and are in good shape, which is why we were able to put together the CMC section of the dossier very, very quickly. And fortunately, allowed us to submit, as we've just announced. So we're in good shape with asfotase alfa manufacturing.","Leonard Bell","Martin?","Martin MacKay","Yes. Thank you. Brian, in terms of your question on the other complement inhibitors, I'll break it down into a couple of parts. Certainly, for Soliris, we'll also, always concentrate on ultra rare and devastating, obviously, with PNH and atypical aHUS. But if you look at our other studies with eculizumab whether it be neuromyelitis optica, myasthenia gravis or in the transplant area with AMR and DGF, a small population devastating disease. As we look at other mediators in the complement pathway, we'll take this on a case-by-case basis. As you rightly see the expertise here, Alexion around that pathway is quite formidable, and we will look at other indications as we develop this mediators. Hopefully, that answers your question.","Operator","And we'll now move to Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just 2 for me. I was wondering if you can give us any more color about aHUS in Japan, and how that -- maybe the early launch there compares to the early PNH launch in that country? And then with respect to the European countries, the roll out of aHUS, I think, you mentioned you're targeting a number of other countries in Europe this year. I was wondering if you could speculate about kind of the sequence of rollouts there.","Leonard Bell","Sure. So regarding Japan, as I've mentioned during the call, we're adjusting our -- Q1 was really just our second quarter of launch. And we're pleased with the early observations, as we initiate our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. As it relates to -- and we'll be providing updates on Japan, as the first year of launch progresses. As it relates to PNH, I think, one, PNH and aHUS have very different dynamics everywhere, and then Japan, specifically, has a different dynamic. And so the difference between PNH and aHUS, as we have observed, is there was a large or prevalent pool in PNH in all the countries that we launched. And so we generally saw, when we opened up in countries, higher number of patients initially commenced treatment, whereas aHUS, because of the very, very high rate of mortality in ESRD within is the first 12 months of diagnosis, there was less of a prevalent pool and largely, sort of a slower buildup of patients initially as we entered countries. Just to remind you, in Japan, because of the very high prevalence of bone marrow failure disorders, which overlap with PNH, we believe Japan has always benefited from having an enriched population of patients with PNH. So we would see that dynamic not necessarily carry through with aHUS. As it relates to Europe, we're very pleased with our progress. I think for the first time in 2014, we can safely say that we have some European countries that had a full year of reimbursement for aHUS for all of 2014, and that's why we're very excited about the progress that we're likely to make this year in serving more patients. We announced, obviously, earlier -- last quarter the success in France. What we look toward now is continued province by province activity in Spain, following the approval of national reimbursement. So our teams are working with local authorities there. And we still expect, near mid-year, a long-term arrangement with the Italian government as well. But right now, in Italy, through an early access program, patients are receiving access to treatment. So we're very encouraged in Europe and do look forward to adding even more countries.","Operator","And will now move to Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities.","Matthew W. Luchini - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","This is Matthew, on for Ian. I wanted to come back, if I could, to PNH and talk a little bit about some of the other territories you guys have highlighted over the last couple of quarters, Turkey, Brazil, Russia, et cetera. And specifically, when I was hoping in this, if you could give a sense or a little bit more color in terms of -- sort of the relative differences you're seeing as you are now on the ground in these markets in terms of physician awareness or disease awareness and diagnosis rates, anything that could get us, give us a little bit more sense as to how these markets are behaving relative to, say, what you saw in the U.S. and EU when Soliris was initially being rolled out in PNH?","Leonard Bell","Thanks. Again, just to remind you, Turkey, Russia and Brazil, what is -- what supports our efforts there with PNH is that the government have established a mechanism to serve their citizens with funding. And so that is, obviously, very helpful. In the aggregate population of those 3 countries, when you look at the reimbursable population, is larger than that of even the United States. And so what we've observed in these 3 countries is actually a very similar pattern of what we've seen in the U.S. and Europe and that is, when we initially launched in these countries our disease awareness activities, there was an initial group of patients that would start treatment. And then through our initiatives, through newly diagnosed patients, newly identified patients, we'd see a steady pattern of patients commencing therapy. So not dramatically different than what we've seen in the U.S. and Western Europe. Just -- what I would say, it's just earlier in the time line of our commercialization efforts.","Operator","And we'll now move to Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have got 2 questions. One is simple, just any plans to take one of your follow-on, the Soliris follow-on programs into AMD, just given some of the interesting data there and geographic atrophy. And then secondly, with respect to asfotase alfa, you guys are obviously going to be involved in looking at low-alkaline phosphatase screening to try to find undiagnosed adults with HPP. I guess, technically, they may not qualify for the labels, it's not clear, because they weren't diagnosed before the age of 18. So what's the thinking about strategy there how to get them reimbursed?","Leonard Bell","Sure. Thanks, Yaron. Martin, do you want to go first or...","Martin MacKay","Yes. In terms of the other indications, and then maybe Lenny and David can talk about the asfotase. Another indication, and it's fair to say with those follow-on, is I really touched on and when I described some of the works that we're doing in the complement pathway, we're interested in a number of indications, actually. And we will, obviously, gather some data to be able to decide on which indications would be most useful for us.","Leonard Bell","Yes. And just strictly speaking, we have a whole portfolio of different modules that we're progressing forward. Obviously, we're going to be focused most exceptionally on serving patients with PNH, aHUS, and other disorders that are really demarketed by having just overwhelming devastation, premature mortality and for where we know, we can provide a life-transforming benefit. There may be other molecules, of course, that may serve a purpose for other types of administration in other sorts of disease settings. David?","David L. Hallal","Yes. Regarding the onset question, first, really appreciate your knowledge on how an HPP patient will be diagnosed. So yes, we are focused, obviously, on low ALP and making sure, at launch, that there are enough diagnostic labs, that not only conducts the test, but I think what's really important is it's not just low ALP, it's age-adjusted and gender adjusted-ALP, which our early market research suggest that maybe not all physicians appreciate, much of their efforts is to diagnose patients with high-ALP, which goes in the wrong direction of HPP. So the diagnostic initiative is very, very important. And then to your point about onset. I guess, the way that we look at it is, I'm not sure that they would have had to have had a diagnosis prior to the age of 18. But I think the past medical history for the patient would have to highlight some level of symptoms associated with HPP, before the age of 18. And then it can be documented as that patient having had pediatric-onset hypophosphatasia. And that's the approach that we will take, and we think it's a reasonable approach.","Operator","We'll move to Lee Kalowski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Lee Kalowski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So on the call, it sounds like you're guiding for a U.S. and EU launch for HPP in 2015. I think in the past, you talked about approvals coming in 2014, but it sounds like you're also very far along the way with the rolling submission. So should we be thinking about a possibility of 2014 approval, at least, in the U.S. And as far as some of the sensitivities around milestone payments that might be due with respect to the U.S. and EU approval and launch milestones, of a cost, can you give is a little color on that?","Leonard Bell","Yes. I'll answer the question. Thank you for your very thoughtful and insightful question. So I think, as Martin and I said in the prepared remarks, as Martin said, very extensively, subsequently, we are very much focused on filing across our 3 core quarter areas, really, our core territories, where there'll be a filing in Europe in the coming months. There'll be for pediatric-onset hypophosphatasia. There'll be -- the filings are already underway now, here in the United States. That filing we expect to complete in the fall. For the review of that, of course, it's subject to the Breakthrough Therapy designation. So we'll, obviously, try to progress this as quickly as possible. The FDA cleared, indicated by virtue of its designation of Breakthrough Therapy designation, there are high level of interest in expediting assets. And we think there's an excellent dialogue underway. We expect that dialogue to accelerate over the next several months, frankly, now they already have materials to start review and that will be increasing on a monthly basis. And then, of course, towards the end of the year we'll be filing in Japan, which is extremely important given that there is a relatively high preponderance of the mutations in Japan, resulting in a lethal or near-lethal version of the disorder. So we're very well focused on beating our own performance there in aHUS and PNH with bringing that forward as quickly as possible for patients. And I think that, that gives you our impression of where we are, I don't know if you had -- that helps orient you some more. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the conference over to Irving Adler, Executive Director, Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Irving Adler","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the first quarter of 2013 and our outlook for the year.","Today's call will be led by Dr. Leonard Bell, our Chief Executive Officer. Lenny will be joined by members of Alexion management: Dr. Steve Squinto,  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development; Vikas Sinha, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and David Hallal, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K reports on file with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after this call.","I'd also like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP operating results are adjusted from our U.S. GAAP operating results for certain adjustments that were described in our press release issued this morning. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release. Thank you. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thank you, Irving. In the first quarter of 2013, Alexion maintained our strong momentum in our mission to develop and deliver life-transforming therapies for patients with severe and life-threatening disorders that are also ultra-rare. During the quarter, we also received a warning letter from the FDA, which I will briefly address later in my remarks. In his section of the call, Steve will provide a comprehensive review of the letter, our submitted response and our ongoing actions.","During Q1, we significantly progressed our 3 primary commercial and product development initiatives. First, our global rollout in PNH proceeded with a steady addition of new patients commencing Soliris therapy across our nearly 50-patient global commercial platform. Second, we continue to observe a steady addition of new patients with aHUS receiving Soliris therapy in the United States and have now started to increase our operations to serve an increasing number of patients in Western Europe. Third, Q1 was an especially noteworthy quarter across the breadth of our R&D pipeline.","I am pleased to announce that we completed enrollment in the multinational deceased donor kidney transplant trial ahead of schedule, recently agreed with regulators on conducting a single pivotal registration trial in myasthenia gravis, completed enrollment in the natural history study of hypophosphatasia in infants, initiated a retrospective clinical study of cPMP and MoCD and following positive discussions with regulators, are now also planning to initiate the first study with our newly manufactured synthetic cPMP.","Looking more closely at PNH, in Q1, a significant number of new patients, again, commenced Soliris therapy in our core territories in the United Estates, Western Europe and Japan, augmented by steady contributions from Turkey, Brazil and Russia and other countries across our global operations.","Turning to aHUS. In the United States, during Q1, we again observed a steady increase in the number of patients commencing Soliris therapy. Our aHUS performance in Q1 continued to reinforce our belief that over time, we have the opportunity to serve a similar or greater number of aHUS patients compared to PNH across our nearly 50-country platform.","In our aHUS operations in Western Europe, we continue to progress the reimbursement processes in key countries and anticipate additional commercial launches in the second half of this year. In England, the government has very recently clarified to Alexion and patient groups its process for providing access to Soliris for patients with aHUS. To begin, it will now fund Soliris for any newly arising case of aHUS. NHS England will subsequently develop our policies specific to aHUS, which in turn will be expected to be operative until the NICE recommendation.","Turning to our increased 2013 guidance. With continued strength in serving a growing number of patients with PNH globally, together with the newly increased visibility to serve additional aHUS patients in the latter part of this year, we announced today that we have raised our revenue and earnings forecast for the year.","I would now like to briefly discuss the warning letter from the FDA that we received in March regarding compliance with current GMPs for Soliris in our Rhode Island manufacturing facility. Earlier this month, we submitted our comprehensive response to the FDA. I would also remind you that in his section of the call, Steve will provide a comprehensive review of the letter, our submitted response and our ongoing actions.","We are taking observations detailed in the warning letter very seriously with a substantial amount of focus and attention at the highest levels of the company, including our board. As we work diligently to improve our performance and to address the agency's concerns, our overall objectives are to broadly review and to raise the bar in all aspects of our manufacturing quality operations, even beyond the requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities.","Before I briefly review our response to the letter, I note 2 important points regarding supply. First, our release lots have met our rigorous specifications for final product, which are approved by the FDA as well as other regulatory agencies. And second, in light of the multiple layers of supply chain redundancy we have established in recent years, we believe that the supply of Soliris to patients will not be interrupted. We note that the warning letter does not restrict production of Soliris or shipment of Soliris from the Rhode Island facility and we continue to manufacture Soliris in this facility.","In addition, a second and independent facility, in this case a contract manufacturer, is also currently approved worldwide for production of Soliris. Further, a third independent facility, also a contract manufacturer, was validated in 2012 for production of Soliris, and we are currently completing our regulatory submissions for this independent facility. We anticipate that the first approval for this additional Soliris manufacturing facility will occur in the fourth quarter of 2013.","While we continue to build additional inventory, with further manufacturing runs scheduled at all 3 Soliris facilities later this year, we estimate that our current inventory of Soliris approved for commercial sale is sufficient for at least 4,000 patient years of treatment. Importantly, our expectations for BLA filings relating to new indications for Soliris and for new products remain unchanged in light of our multiple supply sources.","The letter focuses on 2 sets of observations. The first, regard the adequacy of our investigation of bacterial contaminations in selected batches during the earliest pre-purification steps of the manufacturing process. And second, regarding the robustness of our quality systems. In regard to the previously observed bacterial contaminations in the earliest pre-purification steps, we believe that they were caused by environmental sources inside the plant. During the latter part of 2012, we addressed these root causes by making physical corrections in the facility to prevent potential recurrence of bacterial contamination and by having improved our equipment cleaning procedures. Also regarding the first observation, we are currently developing assays to specifically demonstrate effectiveness of the current initial pre-purification steps to eliminate any bacterial contaminant.","Importantly, and turning to the FDA's second observation, we are also working with several independent industry experts to comprehensively review, test and improve our quality system procedures and programs to prevent future recurrences in the early process steps and to strengthen our overall control processes. Beyond the anticipated resolution of the warning letter, we are committed to a business model in which we are constantly seeking to improve our performance across our manufacturing and quality operations through ongoing self-critical analysis augmented by independent experts.","Finally, and as we announced this morning, we're also directly increasing the senior talent level overall in the R&D and manufacturing organizations with an important objective being a higher level of senior focus, specifically on the manufacturing quality areas. As I noted, in his section of the call, Steve will provide a comprehensive review of the letter, our submitted response and our ongoing actions.","Turning to R&D. Q1 was especially noteworthy across the breadth of our development pipeline. I'd like to highlight 4 key milestones that were achieved in the quarter. First, we completed enrollment in the deceased donor kidney transplant trial ahead of schedule, and we expect data to be presented by year end. Second, as an NMO and following recent and positive discussions with regulators, we now plan to conduct a single pivotal registration trial in myasthenia gravis. We are now finalizing clinical protocols for this study and plan to commence enrollment in the second half of this year. Third, in our hypophosphatasia program, we have now completed enrollment in the interim natural history study, which is a key component of our pediatric clinical program. We remain on track for a pediatric filing for asfotase alfa in the United States and Europe in 2014. And fourth, we have now initiated a retrospective study of cPMP and MoCD patients. And following positive discussions with regulators, we are now also planning to initiate the first study with our synthetic cPMP as well as to initiate a natural history study in patients with MoCD Type A.","Finally, in our press release this morning, we announced important additions and enhancements to our executive leadership team as we continue to strengthen and broaden our talent at all levels. I am particularly pleased to announce that Steve Squinto, a co-founder of Alexion with me, is being promoted to the newly created position of Executive Vice President and Chief Global Operations Officer. In his new role, Steve will increasingly focus his activities on leadership of our critical technical operations and quality organizations. As Steve steps into his new position, we are pleased that Martin Mackay will be joining Alexion in mid-May as Executive Vice President and Global Head of R&D, from his previous position as President, Research and Development at AstraZeneca. I am excited to work with Martin as together, we drive to serve more patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders.","I am also pleased that Saqib Islam has joined us as Senior Vice President, Chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer from his previous position as Managing Director, Head of Health Care Capital Markets at Credit Suisse. In his new position, Saqib will focus on accelerating and executing our current corporate growth strategies.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Lenny. Q1 2013 was another period of strong financial performance by Alexion. During the quarter, we achieved continued steady growth in revenues and profits, and cash flow was again robust. Details of our financial performance are included in this morning's press release. I'd like to highlight a few points regarding Q1 and then look ahead to some key considerations for the remaining of the year.","Soliris sales in Q1 were $338.9 million, a 38% increase compared to Q1 2012. During the quarter, we continued to grow our global PNH business in our existing territories. And in Q1, we achieved steady growth in our aHUS revenues in the U.S. and also saw an early positive impact from Western Europe. Importantly, we expect to increasingly leverage our investments in our commercial operations, which are now in place to serve patients with severe and life-threatening disorders in nearly 50 countries.","As we executed strongly on patient-centered initiatives in Q1, we continued to control both SG&A and R&D expenses well within our guided ranges. Likewise, SG&A in the quarter was 29% of revenues and R&D was 19%, again, within our targets. Strong top line performance, combined with control of other key financial parameters, resulted in a 49% increase in non-GAAP net income to $131 million or $0.65 per share in Q1 2013. Non-GAAP net income excludes upfront and milestone payments related to technology acquisition, which had a favorable impact of approximately $0.01 on EPS in Q1.","Turning to our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at quarter end were just over $1 billion. This reflects positive cash flow from our business during the quarter, offset by our share repurchase program and payment of accrued taxes related to the Enobia acquisition. Turning to our guidance, we are now raising our 2013 revenue guidance from the previous range of $1,490,000,000 to $1,505,000,000 now to the higher range of $1,505,000,000 to $1,520,000,000. This improved revenue performance, coupled with continued discipline in our operating and manufacturing expenses, is enabling us to meaningfully improve our 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance from the previous range of $2.82 to $2.92, now to the higher range of $2.87 to $2.97.","We are reiterating all other aspects of our previously announced 2013 financial guidance. I would like to note some key considerations regarding our new 2013 guidance. In Q1, we experienced a negative currency impact on revenues of $1 million net of hedging compared to Q4, driven by weakness in Japanese yen. Despite the further weakening of the yen, particularly in Q2, and the expected impact on our business results in Japan toward the remainder of the year, we are able to increase our global revenue guidance.","With regard to operating expenses, and as in past years, we expect that SG&A in Q2 and Q4 will be higher than in Q1, reflecting our participation in a growing number of major medical conferences. We also expect that R&D expenses will increase in the remaining quarters of this year, as we continue to accelerate our 9 lead development programs. These expense expectations are likewise within our reiterated expense guidance.","We are pleased with our progress in the first quarter of the year and look forward to serving more patients across our operations in coming quarters.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to David. David?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Vikas. In the first quarter of 2013, global revenues from our Soliris operations increased by a robust 38% compared to the first quarter of 2012, reflecting continued growth in PNH globally, a steady addition of new patients with aHUS in the U.S. and a small contribution from Western Europe. As we continue to grow our PNH operations by achieving deeper penetration in the nearly 50 countries in which we serve patients, we are also serving an increasing number of patients with aHUS in the U.S. At the same time, we also expect to serve an increasing number of aHUS patients in Western Europe as we progress through the reimbursement processes in major EU countries throughout the year.","Looking more closely at PNH in Q1, our diagnostic and disease awareness initiatives are resulting in high levels of identification of new patients with PNH in our core territories of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan. As in prior quarters, the majority of PNH patients newly starting on Soliris during Q1 were also newly diagnosed, indicating the strong potential for further growth in PNH. Beyond our core territories, we continue to expand our operations in additional large countries. In Turkey, Brazil and Russia, we are in the early stages of expanding our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives and expect that we will see a steady rate of new patient identification and Soliris treatment initiation in these countries over time.","We are also now focusing on Korea as the next major country in our global PNH rollout, commencing later in 2013. In addition, we see a significant opportunity to serve patients with PNH in multiple countries in Latin America, specifically Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, also commencing later in 2013 and growing further in 2014. Our goal is to optimize patient care broadly over our 50-country commercial platform. As we enter the seventh year since our initial PNH launch, we continue to grow in our existing territories and to serve PNH patients in new countries. We remain acutely aware that worldwide, the majority of patients with PNH have not yet received an accurate diagnosis, let alone commenced appropriate treatment.","Turning now to aHUS and looking first at the U.S. In Q1, we again observed a steady increase in the number of new patients with aHUS commenting Soliris therapy. Also we continue to observe that the majority of patients who are newly starting on Soliris treatment are newly diagnosed, presenting urgently with this life-threatening condition.","As we progress with our aHUS launch, we are confident that 4 drivers will contribute to our long-term growth. First, an increasing number of patients with PMA will be tested for aHUS. Second, a shorter turnaround time for a higher proportion of ADAMTS13 tests. Third, once diagnosed with aHUS, a higher proportion of patients will be rapidly started on Soliris treatment. And finally, over time, physicians will more fully appreciate the genetic and lifelong nature of aHUS.","Our U.S. performance in aHUS provides a solid foundation for a strong global rollout for patients around the world. In Western Europe, as we begin to serve initial patients, our teams are planning for their individual country launches. And we are making meaningful progress with the reimbursement processes in key countries. In England, since the government has very recently clarified to Alexion and patient groups its process for providing access to Soliris, a small but increasing number of initial aHUS patients are beginning to receive Soliris. In line with this new access program, our field team is now commencing our aHUS disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to support serving more patients. We would expect in England, as we have observed in the U.S., that over time, the majority of patients who newly start on Soliris treatment will be newly diagnosed, presenting urgently with this life-threatening condition.","In Germany, at the end of Q1 and as anticipated, hospitals obtained inpatient reimbursement for aHUS. Soliris is now funded in both outpatient and inpatient settings, and our German field team is proceeding to launch our aHUS initiatives. In France, we are continuing reimbursement discussions with the government, following the very high ASMR II rating that Soliris received for aHUS late last year. We expect that the strong recognition of the clinical benefits of Soliris will support broad access to therapy in France, and we expect these discussions to progress through midyear.","In Italy, during Q1, the government continued to provide Soliris through an early access program for patients with aHUS, as we advanced through the reimbursement process to cover all patients with aHUS. In Spain, selected initial aHUS patients are starting to receive access to Soliris locally, as we progress through the national government reimbursement process. And in the Netherlands, a small number of initial patients with aHUS now have access to Soliris therapy, following the add-on status granted last year by the CVZ authority of the Dutch government. Outside of Europe and based on our recent aHUS registration filing in Japan, our in-country commercial team is now laying the foundation for our anticipated launch in 2014.","Beyond our current Soliris indications in PNH and aHUS, we are building our global commercial operations to prepare for the launches of a series of new indications for Soliris as well as in 2014, the anticipated launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, as a treatment for patients with HPP. Our metabolic team continues to identify the medical needs of the HPP community, mindful that diagnoses can be missed and the natural history of the disease may be misunderstood. With the progress of our transplant development programs, our Nephrology team is continuing to develop our early commercial plans for a potential launch in kidney transplant. They are also continuing their efforts to better understand the disease and diagnostic patterns of STEC-HUS. Importantly, as our development teams are now planning single pivotal registration trials in our 2 lead neurology indications for Soliris, we are starting to develop our plans on how best to serve patients with NMO and MG to severe, life-threatening and ultra-rare disorders.","In closing, we look forward to serving more patients with PNH and aHUS in more countries in 2013, and to expanding our commercial platform to serve patients with additional severe and life-threatening ultra-rare disorders in the years ahead.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Steve, who will review our expanding pipeline initiatives. Steve?","Stephen P. Squinto","Thanks, David. The first quarter of 2013 was especially noteworthy across the breadth of our R&D programs, which are now focused on 5 highly innovative therapeutic candidates, including eculizumab, at various stages of development across 9 severe and life-threatening disorders that are also ultra-rare. As Lenny noted, we are pleased to announce that during the quarter, we completed enrollment ahead of schedule in the multinational deceased donor kidney transplant trial and are expecting data to be presented later this year.","Following recent and positive discussions with regulators, we now plan to conduct a single pivotal registration trial in myasthenia gravis. We completed enrollment in the natural history study of hypophosphatasia in infants. Finally, we initiated a retrospective study of cPMP and MoCD. And following positive discussions with regulators, are now also planning to initiate the first clinical study with our synthetic cPMP. In addition, we plan to initiate a natural history study in patients with MoCD Type A near midyear.","Before looking at our progress in individual programs, I would like to address some key points regarding the FDA warning letter and our response. As noted, our previously released lots have met all regulatory specifications for final product. And we further believe that the supply of Soliris to patients will not be interrupted, given our multiple layers of supply chain redundancy. Furthermore, and equally important from a development perspective, given our multiple production sites and systems, our expectations remain unchanged for BLA filings related to new indications for Soliris and for new products.","On April 16 -- our April 16 response to the FDA was prepared and critically reviewed by a team of senior internal management and external experts. The response documented changes that have already been completed, improvements under way and commitments and timelines for further improvements. As I indicated, we believe we have already addressed many of the FDA's observations in the original Form 483, since it was issued in August of 2012. Looking first at root causes, in regard to the previously observed bacterial contaminations in the earliest pre-purification steps, we believe that they were caused by environmental sources inside the plant.","I would highlight several improvements identified in our response to the FDA. First, we have reengineered and made physical corrections in the facility as well as improvements to prevent potential recurrence of bacterial contamination as well as improvements in the bioreactor cleaning procedures. Second, we are currently developing an assay to specifically demonstrate effectiveness of the current initial pre-purification steps to eliminate any bacterial contaminant. Third, we have already updated specific elements of our quality systems since the FDA inspection this past summer, and are continuing to further improve identified procedures. Fourth and perhaps most importantly, a particular role for our retained industry experts will be to comprehensively review and test all of our quality procedures and programs, a broad gap analysis across all of our system procedures. While this analysis will be important in order to fully resolve the FDA's concerns in an efficient and effective manner and to prevent further recurrences, it is equally important to strengthen our overall quality processes.","Overall, our objectives are to broadly review and to raise the bar in all aspects of our manufacturing and quality operations, even beyond the requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Beyond the anticipated resolution of the warning letter, we are committed to a business model in which we are constantly seeking to improve our performance across our manufacturing and quality operations through ongoing self-critical analysis, augmented by independent experts.","I would now like to discuss the progress of our R&D programs, beginning with eculizumab and looking first at neurology. We continue to accelerate our program in severe and relapsing neuromyelitis optica or NMO as we prepare to commence a single pivotal multinational registration trial in the second half of 2013. In addition, data from the previous investigator-initiated NMO study are expected to be published later this year. Importantly, we are also pleased to announce that as in NMO, following recent and positive discussions with regulators, we now plan to conduct a single pivotal registration trial in myasthenia gravis, which we expect to begin in the second half of 2013. We are currently finalizing the clinical protocol for this prospective controlled study in patients with severe refractory MG.","In kidney transplant, we are pleased to announce that we have recently completed enrollment ahead of schedule in our company-sponsored multinational deceased donor trial in patients at elevated risk of antibody mediated rejection or AMR. Data from this study are expected to be presented at a medical congress towards the end of this year.","I would like to point out that our deceased donor study will also evaluate delayed graft function or DGF as a key prospective secondary endpoint. We expect to discuss these DGF data with regulators as well as data from a separate investigator-initiated trial in DGF in the second half of the year in order to accelerate an Alexion-sponsored multinational DGF registration program. Enrollment in our company-sponsored multinational living donor transplant trial in patients with elevated risk of AMR is ongoing, and we expect to continue enrollment through 2013.","Turning to STEC-HUS. We are continuing to obtain and analyze additional and longer-term controlled clinical outcome data from an epidemiologic study in approximately 400 STEC-HUS patients who receive only best supportive care. We believe these longer-term data, when combined with the positive data from our company-sponsored 28-week single-arm eculizumab STEC-HUS trial in Germany, will strengthen our regulatory submission. We expect to apply for marketing authorization for eculizumab in the treatment of STEC-HUS near year end.","I will now turn to our lead development programs with highly innovative therapeutic candidates beyond eculizumab and starting with asfotase alfa. In Q1, we completed enrollment in the natural history study of hypophosphatasia in infants, which will supplement the existing open label asfotase alfa trials in infants. We are also planning to initiate enrollment in a 6-month placebo-controlled study of asfotase alfa in juveniles with HPP in the second half of the year. We remain on track for a pediatric filing for asfotase alfa in HPP in the U.S. and Europe in 2014. In addition, enrollment is ongoing in our clinical trial for asfotase alfa in Japan, and we expect to complete dosing in 2014.","Beyond asfotase alfa, we are evaluating 3 additional highly innovative therapeutic candidates as treatment for patients with severe and life-threatening disorders that are also ultra-rare across a wide range of therapeutic areas. In our metabolic disease area, were accelerating the development of our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A, a severe, ultra-rare and genetic metabolic disorder that is fatal in newborns. Recently, we met with regulators to discuss the cPMP program and now plan to initiate a trial of our synthetic cPMP in normal volunteers near midyear. Additionally, we have also started a retrospective data collection from a small number of individual newborns with MoCD, who have been treated with an earlier form of the cPMP Replacement Therapy. Finally, we plan to initiate a natural history study in patients with MoCD Type A near midyear.","Also enrollment continues in a Phase I study of ALXN1102 and 1103, IV and subcu versions, respectively, of our novel, alternative pathway complement inhibitor. We are on track to complete these Phase I studies in the first half of this year and to meet with regulators to discuss trial data and the development program later in the year. And finally, after completing dosing in our single-dose Phase I clinical study of ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, we plan to discuss the initiation of a multi-dose Phase I study with regulators near midyear. And following these discussions, we expect to explore development of ALXN1007 in multiple severe, life-threatening and ultra-rare conditions.","After a quarter of particularly noteworthy progress across the breadth of our development platform, Alexion's R&D team is focused on further accelerating our pipeline programs. All of our 9 lead programs are on track to reach important milestones this year. These milestones include registration trial initiations in both NMO and MG; in Japan, completion of clinical development in the aHUS study and enrollment in the HPP study; key data publications or presentations in NMO, MG, STEC-HUS, kidney transplant, HPP and aHUS; and trial enrollment completion across several lead programs.","In closing, our RD team will continue to drive our programs forward with urgency, as we plan to achieve these milestones this year to help patients and families suffering with severe and life-threatening, ultra-rare disorders. I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Steve. We look forward to building on our achievements in the first quarter of the year to serve even more patients with more disorders in more countries in 2013 and beyond. We thank all those who make our work possible, our employees, researchers and physicians around the world, and of course, patients and their families.","Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick one for Steve on the root cause of the contamination. You mentioned you had identified an environmental source. Is that something that was introduced via a person or raw material or the airway supply? Any help you could give us there. And if Vikas could comment on any gross margin impact from all of your remediation efforts. I noticed that cost of goods were a little higher than expected in Q1.","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes, thanks, Eric. Let me start by saying, yes, we have identified the microbial agents that were the contaminating factors. They're soil-based organisms. We believe that they were probably introduced from someone's shoes, clothing, hair and probably related to an improperly functioning floor drain that has now been reengineered. And as I mentioned also on the call, we've also changed the way we clean and store our bioreactor equipment. And I think we have now -- we believe we've adequately addressed both of those issues.","Vikas Sinha","Eric, addressing the gross margin percentages. The expenses related to the FDA warning letter is not significant enough that it \u2013 and plus it'll not go into the cost of goods also. It'll probably be expensed within the R&D side. So it's not material. It's within the guidance. The gross margin for the full year, we'll stick with the guidance of 10%. And Stephen\u2026","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes, Eric, I just want to make one further note. Actually, since all those changes have been made, we've really not had any early-in-process bioburden excursions since the changes were made. And actually, we've had a number now of substantial batches run successfully without any of these excursions.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. Vikas, is there any reason that COGS were a little higher in Q1?","Vikas Sinha","Yes, so 10.1% was in Q1. And Eric, because of the country mixes, because the revenues come in different currencies and the expenses are in U.S. dollars for COGS. Sometimes, we do see up and down, but over the year, we'll be okay.","Operator","We'll go next to Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about aHUS and, I guess, specifically, the idea that there is a higher incident population than maybe even PNH based on the U.S. run rate. I'm wondering, I guess, 2 points on that. One is how confident are you that you're seeing only aHUS and not getting some kind of more standard, more common HUS in there as well? And then do you have any visibility, I know it's early, but into the duration on Soliris at this point? They're somewhat connected, but I guess what I'm wondering is how should we think about this base? Are patients going to be coming off of therapy earlier because there's some HUS mix in there?","David L. Hallal","Yes. Sure, Rachel. So regarding the incidence, obviously, it's hard to tell what the specific incidence is. But we do think, and we've obviously been communicating since launch, that given the severity of aHUS, we didn't necessarily expect there to be a large prevalent pool of patients since half of them either die, progress to dialysis or have permanent renal damage. So what we are seeing on an ongoing basis is that the majority of patients coming in are newly diagnosed with an initial TMA. Historically, physicians would, typically, by their background, might diagnose the patient. For example, we've discussed this, hematologist would typically diagnosed a TMA patient as TTP without any differential diagnosis at all. And in fact, when you dig a little bit deeper on that and recognize that a diagnosis for TTP really does require an ADAMTS13 level that is severely deficient, that is generally below 5% or 10%, you recognize that a lot of these patients may be misdiagnosed. So incidence is hard to tell. We think that physicians, through education, are starting a differential diagnosis process that's helping them to rule in aHUS a little bit more. And so that's helpful, but we would see as one of the growth drivers more appreciation for that. Regarding compliance, as we anticipated, it's generally good in patients with a confirmed diagnosis with aHUS, but does appear to be a little bit less than we've come to expect with PNH. I think it's important that both the U.S. and European labels do have very strong warnings about the risks associated with discontinuation of treatment, missed doses. And in fact, even in the European label, they're recommending treatment for a lifetime. As I was alluding to on the call, we're spending a significant amount of time educating physicians about the genetic and lifelong nature of aHUS, so that they can gain a little bit more of an appreciation for the fact that it is not a disease that would be marked by a shorter-term event but the complement is always overactive in these patients and that's why Soliris would be used chronically. And so it's a critical component of our educational efforts.","Operator","We'll go next to Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I got a couple. So last quarter, you guys gave a geographic breakdown of growth for 2012. Can you give us that same level of detail or at least help us directionally with the trends for the first quarter of this year? And then the second question is, can you talk about your initial experience with aHUS in Germany? How is it different from the experience in the U.S. when you think about things like screening identifications, speed to getting therapy, et cetera?","Vikas Sinha","So I'll start with the geographical breakdown. Geoff, we only try to do that once a year during our K, so we will not be providing that on a quarterly basis.","David L. Hallal","Yes. Regarding Germany, Geoff, we thought it was pretty important to have the, and as we anticipated, hospitals to actually have in-patient reimbursement for Soliris for aHUS. As I'm describing, we see a higher proportion of patients coming in urgently in a state of thrombotic microangiopathy, physicians are trying to make a rapid diagnosis. And so we are seeing that, that is having an impact. In terms of differences in Germany, I think it's just too early to tell whether or not there are significant differences in that country versus the U.S. We'll be tracking very closely that over time.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And then a quick follow-up on asfotase alfa. What inning are you guys in with respect to optimizing the manufacturing? When you file next year, will that be on the old versus an improved manufacturing process?","Stephen P. Squinto","Well, to start right there, it'll be on the initial process that was developed.","Leonard Bell","The initial cell line improvements.","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes, yes. That's different.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Salveen Richter with Canaccord Genuity.","Salveen J. Richter - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I'm just wondering, as you've been talking to the 5 EU plus Netherlands on reimbursement processes, I'm just curious on how pricing discussions are progressing with each of these countries.","David L. Hallal","Yes, Salveen, as we've described in the past, we look at Soliris now approved for both PNH and aHUS, 2 ultra-rare, life-threatening conditions where, with PNH, a 35% death rate for untreated patients at 5 years. Then aHUS, as I just mentioned in my response to Rachel, half the patients either die, progress to ESRD and are on dialysis or have permanent renal damage after 12 months. So obviously, that sets up for the governments the need of their citizens. And then you look at the transformative benefits that are well characterized in our labels in that in Europe. And I think as governments, as we progress through reimbursement processes, they have choices to make. And obviously, they -- as we have these discussions with them, they can see the ultimate value that Soliris will have for their citizens. And so it's certainly very helpful in those discussions.","Salveen J. Richter - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up. In terms of the transplant data that's being released, are we -- are you going to file on the deceased donor study? Or are you going to wait for living donor, as well as DGF before you do a filing?","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes, it's a great question. So I think as we said this morning on the call, we've now just completed enrollment, which was great. It was ahead of schedule. I think at this point, we'll have to see kind of what the data teaches us about where we are with the deceased donor. I would say if the data is highly positive, I think that's something that we will consider, whether or not we want to drive forward with the deceased donor program first.","Operator","We'll go next to David Friedman with Morgan Stanley.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just one quick one on the transplant data, which is, what will the maturity of the data be when we see it versus what the ultimate data will be? And then also just quickly on these natural history studies. What is the sort of goal of them vis-a-vis filing, meaning at what maturity does a natural history study need to be to be part of a filing? Or is that not a gating issue at all?","Stephen P. Squinto","Let's start with the transplant data. So again, as I said, we just literally completed enrollment. I'm -- we're hoping that data will be presented at a transplant congress later in the year. Of course, it's very important in our discussions with regulators. Not only is the primary endpoint, which is a 9-week endpoint looking at AMR critical, but I think we're going to want to take a look at what happens long term with these patients, 1-year outcomes. So you'll see an interim look at the data this -- later this year, but it will not be final data from that trial. Regarding the natural history study, particularly the one that we've just completed enrollment around for asfotase alfa, we expect that to be part of the BLA filing for asfotase alfa. So the data will need to be absolutely mature for that filing.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And sorry, just a quick follow-up for the asfotase alfa. The finishing enrolling now with a plan to file next year, that time delta is enough for maturity?","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess I just have a big picture question. So regarding the third manufacturing facility that you're going to get approved, can you help us understand, is that really just to support global production? Will it have an impact on tax rate over time? And you've talked a lot about the new studies you're starting, like NMO and MG, big picture, what have your thoughts been regarding regulatory discussions? Is there a difference you've seen this year versus previous years, as far as breakthrough designation or the bar for doing clinical trials and getting things approved?","Leonard Bell","Steve, you want me to start and you'll kind of go from there?","Stephen P. Squinto","Sure.","Leonard Bell","So, Robyn, first -- it's Lenny. Regarding manufacturing, certainly, we actually purchased our Rhode Island facility, which was a previous owner's facility that we started renovating in 2006 before we actually submitted our first BLA or MAA for Soliris. So that approach, obviously, that we telegraphed at the time was regarding redundancy. As we've grown to servicing patients and serving patients across 50 countries around the world, obviously, we've established operations across the globe at this point. And as we have now and over the last several years been planning for this third independent manufacturing facility, it provides us redundancy, which is very important, of course. It provides us new state-of-the-art facilities and access to those facilities. In addition to that also, there are certainly some important incentives that we have and returns we anticipate to maximize overtime regarding our expenses and how we review them regarding our overall operating expenses. So I think it hits all of those buttons. I would say looking back from our PNH discussions, and I think that they were in 2002 to 2004, prior to starting TRIUMPH and then SHEPHERD and so forth and going all the way forward to now, obviously, we've moved across different divisions in -- from the U.S. perspective, which is obviously very, very important in that hematology, oncology versus neurology and so forth. And so that gives different personnel and different views and perspectives. In Europe, on the other hand, generally speaking, we've stayed within the relatively similar system because the design of the European regulatory system being very different than the U.S. So it's, by and large, the same overview that it has been before. Steve, you want to comment on the current discussions?","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes, I will. We've had actually very, very productive discussions with the regulators, of course, as I mentioned on the call regarding both NMO and MG. This is known to be in a division within the FDA that's actually relatively conservative. So when we went into those discussions, we really didn't know how well the FDA would perceive the earlier studies that we conducted. I think that they were very pleased with what they saw. And I think were convinced that both the IIT study and NMO and  the Phase II study that we conducted in myasthenia gravis were both very strong hypothesis-generating studies. And I think that allowed them to agree with us to move towards the single pivotal program for registration. So we're pretty pleased with the outcome from those discussions.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo.","Shin Kang - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is Shin calling in for Brian. I have a couple of questions on your early pipeline. Your new synthetic cPMP, could you remind us what the difference is between the old and the new version and -- or some of the issues that might have made you change the manufacturing process, if any? And related to that, along with the natural history study on MOC deficiency, it looks like you guys might be looking at sulfite oxidase deficiency, which also seems to be related to MOC deficiency. Could you comment on the rationale behind the indication and about the opportunity there? And lastly, when should we expect to hear more about the 1007 program, what it targets and potential indication?","Stephen P. Squinto","Sure. Thanks with all those questions. So let's start with cPMP. Initially, that was in the hands of a company called Orphatec. And their production was using bacteria, a bacterial production system to make cPMP. When we looked at that, we were very, very excited about the drug and excited about what was being seen in a handful of patients that did receive that form of cPMP. Some of that has actually been published in top-notch medical journals, so you can refer to that as well. We decided to take a different approach. We decided for the commercialization of this product, it would be better to develop a synthetic route. So this is actually our first entr\u00e9e into small-molecule chemistry, but we've had a lot of success already and are making GMP form of cPMP through a synthetic route. And as we mentioned on the call this morning, we'll be moving that form of cPMP into clinical development very, very soon. In terms of MoCD, as I said, there's a fair amount of data out there on a small number of patients that receive that bacterial form. And we believe that cPMP can, in fact, be a life-saving drug for these infants. It's a very, very devastating disease. Patients build up very high levels of sulfite, which is a very potent neurotoxic agent, and this drug helps to reduce that and attenuate that. And then as far as ALXN1007, I would expect that perhaps on future calls, maybe even this year, we'll hear a little bit more about where we are with 1007.","Operator","We'll go next to Matthew Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sort of a bigger picture organizational and strategy question. I appreciate seeing the increasing depth of the senior management team here. And with the additions of Dr. Mackay and Mr. Islam, I was wondering, Lenny and Steve, if you could sort of add to your perspective on what this means to Alexion in terms of the capacity to advance objectives not only in R&D, but also in business development? I was wondering if you can give us any sense for what the right expectation should be in terms of business development going forward, any tactical shifts or time line shifts, as well as on the R&D side. I appreciate it.","Leonard Bell","This very much reminds me of the very long series of questions in Back to School with Rodney Dangerfield. Well, thanks very much for that question. So I think generally, obviously, Alexion continues to grow, particularly over the last decade. And we have grown substantially across a variety of geographies both -- so therefore in breadth and depth. And we recognized all along that the key opportunity for us to accelerate our growth actually is by broadening and strengthening talent at all roles of the company. And certainly, it's a very important signal and indication to put that as direct reports to me as the CEO. I think that, first of all, I'd just point out it's Dr. Mackay. So as Martin joins us, it provides really 2 opportunities. First of all, it allows the shouldering of a lot of the activities to be shared, frankly, so that Steve can increasingly focus on technical operations and quality, which is important to us going backwards and certainly quite important, if not more so, going forward. It also allows a very strong, globally well-respected, well-regarded R&D leader to come and really commit his passion to develop and deliver transformative therapies for patients with severe and devastating disorders, something for which I know Martin is extremely excited about. At the same time, Saqib joining us today -- or yesterday, I suppose, is very exciting. Saqib and I have known each other for quite a while and I have enormously high regard for his strategic thinking advice. And Saqib will play a very important role, not only from a strategic positioning development so that we can really build on the enormous success we've had to date in business development and developing our strategies. We've been very, very successful. And it's an indication of our ambition really to reach for higher levels, as we've been telegraphing for some time. And I think it's a tremendous opportunity that Saqib joins from a strategic perspective. But at the same time, Saqib will have important responsibilities across the company by helping to manage a variety of operations.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to elaborate. Should we expect that this may help your capacity in order to achieve some of the pipeline diversification goals that you have?","Leonard Bell","Actually, we're not looking to achieve pipeline diversification in any way. We are actually firmly focused on a filter that we've set, which is to identify the most severe and disabling disorders and then to identify, develop and deliver therapies that will transform the lives of these patients. And frankly, what it really indicates is not diversification, but more faster of what we've already been doing.","Operator","We'll go next to Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First one on asfotase alfa. I was just wondering in terms of the gating factor to filing, was just wondering if that's the juvenile trial? And can you walk us through timelines on enrollment for that? I know you mentioned it's going to be a 6-month trial. And then separately, I'd heard at a conference recently that there's some new legislation working its way through in Brazil to help improve access to orphan drugs there in that country. I was wondering if you guys had any comments. And should that be a tailwind for you guys in Brazil on the PNH side?","Stephen P. Squinto","So regarding asfotase alfa, I think -- before we lay out a timeline, I think 2014 is still very realistic for us. And I think we probably will have a very important meeting with regulators sometime midyear this year, which will help clarify things a little bit. But -- so it's hard to say at this moment whether the juvenile trial will be required. We think it's going to be a part of the program. We certainly know that the natural history study, based on conversations that Enobia had with regulators prior to the acquisition, was considered very, very important. So we're very pleased that we have finished enrollment in that trial and will now be looking to collect and clean up and get the data from that trial as well.","David L. Hallal","Regarding Brazil, we -- really globally, we work very closely with all governments. And Brazil has a strong track record, partially due to their constitution for their citizens' rights to life-saving therapies. And we are constantly tracking any changes in any country that may in some way impact a patient's access to treatment. But Brazil continues to be an important part of our growth plans moving forward in that region and in other large countries around the world.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christina Zhang from Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Actually, it's Ying Huang dialing from Amsterdam here. So the first question I have is on the manufacturing side. Can you clarify to us whether the clinical supplies for the cPMP program and also for the asfotase program, they are also being manufactured in your Rhode Island facility only? And then secondly, in terms of the reimbursement for aHUS in the U.K., would you expect any other country might follow this same model that is reimbursed for aHUS for Soliris only when the patients are presented with symptoms here?","Stephen P. Squinto","So regarding cPMP and asfotase alfa manufacturing, neither of those products are being manufactured in Rhode Island. Both are being manufactured -- as I said, cPMP is a synthetic route. It's a synthetic chemistry route of manufacturing, which is being done by a third party, as well as asfotase alfa is also being manufactured by a third party. David?","David L. Hallal","Yes, regarding the U.K., obviously, we were pleased to see the very recent clarification for access to some patients with aHUS. But as we've observed in the U.S., the majority of patients that are commencing treatment are patients with newly presenting TMA, usually in a very urgent medical state of the life-threatening disorder. We obviously look forward to continuing to work on efforts so that in all countries, patients with aHUS will have access to treatment.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A couple quick financial items. First, Vikas, could you confirm that you're headed towards -- still headed towards full federal taxation in 2014? And then just for Steve on the manufacturing inventory, has the 4,000 patient years of inventory been fully tested, completely released? Have you gone back and confirmed that there's no evidence of the same contaminants in those lots? It's absolutely certain it can be supplied? Could you confirm that?","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes, I think we can confirm that. As I said on the call, anything that's been released has met very, very stringent release criteria. The contamination that occurred happened very early in the process, even before purification, even before the material entered a protein A column. By the time it gets all the way through the process and it's actually finally filled and finished, it meets all of our release specs.","Vikas Sinha","And Geoff, this is Vikas. On the tax front, when we left 2012 with more than $400 million NOLs really in United States, we're looking at that to getting absorbed this year, in 2013. And based on that, our next year's guidance is around 28%. If there's something left on the NOLs at the end of this year, we will be able to utilize that next year. And I probably will be able to give you much better guidance when we get towards Q4.","Irving Adler","As we're running over the hour, any remaining questions we can take, please limit yourself to one.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Josh Schimmer with Lazard Capital Markets.","Joshua Schimmer - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the aHUS population who are on dialysis. Maybe can you give us a sense of the size of that opportunity relative to patients not on dialysis, as well as any progress you're making diagnosing and accessing this pool and how we should think about this going forward?","David L. Hallal","Yes, yes, it's a great question. And again, dating back to our call when we were first approved in September of 2011, as we described, we expected the dynamics in aHUS to be very different from that of PNH. That is, given the devastation of aHUS, that there would be a proportion of patients that were either on -- awaiting a transplant, having dialysis. And it could potentially be a longer process for those patients to actually access a transplant and access Soliris. There clearly is data that is suggestive, though, that those patients, while perhaps not having a renal function, they can have extrarenal TMA, which is very dangerous to other organs and we've seen that. And so it's an important population that we are working on. But what we've seen is, over time, the new patients that are starting are the earlier patients. The majority of the patients starting are those earlier patients that are coming in with their first or second clinical manifestations of thrombotic microangiopathy. And those dynamics are what we're really seeing in the U.S. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","And Josh, just putting David's description in other terms, I think it's important at times to step back. This is less something that should be seen in my view, and I know David's view as well, as a commercial opportunity as opposed to philosophical right to treatment as well. And so we don't look at it as an opportunity, as you phrase it. It's really, quite frankly, more of a consideration of whether all citizens have equal access to therapy.","Operator","We'll go next to Richard Reznick with William Blair.","Richard Reznick","This is Rich Reznick for John Sonnier. Just a quick one on STEC-HUS. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the regulatory strategy with Soliris. Specifically, are you going to submit in Europe and the U.S. by year end or just Europe? And then any thoughts on when you may do a submission in Japan?","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes. I think the attempt would be to submit both in the U.S. and in Europe. And as I mentioned on the call this morning, we think a key aspect of that filing will be to continue to collect data around this controlled population of patients that came from this epidemiological study where we collected a lot of early laboratory data and now we're going back and collecting some longer-term clinical outcome data, particularly renal function and CNS function. We think will that -- that will strengthen the overall package.","Operator","We'll go next to Stephen Willey with Stifel.","Stephen D. Willey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just wondering if there's any kind of regulatory feedback you can share with us thus far on the myasthenia in the NMO studies? Specifically, in NMO, if you have confirmation that, that will be an event-driven study, and in MG, if that's going to be a 1-year study?","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes, so let me just make a little -- a few comments. As I said earlier to another question, similar question, I think we went into a very tough division of the FDA known to be a very conservative division. I think what pleased us quite a bit is that they looked at our -- in NMO, the IIT study and then myasthenia, the Phase II study that we conducted. They looked at both of those studies as very strong hypothesis-generating studies, which I think then led to a conversation around what would be next. And as we reported this morning, we have single pivotal trials for both. I think we're still working through some of the elements of the final protocol for both of NMO and MG so I can't, at this moment, comment on the definitive endpoints for those trials. We think the myasthenia trial is likely to be a 6-month trial and not a 1-year trial.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session and our call for today.

Please be advised, that today's conference may be recorded.","I would now like to hand the conference over to Morgan Sanford, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.","Morgan Sanford","Thank you, operator. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Aradhana Sarin, our Chief Financial Officer; John Orloff, our Global Head of R&D; and Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial and Global Operations Officer. You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call, by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website.","Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today, and we undertake no duty to update any of the statements after the call, except as required by law.","I'd also like to remind you, that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, our GAAP results. Thank you. Ludwig?","Ludwig Hantson","Thank you, Morgan, and good morning everyone. Before we review our fourth quarter and 2019 full year performance, I would like to take a brief moment to announce that we have successfully closed on our acquisition of Achillion Pharmaceuticals, which represents an important step in diversifying our business.","Through this acquisition, we had two clinical stage assets to our portfolio, with danicopan and 5228. We are thrilled to welcome our Achillion colleagues to Alexion and excited about the opportunity to collaborate on the development of these Factor D assets for a broad range of rare diseases.","Turning now to our 2019 performance, we delivered on all of our key objectives, and in many cases have surpassed our goals. ULTOMIRIS is now the market leader in PNH, in our three largest markets, the U.S., Germany and Japan. The ULTOMIRIS HUS conversion is progressing well in the U.S., and we anticipate launching in the EU and Japan this year.","We are also very pleased with the uptake of our neurology franchise, with continued growth of SOLIRIS in gMG and the launch in NMOSD. In just over two years, neurology has become our largest franchise in the U.S. by patient volumes. Our ambition is to quadruple the number of MG and NMOSD patients treated by SOLIRIS, and eventually ULTOMIRIS in the U.S. by 2025. Our metabolics portfolio continues to deliver strong growth, as we work to expand access for HPP and LAL-D patients.","Importantly, we have made great progress on our pipeline and have an ambition for 10 launches from now until the end of 2023, through a combination of new assets, new formulations and new indications. And once again have delivered on our financials, with 21% revenue growth and 33% non-GAAP earnings growth in 2019.","Turning to Slide 6, we have a clear strategy for long-term value creation. First, we will move past SOLIRIS and establish ULTOMIRIS as market leader in PNH and HUS, in our three key geographies. Secondly, we will expand our C5 franchise beyond PNH and HUS into larger rare diseases. We have ULTOMIRIS programs planned in six new indications including four neurology and two nephrology indications. In parallel, we will continue to innovate for patients with new formulations and subcu treatment options.","Finally, we will diversify our portfolio beyond C5. Achillion is the most recent example of this effort. With Factor D, we have the opportunity to pursue development in a broad range of indications. Outside of this transaction, we have built a robust rare disease pipeline over the past few years, and have clear line of sight to multiple potential blockbuster launches, including treatments for Wilson Disease and AL amyloidosis. We have significant financial capacity to continue to diversify our pipeline in the future.","In addition to bringing in external assets to diversify our business, we are evolving our leadership in complement to expand our addressable patient population. On Slide 7, you can see our business is rapidly moving beyond SOLIRIS. ULTOMIRIS is approved for two indications.","[Technical Difficulty]","Yes hi, this is Ludwig Hantson. We had a technical issue. I hope that you guys can hear us okay. So what I will do is, instead of restarting, we're going to start on Slide 6 and then we will take it from there.","So turning to Slide 6; we have a clear strategy for long-term value creation. First, we will move past SOLIRIS and establish ULTOMIRIS as market leader in PNH and HUS in our three key geographies. Secondly, we will expand our C5 franchise beyond PNH and HUS into larger rare diseases. We have ULTOMIRIS programs planned and six new indications including four neurology and two nephrology indications. In parallel, we will continue to innovate for patients with new formulations and subcu treatment options.","Finally we will diversify our portfolio beyond C5. Achillion is the most recent example of this effort. With Factor D, we have the opportunity to pursue development in a broad range of indications. Outside of this transaction, we have built a robust rare disease pipeline over the past few years and have clear line of sight to multiple potential blockbuster launches, including treatments for Wilson Disease and AL amyloidosis.","We have significant financial capacity to continue to diversify our pipeline in the future. In addition to bringing in external assets to diversify our business, we are evolving our leadership and complement to expand our addressable patient population.","On Slide 7, you can see our business is rapidly moving beyond SOLIRIS. ULTOMIRIS is approved for two indications and in development for six additional indications, across neurology and nephrology. This year, we will transition to a high concentration formulation, which will shorten infusions to only 45-minutes. Next year, we plan to launch our once-weekly, on body subcu ULTOMIRIS formulation, offering patients a home-based self administration option.","Our next generation subcu assets, 1810 and 1720 offer improved patient dosing regimens, and we have significant optionality for indication selection with each of these assets. From there, we will expand with Achillion's Factor D platform. We see immense opportunity for oral proximal complement treatments, to transform standard of care in many complement-mediated diseases.","On Slide 8, you see that once again, we have delivered strong top and bottom line growth for the fourth quarter and the full year, which provides a solid foundation to continue to deliver on our value creation strategy. Again, I'm very pleased with our strong execution against our 2019 priorities and excited for 2020, as we build on our successes.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Aradhana.","Aradhana Sarin","Thank you, Ludwig. Starting with Slide 10, we reported fourth quarter total revenues of approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year. This was driven by strength in our neurology franchise, continued growth in the core businesses and ULTOMIRIS launch.","Our non-GAAP operating margin was 51%, a reduction of 155 basis points versus prior year, driven by increased R&D spend, as we advanced and further build our development portfolio. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.71, representing 27% growth year-over-year, driven primarily by strong top line growth and lower effective tax rate.","Moving to Slide 11, fourth quarter total net product sales were primarily driven by patient volume growth in our key markets.","Turning to Slide 12, SOLIRIS revenues in the fourth quarter were approximately $1 billion, with year-over-year growth of 4%. SOLIRIS revenue growth was driven primarily by gMG revenues, partially offset by ULTOMIRIS conversion dynamics. ULTOMIRIS revenues in the fourth quarter were $170 million, which now includes contributions from atypical HUS in the United States. Metabolics revenues in the fourth quarter were $201 million, representing 32% year-over-year growth.","Turning to the P&L on Slide 13; during the quarter, non-GAAP R&D expense was $227 million or 16% of revenues. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $340 million or 25% of revenues. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 12%, and continued to benefit from certain one-time events, including the release of state income tax reserves related to the conclusion of an audit.","We reported fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS of $2.71, growing 27% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per share were $4. We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. This is not adjusted for the Achillion transaction.","I'll now turn to Slide 14 for our 2020 financial guidance. We are guiding to total revenues between $5.5 billion and $5.56 billion, this represents 11% growth year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. For SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS, our revenue guidance is $4.755 billion to $4.800 billion. This assumes continued momentum for SOLIRIS in gMG, our ongoing launch of SOLIRIS in NMOSD, and the launches of ULTOMIRIS for PNH and atypical HUS.","Turning to metabolics; our revenue guidance is $745 million to $760 million for both STRENSIQ and KANUMA. This includes the impact of the strategic pricing decision for STRENSIQ in the U.S. to support sustainability and access, given weight based dosing. In 2020 and beyond, it is important to consider the dynamics associated with conversion from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS, as it relates to the annual cost per patient.","There is a revenue benefit when each patient starts ULTOMIRIS PNH treatment due to the increased number of vials consumed during the loading dose. We benefited from this loading dose dynamic, having converted 60% plus of patients in PNH to ULTOMIRIS over the course of 2019. We now expect to be impacted by lower annual treatment cost per patient, as the majority of patients move to maintenance dosing.","In atypical HUS and other indications and development, we will see a lower annual cost per patient compared to SOLIRIS for both loading dose and maintenance dosing. It is also important to consider quarter-over-quarter variability due to every eight-week dosing for ULTOMIRIS. However, this quarterly fluctuation will even out on an annual basis.","We have included a slide in the appendix of this presentation, to provide a summary of this dynamic, and to serve as a reference, going forward. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 53.5% and 54.5% of revenues. Non-GAAP R&D expense is expected to be between 17.5% and 18.5% of revenues, and represents a step-up of approximately $270 million versus prior year, consistent with our intention to further build out and progress the pipeline.","Clinical program spend, particularly for late-stage development, is planned to increase in 2020. R&D expense also includes program costs and potential milestones for previously announced BD transactions and collaborations. Non-GAAP SG&A spend is expected to be between 19.5% and 20.5% of revenues for the full year 2020, and reflect increased leverage from top line growth.","We expect the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. In 2019, the non-GAAP effective tax rate benefited from certain one-time items. Absent these one-time benefits, our 2019 non-GAAP tax rate would have been approximately 15%. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to increase in the future, as a result of tax regulation changes outside the U.S.","GAAP EPS is expected to be between $7.91 and $8.71. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $10.65 and $10.85. The midpoint of the non-GAAP EPS is approximately 2% growth year-over-year, as a result of increased R&D spend, and an increased tax rate, compared to prior year. This guidance reflects the financial impact of our recently closed Achillion acquisition, but does not reflect any future M&A that we may pursue.","As you can see on Slide 15, we have established a track record of strong financial execution. Since 2017, we have delivered double digit total revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth, while maintaining a competitive, non-GAAP operating margin. We continue to invest in our R&D programs and have increased our non-GAAP R&D spend as a percentage of revenues, to within 16% to 19%, in line with our biotech peers.","With the current momentum of the business, we are well positioned to deliver on our 2020 financial goals.","I'll now turn the call over to John, to provide an update on R&D.","John Orloff","Thank you, Aradhana. On Slide 17, you can see our current development portfolio. We now have 19 planned clinical stage development programs for 2020. In the coming weeks and months, we expect to report interim data from our Phase III once weekly on body subcutaneous ULTOMIRIS program, an update on our anti-FcRn studies, and interim data from the Phase II study of danicopan in C3G.","We're excited about the acquisition of Achillion and look forward to providing additional detail in the coming months, as we embark on the integration. Just a few weeks ago, we reiterated our ambition to execute 10 launches by 2023 from our current portfolio.","On Slide 18, you can see our R&D highlights, which summarize these programs, including stage and clinical development, and the estimated addressable population. We are expanding our C5 presence well beyond the PNH and atypical HUS business, and are advancing ULTOMIRIS into five additional indications across neurology and nephrology. Together, the ULTOMIRIS programs present an opportunity to expand our treated patient population by tens of thousands of patients.","We believe in the compelling value proposition of ULTOMIRIS, which has been received well by patients, physicians and other key stakeholders, and are continuing to innovate with a high those concentration, reducing infusion time to 45 minutes and a once-weekly on body ULTOMIRIS subcutaneous formulation.","In addition to ULTOMIRIS indication expansion programs, we see opportunity to diversify our business beyond C5 with four additional late stage novel assets. Our Phase III superiority trial for ALXN1840 and Wilson's Disease remains ongoing. 1840 is an oral once-daily therapy, with 10,000 fold higher affinity for copper than current standard-of-care chelators, which have poor compliance rates, due to burdensome dosing regimens. We are on the verge of completing enrollment and expect the top line readout in the first half of next year.","We plan to initiate a Phase II\/III program for CAEL-101 in AL amyloidosis in the coming months. We see potential for this late stage asset to transform the treatment of AL amyloidosis, a disease characterized by misfolded kappa and lambda light change, resulting an abnormal deposits of amyloid, which can lead to organ failure. Patients are currently treated with a chemotherapeutic agents, not approved for amyloidosis, and median survival rates are only 18 months post diagnosis.","Clinical data supporting our rationale for the collaboration, showed a 63% overall organ response rate, in addition to efficacy on cardiac and renal endpoints. Our Phase II\/III program will look at an overall survival primary endpoint, with patient function, quality of life cardiac imaging, serving secondary endpoints.","Last year, we announced a license agreement with Eidos, to develop and commercialize AG10 for ATTR cardiomyopathy in Japan. AG10 is a small molecule, designed to address destabilized and misfolded transthyretin protein, which is the root cause of ATTR. We believe AG10 has potential to stabilize TTR, and halt disease progression. Pending regulatory discussions, we plan to extend the AG10 development program into Japan later this year.","Finally, we are excited about our acquisition of Achillion, and in its Factor D platform. Achillion reported positive Phase II data for danicopan in PNH patients with extravascular hemolysis at a medical conference last year. We see opportunity for danicopan in the small subset of PNH patients with extravascular hemolysis.","We see additional opportunity for danicopan in C3G, and expect interim Phase II data in the coming weeks, and we see great potential for ACH-5228, as twice daily best in class Factor D oral treatment in PNH, and a broad range of rare diseases. We are excited about the opportunity for these 10 potential launches to significantly expand the number of treated patients, and look forward to providing you with updates, as we progress through the year.","Moving to Slide 19; we have plans to further expand and diversify our C5 leadership, with our next generation assets. Starting on the left, our weekly subcutaneous formulation of ULTOMIRIS for use in PNH in atypical HUS is in an ongoing Phase III PK-based trial. Leveraging the WestGen on body device, we believe this will provide patients with the flexibility to choose how they wish to manage their disease within their lifestyle. We are expecting interim PK data in the second quarter of this year with a potential launch in 2021.","Next, we have the opportunity to evolve our terminal complement subcutaneous treatment options with ALXN1720 and ALXN1810. ALXN1720 is our internally designed bi-specific C5 inhibitor. At only 25 kilodaltons, ALXN1720 is a unique mini body tailor-made for convenience subcutaneous administration. We see opportunity for this asset in a number of larger rare disease indications and we look to initiate a proof-of-concept study in the first half of next year.","Finally, ALXN1810 is our co-formulation of ULTOMIRIS and Halozyme's PH20 hyaluronidase, which allows for bi-weekly subcutaneous dosing. We recently disclosed our plans to start a Phase II renal basket trial with ALXN1810 and look forward to providing additional updates, as this program progresses. Together, these three assets represent an opportunity for Alexion to expand our offerings for patients living with complement-mediated rare disease. Our development portfolio has grown significantly in the last two and a half years, and I'm incredibly proud of all the hard work undertaken by the entire R&D organization.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to provide commercial highlights for the quarter. Brian?","Brian Goff","Thank you, John. Turning first to Slide 22; we've seen unprecedented progress -- in establishing ULTOMIRIS as the market leader in PNH. This is due in large part to the compelling value proposition, which include strong data from the largest and most inclusive PNH clinical program ever conducted.","The broad inclusion criteria in the two Phase III trials in shorter study patient population, would be representative of the real world PNH population. Specifically, we enrolled transfusion independent and transfusion dependent patients, with no baseline hemoglobin or absolute reticulocyte count requirements.","We also included patients with prior history of bone marrow failure, which is critical, because roughly 40% to 50% PNH patients have a history of bone marrow failure or aplastic anemia. As of Monday of this week, we've converted 60% of PNH patients to ULTOMIRIS in the U.S., 62% in Germany and 53% in Japan, making ULTOMIRIS the PNH market leader in our three largest volume countries.","Our latest launch of ULTOMIRIS in atypical HUS in the U.S. is also off to a strong start. While it's still early days, conversion is tracking in line, with the PNH conversion curve at the same time point, since launch. Our neurology business is now our largest franchise by patient volume, and this was achieved in just two years since launch.","On Slide 23, you can see we exited the fourth quarter with 1,885 patients on treatment with SOLIRIS for gMG and NMOSD in the U.S. We've made significant progress advancing our presence in gMG and with our NMOSD launch. gMG patients continue to have broad access to SOLIRIS. Our strong NMOSD launch is underpinned by a remarkable Phase III data, showing 98% of patients relapse-free at 48 weeks, with sustained efficacy out to three years.","We're making progress educating payers on the severity of NMOSD attacks, the objective of preventing all relapses, and the difference between NMOSD and MS. As a result of these efforts, payer adoption of coverage policies for NMOSD has been rapid, and we're seeing strong adherence to SOLIRIS therapy in both gMG and NMOSD.","Looking ahead, we're well positioned to deliver on our ambition of quadrupling our U.S. GMG and NMOSD treated patient population within the next five years. With potential for ULTOMIRIS to launch in late 2022 or early 2023, as an every eight-week infusion.","Our once-weekly, on body subcutaneous formulation planned to launch simultaneously with the IV formulation, will provide another important treatment option for patients, who prefer self or home based administration. Our target gMG population represents more severe uncontrolled patients, and we believe this is a unique space, where SOLIRIS and then ULTOMIRIS can serve as a highly effective treatment option.","In NMOSD, our target patient population mirrors inclusion criteria in our Phase 3 SOLIRIS PREVENT trial. With our dedicated neurology team, we believe our commercial organization is well positioned to deliver on our 2025 ambitions. I'd like to take a brief moment to thank both our global commercial and global operations organizations, for their hard work and dedication, which has enabled us to excel with multiple launches, and continue to bring hope to the rare disease patients we serve.","I'll now turn the call back to Ludwig for closing comments. Ludwig?","Ludwig Hantson","Thank you, Brian. Once again, I'm very proud of what the team delivered in 2019. We're well positioned to further build on our momentum in 2020, and there is much to look forward to this year. We have laid out a clear strategy, to deliver long-term shareholder value, by establishing ULTOMIRIS as market leader in PNH and HUS, expanding our presence in C5, including planned programs in neurology and nephrology, and continue to look for opportunities to diversify our business beyond C5.","Importantly, we maintain our unwavering focus on patients and our commitment to advance our mission to deliver life changing therapies to people living with rare diseases.","With that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Cory Kasimov of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Cory Kasimov","I guess I just want to get a better sense of the drivers behind your guidance for 2020, particularly on the top line. On the surface it looks pretty conservative, is this primarily just a function of the pricing dynamic of assuming more ULTOMIRIS patients on maintenance dosing this year? Or are there other factors that are also important behind the scenes that I'm missing?","Ludwig Hantson","Yes Aradhana? The answer is, yes, you're right. But go ahead.","Aradhana Sarin","So first of all, we had an amazing year in 2019. 21% top line growth, 33% EPS growth, exceeded all our conversion targets, six BD deals, so 2019 was an amazing year. On 2020, we have guided to 11% top line growth. So there are few dynamics that are going on here. First of all, we had -- because we had great conversion from SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS in 2019, as we go into 2020, there will be an impact to revenues, due to the lower annual cost of treatment per patient, as majority of patients have now already converted, and will now go into maintenance dosing, that's on the PNH side.","On the atypical HUS side, we're just starting to launch ULTOMIRIS. There, we do not have the loading dose benefit. There in fact, on the first year, there is a 22% lower price per patient annual treatment cost, and in year two, there is a 33% lower treatment cost annually for the patient. As a result, that dynamic also is sort of a headwind from a revenue standpoint. This is to some extent mitigated by our neurology growth.","As you know, we put out our ambition for neurology, having four times the number of patients by 2025. So we're still seeing strong neurology growth on the patient volume side. In addition, we're also seeing high single-digit growth for PNH and atypical HUS patients, and our metabolics business continues to grow as well. So it's a mix of all these different factors that impact the top line.","On the bottom line, there are several other factors that impact the EPS guidance. As you can see, our R&D spend is going up substantially. It's about a $270 million increase on a dollar basis, and its 19 clinical programs that you've heard about, many of which we did not have in 2018 or 2019. In addition, the R&D spend also includes the spend that we will have, as a result of the close of the Achillion transaction.","In addition, the R&D spend includes the BD transactions that we've already announced, and the milestones that we expect to pay for those transactions, as those programs move forward. In addition, you see that the tax rate, which was on a non-GAAP basis, 13% in 2019 is on the midpoint, expected to be between 16% and 17% or 16.5%. So that's about 350 basis points change from 2019. So those are some of the factors that impact the bottom line.","Cory Kasimov","Okay.","Ludwig Hantson","Does that answer your question?","Cory Kasimov","Yes it does. The color is very helpful. Thank you very much.","Ludwig Hantson","Okay. We'll take the next question, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham","Good morning, guys, thanks for the question. I just have a couple of quick ones. For Brian...","Ludwig Hantson","Geoff, do you just mind speaking up a little bit, its very difficult to hear you? Yes. Is that better? Okay, let's try.","Geoff Meacham","Okay. So for Brian on ULTOMIRIS conversion, are there differences between PNH and aHUS, and down the road NMO and MG, with respect to conversion from SOLIRIS. I wasn't sure if there are nuances between the indications, or if the 70% target was broadly applicable? And then, Ludwig, just curious if there have been further dialog with -- between you and Elliott, since the announcement and maybe just highlight where you see the biggest differences between -- and opinion between the strategies going forward? Thank you.","Brian Goff","Hey Geoff, it's Brian. I'll start. On the on the conversion, first of all, your comment on, is the 70% broadly applicable to our base business of PNH and atypical HUS, the answer is yes. We have the same ambition. Of course, we've made excellent progress on PNH and as we've reported now in our three largest markets, with PNH, we are over the 50% mark. So ULTOMIRIS is definitively the market leader.","Atypical HUS is a different dynamic in terms of conversion, because it's a more acute condition. So you have many of the patients, who will start in the inpatient setting, and they may actually start on SOLIRIS. But then, as soon as they are discharged, there is an opportunity for facilitated patient conversion to ULTOMIRIS, and part of that is, hospital formulary dynamics and part is just awareness of ULTOMIRIS availability, but again, same ambition.","And the other half of your question was around neurology, and I guess here you're asking about with SOLIRIS, because it's too premature to talk about ULTOMIRIS in neurology. And there are very different dynamics between gMG and NMOSD. Though we're really pleased with the progress we're making with both launches. gMG as you know is two years and counting, and in the U.S., we continue to make progress in both breadth of prescribing as well as depth of prescribing.","In NMOSD, we began that journey in the middle part of last year. The launch is very much on track, and we gave the combined numbers of -- as of the end of last year, 1,885 patients. So that starting point of two years with gMG and six months plus with NMOSD, and the progress we've made, has really fed our ambition to be at four times, within five years from now.","Ludwig Hantson","With respect to your second question, Geoff, so we continue to have a constructive dialog with Elliott, as we have with all of our shareholders. As you know, our dialog with Elliott started in 2017 and we listened very carefully to all of you. We also believe that, we have a stock that is undervalued, especially given our strong execution in -- so the management team, including the Board, believes that we have a strong strategy and that we need to continue to focus on executing that strategy and that will create long-term shareholder value. There is not much more that I can add to that. Operator, can we take the next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of SVB Leerink. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges","Okay, thanks. Couple of questions. First Aradhana, just on the guidance, so it sounds to me as though you're saying that ULTOMIRIS is going to be sort of flattish to down, because there is obviously a strong underlying trend in SOLIRIS. So if I just take the Q4 revenue run rate and carry it forward, then I get to your guidance for 2020. So it sounds as though you're telling us that ULTOMIRIS is actually going to go down compared to the Q4 run rate, because of the dose shift, and I just want to make sure that's clear? And then another communication clarification question, your 10 launches by 2023, is that what you see being possible, or is that your strategic commitment? Meaning if some of those, which are clearly high risk such as ALS or even the Caelum program, if they fall by the wayside and the trials aren't successful, will you add other programs to ensure that you deliver 10 by 2023? I just want to understand how to think about that? Thanks.","Aradhana Sarin","Sure. So I'll address the first question and then John can address the second question. So I don't think it's accurate to assume that ULTOMIRIS revenues are actually going down. We expect ULTOMIRIS revenues to still go up for a number of reasons. First of all, we've only converted say around 60% of the market in our three major geographies, and there is still a long way to go, on the PNH side. Secondly, we just started launching ULTOMIRIS and atypical HUS, and that's a conversion dynamic that we will see.","Now, there is a mix of both volume as well as price, and you've been -- you can see in the appendix, the pricing dynamic. So we still expect the conversion to drive the volume and there will obviously be some price headwind, as a result of the lower annual cost per patient. That will be balanced by -- on the SOLIRIS side, strong growth on the neurology franchise, as well as on the metabolic side, both of those businesses still continue to grow very well.","Ludwig Hantson","Yes. We have -- $170 million for the quarter. So we have a run rate of $680 million. We plan to do much better than that, Geoff. It's almost no HUS sales in 2019 and U.S. is picking up and Brian was talking about the fact that the HUS conversion to ULTOMIRIS is similar to what we've seen with PNH, which is best in class. Plus, we think that we're on a good track to get European HUS approval before mid of this year. So that will come in as Plus every month, we have another country globally that's launching ULTOMIRIS. So ULTOMIRIS is going to grow substantially.","And then, with respect to your question on your 10 launches?","John Orloff","Yes. So Geoff. Hi. Its John. I think the 10 launches is clearly our ambition. We believe it's an achievable ambition. Five of those launches are related to ULTOMIRIS, which we think is de-risked, based on the data we have so far. Many of those are in disease areas where we've already established proof of concept and mechanism. The other five relates to new assets, two of those are danicopan and Factor D, where we think we have a strong supporting data.","And as you indicate, we continue to press the envelope, if you will, with regard to business development, and bringing in new assets that we think we will be able to kind of plug and play. And so we think that's -- it's highly achievable, and if one or more of those fall off, then we have other opportunities as well, that we haven't really talked about, both internally, as well as potentially, through external innovation.","Ludwig Hantson","Does that answer your questions, Geoff? Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.","Chris Raymond","Thanks for taking the question. Just noticing in your slides, I guess it's Slide 12 specifically, it looks like there's a lot more growth in Q4 for ULTOMIRIS in APAC or the rest of the world versus EU. Maybe just if you could talk about the assumptions you made in 2020 for Europe versus the rest of world or APAC on ULTOMIRIS? And also maybe, can you quantify any Russian biosimilar impact for ULTOMIRIS or SOLIRIS? And then maybe just a guidance question around you -- just on the R&D, can you maybe put some brackets around what those milestones are and maybe quantify some of that impact? Thank you.","Ludwig Hantson","Yes, maybe I start with Russia. As a matter of fact, you might know how the Russian market works, but -- out of the C5 business in Russia, should you expect any ULTOMIRIS business in Russia moving forward, the answer is not really.","Then on your second question on APAC fourth quarter, loading?","Aradhana Sarin","Yes. So the APAC fourth quarter that you see, it's really driven by Japan, and as we launched PNH ULTOMIRIS in Japan, there was very strong uptake. We have shared numbers with you in the past, and that was the loading dose benefit that I talked about for the PNH patients given the pricing and the volume difference. So that explains the APAC numbers.","Ludwig Hantson","And then we have a question on the milestones?","Aradhana Sarin","Yes, we've made public our various partnerships, both on Caelum and Affibody and Dicerna and so forth, and as those programs progress, there'll be milestones owed. I don't think we're breaking down how much is milestones versus not. And then also that $270 million increase, includes the impact of the Achillion transaction and you can estimate sort of how much that spend would be, given, we plan to progress both danicopan and 5228 forward this year.","Ludwig Hantson","Okay, we will take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Josh Schimmer","Thanks for taking the question. I might have missed it, but was there any other contributing factors for the strong performance of SOLIRIS in the U.S., given some of the growth drivers, but still a little bit above where I might have expected? And then for SOLIRIS in Japan, with new repricing rule, this label expansion, does the NMO indication addition -- is that going to change the price point for SOLIRIS? And if so, how? Thank you.","Brian Goff","Hi Josh, it's Brian. With SOLIRIS in the U.S., I think what you have are mostly a story around neurology, and we're really pleased with the growth that we've had with gMG, as well as the launch of NMOSD, which again began in July, and that has progressed very nicely. We also -- and this is more for SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS, which goes back to your earlier questions as well. In addition to all the conversion dynamics that we talk about, we continue to identify new naive patients with PNH as well as atypical HUS as well. And as we've indicated, we see that continuing in high-single digits and low double-digit growth pattern. So that's feeding it additionally.","Ludwig Hantson","Okay. We'll take the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kostas Biliouris","Hi, this is Kostas on for Matthew. I have a question based on your FcRn gMG study, which is now a Phase II in second half 2020. I'm wondering whether there has been any delay to the initiation of this study versus prior expectations? And a follow-up question, what do you need to advance this study to the Phase III? Thank you.","John Orloff","Yes, thank you. So we have two anti-FcRn programs. One is -- we have this Syntimmune acquisition, which is 1830, that's back in the clinic now. You may recall that last year, we had a CMC issue that we've addressed. We have now have new drug product that's been delivered. We initiated with a higher concentration formulation subcutaneously to healthy volunteers that began in December, and we are reinitiating the Phase II program with the IV formulation in hemolytic anemia this quarter, which was also paused for the same reason. So we will complete those dose ranging trials and then be in a position to launch pivotal programs later this year. And with regard to myasthenia gravis, we may need to do some additional dose ranging upfront there, that would be a seamless Phase II\/III type of trial. And then of course progressing further with hemolytic anemia.","So no additional delays in the program. We're pressing ahead.","Ludwig Hantson","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas of SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Ludwig, just quickly, on the 20,000 eligible target population for MG that you've noted. How are you thinking about that in terms of that impact to price and the ability to capture that, given the competitive landscape? And then along with that, you've talked about, you have a way to go still with converging already at 60%, with the 70% you had set out originally as a goal. How do we think about bottlenecks for conversion going forward? How quickly could that slow or just any color you could provide, so we could figure out how to model that correctly? Thank you.","John Orloff","Hi Robyn. Let me start with the first one on the the approximately 20,000 patient addressable opportunity for ULTOMIRIS in gMG. So the way that we see the gMG market evolving is, first of all as we've talked about many times, SOLIRIS continues to occupy a relatively, let's call it narrow segment of the larger gMG population. It's about 8.0000 patients, which are uncontrolled, more severe patients. And that really aligns with the regain pivotal Phase III study. We are not by the way, limited from a label perspective to stay in that 8,000 patients, but that has in the last two years, that has really been the sweet spot for SOLIRIS.","As we move into the opportunity with launch of ULTOMIRIS, based on the trial design that John and the team have put forward, we see that that space expanding such that the burden of previous IST cycles of therapy is not as high as it was for regain, and we see that opening up a larger segment for ULTOMIRIS.","Now, to your point about price, I mean, neurology is one aspect of price that we will continue to assess. But as we've said, we have eight indications that we've announced, that we're pursuing for ULTOMIRIS. And as those unfold, we have consistently said we maintain price flexibility to align the volume opportunity, with the value that ULTOMIRIS offers, and so we'll, we'll stay on that path.","Your second question was around the continued conversion dynamics. We still maintain the same ambition of 70% within two years of our launch markets. We are well on track with that. We've talked with a lot of pride about the three largest markets, we have worldwide, U.S., Germany, Japan. The only real bottlenecks that we see, and I wouldn't even call them bottlenecks, it's largely a function of time, is moving from so called centers of excellence of treatment with PNH, higher volume centers, as well as with the atypical HUS, to a broader customer segment, and that just takes time for us to continue to penetrate.","Ludwig Hantson","Can we take the next question, operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal of Citi. Your line is open.","Mohit Bansal","Great, thanks for taking my question. So just switching toward danicopan as well as 5528 strategy, the doctors seem to like the alternative pathway a lot, and 4471 is clearly not [pursuing] monotherapy. But could you please help us understand, what would you want to see with 5528, in terms of profile of the drug, which could potentially make it a viable monotherapy or potentially a frontline agent, ahead of C5? Thank you.","John Orloff","Sure. So first of all, we are committed to progressing the clinical development plans that Achillion has already communicated publicly in PNH with 4471, that's completed the Phase II data that we shared at ASH in December, and now planning to move forward with a Phase III study in PNH patients with extravascular hemolysis. At the same time, there is an ongoing Phase II study with 5228 which has better PK characteristics. It has got a longer half-life, the half life being about 12 hours, and also has better activity against the alternative pathway, with more than 90% inhibition of that pathway. So we're really excited about that compound, in order to give it less frequently, and it's greater potency that allows us to expand potentially into new opportunities beyond those with the EVA. So there is a Phase II program going on now, that is looking at it, not only on top of C5 inhibition, but also as monotherapy.","And then I would say, lastly that we're very excited about the opportunities beyond PNH in additional disease areas, that we haven't operated in, where the alternative pathway has been implicated, and where there are exciting opportunities to treat more patients with rare disease.","Mohit Bansal","Got it. Helpful.","Ludwig Hantson","We will take the last question.","Operator","And our last question comes from Kennen MacKay of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kennen MacKay","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on the progress throughout 2019 and into the New Year. Maybe a question for Brian, the PNH switch execution has been beyond phenomenal in in the U.S., can you maybe help us understand how we should be thinking about the pace of switching in AHUS versus PNH, given differences in presentation and disease morbidity?","Brian Goff","Yes. Hey Kennen. Beyond phenomenal, I wrote that one down, so thanks a lot.","Kennen MacKay","Put that in your review.","Brian Goff","The dynamics, as I noted earlier, the dynamics between atypical HUS in PNH are different. But of course, the profile of ULTOMIRIS is the same, and we get the same compelling feedback from patients, from physicians, and certainly from payers. And in fact as Aradhana had noted, the economics on an annual cost of therapy play out even more favorably for atypical HUS with ULTOMIRIS versus SOLIRIS. So I think what we're going to see are different dynamics in terms of inpatient, outpatient starts. But the same 70% ambition and just a couple of months in the launch, we are pleased with how we're tracking. So thanks for the question.","Ludwig Hantson","Okay, perfect. Operator, I'll take it from here. I have two topics that I want to close the the meeting with. The first topic is the state of our business. The second one is an update on IP.","With respect to our business, I believe we have a very healthy business. We talked about the fact that we have a healthy top-line growth moving forward. In -- driven by volume growth, this is not about price increases. We drive our business through to volume and innovation. We believe we have a healthy R&D pipeline and that's why we say we -- our ambition is to launch 10 products, new indications, new formulations by 2023, and that's the way it should be for a biotech organization. Then we have an operating margin that is very attractive within our industry. We are now around the mid 50s. We come from the lower 40s, and we believe that's a very healthy operating margin space to play in, so we really feel good about all of this, and this is reflected in our guidance.","The second topic, as I said is IP. So I have an update. And some of you might have seen that, the U.S. Patent Office has allowed a new patent for SOLIRIS, providing additional patent protection in the U.S. through 2027. And the new patent covers the methods of treating PNH with SOLIRIS, which is a method of used patents. Just to remind you, we also have an existing patent covering a method-of-use for HUS with SOLIRIS, which expires in 2032, and none of those two patents have been challenged. It's important that you guys know all the details of what's going on in the U.S. Patent Office.","With that, we'll close the call. Thank you for dialing in. I am really excited about the progress that we're making and hope you will enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes the conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"1577":["Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Altschuller, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Susan Altschuller","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the second quarter of 2019. Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer; John Orloff, our Global Head of R&D and Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial Officer. You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website.","Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today, and we undertake no duty to update any of the statements after the call, except as required by law.","I would also like to remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, our GAAP results.","Thank you. Ludwig.","Ludwig Hantson","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. We have made great progress so far this year further solidifying the durability of the base business in PNH and aHUS continuing to drive neurology and metabolics growth building out the pipeline for long-term value creation and continuing to deliver on our financials.","Slide 5 highlights some of our recent achievements. The U.S. launch of ULTOMIRIS with PNH is off to a strong start. And I'm pleased to report that as of the beginning of this week, we have facilitated conversion for 40% of PNH patients.","On July 2nd, we received approval of ULTOMIRIS of PNH in the EU and have already launched in Germany. We have remained consistent with our global sustainable pricing strategy and have a best-in-class conversion ambition of at least 70% of patients in the first two years from launch.","Our ULTOMIRIS atypical aHUS filing was accepted by the FDA and granted priority review with a target action date of October 19, ahead of our initial expectations. With the U.S. approval of SOLIRIS in NMOSD in late June, we took a major step forward in neurology. SOLIRIS is the first ever FDA approved therapy for NMOSD, a disease in which even one relapse can have a devastating consequences for patients.","We have already made good progress with the U.S. launch and are working on pre-launch plan in the EU and Japan where we hope to gain approvals by the end of the year. With the launch of NMOSD and growing contribution from gMG, we expect neurology to be our biggest franchise by patient volume in the U.S. by year-end.","In metabolics, STRENSIQ and KANUMA once again delivered double-digit year-over-year growth, with 1840 for Wilson disease. We have an opportunity to bring another transformative therapy to patients and our pivotal trial remains on-track to complete enrollment by early next year.","Our pipeline is progressing. Dosing is under way in the Phase III studies for ULTOMIRIS subcu and ULTOMIRIS in gMG. We are also preparing for multiple late stage clinical trial initiations over the coming year. Business development remains a core organizational focus, that we are working to add to the three deals completed in the first half of the year: Caelum, Affibody and Zealand Pharma.","Finally, we delivered very strong financial performance with 15% revenue growth and 28% non-GAAP EPS growth. And our updated 2019 guidance reflects the momentum of the business. All this positions as very well to deliver against our objectives in the remainder of the year. We also continue to look for opportunities to further build out our core therapeutic areas and expand into orders, aligns with our mission to bring transformative therapies to even more patients with rare diseases.","With that, I will turn the call over to Paul to discuss our second quarter financial results. Paul.","Paul Clancy","Thanks, Ludwig. Starting with Slide 7, we reported second quarter total revenues of $1.203 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. This was driven by gMG, continued growth in the core business and the ULTOMIRIS PNH conversion.","Our non-GAAP operating margin was 58% in the second quarter an expansion of 417 basis points, driven by top line leverage in lower than planned R&D expense. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.64, representing 28% growth year-over-year.","Moving to Slide 8. Second quarter net product sales were driven by volume growth of 23% offset by an FX headwind of 1% in a price headwind of 7%. The price headwind was largely a result of $32 million reduction to revenue for SOLIRIS in our Canada business in the second quarter.","This is related to our ongoing dispute with the Canadian Patented Medicine Prices Review Board or PMPRB related to several SOLIRIS pricing in Canada. In May of this year, the Federal Court of Canada dismissed our application for judicial review. While we are appealing the decision led to a reduction of revenue in the quarter, which includes the impact for the period from September 2017 to June 2019. We estimate that going forward, this will result in approximately a $5 million headwind per quarter.","Turning to Slide 9, SOLIRIS revenue in the second quarter was $981 million with year-over-year volume growth of 17%. Revenue growth in Rest of World markets was negatively impacted by the Canada judicial order in erosion in the Russia business. In the U.S., we benefited from order timing ahead of the July 4th holiday by approximately $8 million, which is consistent with prior year.","Turning to Slide 10. ULTOMIRIS revenue in the second quarter was $54 million. Recall is patients switch there is a 10% benefit in the first year due to the loading dose dynamic.","On Slide 11, we have included the C5 franchise of SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS combined where we saw 15% year-over-year growth across PNH, atypical HUS and gMG. Underlying volume growth in PNH and aHUS remains solid in the quarter and we expect high single-digit underlying volume growth for the year for those two indications.","Moving to Slide 12, STRENSIQ revenues for the second quarter were and $141 million representing 13% revenue growth in 21% volume growth year-over-year. KANUMA revenues in the second quarter were $26 million representing 22% revenue growth in 33% volume growth year-over-year.","Turning to the P&L on Slide 13. During the quarter, non-GAAP R&D expense was $149 million for 12% of revenues. Our non-GAAP R&D expense is much lower than we had planned. This is due to the phasing of late-stage program spend, which we expect to ramp up in 2020, and we have not seen significant R&D burn from the business development deals we have closed so far this year.","Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $256 million or 21% of revenues. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 13%, the GAAP tax rate was 8% both non-GAAP and GAAP taxes were driven by our ability to claim a foreign tax credit in the quarter.","We reported second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.64 growing 28% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per share was $2.04. We ended the second quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and marketable securities.","I will now turn to Slide 14, for our updated full-year financial guidance. We are guiding to total revenues between $4,750 million to $4,800 million, an increase from prior guidance. This represents 16% growth year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. For the combination of SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS our revenue guidance is $4,095 million to $4,130 million.","This assumes continued momentum in gMG incorporates our recent launch of NMOSD in the United States. And now includes the expected of FDA approval in U.S. launch of ULTOMIRIS for aHUS in the fourth quarter.","Turning to metabolics, our revenue guidance is $655 million to $670 million for both STRENSIQ and KANUMA. This includes the impact of a strategic pricing decision for STRENSIQ in the U.S. to support sustainability given weight based dosing. We estimate price will be a 3% headwind in 2019, higher than prior guidance driven primarily by the Canada pricing item.","Foreign exchange impact net of hedging is expected to represent a $40 million headwind. GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 42% and 43% inclusive of restructuring and related expenses as well as upfront payments.","Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 55% to 56% of revenue. Non-GAAP R&D expense is it projected to be 14% to 16% of revenues, lower than our original expectations for 2019. Phasing has shifted and we now expect much of the late-stage program spend to accelerate into 2020. We intend to further build the pipeline and anticipate R&D spend both in dollars and as a percentage of sales to increase going into next year.","Non-GAAP SG&A spend is expected to be 20% to 21% of revenues for full-year 2019. We expect non-GAAP effective tax rate similar to 2018. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $8.13 and $8.41 and non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $9.65 in $9.85. The midpoint of this range is approximately 23% growth year-over-year. We have delivered an excellent first half in well positioned to deliver on our 2019 financial goals.","I will now turn the call over to John to provide an update on R&D.","John Orloff","Thank you, Paul. I want to start by recognizing the significant accomplishments of the R&D organization in the first half of this year. SOLIRIS became the first FDA approved therapy for NMOSD marking a significant milestone in the treatment of this devastating rare disease. ULTOMIRIS was approved for PNH in both the EU and Japan and granted priority review for atypical HUS in the United States. We continue to advance our pipeline and our dosing patients in our pivotal ULTOMIRIS gMG trial as well as our once-weekly ULTOMIRIS subcutaneous trial.","We also added to our pipeline with three business development deals. We announced the collaboration with Caelum Biosciences for CAEL101 and AL Light Chain Amyloidosis; a collaboration with Affibody Biosciences for ABY-039 and novel Anti-FcRn asset; and a collaboration with Zealand Pharma for peptide therapeutics targeting complement.","On Slide 17, you can see the breadth of our development portfolio, which currently encompasses 15 development programs across our four blockbuster pillars. We expect clinical trial activity to ramp up toward the back half of 2019 and into 2020 as we initiate numerous late-stage development programs.","Turning to Slide 18, I would like to highlight some of the key late-stage programs, starting with our plans for ULTOMIRIS in hematology and nephrology, we are announcing today that we plan to initiate a Phase III study in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant-Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy or HSCT-TMA in 2020. This provides us the opportunity to potentially serve HSCT-TMA patients. We have very limited treatment options.","With our ULTOMIRIS once-weekly subcutaneous Phase III study, we believe we will be able to offer optionality for patients with PNH and atypical HUS. In neurology, our Phase III study of ULTOMIRIS and gMG is ongoing, with plans to pursue a weekly subcutaneous bridging strategy in parallel.","We are on-track to initiate a Phase III trial for ULTOMIRIS and NMOSD later this year. We plan to initiate a clinical trial in ALS, early next year pending regulatory feedback. This would likely be a Phase II\/III study with a goal to gain early proof-of-concept for the role of complement inhibition in the pathogenesis of ALS.","Moving to CAEL-101, in our collaboration with Caelum Biosciences. The plan to initiate a Phase II\/III study in early 2020 in patients with AL Light Chain Amyloidosis, a rare disease with rapid progression to organ failure and high mortality. Recall the Phase 1a\/1b program demonstrated early proof-of-concept with clinical benefit on cardiac and renal function and target engagement in vivo.","Turning to metabolics with ALXN1840 for Wilson Disease. We remain on-track to complete enrollment in our Phase III trial early 2020. 1840 has the potential to be highly differentiated from current therapies due to a 10,000-fold higher affinity for copper potentially improving liver function and neuropsychiatric symptoms and significant improvement in dosing.","Finally, ALXN1840 is our lead candidate in our emerging anti-FcRn portfolio. We remain on-track to manufacture sufficient supply for the 1830 clinical programs by year-end. In warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, we plan to start a Phase II\/III operationally seamless trial of 1830 in early 2020.","In gMG, given the evolving landscape, we have decided to focus our development of 1830 on a subcutaneous formulation and we will begin a trial in 2020 after generating subcutaneous data in healthy volunteers.","I'm incredibly proud of the progress made so far this year and we would like to thank the global R&D organization for their tireless efforts in advancing our pipeline and portfolio strategy. I look forward to providing future updates as our pipeline continues to build.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brian to discuss commercial highlights for the quarter. Brian.","Brian Goff","Thanks, John. I will start on Slide 20 with all the progress we have made with ULTOMIRIS. In the U.S., we continue to be very pleased with the launch in our efforts to facilitate patient conversion. As of the beginning of this week, 43% of PNH patients were enrolled in OneSource and 40% are on treatment with ULTOMIRIS.","So we remain on a very solid path toward achieving our goal of best-in-class patient conversion and now believe we can reach that goal of at least 70% even faster targeting mid-2020 in the United States. This is not only important for patients, but also reflects the strength of the ULTOMIRIS clinical profile.","Earlier this month, we received approval for ULTOMIRIS in Europe and have already begun treating patients in Germany, where we have a sustainable pricing strategy as is already established in the U.S.. Similar to the global price range for SOLIRIS our ambition is to maintain a relatively narrow price band globally for ULTOMIRIS. We aspire to facilitate a rapid best-in-class conversion in each launch geography.","In Japan, we received approval in June and while we are waiting for the National Health Insurance price listing in order to launch. We are actively engaged in efforts to improve physician awareness of ULTOMIRIS. We anticipate patients can begin conversion in September.","Turning to Slide 21, neurology represents a significant growth opportunity. As you see on the left, we ended the quarter with nearly 1,200 gMG patients treated with SOLIRIS in the U.S. and we are still less than two years into the launch. On the right, you can see the continuum of gMG disease severity. Building on our base of SOLIRIS, our goal is to expand treatment options for gMG patients with ULTOMIRIS ALXN1830. We believe a portfolio approach will help us to serve patients across the spectrum of disease.","Turning to Slide 22, we are excited to build upon our gMG success with the recent expansion of SOLIRIS into NMOSD. SOLIRIS is the first ever FDA approved therapy for NMOSD, a disease in which patients live in constant fear of the unpredictable and potentially devastating effects of another attack.","As you can see on the right, our Phase III trial demonstrated that SOLIRIS has a profound effect on reducing the risk of an NMOSD relapse. We have expanded our neurology field in medical teams this year, which positions us well for launch. There are strong synergies and overlap with gMG, but we are also targeting new call points such as MS centers of excellence.","With the right infrastructure in place and a sense of urgency to serve these patients, I'm pleased to report that we already have a number of open cases in OneSource as well as the first NMOSD patients now treated with SOLIRIS.","Moving to our metabolics franchise on Slide 23. We reported second quarter STRENSIQ revenue of $141 million with our CALIPER each adjusted initiative we aim to increase awareness and adoption of the appropriate diagnostic ranges for HPP, helping to support earlier diagnosis, particularly of pediatric patients.","KANUMA ended the quarter with revenue of $26 million with both LAL-D and HPP, we continue to identify new patients and plan to seek reimbursement agreements in additional geographies. This was a great and action packed second quarter, and I want to especially thank the commercial team for their hard work and dedication to bringing hope to patients suffering from our now expanded rare disease indications.","I will now turn the call back to Ludwig for closing comments. Ludwig.","Ludwig Hantson","Thank you, Brian. I'm very pleased with our 2019 progress so far. I look forward to further building on this momentum. As we strengthen our position in each of our four blockbuster pillars, we also continue to look for ways to further leverage our unique and established rare disease expertise.","Looking ahead, we have a strong foundation with our base business and exciting opportunities for growth, including our expanded neurology portfolio and numerous late-stage pipeline programs. We are committed to executing on our strategy with the aim to transform patient lives and create long-term shareholder value. As always, I would like to thank our global employees for their dedication to our mission and the patients we serve for their continued trust in us.","With that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Porges","Thank you very much and congratulations for all of you on the progress and particularly the approvals. I guess the big question, Ludwig, is the - that the share price. You are executing strongly both in the pipeline and commercially the trajectories are looking good for the new products and new indications. But yet the share price has been flat for three years. And that probably reflects people's concerns about pricing, patents and concentration of the portfolio.","So as you think about more options you might have with the company. Is there anything that you could contemplate that might potentially generate value for shareholders or else things you could do with the balance sheet? And assuming that there is not much you can say about that, could you just also update us on the EU patent appeal as well, which is part of the other hand?","Ludwig Hantson","Yeah, we have a lot of questions in there, Geoff. But, thanks. Thanks for that. So first of all, we are - we have a strong strategic plan and the team is doing an awesome job in executing the plan here in. When you look at our business model on where we were a couple of years ago, and where we are now, I think the team is really redefines what the fundamentals of this organization is.","And we are growing from old to new, and it's only like year-and-a-half ago that we have got the ULTOMIRIS data, which was strong. We are moving our business from of SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS business, with respect to some of your questions on concentration IP by similar.","As we execute or continue to execute on our conversion, those questions are going to become less relevant. Because biosimilars in IP is related to the SOLIRIS story, not related to the ULTOMIRIS story. And as we are building that conversion quarter-after-quarter, country-after-country, we are going to have a new portfolio that will raise different type of discussion.","So I'm really pleased with what we have done so far. We are not going to change our strategy. As I said, we believe we have a very strong strategy. We are looking at strengthening our portfolio through internal innovation and as you saw that we have 1720, which is internal assets of first one in the last two years going into CTA as well as we will continue to use our cash toward building our pipeline through external innovation.","So I think, my story is, we don't change this company overnight. The team has a very strong strategic plan, we are delivering on what we said, we were going to do. And every quarter we are getting stronger and stronger with our fundamentals.","With respect to your questions on IP, there is no new news on the EPO. In Europe, no new updates. So beginning of September we should know more about composition of matter and matter of use patents. But again, a come back to what I just said, that is our strategy, our chapter 2 for this company is to make ULTOMIRIS the standard of care for PNH and once approved the standard of care for aHUS. So the topic of IP and biosimilars will become less relevant for this organization.","So I hope that answers your question. I'm looking at my colleagues to see if further anything you want to add to that.","Paul Clancy","No. Well said.","Geoffrey Porges","Okay. Thanks, Ludwig.","Ludwig Hantson","Thanks, Geoff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Harrison","Great. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to focus on a couple of the R&D programs if I could, and just ask about especially timelines related FcRn, it looks like those studies are now starting a bit later than you had talked about last quarter and so. I was wondering if you could update us on the manufacturing issues that you had and if you have been able to work through those and then what some of the drivers have been around the pushing out at the timeline related to those? Thanks.","John Orloff","Thanks, Matt. This is John. Actually no change relative to what we communicated last quarter. We basically what we said and what we have identified is an impurity in the manufacturing process that we have addressed now. And we have run new drug substance runs that will deliver new drug product by the end of the year. So drug product will be delivered by December, which allows us to restart the program in January. So that is consistent with what we said.","We do plan to go back into hemolytic anemia with a Phase II\/III operations seamless design with the IV formulation. We are also pursuing a subcu formulation with higher concentration drug product that will also be delivered at the end of the fourth quarter for us to start dosing healthy volunteers.","And then, as I indicated in during my prepared comments, we are looking at Myasthenia Gravis as well with that subcu formulation recognizing evolving landscape in that space. And I will take the opportunity to say that we are committed to Myasthenia Gravis. We clearly have gone great product in severe patients with severe gMG with SOLIRIS.","We are conducting a trial now with ULTOMIRIS in Myasthenia Gravis that does not require the failure of an IST, so to move further upstream in the patient journey less severe patients. And then with our FcRn, we have few shots on goal here. We have ABY-039 is in Phase 1 dosing now as SAD and MAD, as well as our 1830 that will give us the opportunity to span the spectrum of all patients with Myasthenia Gravis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Chris Raymond","Hi. Thanks. Just another R&D question, I guess. Just one, really just. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what is going on with ALXN1810. I think last quarter you talked about completing a Phase 1 study. And I think you even had a slide talking about a potential launch in 2023. But as I read the description now looks like you are in the midst of strategic planning for that asset. So is this some driven by what you are seeing with ULTOMIRIS subcu or is there something else going on with 1810? Thanks.","Ludwig Hantson","So, as you know, for 1810 we have completed the healthy volunteer study that allowed us to increase the bioavailability from 60% for 1210 which is ULTOMIRIS to 73%, which gives us options to dose at every two weeks. We are looking at our options here given the fact that ULTOMIRIS now is rapidly expanding to now seven - new indications in total with PNH and atypical HUS, it's serving that patient popular - those patient populations very well.","In parallel, we have a subcu program that is enrolling now that will allow optionality for patients in our core business when that reach out in 2021, and it gets to market. And we have a bridging strategy to expand that once weekly subQ formulation to the other indications we are pursuing with ULTOMIRIS. So right now we have options in our portfolio with regard to C5 that include 1720 as well as 1810 we are exploring now the potential to go into alternative indications and go into new horizons.","Chris Raymond","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Martin Auster from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Martin Auster","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the continued strong operating results. I have a follow-up on the Canada pricing decision. I was just curious - so does the lowering of Canada prices where you had presents any near-term risks as it creates a lower price point that could then be used by as a competitor by other countries that are evaluating pricing or on SOLIRIS?","So just curious that would trigger potentially in near-term risks around other countries repricing SOLIRIS. And then secondly, I was wondering if you could articulate more precisely what the international pricing vendor on SOLIRIS is? And then for ULTOMIRIS, do you expect a similar pricing band or relatively tighter international band when you currently have with SOLIRIS? Thanks.","Paul Clancy","Alright, Martin. This is Paul. Thanks for the question. The Canada situation goes back to kind of 2017, as I had noted, it's been our legal disclosure since that time period. We believe it's pretty localized issue. It relates to what the core issue relates to - what is the appropriate comparison and it actually gets involved with foreign exchange rates and so on and so forth. We are appealing it, but for the time being, there will be a little bit of a headwind as we kind of march through the balance of the year. But we do believe it's local - it's a localized issue at this point, Brian?","Brian Goff","Yeah. And just on the second question about the SOLIRIS pricing band. We haven't quantified that, but I mean, qualitatively we have described it as a relatively narrow global pricing band. And I think that is really relative to what we know in terms of most other pharmaceutical products on the market who have a global footprint similar to ours. So the ambition that we have, and we have already taken big steps toward this with the launch of ULTOMIRIS in the U.S., and then most recently in Germany is with ULTOMIRIS.","We want to have maintained a similar pricing range. So in Germany, just to be specific about what that looks like, it is similar to the pricing in the U.S. And so in the maintenance fees, there is about a 10% discount of ULTOMIRIS versus SOLIRIS. The way, Germany looks at these patients is they have kind of more of a longer-term view they blend together years one and two.","And when you take that average there is essential parity with ULTOMIRIS versus SOLIRIS. And then when you get into maintenance and beyond. You capture the system savings of the discount and that is our ambition to have that pricing range globally.","Ludwig Hantson","Yeah, I'm going to add to this. The government published end of 2018 a international pricing review.com and SOLIRIS as part of this. So maybe that is a good reference document. But what it said is that our SOLIRIS price in the U.S. is not that much different from the price you are going to see Internationally. And maybe you have already seen this document.","Martin Auster","Thanks. That is very helpful color. Appreciate it.","Paul Clancy","Okay. You bet.","Ludwig Hantson","Take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your line is open.","Nate Tower","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Nate on for Paul. Maybe one question for Brian. So you have got almost 1,200 gMG patients on SOLIRIS. Well, I guess two: a, how is persistent and book so far. And then b, just longer term. What do you think taps the upside of SOLIRIS in gMG. Is this, I mean, by that, is this payers restricting use or do you think is going to be physicians being reticent to use that in a lesser refractory population? Thanks.","Paul Clancy","Sure. Well, we are really pleased with the progress that we are making. So we are nearly two years into launch and we have been very consistent reporting the numbers. So you guys can see exactly what we see and we continue to make progress with all the stakeholders, whether it's physicians, patients or payers.","Just to quantify where we are in the bigger picture in the U.S. gMG, refractory population, which really aligns with our regain pivotal Phase III study at the high end of that there were about 8,000 patients. And as you just noted, we have now achieved nearly 1,200, but that is still is a pretty small number in the bigger picture, which suggests there is plenty of opportunity to go.","I think most importantly, in terms of how we continue on that journey. It's really clear that SOLIRIS continues to deliver clinically, and we see that reflected by the steady growth as well as particularly at this stage in launch both breadth of prescribing as well as depth of prescribing and both of those components for all of our launches are important measures.","So what this does is this reinforces at the physician level, their advocacy to payers. So if the payer were to come back to a physician and require some form of documentation for continuity of therapy that reinforcing clinical delivery that SOLIRIS is offered has only strengthen the case.","And then I would add that, from a payer perspective to where we are with now both gMG and NMOSD is that we continue to reach out to payers proactively in the combination of that proactive communication as well as the steady growth creates one of the most important elements for payers and that is predictability as they set their budgets going forward. So we feel really good about the progress.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Phil Nadeau","Good morning, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress. Just a couple around the European patent situations. Our understanding is that the, on September 5th the Board will issue a ruling on the two patents on that day. Is that correct? And if it is correct, we will Alexion be in a position to announce what the ruling is on September 5th or you have to wait for some written correspondence.","And then second, broadly in the European situation if you don't successfully get those patents issued, the concern that we continue to hear is that biosimilars should they launch in Europe would not just compress the price of SOLIRIS, but would have some impact on the utilization and pricing of ULTOMIRIS and price sensitive countries? What do you think of that concern? Is there a chance that deeply discounted SOLIRIS biosimilar could impact utilization or pricing of ULTOMIRIS in European price sensitive countries? Thanks.","Ludwig Hantson","Yeah. So with respect to the EPO hearing, correct at September 5th, so no new updates there. And yes, it is about two patent applications which is composition of matter. And noted of U.S., this is a closed hearing and we think that is a written decision would come soon after. But we expect to know the outcome of the completion of the hearing, the outcome at the completion of the hearing.","So this will be on the same day. And with respect to what it means for the European situation, a couple of things. First of all, as you know, we have the formulation patent granted, and we have an appeal process ongoing. So that means that, that patent is going to stick with us after next three to five years, that is Number one.","Number two is, our strategy is to make ULTOMIRIS the standard of care for PNH. And as I said once approved those will standard of care for aHUS. And with the approval and the launch in Germany, we have - we feel we have a time enough to convert a business to second-generation, so which is ULTOMIRIS. The timelines for biosimilars to the best of our knowledge. We think best case scenarios is three years from now. And I think, we can do a lot of conversion and upgrade standard of care or redefine standard of care in the next three years.","Which respect to interchange ability of ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS, these are two different molecules in - I'm not aware of a market and a lot where biosimilars is moving into a branded product. So if you have market analogs in Europe, please send them over so that, I can learn, but I'm thinking of older biosimilar launches in Europe in the market dynamics in each of these countries. This will be two distinct molecules and two distinct pricing dynamics.","So I'm looking at Brian here.","Brian Goff","Yeah, I would just only add that, if you stick to that timeframe three years from now and the ambition that we have with ULTOMIRIS, facilitated patient conversion. It gets harder and harder to imagine that you have patients who have had repeated by monthly infusions in the experience that comes with that, that we have already seen play out in the U.S.","It's hard to imagine that those patients would then or the physicians would be motivated to take a step backwards to go back to biweekly therapy. So the more that we continue to deliver on that facilitated conversion, the better off our position is in the less relevant the prospect of a biosimilar becomes.","Ludwig Hantson","Yeah, I think every quarter we are in a much better situation now, since we have the approval. We starting with the conversion. We have good uptick in U.S. and we hope to do the same in Europe. Next being aHUS, there is a lot we can do in three years. And I do believe that we have the opportunity to really redefine standard of care for PNH and HUS and make the IP discussion and good point. So we will take next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kennen MacKay from RBC. Your line is open.","Kennen MacKay","Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for John Orloff. I was wondering if you could just help us understand the decision behind starting the trial in thrombotic microangiopathy HSCT-TMA. Isn't there already some off-label use of SOLIRIS here it is? The decision to run the trial here based on competitive dynamics with other complement inhibitors or just any color there would be hugely appreciated? And maybe a follow-up for Ludwig on strategy, which was brought up previously. I was wondering if there is any potential or thinking around issuing, perhaps a very small dividend. I know this is going to give me some looks from my biotech peers or premyopically focused on growth, but this really could broaden the shareholder base given some investors might be interested in the story, but they might be precluded from investing if there is on has a mandate for cash return. Thanks so much.","John Orloff","So I will start with first one. I think we are looking at this is a significant new opportunity in a severe and devastating disease that currently doesn't have really any treatment options. As you may know, HSCT-TMA was excluded from our atypical HUS program, even though many of these patients actually have underlying complement dysfunction. There are approximately 20,000 patients undergoing such transplants in the U.S. annually.","30% to 40% of those experience of TMA event, and about half of those are considered severe related to complement dysregulation and you alluded to SOLIRIS - actually published case series, Jodele and others that have shown a benefit of SOLIRIS in this population with the reductions in TMA and improvement in mortality, improvement in survival.","In fact, the mortality rate is over 80% at one year and in that paper, they had about 60% survival after a year. So it's a reason to believe that we understand the mechanism of action and there is an opportunity here to have a real big impact and yet another indication for ULTOMIRIS.","Paul Clancy","Hey, Kennen. This is Paul. I will grab the strategy or capital allocation question. It is - our priority is strategic deployment, so building the pipeline, I think we have been - we have tried to be very, very clear about that, that is our priority at this point in time. We are obviously working on the cash flow generation of the company, so that we could potentially broad note, kind of capital allocation and possibly in a few years return capital to shareholders. I think the way we think about it, particularly with the volatility in the sector is that, if we get to that point in time, share repurchases would be the preferred avenue for doing that. So at this point, dividends is not on the horizon.","Ludwig Hantson","Yeah. We still have work to do on the pipeline. So that is our main focus at this point. We will take next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Citi. Your line is open. Please check that your line is on mute.","Mohit Bansal","Sorry. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. Maybe one quick question on PNH conversion. Is it possible for you to characterize the early adopters or early switchers in that market? What I'm trying to understand, is it coming more from the bucket of optimal responders on one end of the spectrum or these are the previous who are responders on SOLIRIS? And then going forward, what challenges do you feel from the 40% number to move from 40% to 70% or even beyond that? Thank you.","Brian Goff","Yeah. Hi, Mohit. This is Brian. Thanks a lot. Good questions. I would say that from what we have seen so far in the conversions, there really isn't any one call it dominant patient phenotype for conversion.","One of the more prominent early factors seems to be, and this is often the case in rare disease launches. It's the frequency of patient visit. So if patient is seeing the clinician every month or every other month versus once every six months, obviously, there are more opportunities to have a discussion on conversion with their clinician.","We also think, and this is a very practical point that patients who live some distance away from their infusion center would be not surprisingly more motivated to switch. So overall, on your question of where do we go from the 40% to get to the 70%, it's going to be the same continued journey as education becomes more prominent across a wider part of the patient and clinician community.","Those patient visits will continue, we have made really good progress with the commercial payers. We are now over 75% of the covered lives have a defined policy in place and we don't really hear any resistance on any level from clinicians. It's more about moving through those timelines and the progress that we have made so far.","Ludwig Hantson","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Seedhouse from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Steven Seedhouse","Good morning. Thank you. What is the current U.S. insurance mix for patients on SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS. And can you at least say, is it appreciably different in gMG versus PNH versus aHUS. And if the new Senate financing Committee drug pricing reform plan were implemented as law as written? What do you assess the impact would be to Alexion? Thank you.","Ludwig Hantson","So I will start with your later, and just a couple of things. As you know, nothing is really concrete, so we will follow what is going to happen. But overall, we believe our potential exposure is limited. Let me go through a couple of topics here. First of all, Medicare is a relatively small part of our business, as you know, 60% of our global business this U.S. Medicare is about 20% of our U.S. business. And same true for our Medicare Part D business, which is a very small part of our total global business.","The second point I want to highlight is that our price increases - or price increases above CPI is not really our business model. We stayed away from that, and that is not how we drive our business. Our direct business is true innovation and an excess and volume.","Then with respect to our pricing strategy, as you know, we have a global sustainable pricing strategy, and Brian already addressed the pricing band that we are trying to respect, but we have a narrow pricing band internationally for SOLIRIS as well as for ULTOMIRIS moving forward. And maybe the last point I want to make is that, rebates is not really our business model, so we have, you could call it price transparency in our business model. So I hope that helps you to frame opposition.","Brian Goff","Maybe I will just add. This is Brian. So I think what we made the points, but it's about 20% Medicare in the U.S. and in the largest portion for us or the commercial payers. There is not really a material difference when you go across indications. But that is why in the case for example of the ULTOMIRIS PNH progress, it's especially important for us that we continue to navigate through the commercial live policy determinations. And each one of those engagements now with multiple launches under way, gives us a chance to give those payers predictability about the outlook ahead. So really commercial is the biggest part of the story.","Ludwig Hantson","Okay. We take two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Salveen Richter","Thanks for taking my questions. And just a follow-up on Phil's question. Can you frame for us your expectations into this EU IP oral hearing? And then secondly, when we look at the SOLIRIS launch in NMO, do you expect this to follow a similar cadence to the launch that we have seen for gMG in U.S. and Europe even though I do recognize more touch points here?","Ludwig Hantson","Yeah. With respect to the EPO, and Brian will do the second question. EPO there is not much more I can say. So we believe that we have a strong case here. As I said, we have the formulation patent but our overall strategy again is not about SOLIRIS. Our overall strategy is about build to me is making that the standard of care. It will moving quarter-from-quarter, we are moving. So we have note the approval. Germany is launching. We have other countries that will join Germany in the launch later this year. So we believe that we are in a pretty good spot here. With respect to your second question.","Brian Goff","Sure. And then with respect to NMOSD, we are excited about the launch opportunity. The fact that this is the first FDA approved treatment option for these patients who were really living in a world of fear given the unknowns in the devastating impacts of these attacks is meaningful, and it's very motivating for us. It is an important growth opportunity. And just to characterize it in gMG, we often cite the - at the high end of the refractory spectrum.","There were about 8,000 patients in the U.S. and that aligns with the Regain pivotal Phase III study criteria to dimensionalize it NMOSD in the U.S. is about 4, 000 to 5,000 patients. So a roughly half of the refractory gMG U.S. population. Hopefully that helps sort of frame-up the opportunity. I would say that we have gained a lot of neurology experience in the almost two years that we have been commercializing with gMG as we amortize that into NMOSD as well, but there are some different market dynamics with respect to NMOSD.","One is that, physicians have had nothing that is FDA approved to use, so that with their use of something for example like Rituxan, that is created a sense, we believe a false sense of stability from the tax. And so we are working through that educational aspects of every attack matters and really stable is a false sense of security.","And the second one is that we also know that there is potential near-term branded competition on the horizon. We could not be prouder of the very high bar that we have set with the SOLIRIS Prevent study, and none of the competitors on the horizon address complement a core part of the underlying pathophysiology of NMOSD. So those are a couple of dynamics. We don't expect a bolus. We do expect more of a linear uptake as we have seen with the rather neurology launch.","Ludwig Hantson","Okay. So we take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Justin Kim","Good morning. This is Justin Kim on for Hartaj. And thanks for the question. I just wanted to see if you could speak a little to how many of the total patients are on SOLIRIS, ULTOMIRIS in the context of the 5,000 patient goal by year-end?","Brian Goff","Yes, this is Brian, Justin. So, thanks for the question. We haven't broken down those numbers specifically. But I think we have given enough that you can walk around the numbers and get to the right landing spot. So our ambition is, as you noted to get to 5,000 patients or beyond by year-end. And what is important about that when again to reflect back on prior comments we have made is from the launch of SOLIRIS and PNH back in 2007, up until the middle part of 2017.","We had achieved about 2,500 patients on therapy and that is the base indications of PNH and atypical HUS. And in the roughly 2 years, 2.5 years, subsequent to that, we will have double that number. So that gives you a sense of the velocity of change in the meaningfulness of neurology in the business.","And then of course, inside of that, we are actively in the U.S. converting now the PNH patients over to ULTOMIRIS. We are thrilled about the early PDUFA date that we achieved for atypical HUS or excited to upon approval get going on that journey. And then SOLIRIS will continue near term on the neurology path. So hopefully that gives you enough color to dimensionalize the numbers.","Ludwig Hantson","Thanks, again, everybody. As I mentioned, I'm really pleased with what we have accomplished so far this year. And I'm really, really proud of the Alexion team. So to all of my colleagues, a big thank you and thanks to everyone for your time today. So, thanks so much.","Operator","Well ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

We will make forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.

A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release. Thank you.","David?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Elena. Q2 was a strong quarter for Alexion as we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones while also completing the Synageva acquisition to strengthen our position as the global leader in serving patients with devastating and rare diseases.","In Q2, we fired on all cylinders. First, our commercial organization delivered steady growth in both PNH and aHUS reflecting the strength of our core Soliris business. Second, we substantially advanced our next product Strensiq towards commercialization with our first approval in Japan as well as a positive CHMP opinion in Europe. Third, we continue to expand our complement franchise as we exceeded the target enrollment in our registration trial of eculizumab in refractory myasthenia gravis. Fourth, we delivered these milestones as we simultaneously announced and closed the Synageva acquisition and advanced Kanuma with a positive CHMP opinion in Europe. Fifth, we progressed the broadest pipeline in our history, driving toward as many as eight new product or indication approvals through 2018, starting with the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma later this year. And finally, we had another strong quarter of financial performance.","In Q2, product revenues were $636 million, an increase of 24% over Q2 2014, despite the continued weakness in ex-U.S. currencies. This revenue growth was driven by an increase in volume of 31% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses. We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $1.44 per diluted share as a result of strong performance in PNH and aHUS in the first half of 2015, and our expectations for continued strong Soliris volume growth, we are increasing our 2015 revenue guidance to the higher range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion, despite continued currency headwinds.","This guidance includes only a small initial contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma as we launch later this year. Consistent with our experience in ultra-rare disease, we expect the launch trajectory to be slow and steady. Vikas will provide updates on our full guidance, which now includes the acquisition of Synageva.","Taking a closer look at PNH in Q2, as in all prior quarters since 2007, we identified a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in our core markets of the U.S., Europe, and Japan, the territories where we have been operating the longest. As well as in other key markets, such as Turkey and Brazil. The ongoing success of our PNH diagnostic initiatives drives our steady growth as we continue to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. Our experience affirms our view that, on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.","In aHUS in Q2, the strength of the global launch was again reflected by a consistently high number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 15 quarters, from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. We now see this same trend in Europe three years post approval.","The ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that, over time, this trend of new patient additions will continue, and perhaps even widen. Importantly, we see the majority of our growth ahead of us and our global complement franchise, in both PNH and aHUS.","I would now like to turn to our metabolic franchise. During the quarter, we both announced and closed our acquisition of Synageva while continuing to execute strong growth in our core Soliris business. We also simultaneously delivered important regulatory milestones toward our upcoming global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma, which both will further diversify and accelerate our growth.","These two highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies address the underlying cause of HPP and LAL-D. First, in Japan, we received regulatory approval for Strensiq as a treatment for patients with HPP. The broad label includes patients of all ages and contains strong clinical data, including that the youngest HPP patients treated with Strensiq had an 84% overall survival. We are urgently working with the Japanese healthcare authorities to make this breakthrough therapy available to patients as quickly as possible.","Second in Europe, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Strensiq. The proposed indication will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment. Third, the CHMP also adopted a positive opinion for Kanuma. The proposed indication will include patients of all ages with LAL-D.","These positive recommendations reflect a strong clinical value proposition for Strensiq and Kanuma to treat the devastating nature of HPP and LAL-D. Final decisions from the European Commission are expected later this quarter, after which we will commence the reimbursement processes on a country-by-country basis. And finally, in the U.S., we continue to progress the regulatory processes with the FDA for both products, which are each undergoing priority review, and expect decisions later this year.","With these meaningful regulatory milestones, we are preparing for two product launches and plan to serve patients with HPP and LAL-D with a single metabolic field team across our 50-country operating platform. We are applying our proven disease awareness and diagnostic expertise from PNH and aHUS to HPP and LAL-D, including developing evidence-based diagnostic pathways to identify patients at higher likelihood of having the diseases, which will lead to more rapid and accurate diagnoses. We expect to serve initial patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan later this year.","Turning now to our growing portfolio of highly innovative product candidates. We continue to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. Including Strensiq against Kanuma, we now have eight product candidates in the clinic for 11 indications and expect at least four additional programs to enter the clinic in 2016.","In our late stage pipeline, we are pleased to announce that we have exceeded our enrollment target in the eculizumab registration trial in refractory MG and expect preliminary data in mid-2016. We are also working diligently to fully enroll two additional ongoing registration trials with eculizumab in patients with relapsing NMO and DGF.","In the quarter, we continue to progress our broad portfolio of seven highly innovative complement inhibitors, three of which are already in clinical development. Our lead next-generation Soliris molecule, ALXN 1210, is a longer acting anti-C5 antibody, suitable for monthly dosing. Importantly, I am pleased to announce that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a composition of matter patent for ALXN 1210 in effect until March 2035, extending our leadership and complement and strengthening our ability to serve patients for several more decades to come.","Martin will discuss our lead development programs in more detail later on the call.","To support our growing product portfolio we announced in Q2, our plan is to expand our manufacturing operations with the construction of a biologics manufacturing facility in Ireland. Along with our Rhode Island facility and other investments in our third-party suppliers, we are broadening our capabilities while expanding our capacity and increasing the redundancy of our global manufacturing network.","Looking at the second half of 2015 and beyond, we will continue to focus on what we know well and do well, developing and delivering transformative therapies for patients with devastating and rare diseases. With an unprecedented range of opportunities, we look forward to hosting an Analyst Day on December 10 in New York City.","At this point, for a closer look at our financial performance, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, David. In Q2, we achieved strong financial performance while increasing our investment in our long-term growth. Product revenues increased to $636 million in Q2 or 24% above the year-ago quarter. The strong revenue growth was driven by a 31% increase in volume, partially offset by a 7.6% or $39 million in currency headwinds in Q2 over the year-ago quarter.","The growth of our core business enabled us to increase our investments in our pipeline and in our commercial platform as we broaden our product portfolio. We achieved Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $1.44 per diluted share.","As a reminder, our Q2 financial results reflect the inclusion of the Synageva financial results for the last week of the quarter. In Q2, we have a non-GAAP income tax benefit of $1.6 million. This income tax benefit is primarily resulting from our ability to utilize operating losses from Synageva in 2015. For the first half of 2015, our non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 3%.","Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.5 billion in debt. In addition to paying off our debt obligation, we will continue to focus our capital allocation priorities on the following: investing in our product launches; advancing our robust pipeline; enhancing our manufacturing capabilities; evaluating additional opportunities that fit our strategic objectives; and utilizing our share repurchase authorization over time.","Based on our expectation for continued strong Soliris volume growth in PNH and aHUS, we are increasing our 2015 revenue guidance from the previous range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion now, to the higher range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion.","This guidance also includes only a small initial contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma as we launch later this year. Consistent with our experience in ultra-rare diseases, we expect the long trajectory to be slow and steady. We are increasing our revenue guidance despite currency headwinds.","Looking specifically at Q3, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $662 million to $665 million including a continued negative currency impact of approximately $43 million to $46 million as compared to Q3 2014. On a sequential basis, the Q3 revenue guidance includes a $4 million to $6 million negative currency impact over Q2.","The Q3 results will include a full quarter of costs related to the Synageva operations as we build towards our synergy goals and prepare for Kanuma launch. As a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.95 in Q3.","I would also highlight the following other elements of our 2015 guidance. We continue to expect cost of goods will be at the upper end of our guided range of 8% to 9%. We are revising our R&D guidance to $520 million to $540 million and we are revising our SG&A guidance to $690 million to $710 million. This new operating expense guidance is due to additional investment in an expanded pipeline from the acquisition and in the Kanuma launch.","In addition, for the second half of 2015, we expect to incur interest expense of $55 million. We also expect a fully diluted share count for the second half of 2015 to be approximately 232 million shares, resulting in a weighted average share count of approximately 219 million shares for the full year of 2015.","Importantly, we now expect our 2015 full year non-GAAP cash tax rate to be in the low range of 3% to 4% versus our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. This income tax benefit is primarily resulting from our ability to utilize operating losses and tax credits from Synageva in 2015.","Regarding our tax rate beyond 2015, we are in the process of executing our synergy reintegration plan. Early on, we identified that an important value driver of the Synageva acquisition was the ability to incorporate Synageva business into our structure resulting in a benefit to our tax rate. This will result in a reduction of 2% to our long-term non-GAAP tax rate in 2019 and beyond, from a previous guided range of 14% to 16% now to the low range of 12% to 14%. We expect our tax rate to gradually rise from 3% to 4% in 2015 to 12% to 14% in 2019 as we utilize our NOLs and tax credits.","In addition to our anticipated tax benefit from the Synageva acquisition, we continue to expect operating synergies across our global platform starting with $30 million for the second half of this year and increasing to at least $150 million in 2017. This will allow us to reach an operating margin of 48% to 49% and non-GAAP EPS accretion in 2018, just three years after the launch of Kanuma.","In summary, we have delivered a very strong quarter with 24% year-on-year increase in revenues and 29% year-over-year increase in EPS, while continuing to invest in growth and diversification of our business.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?","Martin MacKay - Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development","Thank you, Vikas. In the second quarter of 2015, our R&D teams made significant progress in advancing our pipeline as we drive toward achieving up to eight new product or indication approvals through 2018.","I will provide an update on our lead programs starting with our late-stage metabolic franchise. Our regulatory filings for Strensiq in the U.S. and Europe are on track. In the U.S., with breakthrough therapy designation, our rolling BLA is undergoing priority review and our application continues to progress with the FDA and we expect a decision later this year.","In Europe, we received the positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, in late June, recommending marketing authorization of Strensiq as a long-term enzyme replacement therapy for patients with pediatric onset hypophosphatasia, or HPP, to treat the bone manifestations of the disease.","Importantly, the proposed SmPC states that HPP is associated with multiple bone manifestations including rickets, osteomalacia, altered calcium and phosphate metabolism, impaired growth and mobility, respiratory compromise that may require ventilation, and vitamin B6-responsive seizures. The natural history of untreated infant hypophosphatasia patients suggest high mortality if ventilation is required.","The SmPC also indicates that 71% of infant patients treated with Strensiq, who required ventilation support, remain alive and continue on treatment. The CHMP opinion also notes that treatment with Strensiq improves skeletal structure as demonstrated by x-ray appearance of joints, and histological appearance of bone biopsy material, and by apparent catch-up height-gain. We are pleased that the proposed indication will allow any patient who had symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment. A final decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2015.","Turning to Japan, the rapid approval and strong label for Strensiq underscores the devastating nature of HPP and the life-transforming impact that Strensiq can provide to patients in Japan.","Moving to Kanuma, our late-stage enzyme replacement therapy being investigated for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency or LAL-D. This is a genetic progressive ultra-rare metabolic disease where patients, which include infants, children and adults, experience chronic lipid accumulation causing multi-organ damage and premature death. Kanuma is a recombinant form of the human LAL enzyme designed to address the underlying cause of LAL-D.","The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for Kanuma for LAL-D presenting in infants and accepted the BLA for priority review. Our application continues to progress with the FDA, and we expect a decision for Kanuma later this quarter.","In Europe, the CHMP issued a positive opinion for Kanuma in late June, recommending marketing authorization for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients of all ages with LAL-D. As a reminder, LAL-D is fatal in infants, with a median survival of 3.7 months. In children and adults with LAL-D, about half will have fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, or death within three years of diagnosis. As noted in the CHMP opinion, the benefits of Kanuma are its ability to replace activity of the missing enzyme, resulting in improvements in key liver and lipid endpoints including, importantly, a reduction in liver fat content. In addition, there was a 67% survival benefit in instance with LAL-D beyond 12 months.","A final decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2015. And we look forward to bringing Kanuma to patients with LAL-D in Europe as quickly as possible. In Japan, a new drug application for Kanuma was submitted in Q2, and we expect a decision from the MHLW in the first half of 2016.","Turning to our three ongoing registration trials with eculizumab, we have exceeded the target enrollment in the REGAIN study, our registration trial in refractory myasthenia gravis, or MG. The trial was designed to enroll patients who, despite receiving best support of care, continue to experience a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including severe and generalized weakness in muscles of the head, spinal cord, and respiratory system causing blurred vision, slurred speech, weakness of the arms and legs, and difficulty breathing. We expect to have preliminary data in mid-2016.","Also in neurology, we are on track to complete enrollment in the PREVENT study, our registration trial in relapsing neuromyelitis optica, or NMO, in 2016. And, in kidney transplant, we are on track to complete enrollment in the PROTECT study, our registration trial in delayed graft function, or DGF, in 2015.","As a global leader in complement biology, we continue to focus our innovative approaches to best serve patients with devastating complement-mediated diseases. Our portfolio of complement inhibitors includes seven molecules across diverse platforms, with three of these molecules already in clinical development.","ALXN 1210 is a longer-acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing and is our lead next-generation Soliris molecule. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a composition of matter patent for ALXN 1210 that is in effect until March 2035. As noted in the patent, the ALXN 1210 is administered intravenously and completely suppressed hemolysis in a Phase I healthy volunteer study.","The multiple ascending dose study of ALXN 1210 is ongoing, and we expect to initiate a Phase II PNH trial by the end of this year. In addition, we are developing ALXN 1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a. We expect interim data from our Phase II study in patients with Graft-versus-Host Disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening auto-immune disease, later this year.","Turning to our metabolic portfolio, SBC-103 is an enzyme replacement therapy for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB or MPS IIIB, which is a devastating and progressive rare metabolic disease. In Q2, enrollment was completed in the Phase I\/II trial of SBC-103, and interim data are expected in the second half of 2015.","Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy, we are also pleased to have completed our planned enrollment in the bridging study in patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency, or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We plan to initiate a pivotal study with our cPMP replacement therapy by the end of 2015.","Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on expanding our preclinical pipeline. We now have more than 30 diverse programs across a range of therapeutic modalities, and we expect four of these programs to enter the clinic next year.","These include: Asfotase alfa, a potential treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPI may play a role; SBC-105, an enzyme replacement therapy being developed for generalized arterial calcification of infancy, or GACI, and other rare disorders of calcification; one of the mRNA rare disease programs from our collaboration with Moderna; and an additional candidate will move into the clinic from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio.","We are excited to be advancing the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech as we drive toward as many as eight new product or indication approvals through 2018, starting with the global approvals of Strensiq and Kanuma this year, and including at least one of our next-generation Soliris molecule by 2018.","I will now turn the call back to David. David?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Martin. We are very pleased with our performance in Q2. Looking at the second half of 2015, we will continue to serve more patients with PNH and aHUS around the world, while simultaneously launching Strensiq and Kanuma. We will also remain focused on advancing our R&D program so that more patients will have access to the transformative therapies they so desperately need. As always, we thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as we work to transform the lives of patients around the world.","Now let's open the line for questions. Eric?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now turn to the question-and-answer portion of our call. We'll take our first question from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Thomas Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. Congrats on the progress. And thanks to Elena and the team for the earnings slides, they're very helpful. Maybe next time you could even add some numbers to your Y axes.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're asking too much, Eric.","Eric Thomas Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, David. Just maybe on the pipeline side for Martin and the team. I think you mentioned that 1210 was IV, perhaps, you mentioned that for the first time, with a patent now out there on that molecule, was there anything special beyond the once-monthly longer duration that comes with that molecule and could you formulate that as a sub-Q in the future?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, Eric, I'd let you know that as it relates to 1210 and the other six highly innovative complement inhibitors that we have in development, three in clinical, four in preclinical. Our objective as we've stated before is not to just have one complement inhibitor enter the market behind Soliris but for multiple inhibitors. And the objective is to provide options to physicians and patients. And offering them a variety of different modes of administration that may suit their needs best. So as it relates to 1210 and the other complement inhibitors, we would expect to be offering that optionality in the future. Martin?","Martin MacKay - Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development","Just I think you articulated really well, David. And as well as other treatment options, Eric, because we now have seven, and as David alluded to, three in the clinic and four in pre-clinical. We're obviously looking at other targets also and the ones in the clinic, 1210, you mentioned, clearly 1007 against two devastating diseases and 5500 all in the clinic with the other four coming up and pre-clinical with the expectation that one of those four will also enter the clinic in 2016.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And I mean, directly, obviously, the patent is there, Eric. And we would \u2013 you would actually find that there is that potential for that optionality that was related to your question.","Eric Thomas Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","The sub-Q optionality?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Eric Thomas Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks very much for taking the question and I appreciate some of the increased specificity on the call and in the disclosure. David, I have to nudge you a little bit. As far as we know, Alexion's missed consensus expectations for earnings twice in its history and that's been the last two quarters. Is it...","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks very much for the compliment, Geoff.","Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And I just \u2013 could you give us some sense about that and were there surprises here in terms of reprocessing (33:13) the quarter? Obviously, you had to absorb the acquisition, but nevertheless, it was only late in the quarter. So, how should we get comfortable with the expense outlook going forward? And then just related to that a little bit, Strensiq still seems to have a fairly vague approval timeline. I think we originally expected it in Q2, then the middle of the year. Now, we're heading into August and it's second half of the year. Could you give us some color about what's going on and some confidence that, that approval really is imminent? Thanks.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Geoff. And again, I appreciate the complements on the EPS side. So, I would just remind you, last quarter, we specifically had one issue with the cancelled manufacturing campaign which we alluded to. That was the one item that was highlighted, obviously, in the release and on the call. Other than that, continuing to operate with the financial discipline in which we've been operating with as company for many, many years.","As it relates to this quarter, I'll have Vikas address it in a moment and also provide you the longer-term outlook on expenses. As it relates to Strensiq, you're absolutely right. I mean, we felt like coming into this year, rolling BLA, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, that there'd be, perhaps, even more benefits and expedited review as it's related to the U.S. approval.","We indicated last quarter we now saw that timeline really moving to a second-half story for approval. But we also saw in the quarter the positive opinion in Europe from CHMP and, of course, the very rapid approval in Japan by PMDA. And there really is nothing other than the fact that I think an important outcome is what you see in Europe and Japan and what's expected with breakthrough therapy designation now in the U.S. which is infantile- and juvenile-onset HPP, which is very important, as the opportunity to serve patients with HPP that had symptoms of disease before the age of 18. That's what we saw in Europe. That's what we would \u2013 that's what we're obviously focused on in our discussions with regulators in the U.S., as well as that's what the breakthrough therapy designation is for.","So we feel that the labels, thus far, are reflective of both the devastating nature of HPP for all patients who have pediatric onset disease, as well as the transformative benefits that Strensiq can provide to those patients including the youngest patients who are exposed to an extremely high mortality rate at one and three years, and Martin and I, I think, shared the survival numbers with you for those patients who are exposed to Strensiq.","So, no real surprises there. We're lining our U.S. team up to be ready to launch both Kanuma and Strensiq later this year. Vikas, expenses?","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So, Geoff, if you look at Q2, there's enormous number of objectives that we executed upon, right? If you look at what David mentioned earlier, we fired in all cylinders. And when you start looking at those multiple things that we did, we backed out for the non-GAAP several expenses that are related to restructuring and the deal closing.","But as I mentioned, if you look at Q2 even carefully, even without the tax impact, you will find that if Synageva acquisition wasn't there, we would have really done still very well on the EPS side. We had a deal of \u2013 last, last week of Q2 at around $5 million, $6 million of expenses from them. There was a lot of work that was done during Q2 on analyzing projects and acquisition to which all gets into that, right? When we look forward from here, that's where I think you need to focus on is we're increasing our expense guidance by approximately $140 million. Now on a standalone basis, that would have been approximately $170 million of spending in second half. So, we have taken off already $30 million as of the date, right, for the second half.","Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Now when you look at the longer picture, so when we analyze $140 million for the full year, it's around $280 million. And for us to get \u2013 achieve our targeted $150 million savings that we have promised for 2017. From $280 million we have to get down to $190 million levels, right? And what that does is, if you really focus on the operating margins, we are currently around 43%. And if we can get through the synergy line, we will back up to 48% to 49% by 2018.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And we would just see that at the $130 million levels, Geoff, and at the same time, continue, as Vikas indicated, on really funding two launches and a broader set of programs across R&D than we've had before.","Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I appreciate that color. I'm sure other people are asking about it. I'll jump in the queue though for follow up.","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. But Geoff, before we finish, on top of that, we're not counting the tax synergies and the cost improvement that we will be delivering over these two, three years. That's yet to come because we have a lot of work to do there.","Geoffrey Craig Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. Thanks, Vikas.","Operator","Our next question will be from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just quick one for Martin related to SBC-103 and Sanfilippo. Just wondering if you could help us benchmark sort of the declines in heparan sulfate that you're expecting, particularly as it relates to CSF. Thanks.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Martin?","Martin MacKay - Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development","Thank you, Anupam. I won't predict what we will see in this study, but suffice it to say, we did complete enrollment in the Phase I\/II study with all the patients enrolled. And as you know, MPS IIIB really is caused by this marked decrease in NAGLU and the enzyme activity, which leads to abnormal buildup of heparan sulfate in the brain.","What we will be able to measure from this first study is in the serum, in urine and in the brain, which will give us a much better idea of what we're seeing in this study with SBC-103. There are other measures that we'll be looking at. But clearly these, over the dose range, have been given (40:29) those patients will be a very helpful data to start to look at future studies.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Anupam.","Operator","Our next question will be from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a couple of short ones. First one for Vikas, the FX impact has really, obviously, hit the P&L the past six months. Has this changed your view about hedging strategies going forward? I'm thinking about this with an eye to 2016.","And then the second question is on reimbursement. You guys will be on parallel tracks in Europe, which is really unusual, and does that give you an opportunity to talk differently about cost benefit on a country-by-country basis as you try to navigate reimbursement for both Strensiq and Kanuma? Thanks.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Vikas?","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So on the FX impact, we normally try to \u2013 on the major currencies, we try to take 50%, half of it hedged. And the rationale for our hedging strategy has been that we also spend a lot in those local currencies, right? So when you look at the net exposure down in the EPS level, we get it down to like 20%, 25% of the overall sales that really gets exposed to our EPS line. So we would like to continue the same philosophy going forward. Because what happens in this is we saw a very dramatic move this year.","We were able to mitigate half of it this year. And so when you move from 2015 to 2016, the impact needs to reduce significantly. The view of taking a very high FX hedge early on \u2013 well, you can get that and you can predict the year. But when you go to the following couple of years, the dramatic drop just shifts from one year to another.","In the long run, what happens with FX is whatever is the rate is going to be the long term rate. So it's a mitigating factor of how slowly you take that impact. And so we would have taken a substantial impact this year. So going into 2016, the impact \u2013 if the rate continues to stay where it is and it continues to deteriorate further from here, the impact will be not as high as we saw in 2015. So best to take it at a time when the rates have dramatically dropped than to go back two years later and remind people that the rates have dropped two years back. That's the view I have.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then regarding the question about concurrent reimbursement processes for both Strensiq and Kanuma really starts with where we are today, which is actively being involved with regulators as we finalize the labels that reflect both the devastating nature and severity of the disease for the patients who suffer from HPP and LAL-D, as well as the broad range of transformative clinical benefits that patients can expect, that's where it starts. And then, that moves through, obviously, the process of approval, the submission of dossiers to funding authorities on a country-by-country basis, which reflect the labels, which reflect the nature of the disease and then also the expected clinical benefit that patients can see.","So we think to be able to actually work with both of the programs at the very same time, from regulators through funding authorities, that that really does position us quite well to execute on what we know well and do well, and what we've demonstrated with both PNH since 2007 and aHUS since 2011, which is, when positioning the extreme rarity of the disease, the devastating nature of the disease, and the transformative benefits of the treatment, we have been able to produce very good success in enabling access for patients.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Congrats on the progress. I'm a little confused by this talk about missing earnings on the quarter, because I'm showing that you beat consensus by $0.06 on EPS. But the question is on the increase to revenue guidance. I think last quarter, you mentioned that there's a small contribution from Strensiq in this year's guidance. And now you've increased it a tad bit here, you're saying on Soliris strength. So should we assume that the small contribution from Strensiq has not changed? And further, should we assume that there's nothing in there for Kanuma post the close of the acquisition?","And then just a second quick one for Vikas on the long-term tax guidance. We've seen several sort of favorable adjustments to the long-term tax guidance over time. And I just want to get a sense, if you can talk a little bit further about the basis for it this time. It sounds like maybe it's the way GEVA fits into your business model, just wonder if you could elaborate on that a little bit. Thanks very much.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So, I'll take the front half and then Vikas will step in. And I \u2013 you're absolutely right regarding EPS and the beat versus consensus. So, thank you for that. I think, subsequently, related to the guidance, and I just want to address it. When we established our revenue guidance back in January, remember, as I've already discussed with Geoff, we were anticipating a first-half-of-the-year launch for Strensiq in the U.S. and Europe. And obviously, we're awaiting for that to happen later on this year.","So yes, the initial guidance did include a small initial contribution from Strensiq. But knowing the kinetics of an ultra-rare disease launch, and the fact that it takes a period of time to really build up the patients on treatment, just that nudge back, obviously, means that contribution, even for Strensiq and Kanuma combined, is now expected to be lower than it otherwise would have been if Strensiq had launched in the first half of the year.","And what you see today is, we more than make up for that with a very strong ongoing growth of Soliris in PNH and aHUS. And of course, we are eagerly anticipating the all-out approvals in the U.S. and Europe to begin to reach patients later this year. But, by the time they're coming in, you're serving initial patients for a shorter period of time, and we would expect largely the meaningful revenue contributions to really start in 2016. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Matt. So your question on the tax rate, there's two aspects to that, right? So one is looking at the ongoing long-term rate, and that we look at going down from 14% to 16%, to 12% to 14%. We looked at the business combination very closely, and Synageva had already started, the team had already started, a lot of work on IT side and we're trying to complete that as we go forward. So that drives down the couple of percentage drop on an overall basis of the company, right? So, that's step one.","The step two is then, you look at what are the NOLs and tax credits that we inherit from the acquisition. Now, that has limitations to absorb that in a particular year. We start absorbing that from 2015, that's why you see the rate go down from 7% to 8% that we were expecting this year to 3%, 4%. And then we will continue to utilize these NOLs and tax credits over 2016, 2017 and maybe a little bit will be left by 2018. So 2019 onwards, we will start seeing a more stabilized long term rate implementation. Does that help?","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","It does. Thanks very much for taking the questions.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Our next question is from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and also thanks for the slides, which are very helpful. So I have two questions though, R&D maybe for Martin. Number one is, you just mentioned in the script that you guys saw complete inhibition of hemolysis in the Phase I for ALXN 1210. I was wondering if you can give us a little bit comparison of the data compared to your competitors' data (49:12) C5, that was presented at EHA last month. And then secondly, can you talk a little bit more about whether the Synageva acquisition, in terms of what that platform can do for your pipeline, in terms of the technology and also, maybe the way they can enable the drug delivery into the brain? (49:33) Thanks.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thanks, Ying. And Vikas and I are disappointed because you normally have a five-part question that includes all of the speakers. But, nonetheless, Martin?","Martin MacKay - Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development","Thank you very much. I'll take them in the order that you asked them, Ying. And rather than do a comparison, which we could go through quite a lot date (49:53) and take some time, suffice it to say that we know, from years now of clinical data with eculizumab, what type of hemolysis inhibition that you need to reach to have the profound effects in PNH patients, and we see \u2013 and it's essentially 100% hemolysis that you need to see. We see this with eculizumab in our clinical studies. We are now seeing this with our lead follow-on program in 1210, the longer-acting C5 antibody. And it's our profound belief that this is a level of hemolysis that you need to see to confer the benefits on PNH patients that we do witness.","In terms of the second part of your question, it's enormously exciting for an R&D organization to be able to look at the assets that we have now. And I mentioned on the call, we have over 30 programs in pre-clinical development that we're progressing. I'd say we're doing that in a highly prioritized fashion. We're very observant in terms of costs, so that these don't escalate and not really means choosing the very best programs that we can to prosecute.","And as also said in the call, the fact that we intend that four of these will enter the clinic in 2016 is really a testament to being able to progress the best program. In terms of the platform, it's early days. Our scientists are very excited about looking at this platform, testing it both with the programs that were ongoing but also in some of our own programs to really see the utility of this. I hope that helps, Ying.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very much so. And David, since I don't want to disappoint you, do you mind telling us whether you are thinking about BD (51:40) acquisition again. Now that you complete the Synageva?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Ying. So as we've said over and over and it's really been sort of our track record, we're a company that really focuses on what we know well and do well. And that is characterizing and understanding devastating and rare diseases and identifying potential product candidates, molecules that can have a transformative impact really independent of therapeutic area or modality.","And I just \u2013 Saqib, you may want to just highlight for Ying just how we continue to kind of explore and look for opportunities that fit that filter.","Saqib Islam - Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy & Portfolio Officer","Sure. Ying, as you know, on an ongoing basis, we are evaluating these type of opportunities. Again, within the filter of transformative therapies for devastating diseases. And we do this at all stages of research and development. In addition to the Synageva acquisition, earlier this year, we talked about three early stage pipeline transactions, some of which support or complement portfolio and others that do not.","As Vikas highlighted in his script, we do have the capacity and the interest to continue to being focused on opportunities for us at all stages of research and development.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ying.","Operator","And we will go next to Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for the question. Maybe just one clarification and one question. So, the FX impact on the bottom line for the year, I didn't notice if you guys had updated that. And then for SBC-103, just wondering what percent reductions you saw in heparan sulfate in preclinical models and if the ongoing trial's open label and if you guys had access to that data during the due diligence. Thanks.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Vikas, then Martin.","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, on the FX impact, on the bottom line, Terence, in the first half, we saw around $70 million of FX impact year-over-year. And second half, we're expecting somewhere around $85 million to $90 million. That's what takes us to $160 guidance that we had given early in the year. Martin?","Martin MacKay - Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development","Thank you. Just briefly, and Terence, we're not going to disclose what we saw on diligence. And the really important data from the study that's just completed will be coming out later this year and we'll certainly share those data with you at that time.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think, Terence, just from a general perspective, on diligence, what we saw as we understood what the sort of rationale was to think that you could some heparan sulfate response in the CSF, but also importantly, very interested to see the change in baseline in urine and serum as well. So again, it's early days, but we look forward, as we said in the second half of this year, to getting a good look in the first trial that we fully enrolled in the first half of the year in these patients.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks. And then just, Vikas, I was asking about the bottom-line impact. I think you guys said $0.35 earlier this year. So I was just wondering if you've updated that number specifically. Thanks.","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Terence, it will be very similar because there'll be plus\/minuses between the tax rates and among the currency impact. And we'll land a bit to (55:27) similar $0.35.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Evan Seigerman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. This is Evan on for Robyn. Thank you for taking my question. First, I want to touch on HPP in adults. On the last quarter call, you had mentioned that you're finalizing a protocol for a clinical study in adults. When will you get more insight into that and is that still on track to commence later this year? And then in regards to 1007, what should we expect in regard to the interim data for GI-GVHD and when can we also (56:02) for APS? Thank you so much.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Evan. Martin, you want to cover that up?","Martin MacKay - Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development","Yeah. I'll take the three questions in the order. Evan, in terms of HPP adult, we still intend on initiating that study in adults before the end of this year, so that is ongoing. In terms of 1007 for GI-GVHD, of course, we'll be looking at the primary end point. It's an open-label study, as I think you know, and we'll be looking at the overall acute GVHD response at day 28. And again, we expect to see the interim data by the end of this year.","In terms of APS, again, you will know that the studies about the safety incidents and severity of (56:49) through 36 weeks and we'll be looking at that data in 2016. Hope that answers your three questions.","Evan Seigerman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It does. Thank you very much.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Evan.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Raymond with Raymond James.","Chris J. Raymond - Raymond James","Hey. Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on the next generation C5 efforts. Sort of intrigued by your comments regarding the optionality for a sub-Q delivery for 1210, I'm looking at what I think is that granted patent. But a few months back, we stumbled across an application that describes something that looks a little different, it's a high titer C5 preparation without aggregation. Can you just confirm, is that separate? Should we expect that some of these pre-clinical programs, that you have a dual track here for a potential sub-Q dose?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So thanks very much. That's right, it is separate. And we really believe that with building a very strong portfolio of multiple complement inhibitors with the objective of multiple complement inhibitors to be developed and approved and follow-on behind Soliris is the best way to serve patients with a variety of complement-mediated diseases, obviously today marks another important milestone for us. So beyond PNH and aHUS, we announced the important milestone of exceeding target enrollment in the MG registration trial for eculizumab. And so as we indicated really at the beginning of this year, we look forward to updating you on an ongoing basis on the progress across our entire complement inhibitor portfolio.","Chris J. Raymond - Raymond James","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we have time for two more questions. And we'll go next to Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just have two short ones. So first on MG, can you just remind us, to the extent you've talked about what your expected event rate there is and how confident you feel around the timing of that data? And then separately for the cost, can you just talk a little bit about share count and buyback, how you're thinking about that, how aggressive you might be with that and how quickly you might be able to bring the share count down? Thanks.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So why don't I just start and then Martin and Vikas. But, first, I think I heard you say event rate, and I just wanted to clarify that event rate is the endpoint in the NMO registration trial. What we are looking at in myasthenia gravis is a change in MG-ADL from baseline and at 26 weeks. That's the endpoint. But Martin can share a little bit more with you.","Martin MacKay - Executive Vice President, Global Head of Research & Development","Well, just to add, David, you've hit the nail on the head in terms of the study. And I think, Matthew, it's a randomized double-blind placebo control, as both David and I alluded to, we were very pleased to say that we've exceeded the enrollment in that trial. And the last piece of your question on this topic was how confident are we in terms of getting data for the trial? And we're very confident that by midyear 2016, we'll be able to look at preliminary data.","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And as we had alluded in my script, basically, we have a capital allocation plan as I had mentioned, first and foremost, this particular debt obligation. And then, after that, we're going to be continuing to invest in our product launches, look at our pipeline and invest there. Look at enhancing our manufacturing capabilities and then look at strategic objectives where we can find more opportunities to build our portfolio and then comes the share repurchase plan, right? And we will look at it very opportunistically as we go forward.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question?","Operator","And our last question is from Ian Somaiya with Nomura.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. It's Matthew (1:01:25) on for Ian. Just coming back to \u2013 I have two sort of related questions as it relates to the earlier stage pipeline. I was hoping you might be able to provide a little bit more color around something \u2013 I think Martin said earlier which has to do with the way that you're prioritizing the whole host of molecules you've got in the earlier stages of the development. And then specifically, if you could share your expectations on when we might be able to get additional visibility into ALXN 5500, as well as the third candidate \u2013 the third preclinical candidate that's also in development. Thank you.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No. Thanks, Ian. As we've indicated, and Martin can jump in here as well, with seven assets in total \u2013 in addition by the way of eculizumab continuing to progress with these three ongoing registration trials that we'll be providing updates in time. ALXN 1210, as Martin and I indicated, is our lead next-generation molecule. 5500 and 1007 are indeed two other complement inhibitors in clinical development. And very importantly, we see the fourth one coming in next year, as Martin alluded to.","And I think across all of them where our objective is for multiple approvals, multiple new molecules to come in after Soliris. We do expect a first approval to be in 2018 for a next generation molecule. So we'll continue to provide you updates over time. And as I alluded to the Analyst Day on December 10, we'll be providing a presentation on our complement portfolio. Thanks.","Operator","That was our last question and this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"1610":["Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Irving Adler, Executive Director, Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Irving Adler","Thank you, Kim. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the second quarter of 2013 and our outlook for the second half of the year. Today's call will be led by Dr. Leonard Bell, our Chief Executive Officer. Lenny will be joined by members of Alexion management: Vikas Sinha, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; David Hallal, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Martin MacKay, Executive Vice President and Global Head of R&D; Steve Squinto, Executive Vice President and Chief Global Operations Officer; and Saqib Islam, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K reports on file with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements apply only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after this call.","I'd also like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP operating results are adjusted from our U.S. GAAP operating results for certain items that we described in our press release issued this morning. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release. Thank you. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Irving. In the second quarter of 2013, the Alexion global team continued the strong commercial progress and the increasing R&D momentum that we achieved during Q1. In each key initiative, we are further accelerating our tightly focused mission to develop and deliver life-transforming therapies for patients with severe and life-threatening disorders that are also ultra-rare.","Looking first in our commercial operations of PNH, Q2 was the 24th consecutive quarter in which Soliris therapy was commenced in a significant number of new patients with this life-threatening disorder. This continued growth was again observed across our core territories: United States, Western Europe and Japan; and increasingly, in Turkey, as well as in Brazil, Russia and other new territories.","Turning to our aHUS launch. We continue to be pleased with the addition of new patients in United States during the quarter. In Europe, we are particularly pleased to note significant progress in England. The government's Clinical Priorities Advisory Group, or CPAG, has very recently decided to recommend a new broad and formal clinical access policy that would be highly favorable to patients. Upon implementation, this policy would provide broad access for Soliris for aHUS patients through the anticipated NICE decision in 2014. This is a very important and positive step forward for patients in England.","Overall, we continue to be pleased with our launch of Soliris and aHUS, and our observations in Q2 reaffirm our view that our opportunity to serve aHUS patients is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and perhaps larger.","Turning to R&D. Q2 was another noteworthy quarter across the breadth of our development pipeline. To begin, I would point out that the excellent clinical efficacy and strong safety profile of Soliris, demonstrated over the course of thousands of patient years of treatment, continue to establish an astounding clinical benchmark for delivering life-transforming outcomes to patients with life-threatening and ultra-rare disorders. Further confirming this benchmark, in June, the New England Journal of Medicine published the strongly positive data from our registration trials of Soliris in patients with aHUS, thus, helping to further broaden the understanding of this product, life-threatening disorder and the life-transforming clinical benefits of Soliris for these patients. In addition, in July, regulators in both United States and Europe granted orphan drug status for Soliris for NMO. Following approval, this would provide us with 7 years of additional post-marketing exclusivity in United States and 10 additional years in Europe for this new indication, joining our already significant patent portfolio and other orphan drug designations, protecting Soliris in key markets worldwide.","I would also note that we are pleased to have completed dosing during the quarter in our deceased-donor kidney transplant program. And we anticipate that this will lead to the presentation of topline preliminary results in the fall.","Finally, and very importantly, with regard to the life cycle management of Soliris, well through to the end of the 2020s, we are increasingly focused on a rapid advancement of 2 or more next-generation modules into the clinic during 2014. Our broader research commitment to develop life-transforming therapies was also recognized during the quarter when we received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for asfotase alfa, which provides further impetus to our BLA submissions in 2014. Importantly, the designation will provide us with enhanced interactions with the FDA, which will help us to strengthen our filing and regulatory strategies for this larger-than-anticipated patient population now defined by age of onset.","As we substantially expand our global development capabilities, we are preparing to initiate a series of expected commercial launches with new indications for Soliris as well as with our new product candidates. Looking forward over the next several years and depending, of course, on trial and regulatory outcomes, we anticipate a series of additional potential, major product approvals between 2014 and 2018, starting with our second product, asfotase alfa, in late 2014; and then followed by Soliris in the deceased- and living-donor kidney transplant settings; Soliris in delayed-graft function; Soliris in one or more neurology indications; our third product, cPMP, for infants with MoCD Type A; and we are now specked to launch one or more of our next-generation of follow-on products to Soliris, within the very same 2014 to 2018 period.","I'd like now to turn to a broad update on our manufacturing and supply chain operations, in which we had 4 significant, positive developments in the second quarter. First, third-party independent experts completed their GAAP analyses with regard to our manufacturing and quality operations in Rhode Island. Based on these analyses, we are already implementing additional improvements in our manufacturing and quality operations and expect an FDA reinspection of Rhode Island in the first half of 2014. Second, and also with regard to manufacturing in Rhode Island and following inspections earlier this year in 2013, I am pleased to note that the European Medicines Agency notified us during the second quarter of its GMP Certification of our Rhode Island facility for the ongoing manufacture of Soliris.","Turning to other Soliris manufacturing locations, I am also pleased to note that during Q2 and ahead of our expectations, the EMA also notified us of its positive opinion for the manufacture of Soliris in the Singapore facility, now permitting release of Soliris from a third manufacturing location.","And finally, we have started to establish a global supply chain and quality facility in Ireland, which we anticipate will provide us with significant opportunities to serve a growing number of patients within the European Union and beyond in the years ahead.","Turning briefly to our financial performance. Our Q2 results reflect a 35% growth in revenues and 56% growth in non-GAAP net income year-on-year. This continued strong performance has enabled us to increase our 2013 guidance for both revenues and net income for the second time this year. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our second quarter financial performance and our expectations for the remainder of 2013. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Lenny. As we reported in this morning's press release, Q2 2013 was another period of strong financial performance by Alexion. During the quarter, we again achieved steady growth in revenues and profits from our PNH and aHUS operations and cash flow was, again, robust. I'd like to highlight a few points regarding our performance in Q2 and then look ahead to some key considerations for the second half of 2013.","Soliris sales in Q2 were at $370.1 million, a 35% increase compared to the year-ago quarter. In aHUS, we are gratified by the steady uptake of Soliris in the U.S. and by our reimbursement progress in Western Europe during the second quarter. We expect continued contributions from Western Europe in the second half of the year, and note that the impact from anticipated initial launches is already included in our increased 2013 guidance.","As we executed strongly on patient-centered initiatives in Q2, we continued to control both SG&A and R&D expenses. Strong topline performance, combined with control of other key financial parameters, resulted in a 56% in non-GAAP net income to $147 million or $0.73 per share in the second quarter.","Looking at our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end grew by approximately $100 million to $1.1 billion. This reflects continued positive cash flow from our business during the quarter offset by our share repurchase program.","Turning to our guidance. We are now raising our 2013 revenue guidance from the previous range of $1,505,000,000 to $1,520,000,000, now to the higher and narrower range of $1,520,000,000 to $1,530,000,000.","You will also notice in this morning's press release that we have made offsetting adjustments in the SG&A and R&D lines of our 2013 guidance for operating expense. R&D is now expected to be 18% of sales, reduced from 19% in our earlier guidance and SG&A is now expected to remain stable at 29% of sales. With revenues expected at a higher level and expenses essentially unchanged, we are increasing our 2013 guidance of a non-GAAP EPS from the previous range of $2.87 to $2.97, now to the higher and narrower range of $2.97 to $3.02.","Other adjustments to guidance are detailed in this morning's release. Looking at a few points released to -- related to our guidance, I'll note that with regard to sequential quarter growth, increased infusion days in Q2 compared to Q1 resulted in approximately $5 million to $6 million in sales growth in Q2 that would not be anticipated in Q3. As in the past, we expect that SG&A in Q4 will reflect the impact of the major medical conferences in which we participate. We also expect R&D expenses will increase in the remaining quarters of this year as we continue to execute on 10 development programs. We are pleased with our progress in the second quarter of the year and our plans for the future. I look forward to providing further updates of our performance as the year progresses.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to David. David?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Vikas. In the second quarter of 2013, global revenues from our Soliris operations increased by a robust 35% compared to the same period last year. As we continue to grow our PNH operations by achieving deeper penetration in the nearly 50 countries in which we serve patients, we are also serving an increasing number of patients with aHUS in the U.S. and Western Europe.","During Q2, looking first to PNH, in our core territories of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan, our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives continued to result in a steady rate of identification of new patients with PNH. These initiatives continued to enable us to serve an increasing number of patients with PNH and, as in prior quarters, the majority of PNH patients newly starting on Soliris during Q2 were also newly diagnosed.","Beyond our core territories, we continued to expand our PNH operations in additional major countries. As anticipated, in Turkey, Brazil and Russia, in Q2, we observed a steady rate of new patient identification and Soliris treatment initiations indicating further expected consistent growth over time. We also now expect to add patients in Korea in the second half of 2013 as the next major country in our global PNH rollout.","In addition, we see a significant opportunity to serve patients with PNH in multiple countries in Latin America, with a potential for growth in Argentina and Colombia later in 2013 and continuing further in 2014.","Turning now to aHUS. In Q2, we again observed that our efforts resulted in the steady increase in the number of new patients with aHUS in the U.S., commencing Soliris therapy. We continue to observe that the majority of patients, who are newly starting on Soliris treatment, were newly diagnosed, as they presented urgently with life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy or TMA.","As we extend our aHUS initiatives to reach more hematologists and nephrologists, we are confident that we can improve our ability to serve more patients by focusing on 4 drivers to further optimize patient care. First, an increasing number of patients with life-threatening TMA will be tested for aHUS. Second, a shorter turnaround time for ADAMTS13 test will provide physicians and patients with critical diagnostic results more rapidly. Third, once diagnosed with aHUS, a higher proportion of patients will be rapidly started on Soliris treatment. And finally, over time, physicians will more fully appreciate the genetic and lifelong nature of aHUS and the optimal outcomes achieved with chronic Soliris treatment.","Our efforts in aHUS are aided by the growing body of peer-reviewed clinical evidence regarding the disease and the clinical benefits of Soliris treatment. These include, most recently, the New England Journal of Medicine publication in early June of the life-transforming results from our pivotal multi-center, multinational registration trials in aHUS. This publication is now a major new resource for our field teams in educating physicians worldwide.","Turning to our aHUS operations in Western Europe, as we begin to serve initial patients, our teams are planning for their individual country launches. And as expected, we made significant progress with the reimbursement processes in key countries during the quarter. Starting with England, during Q2, the government commenced its first program to fund Soliris treatment for patients with aHUS. And we observed that an initial and growing group of patients accessed therapy. Now in July, and following this initial program, we were pleased to recently learn that the government's Clinical Priorities Advisory Group, or CPAG, has decided to recommend a new broader and formal clinical access policy that includes all aHUS patients who have functioning kidneys as well as patients on dialysis who are transplantable.","Upon implementation, this policy would provide broad access to Soliris for children and adults with aHUS in England through the NICE review next year. This is an important and positive step forward for patients in England. In Germany, following the Q1 accomplishment of reimbursement for aHUS in all settings, both outpatient and inpatient in Q2, we have now started to see an increasing number of aHUS patients diagnosed and treated by hospital-based nephrologists and hematologists.","In France, we are continuing reimbursement discussions with the government following the very high ASMR II rating that Soliris received for aHUS. We expect that this strong recognition of the clinical benefits of Soliris will support broad access to therapy in France and we expect these discussions to progress through the year.","In Italy, during Q2, the government continued to provide Soliris through an early access program as we advanced through the reimbursement process to cover all patients with aHUS year. In Spain, selected initial aHUS patients are starting to receive access to Soliris locally. We have made meaningful progress in the national government reimbursement process and we anticipate finalizing the process in the fall. And finally, in Belgium, funding for all patients with aHUS commenced on July 1.","Beyond the significant progress in Q2 across Europe, I note that we have started serving initial aHUS patients in Turkey this quarter. In Japan, and based on our recent regulatory filing with the PMDA, our in-country commercial team is now laying the foundation for our anticipated aHUS launch. We continue to be pleased with our launch of Soliris for aHUS, and our observations in Q2 reaffirm our view that our opportunity to serve aHUS patients is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH, and perhaps larger.","Beyond our current Soliris indication in PNH and aHUS, we are growing our commercial operations to support more indications and products. Looking forward, over the next several years, we anticipate a potential series of additional major approvals between 2014 and 2018, starting with our second product, asfotase alfa, in late 2014 and then followed by Soliris in the deceased- and living-donor kidney transparent settings; Soliris in delayed-graft function; Soliris in one or more neurology indications; our third product, cPMP for infants with MoCD Type A; and we expect to launch one or more of our next-generation follow-on products to Soliris within the same 2014 to 2018 period. In closing, we look forward to serving more patients with PNH and ASUS in more countries in 2013 and to serving patients with additional severe and life-threatening ultra-rare disorders in the years ahead. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our development programs. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Thanks, David. It has been a very exciting first 2 months for me since I joined the Alexion team. I am gratified to be working in an environment where we are truly transforming the lives of individual patients who would otherwise be at high risk of severe disability or premature death from an ultra-rare disorder. I am especially compelled by the tremendous potential of the pipeline. For the next few minutes, I want to provide both a brief update on key milestones in our development programs, and also a wider view of how we are building the momentum of our global R&D organization to support an expanding yet highly focused portfolio of clinical initiatives.","To begin, I would like to discuss the progress of our development programs with eculizumab, starting with kidney transplant. I am pleased to announce that during the quarter, we completed dosing in our multinational deceased donor trial in patients at elevated risk of antibody-mediated rejection, or AMR. Initial topline data from the study are expected to be presented at the European Society for Organ Transplantation congress this September. As we have noted, our deceased-donor study will also evaluate delayed-graft function, or DGF, as a key prospective secondary endpoint. We expect to discuss this DGF data with regulators as well as data from a separate investigator-initiated trial in DGF in the second half of 2013 in order to accelerate an Alexion-sponsored multinational DGF registration program. Enrollment in our company-sponsored multinational living-donor transplant trial in patients at elevated risk of AMR is ongoing, and we expect to continue enrollment through 2013.","In neurology, as we have discussed, we are now preparing to conduct single registration trials with Soliris in both relapsing neuromyelitis optica, or NMO, as well as in severe refractory myasthenia gravis, or MG. We are pleased by the recent publication in the Lancet of the positive data from the investigator study in NMO. We continue to make preparations towards commencing both studies in the second half of 2013, and I can now report that we have finalized the NMO protocol and are nearing completion of the MG protocol.","Turning to STEC-HUS. We are continuing to obtain and analyze additional and longer-term controlled clinical outcome data from an epidemiologic study in approximately 400 STEC-HUS patients, who received only best supportive care. We expect the key investigators on this study to commence their review of the data this fall.","Finally, with regard to the life cycle management of Soliris well through the 2020s, we are increasingly focused on the rapid advancement of 2 or more next-generation molecules into the clinic during 2014.","I will now turn to our lead development programs with our second highly innovative therapeutic candidate, asfotase alfa. The FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation we received for asfotase alfa in May is an important element in the late stages of our development program. In addition, and importantly, the designation is aligned with the medical community's view of HPP as a disorder in which the age of onset is a critical clinical consideration, more so than the current age of the patient. The designation specifically covered the perinatal onset, infantile onset and juvenile onset forms of the disease. Through the designation, we expect more frequent interactions with the FDA. These interactions, for example, will help us to strengthen our filing and regulatory strategies for this larger-than-anticipated patient population.","Following the completion of enrollment, we are now analyzing the data in our natural history study of HPP in infants, with the goal of including this in our filing for marketing authorization. We remain on track for a filing for asfotase alfa in HPP in the U.S. and Europe mid-2014.","In addition, enrollment is ongoing in our clinical trial for asfotase alfa in Japan, and we expect to complete dosing in 2014. Beyond asfotase alfa, we are evaluating 3 additional highly innovative therapeutic candidates as treatment for patients with severe and life-threatening disorders that are also ultra-rare.","In our metabolic disease area, we continue to accelerate the development of our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A, a severe ultra-rare and genetic metabolic disorder that is fatal in newborns. I am pleased to report that we have now commenced dosing with our synthetic cPMP and a study in healthy volunteers this month. Additionally, we are continuing with a retrospective data collection from the small number of individual newborns with MoCD, who have been treated with the earlier form of the cPMP replacement therapy.","Finally, we plan to initiate a natural history study in patients with MoCD Type A this quarter. Also, after completing dosing in our single-dose Phase I clinical study of ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, I am pleased to report that we have now commenced a multi-dose Phase I clinical study in healthy volunteers, and we plan to discuss the initiation of a multi-dose Phase II proof-of-concept study in patients with regulators before year-end.","Following these discussions, we expect to explore parallel development of ALXN1007 in multiple severe life-threatening and ultra-rare conditions. And finally, enrollment continues in a Phase I study of ALXN1102 or ALXN1103, our novel alternative pathway complement inhibitor. We are continuing to enroll and dose patients in these Phase I studies and expect to meet with regulators to discuss trial data and the development program following completion of patient treatment.","As we look at the number of development milestones we have reached in the first half of the year and those we expect in the second half, it is evident that we are achieving a growing momentum across our R&D operations. Our priorities, as we accelerate, are clear as we strive to move forward rapidly and simultaneously on a greater number of R&D programs than we have in the past.","There are 6 key elements to this momentum, as we build our global R&D organization. First, we are committed to significantly expanding our R&D leadership. As part of this initiative, we are especially pleased to now welcome Dr. Steve Ryder as Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer. Steve joins us with extensive biologics and small molecule experience from Astellas Pharma, where he was President, Global Development. We have recently recruited a number of additional highly talented and experienced physicians and scientists as we continue to build our leadership cadre.","Second, we are focused on maximizing the life cycle management of Soliris well through the 2020s. This includes our ongoing work on 2 or more next-generation follow-ons to Soliris, which we will begin to discuss in more detail as they get closer to entering the clinic in 2014.","Third, we are accelerating the development of our late-stage portfolio. This includes asfotase alfa, the 5 transplant and neurology programs with Soliris that I discussed earlier, as well as our cPMP program and multiple indications for ALXN1007.","Fourth, as a company, we are significantly increasing our pursuit of business development opportunities, being within our tight focus of potentially transformative therapeutic candidates for severe and life-threatening disorders. Our recent collaborations with Ensemble, which seeks to leverage its highly innovative approach to the use of small molecule compounds to modulate protein-protein interactions, holds promising potential with regard to a number of such disease targets.","Our fifth area of focus, which is tied to both our internal development and our business development strategy, is translational medicine. We are intent on further shortening the timely date to conduct proof-of-concept studies and arrive at critical go-no-go decisions on promising preclinical candidates.","And sixth, building on our successes to date, our research programs will now further seek to genetically map select groups of severe and life-threatening, ultra-rare disorders. I look forward to updating you on all of these initiatives on future calls. I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thank you, Martin. In the first half of 2013, we accomplished a significant number of important commercial and clinical milestones while continuing to build our global organization to serve more patients worldwide. As always, we thank all of you who make our work possible, including employees, researchers, physicians, investors and especially patients and their families. Working together, we can expect to reach many additional milestones in the second half of the year. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move on to Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Co.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Lenny, maybe I'll ask about manufacturing. It sounds like the EMA actually inspected Rhode Island recently. Is that the case? And that you passed inspection from that party? And maybe Vikas, could you just talk about the financial implications of the Singapore approval happening a little bit earlier, when we might see products shipped from Singapore and what we might see in terms of P&L impact when that happens?","Leonard Bell","Steve, do you want to describe that current -- Rhode Island?","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes. Let me just walk you through the timing of going all the way back to the FDA inspection and walking all the way through the new EMA GMP compliance letter. So the FDA inspected the Rhode Island facility back in August of 2012. As you know, we did receive a 483 which then turned into a warning letter of the FDA issued in March of 2013. Actually, EMEA came in January of 2013, about 3 months up ahead of the warning letter. And after the 483 was received, of course, we started to make pretty significant improvements in the manufacturing facility, both from a facility's point of view and as well as a quality operation's point of view as well. So the EMEA came in January of '13 and then found the manufacturing quality improvements to be acceptable. The facility then received a GMP compliant letter in May of 2013.","Vikas Sinha","Eric, on the financial front, as you know, we have currently -- we are currently producing inventory and stock. And so as we finish the SKUs, then only we will be using the Singapore-produced products. So I don't see much of an impact this year, but next year will be a transition year and then we should start seeing impact on '15 or so.","Operator","Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One on asfotase alfa, you guys are filing in pediatrics, but would you expect reimbursement or labeling to be restricted at all by age? I know, Lenny, you mentioned, segmentation of the market by age at this point now. And then a follow-up on STEC-HUS, are you guys still on track for a year-end filing. Obviously, the filing has lost momentum, but I wasn't sure if it was coming from KOLs or regulators telling you to hold back or if there's some sort of data trigger that you're aiming to hit?","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Jeff. As Martin and I just said on the call, in regarding asfotase alfa and hypophosphatasia, it's a pretty important observation that the breakthrough therapy designation is not based upon the age of the patient to be treated, but the age of onset of disease. And so, of course, just from a logic perspective, individuals who have age of onset as infants or as juveniles or perinatal, obviously may very well be anywhere from newborns to adult patients as long as they had onset before the age of 18. And that's really when it's -- as I was saying and Martin described, potentially it might be a much larger-than-anticipated population based upon age of onset. Is that understandable?","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, it's helpful.","Leonard Bell","Okay. And Martin, do you want to...","Martin MacKay","Sure. Thanks, Lenny, and thanks for the question, Geoff. In terms of STEC-HUS, as we continue to obtain and really analyze the longer-term control data, we expect the key investigators on the study to really commence their review of this data in the fall. Up to this point, I would say the greatest challenge has really been to identify those patients who would truly benefit most from being treated with Soliris and STEC-HUS.","Operator","Our next question today is from Salveen Richter from Canaccord.","Andrew Peters - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Andrew on the line for Salveen. Maybe a question for Vikas. Curious of the increase in guidance, if it's due to kind of you coming on board quicker than you expected or what the drivers are. And then maybe related to that, I was wondering what the timeframe for the CPAG implication -- implementation is and how that's going read through to the NICE.","Vikas Sinha","David, why don't you comment on the launch in the second half and aHUS continuing until next year.","David L. Hallal","Sure, so it's a -- as Vikas had indicated, the guidance that was provided this morning on the call takes into account what our expectations are in Europe for aHUS in the second half of the year. We've been pointing to this point in time as a real key point for us in Western Europe, I think you've heard the progress there throughout the call. As it relates to CPAG, I think there's an important point which was, during Q2, even prior to the CPAG recommendation, we started to see an initial and growing group of patients in England with aHUS access treatment. So our team there locally is educating physicians, we're identifying patients and we're seeing patients gain access to funding. As it relates to CPAG, just technically speaking, just like AGNSS, they have made a recommendation for a broader group of patients, for a formal clinical access policy for all patients with aHUS with functioning kidneys as well as any patients on dialysis who are transplantable. But that recommendation still needs to be adopted and ratified, and the patients are expecting that to happen very, very soon.","Operator","Moving on, our next question is from Ying Huang from Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have a couple of questions. Number one is, obviously, there's some media reports that you guys could be takeout or a target for M&A transaction here. I was wondering, strategically speaking, how do you think an orphan franchise like what you have here fits into a large pharma portfolio here. And then secondly, in terms of the aHUS launch in U.S., you guys were trying to refocus the sales force of patients outside of the hospital setting. So I was wondering what kind of progress you guys have made since that?","Leonard Bell","Thank you for that single question, Ying. And as we've said in the past, we don't comment on any rumors. And as we've been talking about, probably extensively in the monologue part of the call so far, although I think we may have more opportunities in the rest of the hour, I'm sure. Alexion is currently operating from an unprecedented position in our history. From all perspectives, as I look around, R&D, commercial operations, manufacturing and, really, overall senior management, we believe that we're seeing the results in our quarterly performance. And as importantly, we are also poised to take advantage of the breadth and accelerating number of significant opportunities that we see in front of us. As we look down this road, we see, first and foremost, continued strong growth in Soliris in each of its 10 -- to each of its 2 currently approved indications. We see also see 5 highly innovative compounds across-the-board now being investigated in 10 additional severe and ultra-rare indications, which we expect to result in a continuous series of anticipated major product approvals from 2014 through 2018. With execution of a strategy now taking the current and future Soliris franchises, as we described earlier in the call, through to 2030 and beyond, together with the benefits of a stronger and wider global manufacturing and supply platform here in the United States, increasing in Singapore and, as we noted just moments ago, now in Ireland, with an expanding experienced senior leadership team and an equally strong balance sheet with another quarter of strong financial performance. As I look back, just over past 4 years, we moved from a company with a single product approved in a single disorder then to a second indication and now, closing in on a robust and continuous series of new products and indications, major launches over the next 4 years. As we look ahead, we're tremendously excited. What was your second question?","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","About the progression on aHUS launch in the U.S. outside of the hospital setting.","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes. Thanks, Ying. So as I've indicated, we expanded our team ahead of the aHUS launch in the U.S. and we dedicated that single expanded sales force to support both our PNH and aHUS initiatives. And that sales team is -- field team is focused on hematologists, pediatric nephrologists as well as adult nephrologists. We are and have been experiencing success in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. As I mentioned, many patient are presenting with life-threatening TMA where those patients are in a situation where they are being identified, diagnosed and treated at the hospital setting. But at the same time, there are patients with longer-term disease who have more severe longer-term impact to their kidneys that are identified in the outpatient setting, where physicians are looking at the totality of the information now has been reported at medical congresses that those patients with longer-term disease can see long-term benefits to Soliris treatment with improved kidney function. So we are having success really in both settings with our field team in identifying and starting new patients on treatment.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Rachel McMinn from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I missed part of the call, so I apologized if this has been asked. Your x US aHUS -- or your comment about aHUS being a larger market opportunity, did somebody asked that already?","David L. Hallal","No.","Leonard Bell","This would be the time.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, so I apologize. I missed the entire Q&A portion so far. So I don't want to repeat -- ask like 15 questions. So your comment about this being...","Leonard Bell","Start with part A.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So part A. Is that -- I mean, when you say it could be as big or bigger in the past, you've referenced the initial uptake in the U.S. Are you referencing that again? Has anything changed there for you? Or are you seeing things, just x US, that gives you more confidence? I also wanted to ask you about asfotase alfa. I think, Lenny, you mentioned there was a potentially larger population there, and I wanted to clarify those comments. And finally, just your enthusiasm for next-generation Soliris launching within 2018, if you're just putting something in the clinic next year, what gives you confidence in that timeframe for a launch?","Leonard Bell","Yes, something x US, [ph] right?","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Something, yes.","Stephen P. Squinto","Yes. So Rachel, as you know, we now have 7 quarters behind us in the U.S. And Q2 sort of reaffirms that view, as we see on a quarterly basis, the new patients that are presenting with life-threatening TMA, recognizing that we're not capturing all of them right now. But when we see those that we are helping to receive a rapid diagnosis and initiate treatment, that is giving us confidence in the size of the opportunity. But as you state, we're now starting to see that in countries outside of the U.S. And as I alluded to on the call, for example, now in Germany, with the Q1 achievement of full reimbursement in the inpatient and outpatient setting, we were pleased with our observations in Q2. And we're seeing some initial positive indications in the U.K. as we saw our initial patients start on treatment in England in Q2. So it is indeed reaffirming that observation outside of the U.S.","Leonard Bell","And Rachel, as regards the second part, part B of question 1. In terms of asfotase alfa, what I think was noteworthy earlier on the quarter -- or to me, during the second quarter, was that the Breakthrough Therapy designation was very specific on the basis of age of onset of patients and not the age of the patients of when they get treated. And specifically in regard to patients at perinatal, infantile or juvenile onset of disease, which actually is, as you've kind of appreciate, I'm sure, means that the patients who are treated can be any age, over 18 or below 18, as long as they hit onset of disease prior to age 18. And that then would be a significantly greater population than one might have anticipated if it were just to be strictly those who are under age 18. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Thanks, Lenny, and thank you for the question, Rachel. On the follow-on, there's just a couple of points. It's clearly really important to us to maximize the life cycle of Soliris being such a terrific molecule. And well into the next decade, that's what we're looking at here. Now your specific question on follow-ons, we do have a path forward which we're going throw a lot of muscle behind because of the importance to it. And as follow-ons, we would expect it to be -- and I'm always careful to say this, but some more easier than the normal path for a new molecular entity. We know the molecule, we know the indications that we would be looking at and we know the clinical trials and, of course, we know the key opinion leaders. So it is an aggressive timeline, but we are absolutely behind this. Hope that helps.","Operator","Moving on, our next question is from David Friedman from Morgan Stanley.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just maybe discuss your updated thoughts or plans for the cPMP program? And what do you think you will need to do in terms of steps left before you could file that program?","Leonard Bell","Thanks very much, David. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Yes. Thank you, David. Clearly, an important step is the healthy volunteer study. We do believe that this will be the most effective way to really evaluate the safety, the pharmaco-dynamics and PK of the synthetic form of the cPMP. And this study will be necessary really to transition from the earlier form of the cPMP to our currently synthesized form. As I'm sure you know, the earlier forms of the cPMP were produced in a bacterial expression system. And we are now producing via chemical synthetic group. So that's really step 1. That said, we would really like to accelerate the development on this replacement therapy. As I've said in the script, and you've heard many times, this really is a severe, ultra-rare disorder. Recently, we've met with regulators to discuss our program. We've started dosing in healthy volunteers. We're also initiating a natural history study to learn more about the disease. And finally, we've also started the retrospective data collection from the handful of individual newborns who had been treated with the earlier form. So clearly, it's early, David, but again with a lot of acceleration, thoughts on how we can bring this forward.","Operator","Our next question today is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just 2 for me. First on aHUS in France. I was wondering -- it seems like it's taking a little bit longer with respect to the reimbursement discussions. I was wondering if you can give us any more insight there. And then on 1107, when might we expect to know anything about the mechanism of action there, the potential indications?","Leonard Bell","Yes. Thanks very much, Terrence. I'll look to answer the first part and then Martin will field second part. Excuse me, David, go ahead.","Basically, the way I would describe, as David mentioned earlier during the call, I think this was -- the second quarter was a particularly important quarter for us moving forward really meaningfully in 3 different countries in Europe. Most notably, the second time, we've got a broad agreement in England. I would the second time's the charm. But it's a very important formal process that just went through again with CPAG. We think that bodes extremely well for other countries. Likewise, actually, in a -- within the other central European environment in Belgium, obviously received a broad reimbursement approval. And as David intimated, we are extremely close to having a broad understanding as well in Spain. With that actually, we anticipate France is moving forward over the timeframe we had anticipated, and we would expect some time late fall to complete this. In terms of 1007?","Martin MacKay","Thanks, Lenny. And again, thanks for the question, Terence. As you know, we've completed our dose into the single-dose Phase I. We plan to discuss the initiation of a multi-dose Phase II study with regulators before year-end. And then I think I mentioned this on the call, following these discussions, I think we're in a much better position to really explore development of 1007. And we have multiple ideas in mind, all of them in severe life-threatening disease and, of course, ultra-rare. In terms of your specific about timing, we will provide more information when we reach these key clinical milestones.","Operator","Chris Raymond from Robert Baird has our next question.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just curious, you guys have been very descriptive of your life cycle management efforts. Could you maybe talk about what specific attribute or improvement on Soliris you'd be looking for either if it is a clinical improvement or safety improvement, convenience, or maybe all of the above. And maybe a second part is can you maybe give us an update, if there is one, on any IP extension strategies for Soliris?","Martin MacKay","Mark, thank you for your question, and you really answered it in part with all of the above. What we really intend on doing is serving patients in the very best way that we can. And there could be multiple means of doing that. The key thing is that we really explore like Chris, what this life cycle management plan looks like. We have some molecules. We'll take them into the clinic and we certainly have ideas about all the things that you mentioned. But at the very heart of it is how we can serve the patients best. And that will unfold over the next relatively short period.","Leonard Bell","And in regards to IP, Chris, in the United States and Europe, there is issued and valid patents out to 2020 including extensions and a supplementary protection certificates. In addition, there is a variety of pending applications that potentially could go out towards the mid-'20s or late '20s as well. And there's also, of course, a series of interwoven designations for orphan drug exclusivity across the major territories, which in different indications, would go out towards 2020 or potentially, for some of them now, that we're just starting. And our registration trials actually might go out substantially longer. And then on top of that, of course, there is a broad understanding based upon the risk management profiles and so forth of a control distribution system around the world with Soliris, where there is such a direct interaction with every prescriber and there's a very controlled tight system to assure the proper utilization and safety around the world, out to every territory and every country and every region around the world. So we think there's a variety of opportunities for carrying and continuing to serve across an increasing number of severe life-threatening ultra-rare disorders out into the 2020s with Soliris. If not, frankly longer. And at the same time, Martin has really described that we are committed to serving patients broadly and deeply. We have a great understanding of their needs and we're committed to that as we look forward to bring at least 2 molecules into the clinic as a follow-on candidates to Soliris next year. And we committed as well to bring at least one of them into approval launch status over the same multi-year period of time. We think that, overall, we have an opportunity to actually to increase our service to patients with the strategy over what already we consider to be a very robust model of service.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess two really quick questions. The follow-up was Chris's question on the pipeline and how you're thinking about the business going forward? How important it is to diversify the business away from Soliris in the outer years? And what is more important, is it expanding Soliris or the follow-on Soliris products, or is it diversifying with new products? And then second question, when you think about M&A, there's a lot of M&A as far as bringing in products into the pipeline, what do you look for as far as in products that will help you go forward diversifying the company as you've been doing in recent years?","Leonard Bell","Thanks very much for that single-part question, Robyn. As we look at our growth over the following 10 to 20 years, we really see tremendous opportunity to expand the Soliris opportunities to certifications, to bring forward next-generation molecules to expand that and serve patients even better. But at the same time, our ambitions to serve patients clearly exceed our ambitious to be able to deliver that just through Soliris -- or even the follow-ons actually for Soliris. that's really why internally with Martin now and increasingly with a new leadership being brought in to supplement the current leadership. We have a tremendous opportunity to go forward beyond an expanding robust Soliris franchise over the next 10, 15 years. And over the next several years, identify tremendous opportunities, always focusing though on patients with severe and life-threatening disorders. And for that reason we look to only go forward, as you know, with therapies that are truly transformative for these patients. I think as we now have asfotase alfa, looking to file for a registration for what we now anticipate to be a larger first indication for asfotase alfa next year, cPMP also against a lethal infant disorder. And as we look at other opportunities, bolt-on or otherwise, they're bringing to Alexion, we look at these opportunities across a broad array, with a filter, so that it's very specific for only those therapies that are potentially transformative or patients with just severe and devastating disorders. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Yes. In terms of what we look for, which really just adds to the points that Lenny made, it starts off with the path of physiology of disease, what we understand about these devastating ultra-rare disorders. I mentioned briefly in the script about doing genetic analysis and deep genetic analysis of a very focused group of diseases and then, clearly, surround the target. Is the target plausible? Can you attack it by means. And we are agnostic to the modality, whether it's an antibody, where we have terrific skills, small molecule, other modalities, we will bring that to bear. Right at the heart of it, as Lenny said, it's about the devastating nature of the diseases that we're looking at and just how much of a change that we can make in their lives.","Leonard Bell","Was there a second part or a third part, Robyn, I don't remember.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I think -- I was just really trying to get a sense of what was more important, expanding Soliris or is the focus now, over the next years, really in -- be on bringing things in?","Leonard Bell","I think what you heard is all of the above.","David L. Hallal","And as we're coming up on the top of the hour, we can stay a few more minutes. [Operator Instructions] Operator?","Operator","Are you ready for one final question?","David L. Hallal","No, it's not a final question. We can take a few more, but are only asking people limit themselves to one apiece.","Operator","We do have a question from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A question on asfotase alfa on the regulatory side. I'm just wondering if you have any increased understanding of what breakthrough status might mean for the development plan here. I know you reiterated plans for a mid-2014 filings here. Just wondering if there could be any opportunity for this to be accelerated? Wondering where that potential next juvenile study could fit in given what you've talked about as FDA stance on the importance of age of onset here rather than age of treatment?","Martin MacKay","Thanks, Brian. It's clearly early days in terms of the breakthrough status, the designation. But what it clearly means is we'll have more frequent interactions with the FDA. And as you can imagine, we have some of those plans just now to discuss the data that we have. But also as you allude to, the studies that we want to do in this area. I wouldn't go much further than that at this stage until we really understand what the designation means. But we're very pleased that we will be able to have those more frequent interactions, in particular, at this stage of development of asfotase alfa.","Operator","We'll move on to Matt Roden from UBS Securities.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just was wondering if you could comment on the NMO Phase III that's posted on clinicaltrials.gov. Two things kind of jumped out of me. One is the exclusion of retox, and I don't think that was the case in the prior study. And secondly, the EDSS has to be 7 or less. I was wondering if you can comment on the rationale for those 2 particular changes from the Phase II, and whether or not you think that will impact either the utilization downstream or patient enrollment.","Martin MacKay","Okay. Thank you. Just a couple of points specifically to your question. I think you know from reading about it that this is about a 90-patient study, approximately 100 sites. We decided on the criteria just based on kind of treatment of those patients and the severity of the disease. In terms of the EDSS score of less than 7, we wanted to make sure that we were able to help in the disease, particularly, in the clinical trial stage of things. So that's why we chose that particular criteria.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Lee Kalowski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Lee Kalowski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I also had an NMO question. I'd also seen the posting on clinical trials. I was wondering if you can just give us a sense for when you expect the first patient to be dosed? And the timeline, I'm just wondering if the study completion that's posted, if that's just a placeholder or when we should expect that data from the trial?","Martin MacKay","Yes. I'll answer your questions in reverse order. It's a placeholder. Now that we've had the protocol complete, though, that's clearly very good start. And now, we'll prepare to commence the single multinational registration trial in the second half of this year. So we will start this year and, obviously, being event, we will see the progress of that depending on the patients that we recruit. Hope that's helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Willey from Stifel.","Stephen D. Willey - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I have a question on South Korea actually. I know that we've seen I think some registry data presented at a couple of ASH meetings now, and I think it's looks like, if I remember correctly, at least a couple of 100 patients that look to at least be typically worthy of treatments. So I guess, how should we think about the rate at which those patients come online into the model?","David L. Hallal","Yes, thanks, Steven. So as I mentioned the second half of this year, we expect to add Korea to our portfolio. I think that just looking at the access path, I would view it as probably a slow but growing number of patients over time. We obviously, work very closely with the key opinion leaders including the Professor Lee in Korea. So they will be looking at some of the more severe patients to initiate treatment first. And then we might see a slow and growing proportion of patients over time access treatment. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Luchini from Piper Jaffray.","Matthew W. Luchini - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","You've talked a bit about the second-generation Soliris compounds. And I was just wondering, if you might be able to expand on -- if both -- how the profiles of the 2 products might be different from one another as well as if both end up looking promising, would you -- is it a one or -- either\/or situation, or would you consider commercializing both of them? And if so how would you segment the 2 relative to one other?","Martin MacKay","Thank you. I think I mentioned this previously, it's just a bit early to have that level of discussion. And I'd go back to my comment, what's really important here is how we can best serve patients. And we'll only really know about it, once we get into clinical trials. And then we'll been able to make decisions, what makes the most sense and which ones to push forward. It's really as simple as that.","Operator","And that was our last question, and this concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Irving Adler, Executive Director, Corporate Communications. Go ahead, sir.","Irving Adler","Thank you, Whitney. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the fourth quarter of 2013 and our outlook for 2014. Today's call will be led Dr. Leonard Bell, our Chief Executive Officer. Lenny will be joined by members of Alexion management: Vikas Sinha, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; David Hallal, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Martin MacKay, Executive Vice President and Global Head of R&D; Steve Squinto, Executive Vice President and Chief Global Operations Officer; and Saqib Islam, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements apply only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after this call.","I'd also like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP operating results are adjusted from our U.S. GAAP operating results for certain items that we described in our press release issued this morning. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release.","Thank you. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thank you, Irving. With focus execution in Q4, Alexion's global team achieved a strong finish to 2013, which positions us to reach an even broader and higher range of commercial and clinical milestones in 2014 and the years ahead. Our accomplishments in 2013 and our expectations for 2014 are driven by the urgency of our mission to develop and deliver life-transforming therapies for patients with devastating and life-threatening disorders that are also ultra-rare.","Our fourth quarter performance underscored our strategic growth initiatives. First, our commercial team provided Soliris to an increasing number of patients with PNH and aHUS worldwide and broadened the base in which we will serve more patients in 2014 and beyond.","Second. Our R&D team advanced our current lead development programs toward a potential of as many as 7 anticipated product approvals with Soliris and other highly innovative therapies starting in 2014.","Looking first on our PNH operations during Q4. We, again, continue to demonstrate strong Soliris growth in our core territories with increasing contribution from the next group of major countries, including Turkey, Russia and Brazil. In 2014, we will go deeper in each of these countries, while also increasing our presence to serve more patients across our nearly 50-country platform. We are driven in these efforts by the knowledge that globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone began appropriate therapy.","Turning to our aHUS launch. In Q4, we again observed a steady addition of new patients in the United States, made continued progress in key European countries and initiated aHUS commercial operations in Japan, following our marketing approval late last year. The ongoing strength of the global aHUS launch in the United States and other countries reinforces our confidence that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH, and perhaps larger. As one measure, we continue to observe that match for the time since their respective approvals, more patients in the United States are currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. These results support our belief that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH.","In 2014, we expect to continue to extend our aHUS initiatives in the United States, complete the aHUS reimbursement processes across Western Europe, achieve a robust launch in Japan on our first full year of aHUS operations, and build on our initial presence in Turkey, Russia and Brazil.","Turning to R&D, during Q4, we made significant progress across all of our lead development programs. In 2014, we are now well positioned to achieve 10 or more development milestones. As Martin will describe further, these include, in HPP, our U.S, EU and Japan filings for marketing approval for asfotase alfa.","In AMR: the completion of enrollment and dosing in both, our ongoing living-donor study, and our newly expanded diseased-donor study. For DGF, NMO and MG: significant advances in enrollment of the single registration study in each of these indications.","For cPMP: completion of the retrospective study, completion of enrollment in the natural history study, and initiation of the synthetic cPMP bridging study.","For ALXN1007: the initiation of 2 Phase II proof-of-concept clinical studies in patients with 2 different severe and ultra-rare disorders with initial data from at least 1 of these indications by year end.","And finally, turning to our next-generation Soliris candidates, we expect to initiate clinical studies with 2 or more molecules in 2014.","Our 2014 development milestones are all important steps toward our anticipated series of as many as 7 potential major product approvals between 2014 and 2018, starting with our second product, asfotase alfa near late 2014, and then followed by Soliris for AMR and DGF and kidney transplant, and for both NMO and MG; our third product, cPMP for infants with MoCD Type A, and we expect approval of 1 or more of our next-generation follow-on products to Soliris within the same 2014 to 2018 period.","Beyond our current late-stage clinical development programs, we were pleased to recently announce a significant expansion of our research capabilities through our broad and long-term exclusive strategic agreement with Moderna, with the discovery and development of messenger RNA Therapeutics to treat patients with rare diseases.","Since rare disorders are most commonly caused by protein deficiencies, this innovative mRNA drug discovery platform optimally positions Alexion to address the broadest number of severe and rare conditions. Martin will provide more information on this program later in the call.","Over our 20-year history, and as we continue to grow strongly here in the United States, we have been focused on building a strong and independent organization. That will always have as its core mission the emphasis on patient care.","To this end, during Q4, we also reached an important milestone in our expanded service to patients around the world with the expansion of our technical operations and the opening of our global supply chain and quality facility in Ireland. I am pleased to note that as part of this expansion, we have recently agreed to purchase a vialing facility in Ireland. Following the appropriate validation processes and regulatory approval, this will become Alexion's first company-owned vialing facility for Soliris and our other clinical and commercial products.","As we centralize our global supply chain operations in Ireland, we also expect greater operational efficiencies, which Vikas will discuss later in the call. Separately, we have begun to distribute Soliris from our newly-approved contract manufacturing facility in Singapore.","Finally, we are pleased with the continued improvements in our Rhode Island manufacturing and quality operations and look forward to the FDA reinspection of this facility in the first half of 2014.","Turning briefly to our financial performance. Our 2013 results reflected 37% growth in revenues and 47% growth in non-GAAP EPS year-over-year. Moreover, towards the end of 2013, we realigned our global structure to facilitate stronger growth and more efficient performance in the years ahead. Our 2014 guidance reflects both our strong top-line and bottom-line growth forecasts.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance in Q4 and 2013, and our expectations for 2014. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Lenny. The fourth quarter of 2013 was another period of sustained growth in revenues and profitability for Alexion and provided a strong finish to the year. Revenue in Q4 increased 38% year-on-year to $441.9 million, representing a strong ongoing growth in established market, augmented by initial contributions from aHUS in Japan and Russia, following approvals in these countries in late Q3 2013. For the full year 2013, we recorded sales of $1.55 billion, an increase of 37% compared to 2012.","Looking at the geographic breakdown of sales in 2013: the U.S. contributed 36% of revenue; Europe, 33%; Asia Pacific, 13%; and rest of world, 18%.","Year-on-year revenue growth was robust across all our territories in 2013. Compared to 2012, U.S. sales increased by 40%, Europe by 23%, Asia Pacific by 26%, and rest of world increased by 76%. The growth rate in Europe was impacted by the fact that we did not have a full year of aHUS revenue in any European country. As a result of exceeding our revenue target, while maintaining strict financial discipline in our growing commercial and clinical activities, we were able to report 2013 non-GAAP EPS of $3.8 per diluted share, an increase of 47% year-on-year.","Looking at our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at quarter end grew by $212 million to $1.52 billion, reflecting continued strong positive cash flow from operations.","I would like to review some individual line items with regard to Q4 and 2013, starting with cost of goods. In November, we announced our intention to record an additional expense in cost of goods resulting from the replacement of certain inventory. Compared to our previous estimate of as much as $25 million, we recorded an expense of $14.3 million in cost of goods in Q4. During Q4, this increase in cost was partially mitigated by the benefit of the lower cost of goods shipped from our contract facility in Singapore. As a result, cost of goods was 11.5% in Q4 and 10.6% for the year.","Our Q4 non-GAAP results excluded $33.5 million related to an impairment of early-stage assets. Also in Q4, and importantly, to build a platform for long-term operating efficiency, we incurred an incremental noncash tax expense of approximately $96 million by centralizing and optimizing of global supply chain and business operation within our Irish affiliates. We expect this realignment of our operations to bring a significant operational and financial efficiencies beginning in 2014.","I would now like to turn to our 2014 guidance. First, we are again guiding strong top-line year-on-year revenue growth. Revenues for 2014 are forecasted in a range of $2 billion to $2,020,000,000, an increase of approximately 30% year-on-year. 2014 guidance reflects our expectation for continued strong organic growth. As in past years, sequential growth in Q1 will be lower than Q4, reflecting fewer treatment days in Q1. In addition, we do not expect any meaningful new country initiations in Q1 2014.","Second, our forecast for 2014 SG&A expense of $560 million to $500 million -- $560 million to $580 million will be approximately 28% of sales. Our 2014 guidance includes the expense associated with the build-out of our metabolic therapeutic area in anticipation of a robust HPP launch.","Third, our non-GAAP R&D guidance in 2014 is forecasted in the range of $360 million to $380 million, which is approximately 18% of sales, as we pursue the broadest pipeline in our history to support future product approvals and launches. Q1 non-GAAP results will exclude $100 million related to our strategic agreement with Moderna, which will be recorded for GAAP purposes only.","Fourth, as we guided this morning, we expect our cost of goods sold to be reduced to approximately 9% in 2014.","Fifth, looking at our 2014 tax guidance, we have taken several steps to create a platform to continuously achieve greater operational and financial efficiencies. We now expect that our non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 10% to 11%, reflecting our more efficient global structure and the utilization of available tax credits. Following utilization of our remaining tax credits, we expect that our non-GAAP tax rate will gradually rise to a range of 16% to 18% by 2016.","Finally, with regard to our 2014 guidance, by continuing to strongly grow revenues while maintaining our financial discipline, we are providing 2014 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.70 to $3.80. This forecast is based on an average of 205 million shares outstanding during the year. We are very pleased with our financial performance in 2013 and our robust outlook for 2014.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to David, who will provide an update of our global commercial operations. David?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Vikas. During 2013, we achieved strong Soliris revenue growth of 37%, reflecting continued steady growth in PNH and our ongoing strong launch at aHUS in initial countries.","Looking first at PNH. We continue to grow our PNH operations by achieving deeper penetration in the nearly 50 countries in which we serve patients, with key countries benefiting from field team expansions deployed for the aHUS launch.","Importantly, throughout 2013, we continued to identify new patients with PNH each quarter, even in our longest established territories. Looking specifically at Q4, strong rates of patient identification and rapid treatment initiation with Soliris continued as in prior quarters, as our disease awareness and diagnostic programs continue to support optimal patient care. We were pleased with our performance in our core territories of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan; saw a steady growth in Turkey, Brazil and Russia; and continued to serve new patients in Korea and Latin America. In 2014, we expect that our efforts will result in more patients being rapidly diagnosed and treated in both established and newer markets and continue to selectively broaden our footprint to address opportunities in Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific.","We are optimistic about our growth potential in PNH, as globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commenced appropriate therapy. In aHUS, we were pleased with the strength of the early stages of our global launch in 2013, and we are continuing this momentum in 2014.","In Q4, our disease education and diagnostic initiatives again resulted in a steady increase in a number of new patients in the U.S. commencing Soliris therapy, as well as the steady addition of new patients in the major countries of Western Europe, where we have established reimbursement. We added a significant number of new patients in Western Europe during 2013, even though we did not have a full year of reimbursement in any individual country. During 2013, we made significant progress to establish reimbursement for aHUS. And in 2014, we look forward to our first full year of serving patients with aHUS in several major European countries.","Looking more closely at our progress in key European countries. Starting with England, new and existing aHUS patients are receiving Soliris through a very broad funding policy commissioned by NHS England in Q3, which we expect will form the basis of ongoing access to Soliris. The NICE process is ongoing, and the decision is anticipated later in 2014.","In Germany, in Q4, we were very pleased that the government announced a rollback of the mandatory rebate on pharmaceuticals. The 16% rebate will revert back to the original level of 6% in Q1 2014 and then increase slightly to 7%. We are also pleased that we continue to see an increasing number of aHUS patients in Germany diagnosed and treated by nephrologist and hematologists.","In Spain, we are beginning the reimbursement processes in individual provinces, following a national agreement with the federal government regarding the use of Soliris for patients with aHUS at the end of Q3.","Elsewhere in Europe, in France, we continue to advance reimbursement discussions with the government and expect these discussions to conclude by mid-2014.","In Italy, while the government continues to provide Soliris through an early access program, we also expect to complete the reimbursement process by mid-2014 to enable a full commercial launch. Also, in our EMEA region, we continued to observe steady growth in serving new aHUS patients in Turkey in Q4.","Beyond EMEA, we've reached an important milestone as we served initial patients with aHUS in Japan, and now expect to execute on a robust launch in our first full year of aHUS operations in Japan.","The ongoing strength of the global aHUS launch continues to reaffirm our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH, and perhaps larger. As one measure, we continue to observe that match for time. Since their respective approvals, more patients in the U.S. are currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. These results support our belief that the incidence of aHUS is higher than the incidence of PNH.","Beyond our current commercial operations, I would like to now turn to our preparations for a robust launch with asfotase alfa for patients with hypophosphatasia, or HPP. Importantly, our market research confirms our understanding, reflected in the FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation that age of onset is a key clinical indicator for the need to provide a transformative treatment. As we continue to establish our metabolic therapeutic area for our anticipated launch near late 2014, we have now added our initial field-based medical teams in the U.S. and Western Europe. At launch, we will be prepared to serve all patients with pediatric onset HPP, including adults. Additionally, we continue to recognize the importance of continuing to understand the needs of patients with adult onset HPP. For all patients with HPP, our metabolic therapeutic area is leveraging our learnings and expertise in PNH and aHUS to develop commercial programs to support the HPP community. Beyond planning for the launch of asfotase alfa, we are beginning to establish commercial teams to assess and plan for the opportunities in AMR, DGF, NMO, MG, and the next-generation Soliris molecules. These teams will work closely with our R&D colleagues as they advance these programs through the development process.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our development programs. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Thanks, David. I am pleased to provide an update on our lead development programs. We are currently aiming for up to 7 potential launches between 2014 and 2018. In addition, I will discuss our strategic agreement with Moderna, a key step towards expanding our research capabilities to serve additional patients with severe and rare disorders and to drive growth well into the 2020s. In keeping with our tight focus with regards to target disorders and therapeutic candidates, all of our programs are focused on devastating and life-threatening disorders affecting extremely small patient populations. And our therapeutic candidates have the potential to deliver a transformative impact on patients' lives.","To begin, I would like to discuss the progress of our development programs with eculizumab, starting with our studies in antibody-mediated rejection, or AMR, in kidney transplant patients. We have now made significant progress towards completing enrollment in our living-donor study, and we expect to complete enrollment in this study in Q1. We also continue to enroll patients in our expanded deceased-donor study, and expect to complete enrollment this summer.","Also in the area of transplant, and as we announced last week, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to eculizumab for the prevention of delayed graft function, or DGF, in renal transplant patients. DGF is an early and serious competition of organ transplantation that is characterized by the failure of a transplanted organ to function normally immediately following transplantation, requiring that the patient undergo dialysis in order to survive. There is currently no approved therapy for kidney-transplant patients who develop DGF. In addition, a significant number of donor kidneys are reportedly discarded each year due to the risk of poor outcomes associated with DGF. Following positive discussions with regulators in the U.S. and EU, we expect to initiate a single multinational DGF registration trial in mid-2014.","Turning now to neurology. Our program in neuromyelitis optica, or NMO, is on track, as we prepare to commence a single registration trial with eculizumab in relapsing NMO in the first quarter of 2014. This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, with the primary outcome measure of time to relapse. As previously discussed, the study design now aligns more closely with the thinking of leading practitioners and is focused on patients who continue to have relapses, regardless of which therapy or therapies they may have received.","In refractory myasthenia gravis, or MG, we will also initiate a single registration trial in Q1. This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in which the primary outcome is change in total MG-ADLs score from baseline to Week 26. A measure of patient outcomes aligns with our discussions with regulators.","Finally, with regards to lifecycle management of Soliris, well through the 2020s, we expect to initiate clinical studies with 2 or more next-generation Soliris molecules in 2014, with another molecule at an earlier stage of development.","I will now turn to our lead development programs with our highly innovative therapies beyond eculizumab, starting with asfotase alfa. We continue to benefit from the Breakthrough Therapy designation received from the FDA, as we look to complete our registration program for pediatric-onset hypophosphatasia, or HPP. Importantly, we have also now had productive discussions with both EMA and PMDA regarding our HPP program.","The analysis of our infant natural history study continues to be strongly supportive of our anticipated filing, and we have now initiated a natural history study in juveniles with HPP. We remain on track to file for our initial marketing authorization in HPP in the U.S. and Europe by mid-2014, and we also expect to file for approval in Japan near the end of 2014.","Further in our metabolic disease area, we continue to accelerate the development of our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A, an ultra-rare, genetic metabolic disorder that causes catastrophic, neurologic damage in newborns. In 2014, we expect to drive this program forward on 3 levels: Completion of both the retrospective data collection and enrollment in the natural history study, and the initiation of a synthetic cPMP bridging study in the first quarter of 2014.","With regard to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, we expect to conduct parallel development in 2 severe and ultra-rare conditions. Following our meeting with regulators, we will initiate the Phase II proof-of-concept clinical studies in Q1, and expect to have initial data near year end and at least 1 condition.","Beyond our current clinical development programs, we were pleased to recently announce a significant expansion of our research capabilities through our long-term exclusive strategic agreement with Moderna for the discovery and development of messenger RNA therapeutics to treat patients with rare diseases. This innovative drug discovery platform optimally positions Alexion to address the broadest number of severe and rare disorders, which are most commonly caused by protein deficiencies. As part of our exclusive strategic agreement, we have the ability to cycle through many different potential rare disease targets to pick the optimal one for development. In this context, we have already identified a large number of targets relevant to rare and severe disorders.","Our relationship with Moderna is structured so that each party can focus on what it does best. They will design and manufacture mRNA therapeutic candidates based on targets we identify, and we will lead the discovery, development and commercialization of the treatments that are produced. We look forward to providing further updates on these programs on future calls.","As we look ahead in 2014, we are expecting 10 or more development milestones in our in-house programs whilst also enhancing our R&D capabilities through disciplined research collaborations, licensing and acquisitions. Our strong focus remains on developing therapeutic candidates with life-transforming potential for patients with rare and severe disorders.","I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thank you, Martin. 2013 was a year of strong performance for Alexion across a growing number of commercial and clinical objectives. In 2014, we will build on our recent accomplishments as we seek to serve more patients with PNH and aHUS worldwide, prepare for a robust launch in HPP, reach a wide range of milestones across our lead development programs, and aggressively push forward the frontiers of scientific discovery for the benefit of patients with severe and rare disorders.","As always, we thank our employees for their dedication to our mission, as we work to transform the lives of patients.","Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And will take our first question from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","First, across all the facets of the organization, a question for Vikas maybe on the business operation transfer to Ireland. Can you talk mechanically about what's maybe going on there? Are you transferring IP to Ireland? And in terms of the cash you'll be generating, is that going to be domiciled in Ireland? Would that be available for things like M&A or future dividend payments? Would you have to pay taxes if you were to repatriate that cash, et cetera?","Leonard Bell","Eric, its Lenny. Thank you very much for that question. Let me start out by giving some context, and then actually I'll turn the rest of the response to Vikas. Over our 20-year history and as we continue to grow strongly here in the United States, as I mentioned earlier, we have been focused on building a strong and independent organization. That will always have as its core its mission and emphasis on patient care. In addition to our relentless focus on the development of innovative therapies, we also recognize our need to achieve increased operational efficiency in order to optimally serve patients worldwide. As we highlighted earlier, we've recently reached important milestones in the centralization of our technical operations with the opening of our global supply chain facility and agreement to purchase a the vialing facility in Ireland. During 2013, we have developed a substantial presence in quality, technical operations and global supply chain in Ireland. Already in 2014, as I mentioned, our presence is further accelerating as we made our agreement to purchase and now operate a vialing facility in Ireland. As our quality, technical operations, global supply chain and vialing facilities come online, they are designed to provide further support for patients in Europe and around the world. In addition, our increasing investment in Singapore production further improves our cost structure and strengthens our global supply chain. The tax rate guidance that we are giving this morning reflects the changes we have made for our operations to accommodate this substantial growth in our global business. Importantly, this increase is efficiency will enable us to continue to investing in our expanding research initiatives as well as the global introductions of innovative therapies to serve patients around the world. For more details, Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","So Eric, further to what Lenny pointed out, the tax rate guidance we gave this morning reflects the changes we have made to our operations to accommodate the substantial growth in our business. In order to accomplish these objectives in Q4, we incurred an incremental noncash tax expense of approximately $96 million as we centralized our global supply chain and business operation within our Irish affiliates, right? And as part of the centralization of our business, effective 2014, our Irish affiliates will hold certain IP rights to Soliris and other compounds. Now going to the -- towards the math portion of this, as you'll recall, we had $454 million in NOLs and $65.3 million in tax credits at the beginning of 2013. During Q4, we created additional foreign tax credits as we centralize business operations within our Irish affiliates. At the end of 2013, we have approximately $9 million of NOLs and approximately $190 million in tax credits remaining. We will use these foreign tax credits to offset our taxable profits beginning in 2014. As a result, 2014 non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 11% to 12% in 2014. And then in 2015, it will be 13% to 14%. And then it'll rise to 16% to 18% in 2016 and beyond. I hope that answers your question.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Well, what about the cash domiciled, Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Yes, so cash domicile-wise, for acquisition purposes, I think we have a good opportunity to do it from either subsidiary or in terms of providing buyback opportunities to cover the dilution. And in the future, if there's a need for providing dividends, which we don't have an intention at this point, we will have enough cash that will come in to U.S.","Leonard Bell","Yes, 2 things to clarify. One is the -- again, as we provided our guidance this morning, the -- we anticipate the 2014 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%, then moving up as we exhaust some of our tax credits to 13% to 14% in 2015. And then from 2016 for the foreseeable future forward, 16% to 18%. Second, actually, we also anticipate having sufficient capacity to really build the organization globally and strategically as well from the United States and from all of our affiliates. So we don't feel constrained anywhere.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I know you guys were working on, for asfotase, the optimizing and manufacturing process but I wasn't sure what stage was this -- this was in. And then just curious, do you think that your changes to the manufacturing will require a label amendment down the road, if you have to run some sort of bridging study? And then I have just one quick follow-up on the pack.","David L. Hallal","Yes, we actually have made a firm amount progress in creating a second-generation manufacturing process for asfotase alfa. I think at this point, it's a little bit too early to determine what the regulatory strategy will be. As we learn more about the next-generation molecule and better characterization around that molecule, we'll be able to identify better how the regulatory path will play out.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's good. And then just to confirm, I know the cost on the new tax structure, just to confirm it, if that include asfotase, future indications of Soliris, et cetera, et cetera.","Vikas Sinha","Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was hoping to ask a question where Lenny couldn't read from the scripts. For aHUS, I know you've not really provided a lot of granularity but was hoping you could give us a sense. Is it somewhere around 20% of sales? It looks like you had such a big uptick in U.S. sales growth for the year that a lot of that has got to be attributed to it. I just wanted to get a ballpark number, if I'm thinking about it correctly. And then, again, capital allocation for R&D in the past, you talked about that being in and around 18% of sales. But as you look at the pipeline today, do you think that you have enough programs to really achieve that goal? Or should we be thinking about a lot of deals going forward to help support your longer-term growth goals?","Leonard Bell","So I'll take the first question, which has something to do with the aHUS versus PNH and then the second question, Martin will take. So as I think that people have noticed, obviously, you can see the bump up in our reported U.S. sales in 2012 over 2011, which actually reflects then the addition at the end of 2011 of aHUS in the United States, the PNH agent. And we think that's indicative, frankly, if one backs that out of the preceding several years of year-on-year absolute growth of how much aHUS contributed versus how much PNH contributed. We have further made a comment that outside the United States, we really have not had one full year of sales in any country following all of our discussions, and we anticipate that this will further serve patients as we move forward during the remainder of this year. We think as well, as we note, that overall looking at the United States, and certainly as we mentioned, David and I both mentioned earlier, is that as well as other countries, we think that, that time for time, aHUS to PNH, there are more patients typically on a treatment but at the same time post approval in those countries where we're fully active. And we think that indicates, as we mentioned, that we believe the incidence of aHUS is higher than PNH. Martin, would you like to discuss R&D and our strategic approaches there?","Martin MacKay","Yes, thank you. Thank you, Lenny. Yes, Rachel, in terms of 2014, from a development part, is certainly a busy year if I think about the filing of asfotase alfa, the completion of the living-donor, deceased-donor trial and AMR, and we have several starts, as you know, from NMO, MG, DGF, the bridging cPMP study, 2 programs with ALXN1007 and then, of course, our next generation. However, I believe that our budget is very well positioned to be able to prosecute this portfolio. So that said, top of my mind to deliver those programs. The other part you raised is a good one, though in terms of looking at other things and as I mentioned in the script, whether it be research, collaborations or acquisitions or licensing, we're very active in this field, looking to bring those things in. And we will handle the budget accordingly.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ying Huang with Barclays.","Ying Huang - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So first one, can you talk a little bit about the average aHUS dosing for Soliris now? So now we can have an idea like, on average, what the age group is for the current patients receiving Soliris. And then secondly, I was hoping Martin can give a little bit more clarity on the Moderna collaboration in terms of which indications you guys might be looking at? And then how is this messenger RNA delivered?","David L. Hallal","Yes, Ying, it's David. I'll take your first question. The way to think about aHUS is that on average, across the children and adults, it reflects very similarly to that of PNH. Some of the adults, obviously, that we have on treatment or all of the adults are on the higher dose as reflected in our labels. But of course, because we're serving children as well, on average, it squares up with PNH.","Martin MacKay","Well, thank you, Ying, for your question on Moderna. I'd say a couple of things. As you probably know, the key finding here that really underpins the technology was the ability to inject modified RNA in animals to avoid the immune system and actually produce proteins at potentially therapeutic levels. And the Moderna scientists have shown in vivo that you can make these therapeutic levels of proteins via this mRNA technology. Of course, in our world, most of the diseases that we look at in the rare and ultra-rare space are caused by protein deficiencies, and therefore, a lack of a protein caused by some gene defect. So if you think about it, it's really a very good fit to apply this technology to the diseases that we are most interested in. And that's what we will prosecute. In terms of the types of diseases we're thinking of, literally, we have scores of diseases in the ultra-rare space that would fit the bill here for replacement proteins, and we're working through these diligently now to select a number of them that we'll be able to test with the technology. The really neat thing from my perspective is this is all really very testable. The ability to make the construct inject it, which is the answer to the last part of your question, and then test if you get those therapeutic proteins is all within the realms of what we do in the laboratory today. So very exciting technology and we're looking forward to addressing a number of disease targets.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Salveen Richter with Canaccord.","Salveen J. Richter - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Just a follow-up question on the tax credit. Just wondering, post 2016, should we expect non-GAAP taxes to go up to full tax rates? And then also, the cost, if you could give us an idea of the FX impact in Q4 and then your assumption for 2014 in guidance for FX and how we should think about Q1 given the yen and Australian dollar?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Salveen. The first one is in 2016, we will get to 16% to 18% range in taxes as we exhaust our foreign tax credit in '14 and '15. Relating to the foreign exchange, from Q3 to Q4, the pressure on yen was there and was slightly offset by the euro so we didn't see a significant impact going into Q4. But when we go from Q4 to Q1, the yen and the commodity currencies there are under tremendous pressure right now, and we will definitely see pressure going into Q1 from Q4 2013. And as a reminder, Q1 always has 2 fewer shipping days. So between that and the FX, we see that impact also if you compare it to the last year and the year before. We see that impact coming in, in Q1 also. So those 2 factors will impact our Q1, namely 2 fewer days and yen and Aussie dollars from commodity currencies.","Salveen J. Richter - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And then -- so then, Vikas, the tax credits will run out in 2016 and we should expect tax rates to kind of go up towards the 32% range or so as we go to 2017 onwards?","Vikas Sinha","No, no, no. Salveen, 16.8 -- 16% to 18% will be 2016 and beyond. So it will not go up. And then I will -- so from the GAAP tax rate perspective also, I don't expect GAAP tax rate to be more than 3%, 4%, more than that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from David Friedman with Morgan Stanley.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's on the delayed-graft function. I was wondering if you could discuss, a, are we going to be any of the delayed-graft function data of this year? And then, b, in terms of the planning for Phase III, are you thinking about dosing more along the lines of what you're using for acute rejection or more along the lines of some of the investigator sort of studies or some of the discussions around single dosing or a couple of doses?","Martin MacKay","Thank you, David. In answer to 2 parts of your question, in terms of when we will expect to see some data, clearly, that we look the data that's coming out of the AMR studies, living-donor and deceased-donor over the next period. Clearly, the DGF trial itself, which is the randomized double-blind eculizumab versus placebo, we'll not have that data for some time. We aim to start that study in the middle of the year. And I think as you know, the primary endpoint there is incidence of DGF following posttransplantation. Obviously, our aim is to start in 2014. In terms of the dosing, we expect that to run along more of the lines of the AMR. Clearly, we've looked very carefully at the investigator studies and are continuing to work through that. Hope that answers both questions.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess, just to clarify that. Will we see some of the data that you've generated to date this year? Or is that not to be?","Martin MacKay","We're still working through that actually, David. As I mentioned, maybe mentioned in the script, it's something that we are considering given that we will complete the living-donor data in the first quarter and aim to complete the deceased-donor, the expanded study that you remember from the 47 to 80 patients towards midyear. As we gather those data, then we'll make a decision about how we will externalize them.","Leonard Bell","Obviously, David, as well, the DGF is part of deceased-donor, which, as we mentioned, now, as Martin said, is being expanded. So we're hustling, of course, and we're very grateful to all the investigators as they try to rapidly enroll the increased number.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Raymond from Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Lenny, just a question on the Moderna deal. As I recall, you had a few things to say about RNAi as a technology. Maybe in the context of those comments, can you maybe talk a little what drew you to mRNA? And specifically, on Moderna, we've done a little bit of work on this, and I think they've got some really good direct injection data. But could you maybe comment on sort of the plan going forward for a systemic delivery?","Leonard Bell","Yes, I'll make an initial comments and then I'll defer to Martin for sure. I think that as we look at the scope of patients suffering with devastating disorders that are within the filter that we look to address, the overwhelming majority of these conditions, as Martin mentioned, are really caused by protein deficiency. And so we look at the end how we're looking to help a patient -- how we're looking to help the patients with the most devastating disorders. As we then back up all the way to say what types of technologies would allow us to address the broadest group of those patients with the most severe and devastating disorders that are rare, it happens to be that technologies that cause increase in endogenous protein production are perfectly matched to the setting where almost the vast majority of rare, devastating disorders are caused by protein deficiencies. Certainly, there are patients who may have excess proteins. Certainly, oncology is a typical area where this is. Its overexpression and so forth. But when you look at devastating and rare disorders, the overwhelming majority of these severe conditions are caused by protein deficiencies by which the addition of mRNA as a template for protein or endogenous protein production, in our view, allows us to address the broadest group. Not to say that we don't have interest in a variety of different technologies to address different populations of patients, as we look at the platform, the broadest group would really be with something that accentuates protein production.","Martin MacKay","Nothing to add, Lenny. You've covered both points. It's not just this technology, its other technologies where we are looking at things being knocked down also. Basically, anything brought to bear on these devastating diseases.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about the latest on persistency rates in aHUS, how your educational efforts around all the data you've generated are resonating and if there's any regional differences in the level of understanding of the need for chronic therapy.","David L. Hallal","Yes, thank you, it's David. We sort of noted in past calls that our compliance rate with aHUS is solid. But it is less than we've historically observed in PNH. And as we described and discussed down at ASH, we were very pleased with new information at both ASN and ASH last year that was producing for the first time our 3-year data. So the impact of Soliris on those aHUS patients that were remaining on treatment for now up to and through 3 years. And I think what's important about that is it's giving physicians not only the comfort on the fact that patients are remaining TMA free, but there continues to be improvement in patient's renal function over that time. And so there's 2 risks associated with stopping patients early. One, of course, is the return of clinical manifestation of TMA that is outlined in our labels around the world, and those severe TMA complications are very dangerous to patients upwards and including the risk of death. And then secondly, the overall improvement of renal function as patients remain on treatment for the long run. And then secondly, at ASH, the biomarket data, which showed a large cohort of patients that were on treatment for 1 year, and that while Soliris had a dramatic impact on clinical outcomes, it also reduced all key levels of diseases measured by biomarkers except that. What we showed 1 year later was that complement alternative pathway was still elevated above the levels of normal, which highlights that without a terminal complement inhibitor on board, those patients are at risk. So we've gone out, we've started to educate many of the physicians on this new data and it is certainly resulting in a greater appreciation for the chronic nature of the disease. So early stages, but we want to bring the levels up.","Leonard Bell","Was there a second part that you wanted David to answer to that?","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No, that's very clear.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I have to say, Vikas, consensus seems to be that if you ever wanted to do some moonlighting, that I'm sure there's lots of people in the investment community that would love to have you do their tax returns. In HPP, you've gotten a variation of this question before, I just want to get your latest thinking. Would it be correct to assume that the later the onset of disease, that the less severe the manifestations? We know there's a range of severity, but I'm just trying to get a sense for what the most appropriate patient population would be, and frankly, just trying to determine how far we should go in our models beyond the [indiscernible] onset population?","David L. Hallal","Yes, so I think what the Breakthrough Therapy designation highlighted and certainly what we are focused on is those patients with perinatal, infantile and juvenile onset were those patients that very much needed a transformative treatment. And that opens up the dialogue with the FDA and Martin's team even further on [indiscernible] patients faster. So what we do know though and our market research validates is there are adults with HPP that have been living with this disease since prior to the time that they were 18 years of age. And so it is the time and onset of first symptoms of HPP that can be very indicative of the severity in adults. And that's what we're focused on, is understanding that adult segment while not in any way, as I discussed in the script, ignoring the need that patients may have with adult-onset HPP as well. And so we're going to continue to work with the community. We're going to continue to work with all segments of the population and develop our launch strategies appropriately. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Yes, just to add to David's commentary. As time goes on, we're also understanding much more about the pathophysiology of the disease and understanding the onset piece and the age piece. And as David said, we know there are adults that have quite a serious form of hypophosphatasia.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, on the aHUS side, you had mentioned at ASH that you're working toward increasing duration. How is that going? And on HPP adults, are there patients that are diagnosed after 18 that have a severe form as well or a subset of people that have a severe form? And why -- and what do you know about that population?","David L. Hallal","Sure. So I'll take on the aHUS piece and then have Martin address the HPP. So I think there's one key point about patient retention and compliance rates in aHUS and that is, as Lenny and I described on the call, the metric that we're using for time-adjusted numbers of patients on treatment with aHUS at the same point in which we had 4 PNH, being higher for aHUS, that is patients actively on treatment. So I think what that highlights is as we continue to progress and help physicians understand the long-term nature of the disease, we see great, really great leverage to try to improve patient outcomes and improve those patient numbers even further. But again, even with the compliance rates, which are not as high as we've come to expect with PNH, we still have a higher number of patients actively on treatment with aHUS as opposed to PNH. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Yes. Just briefly, Robyn, the database is relatively small at the moment, and as I mentioned earlier, we're really trying to understand the disease better across age groups. It certainly appears that today, most of the adults have onset earlier than 18. That's what we have seen. But again, much more work to be done there to truly understand this disease.","David L. Hallal","And then Robyn, I would just close. As we move toward our team getting more involved with HPP, with any ultra-rare disease, there's typically a misunderstanding as to which patients have the disease. So I would anticipate that as we extend our decease and diagnostic initiatives in HPP, there will be patients who are adults that, for the first time, physicians do evaluate their long-term medical history and onset of disease that will be diagnosed with HPP as an adult but will be validated as having pediatric-onset HPP because of greater awareness of the disease. So we're looking forward to making a significant impact there.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Howard Liang with Leerink.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","You talked about the incidence of aHUS is greater than PNH. I think also, obviously, you're converting the incidence to prevalence more for aHUS than for PNH. Can you talk about how you see the prevalence evolves over time for aHUS, and eventually, the prevalence of aHUS, how might that be relative to PNH?","David L. Hallal","Sure, Howard, thanks. So yes, I mean, as we introduce Soliris in any individual country at launch, because of the very, very high rates of ESRD and death associated with aHUS, there is typically not a very large prevalent pool of patients at all. But our belief is that on ongoing basis in any 12-month period, there would be more patients with initial symptoms and clinical manifestation of TMA with aHUS than there would be with PNH. And that is newly presenting symptoms and newly diagnosed, okay? It does not necessarily mean, and we are still focused on this, the growth opportunity, as I indicated, for PNH is still very, very high because patients have been living with the disease with symptoms that resemble other diseases. And through our efforts, we're able to identify new patients with PNH that, frankly, had symptoms of the disease for a longer period of time. So then how does all of this impact prevalence of aHUS? As we get there sooner with our efforts to enable patients to receive a rapid and accurate diagnosis and then gain access to treatment, obviously, the long-term outcomes associated with Soliris and aHUS are very positive and we would expect the number of patients then to increase, the prevalent pool to increase, because now they are not progressing to ESRD or death.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 because I'm guessing you aren't going to answer the first one. But any hint about 1007, either the target and\/or the diseases you're going after? And if you guys aren't going to answer that one yet, then just wondering in terms of the business development efforts here going forward, if Moderna's the type of asset company we should think about so early stage platform or is still everything on the table as you continue to scour the landscape.","Unknown Executive","Lenny, do want to...","Leonard Bell","Martin, do want to answer 1b? Good.","Unknown Executive","Exactly, Lenny do not want to answer 1a first. Listen, Terence, I think that with respect to BD, I think Moderna certainly fits the bill from a technology standpoint and a quality standpoint. But it is not -- we aren't limiting ourselves to early stage or late stage. There will be products that we look at. There will be technology that we continue to look at, all within the filter that we're solving for a transformative effect in very life-threatening disorders. Sorry, I'm losing my voice here.","Martin MacKay","Yes, as regards to 1007, Terence, we will give more information as we progress with the trials, both in terms of mechanism and the 2 ultra-rare disorders that we are looking to start proof-of-concept studies in the first quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Geoff Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Look, Lenny, you've beaten us over the head with aHUS that's got to be bigger than PNH. So I'm not trying to prompt you to say that again, but could you help venture a similar sort of comparison for asfotase? Do you think, given what you've seen right now, that asfotase has the potential to be as large contributor, either in terms of to the company or in patient numbers to where you've achieved things with PNH?","Leonard Bell","Yes, it's a great question. Thank you for as asking, Geoff. I think it's really very early. Obviously, we're -- as David described, we're just creating -- and Martin described we're just creating our medical teams around the world to help physicians understand what HPP is. It's a very, very long road, given that very rare disorders, particularly ones that such a devastating outcome for patients and families like HPP. The knowledge in the identification of patients is really uncommon. But I think it's really way too early for us to project to you, if we ever were to, what we think that will be. As we can tell, we're keenly focused, obviously. We recognize clearly, no matter what, how devastating this disorder is and that's our first and foremost priority to address that.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, you should -- you might have to remind us about aHUS being as large as PNH again then.","Leonard Bell","Sorry, I might have to remind you about what?","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","aHUS being larger than PNH then. We've talked basically on that.","Leonard Bell","Yes -- no -- yes, as I said, I think we said it several times. I think it's indicative that, as David said, I said, David said and then I said, I think that there is -- clearly, match time for time, PNH approval versus aHUS approval in the United States and selected other countries. There are more patients currently actively receiving treatment with Soliris for their aHUS as opposed to PNH at the same time. Likewise, we have a great conviction at the incidence of aHUS, as David said, I said then David said and I said, again, it is actually higher for aHUS than it is for PNH. David, do want to do it again or...","David L. Hallal","I don't want to do it again. The only thing I'll state is that this is over a few years period of time in the U.S. So it is a long period of time. We're not looking at a single quarter.","Vikas Sinha","Let's take 2 more questions.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two questions. One, Vikas, for you, the benefits from Germany, the reduction in the rebate, is that something -- it sounds like it's going to start in Q1. Is that immediate, that the whole thing is going to a roll forward starting January? And I don't know if you can qualify for us how big is Germany. And then I just have a quick follow-up on HPP.","Vikas Sinha","So I'll take the first question. The German impact is across all the companies in Germany as all of you know about that. And so yes, the impact will start seeing the benefit from Q1 onwards for the full year or most likely full year, next year.","Leonard Bell","There's also a -- just the nuance which I'm not sure if we mentioned directly in the call earlier, but again, as Vikas said, it was across all companies serving patients in Germany. But in addition to that, there's a little bit of change that we expect to occur. So it goes from 16% down to 6% and then back up to 7% starting in the second quarter, the rebate.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then Lenny, just for you. Can you give us a little bit of a sense, I mean, obviously, you guys are going to go aggressively with the alkaline phosphatase, asfotase alfa in the market to try to diagnose more patients. And it's probably going to be -- it's going to be more fruitful, obviously, in the patients who are a little bit older. So what -- is there -- was it -- even if it exists, a typical presentation for an adult who was diagnosed prior to age of 18, I'm trying to get a sense what's the profile of these kind of patients. And are they symptomatic against the drug?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Yaron. Yes, so I think the one thing I'm hesitant to say about which is more fruitful, all patients with this disease, we are focused on. From a development perspective and a commercial perspective, when we get in, we're focused on the entire community and all of our efforts has got to be focused on really serving that community. In terms of how one might be diagnosed, I'll share one example, is you're looking at dysfunctional alk phos in these patients. And what's interesting is a lot of physicians don't necessarily even have in part of their diagnostic platform. When they see, say, a presentation of a patient with early tooth loss, frequent fractures, perhaps some organ involvement, they're not necessarily thinking about testing alk phos or when they do, they perhaps are looking for elevated levels of alk phos rather than low alk phos. And there's a very basic element of our diagnostic campaign that will help to shape, very much like we did with PNH and aHUS, help to shape the clinical presentation of patients, what diseases may overlap in terms of symptoms with HPP and then the simple, available, reliable and trusted diagnostic test available to those physicians so that they can make a differential diagnosis. And so there's a lot to learn and we look forward to providing more color on our efforts in future calls.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I guess my question is a little bit of a continuum of that. Have you begun screening any bone fragility disorder populations like osteogenesis imperfecta to identify HPP patients? How many -- any estimates for how many candidates for asfotase alfa you might be able to pick up in those settings?","David L. Hallal","Yes, it's just too early to tell. I will say though that we are working with the opinion leaders globally in the HPP community to gather their feedback on what we think can be the most effective diagnostic education programs to help physicians think about screening and testing the right patient.","Leonard Bell","As David is saying, clearly, there's a significant number of disorders that may get confused with hypophosphatasia. And certainly, as what we have done in other disorders, PNH for example or aHUS, sometimes it's helpful to frame for physicians to consider those other disorders by which physicians may get confused to give them a path to identify which one of them really have the critically severe disease, in this case, hypophosphatasia.","Operator","That was our last question, and this concludes today's conference call.

Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the third quarter of 2015 and updated plans for the full year. Today's call will be led by David Hallal, our CEO. David will start the call with an overview of our global performance and be joined by Vikas Sinha, our Chief Financial Officer; and Carsten Thiel, our Chief Commercial Officer as well as Martin MacKay, our Global Head of R&D.

We will make forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filings with the SEC and our subsequent SEC filings.","Any forward-looking statements apply only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after this call.

A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release. Thank you.","David?","David Hallal","Thank you, Elena. Q3 was a landmark quarter for Alexion as we firmly established our leadership in serving patients with rare and devastating diseases. During the quarter we achieved many significant commercial, R&D and financial milestones. ","First, our commercial team continued to serve an increasing number of patients with PNH and aHUS with Soliris. Second, we received important regulatory approvals for Strensiq and Kanuma establishing the platform to globally launched two new highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies. Third, our R&D team continues to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech with multiple key milestones expected in Q4 and beyond. And fourth, we had another quarter of strong financial performance. ","Looking first at our complement franchise in PNH in Q3 as in prior quarters. Our global commercial organization continued to identify and serve a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients across our 50-country platform. In aHUS in Q3 we once again reached a consistent number of new patients. The ongoing strength of our global rollout confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is indeed larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. We continue to see the majority of our opportunity to serve new patients with PNH and aHUS ahead of us. ","In our metabolic franchise as we just announced, the FDA approved Strensiq under breakthrough therapy designation and priority review for patients with perinatal, infantile and juvenile onset HPP, a life-threatening ultra-rare disease in which bone formation is incomplete causing deformity of the skeleton, profound muscle weakness, seizures, severe pain and premature death. We are very pleased that the broad label for Strensiq will allow any patient with symptoms of HPP prior to the age of 18 to be eligible for treatment. The label reflects the breakthrough medical innovation that Strensiq provides to patients and families. ","First, Strensiq treated patients had overall survival of 97% compared to 42% for historical control patients at 49 weeks. Second, 100% of juvenile onset HPP patients responded to Strensiq treatment as measured by substantial bone healing compared to only 6% bone healing in the control group. Third, 100% of treated patients had improvement in low weight or short statures or maintained at normal height and weight. Fourth, improvements in mobility were demonstrated in patients with juvenile onset HPP. By four years of treatment, 100% of assessed patients achieved the 6 minute walk test within the normal range for matched peers whereas no patients were in the normal range at baseline prior to Strensiq treatment. And fifth, the label specifically includes extensive safety and efficacy data from four clinical studies with Strensiq treatment in patients for up to 6.5 years. ","We are pleased that the broad and robust label reflects the transformative benefits of Strensiq for the very small number of patients who suffer from this chronic genetic metabolic disease. ","In Q3, we received regulatory approval for Strensiq in the European Union, Japan and Canada and like the US the strong labels reflect the transformative benefits of Strensiq. As with PNH since 2007 our objective is that every patient with pediatric onset HPP who can benefit from Strensiq will have access to Strensiq. ","Turning now to Kanuma. We received European approval for patients of all ages with LAL-D. The broad label includes the survival benefit in patients with the most rapid disease progression. 67% of infants treated with Kanuma survived beyond 12 months of age whereas no infants in the historical control group survived past eight months. In addition, the European label also includes clinical data in children and adults demonstrating significant improvements in multiple disease manifestations, including markers of liver injury and liver fat content. ","In the US, Kanuma continues to be reviewed under the breakthrough therapy designation and priority review with the PDUFA date of December 8. We submitted additional chemistry manufacturing and controls or CMC data last month in response to the FDA's request. As a reminder, the FDA did not request additional clinical data. We continue to have constructive discussions with the agency as we work toward bringing Kanuma to patients with LAL-D in the US as quickly as possible. Our commitment to patients and families with HPP and LAL-D reflects what we know well and do well delivering breakthrough medical innovation to transform the lives of patients suffering from devastating and ultra rare diseases. Carsten will provide an update on our launch plans for Strensiq and Kanuma later in the call. ","As we transitioned in Q3 to a multiproduct company, we were advancing the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech. We distinguish ourselves with an exclusive focus on developing life transforming therapies. We are excited about our early and late stage portfolio of highly innovative product candidates and expect up to 6 new product or indication approvals through 2018. In fact, we have multiple catalysts in our pipeline this quarter, including Phase 1\/2 data for SBC-103, our innovative enzyme replacement therapy for patients with MPS IIIB, data from our Phase 2 study of ALXN1007 and patients with GI-GVHD, initiation of a proof of concept PNH trial with ALXN1210, our lead next-generation Soliris molecule and completion of enrollment in our registration trial of eculizumab and delayed graft function in kidney transplant. ","As we head into 2016, R&D milestones include data from the registration trial of eculizumab in refractory MG, data from ALXN12010 in patients with PNH, completion of enrollment in the registration trial in refractory NMO and progressing four preclinical programs into the clinic, including a messenger RNA therapy from our Moderna partnership and another additional complement inhibitor. ","Turning to our financial performance. Product revenues in Q3 were $666 million, an increase of 20% over Q3 2014 despite increased weakness in ex-US currencies. This revenue growth was driven by a strong 29% increase in Soliris volume compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core PNH and aHUS businesses, both in the third quarter and year-to-date. ","Also, we achieved strong Q3 non-GAAP operating income of $285 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 per diluted share. ","Turning briefly to our 2015 guidance. This morning we guided 2015 revenues to be in the lower end of our previously guided range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. Due to the macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries, we expect an impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in countries where we sell in USD which is due to local government budgetary constraints. ","Also this morning we increased our EPS guidance for the year from $4.70 to $4.80 to a higher and narrower range of $4.92 to $4.97 as a result of our strong Soliris growth, continued financial discipline and accelerated synergies from our recent Synageva acquisition. ","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha ","Thanks, David. We were pleased with our financial performance in Q3 driven by the combination of strong revenue and volume growth and continued financial discipline. ","Total revenues increased to $667 million in Q3, or 20% above the year ago quarter and net product sales were $666 million in this quarter. This revenue growth was driven by a strong 29% increase in volume partially offset by a 9% or $49 million in currency headwinds in Q3 over the year ago quarter. ","Q3 revenues were driven by continued strong growth of Soliris and we also booked our initial sale for Strensiq in the final weeks of the third quarter. We look forward to serving patients with HPP around the world. However I would like to remind you that given the low incidence and high mortality of HPP as well as the country by country rollout, we expect the launch trajectory of Strensiq to be slow and steady as we build a robust global metabolic franchise over time. During the quarter, we continued to invest in the global buildout of our metabolic franchise and in our broad pipeline, including operating costs from the Synageva acquisition. ","Third quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $147 million or 22% of revenue and third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expense was $182 million or 27% of revenue. During Q3, we recognized greater synergies from the acquisition compared to our expectations which benefitted both R&D and SG&A spend in the quarter. We also benefited from $5.6 million from lower expenses due to strengthening of the US dollar. ","In Q3, our non-GAAP tax rate was 0.5%. As we announced on our Q2 call, our 2015 tax rate will benefit from our ability to utilize operating losses from Synageva. We incurred a one-time GAAP tax expense of approximately $316 million. This GAAP tax expense is attributable to a change in our deferred tax liability associated with the restructuring of Synageva\u2019s intellectual property into our existing structure. As a result of our continued Soliris growth and financial discipline we achieved strong Q3 non-GAAP operating income of $285 million and delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 per diluted share. ","Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.5 billion in debt. Since we authorized our share repurchase program we have to date purchased $215 million or 1.3 million shares. We currently have 785 million remaining of our $1 billion share repurchase authorization and we will continue to buy back additional shares opportunistically. ","Turning to our 2015 guidance. We continue to forecast strong Soliris volume growth in PNH and aHUS of 28% for the full year and a very small contribution from Strensiq and Kanuma. We now expect 2015 revenues to be at the lower end of our previously guided range of $2.6 billion to $2.62 billion. As a reminder, our 2015 revenue guidance includes an approximately negative 6% or $160 million foreign-exchange impact compared to 2014 exchange rates. ","In addition, due to macroeconomic factors in Latin American countries we expect an impact of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter in countries where we sell in USD which is due to local government budgetary constraints. ","As a result of our continued Soliris growth and financial discipline, we are increasing our EPS guidance for the year from the previous range of $4.70 to $4.80 to the higher and narrower range of $4.92 to $4.97 as we accelerate synergies from our Synageva acquisition. ","For the fourth quarter we anticipate revenues of $697 million to $702 million. On a sequential basis, the Q4 revenue guidance includes a $5 million to $7 million negative currency impact. Operating expenses will be sequentially higher in Q4 due to the investment in the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.12. ","In summary, we've delivered a very strong quarter. We have continued to realize accelerated acquisition related synergies earlier than expected and we are on track to realize total annual synergies of at least $150 million in 2017. ","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operation. Carsten?","Carsten Thiel","Thank you, Vikas. Our global commercial operations delivered a strong 29% volume growth year on year reflecting the underlying strength of our core Soliris business. ","Starting with PNH, the ongoing success of our diagnostic initiatives drove steady growth. We are consistently identifying a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in our core markets of the US, Europe and Japan, the territories where we have been operating the longest as well as in other key markets such as Turkey, Brazil and Russia. ","Our experience confirms our view that on a global basis the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis let alone commence appropriate treatments. In aHUS we also continue to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Matched for time, now 16 quarters from their respective approvals in the US, there are more patients actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there has been for PNH. We now see the same trend in Europe four years post approval. ","Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect that over time this trend of new patient additions will continue and perhaps even widen confirming our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than that of PNH. ","To support the aHUS community we continue to enhance our disease awareness programs further underscored by new data that will be presented at the American Society of Nephrology Meeting next week. Researchers will present findings from a long-term follow-up study that demonstrated that the TMA event rate was 3.5 times higher in patients who discontinued Soliris versus those who stayed on treatment. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of ongoing Soliris treatment in preventing life-threatening complement mediated TMA in patients with aHUS, further highlighting the importance of long-term treatment for this genetic and chronic ultra-rare disease. ","Now I would like to turn to our global metabolic launches. Starting with Kanuma, we are very pleased that the New England Journal of Medicine published our pivotal Phase 3 ARISE study in children and adults with LAL-D. Key findings showed that all patients treated with Kanuma had a reduction in liver transaminases or ALT levels which is a key marker of disease activity in liver injury. Children and adults treated with Kanuma had significant improvements in disease-related lipids and liver abnormalities compared with the placebo. ","And in addition, the accompanying editorial stated that LAL-D is a rapidly fatal condition and that enzyme replacement therapies could be lifesaving and transformational for all patients with LAL-D. The New England Journal publication and editorial will support our disease education initiatives with the LAL-D medical community. As a reminder, most patients in the ARISE study were under 18 years of age. To further support the medical community, we have launched an enhanced diagnostic pathway to optimize care for patients with LAL-D. This comprehensive yet simple diagnostic pathway guides physicians to the patients who had higher likelihood for LAL-D. For example, the new pathway will help pediatric specialists rapidly identify and diagnose children which is important because the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years. And in children liver and lipid abnormalities are more uncommon. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of LAL-D is of critical importance as 50% of patients progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver failure within just three years of symptom onset. ","Turning to Strensiq. Our HPP diagnostic pathway is also a critical element of our disease education and launch plans. The pathway is designed to help specialists recognize the key clinical manifestations of HPP and to raise awareness of low age and gender adjusted alkaline phosphatase or ALP activity as the biochemical hallmark for diagnosis. ","As we successfully roll out with PNH and aHUS, our single global metabolic field team is implementing our disease education and diagnostic programs to educate on the extreme rarity and life-threatening consequences of HPP and LAL-D. ","With the regulatory approvals of Strensiq in the US, Europe, Japan and Canada and Kanuma in Europe, our single metabolic field team will educate physicians of the transformative treatment benefits as described in each of the product labels. We expect that over time our comprehensive launch plans will lead to a rapid and accurate diagnosis, so physicians can make better informed treatment decisions. ","Turning to the timing of our in-country launches for Strensiq. We will initially launch in the US, Germany and Japan. In the US just days after the FDA approval, our nurse case managers have started to enroll initial HPP patients into OneSource and for Kanuma, our metabolic field team in Germany is also at the very early stages of launch. ","In the other major European countries, we are beginning the funding processes for Strensiq and Kanuma with healthcare authorities. We expect to begin serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of 2016 with additional countries to follow in 2017. We\u2019re committed to working with governments throughout Europe to ensure that patients with HPP and LAL-D will have access to Strensiq and Kanuma. ","In closing, the commercial organization is at the strongest point in the Alexion history. We see the majority of our growth ahead of us in our global complement franchise in both PNH and aHUS and we will leverage our ultra-rare disease expertise to serve patients with HPP and LAL-D globally. ","Now I will turn the call over to Martin who will discuss our lead R&D programs. Martin?","Martin Mackay","Thank you, Carsten. In the third quarter of 2015 we continued to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech with our portfolio of highly innovative product candidates in multiple therapeutic areas. We have several R&D catalysts to report in the fourth quarter and beyond. ","Starting with eculizumab, our three ongoing registration trials continue to progress as planned. In neurology we expect to have preliminary data in refractory myasthenia gravis in mid 2016 and they are on track to complete enrollment in the Relapsing Neuromyelitis Optica trial next year and in kidney transplant, we expect to complete enrollment in our registration trials in delayed graft function by the end of the year with preliminary data expected in 2016. ","Also, in transplant, researchers will present updated one-year data from our single arm Phase 2 study of eculizumab in the prevention of acute antibody mediated rejection or AMR in sensitized deceased donor kidney transplant recipients in a latebreaking poster session at the AFN meeting next week. In addition to eculizumab, we continue to develop a robust portfolio of innovative complement inhibitors. We advanced ALXN1210, our lead next-generation Soliris molecule which is a longer acting NTC5 antibody that is administered intravenously and suitable for monthly dosing. ","As a reminder, last quarter the US PTO granted ALXN1210 a compositional matter patent in effect until March 2035. We are completing the multiple ascending dose study of ALXN1210 and we are on track to initiate a proof of concept PNH trial by the end of the year. ","Turning to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a, we progressed our Phase 2 study in patients with gastrointestinal Graft-versus-Host Disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening autoimmune condition with significant mortality within the first 100 days post transplant. The primary outcome measure of our Phase 2 study is 28-day GI-GVHD response rate and we will present interim data from the study later this year.","Turning now to our metabolic franchise and starting with SBC-103. SBC-103 is an enzyme replacement therapy administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB or MPS IIIB, which is a rare devastating and progressive autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of NAGLU. The enzyme deficiency leads to the build-up of abnormal amounts of heparin sulfate in the brain and other organs. Patients with this systemic disease experience profound neurocognitive abnormalities, including severe cognitive decline, behavioral problems, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility and premature death. A Phase 1\/2 trial of SBC-103 is ongoing and interim data measuring three month changes from baseline and heparin sulfate levels in urine, blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid are expected this year. ","In Q3, we also completed enrollment and a natural history study to characterize the course of disease progression in patients with MPS IIIB. ","Moving to our cPMP replacement therapies for patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We have completed our planned enrollment in the bridging study and the natural history study. We now plan to initiate a pivotal study with our cPMP replacement therapy by the end of this year. ","Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on progressing our preclinical pipeline and expect four of these programs to enter the clinic next year. These include asfotase alfa, a potential treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPI may play a role; ENPP1, an enzyme replacement therapy being developed for generalized arterial calcification of infancy, or GACI, and other rare disorders of calcification; one of the mRNA rare disease programs from our collaboration with Moderna; and an additional candidate will move into the clinic from our growing complement inhibitor portfolio.","Following the global approval of Strensiq and Kanuma, we are driving toward as many as six new product or indication approvals through 2018, including at least one of our next-generation Soliris molecules. I look forward to reporting on our upcoming catalyst at our analyst day on December 10. ","I will now turn the call back to David. David?","David Hallal","Thanks, Martin. We're pleased with our performance in Q3. We are at the strongest point in our company's history. Serving patients with four devastating and ultra-rare diseases with three highly innovative therapies. In Q4, we look forward to serving more patients with PNH and aHUS while initiating the early stages of the global launches of Strensiq and Kanuma. We will also remain focused on advancing our broad pipeline so that more patients with ultra-rare diseases can have access to the transformative therapies they so desperately need. As always, we thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as we work to transform the lives of patients around the world. ","Now as I turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions, I understand that there were some technical difficulties with the webcast. We certainly apologize for that and look forward to taking your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt ","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe on Kanuma, David, could you tell us what your confidence might be in getting approvals in the US on or before the December date? And then maybe for Carsten, and I guess I didn\u2019t quite follow the slide that you have on the new diagnostic paradigm, I think it\u2019s slide 15 in your deck, could you just kind of walk us through that in a little more detail to get a sense of what the paradigm actually entails? ","David Hallal","Thanks Eric. Regarding the regulatory process as we have indicated and I addressed on the call from an FDA request we provided more CMC data to them to fulfill that request. As you know under breakthrough therapy designation and priority review we continue to have ongoing dialogue with them and they have extended the PDUFA or review period by 90 days, and as you know that we announced on September 4 that, that was bumped out from September 8 to December 8. And we are working diligently with the agency because we know that we need to get this therapy to patients who so desperately need it. Carsten on the diagnostics. ","Carsten Thiel","Sure, so on the Kanuma diagnostic pathway what you have seen on the slide is the cornerstones of this pathway is the lipid abnormalities and the liver abnormalities that are consistent with LAL-D disease. The diagnostic pathway looks at other diseases that are suspected and if specialists were to follow those it would lead not only to a misdiagnosis but also to mistreatment. Essentially in medical education that specialists recognize the urgency and importance of conducting a dry blood spot test. This is a simple test that can turn around in short time and provides a definitive answer to the correct diagnosis of LAL-D. ","David Hallal","Eric, I would just close with what Carsten and the team are really focused on is really our expertise from PNH and aHUS and now applying it on the metabolic side is just, who is it that should be tested? What is the appropriate test to be ordered and are the labs actually supplying that test and reporting it out clearly? And Carsten and the team are really focused on the right specialist to deliver that message. As he stated in the call a real focus on pediatrics. Given a national history disease reflected in the number of children and percentage of children in the registration trials for Kanuma that we believe is an enriched population for us to work on to get to those children early. Thank you. ","Operator","We will go ahead and take our next question from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan.","Anupam Rama ","Thanks so much for taking the question. I have perhaps a broader level high-level strategic pricing question. I know it\u2019s early innings but now that you are in OUS government pricing negotiation and Alexion has multiple [indiscernible] and two additional high priced orphan products which account for healthcare expenditure budget. Are governments looking at the products and indications individually and the merits of the data or are they looking at sort of maybe broader Alexion pricing negotiations and Alexion\u2019s impact on the healthcare budget?","David Hallal"," Thanks Anupam. As you know we\u2019ve really approached diseases that for a very long time there really has been no focus on them. And largely because they are highly challenging diseases and very few companies were really accepting the high risk associated with developing not just therapies that make an incremental difference but truly therapies that transform patients\u2019 lives. That's really what we're focused on. And our approach with Soliris and PNH and aHUS is very similar to now our approach with Strensiq for HPP and Kanuma for LAL-D. It really starts with one, the extreme rarity of the diseases. And you mentioned budget impact. As I think we all know in the US and in Europe there is a definition for the prevalence for an orphan disease. And it\u2019s typically around 200,000 patients with the disease. The definition for an ultra-orphan disease in the US is say 6400 patients. And when we look at the diseases in which we are focused on the numbers generally fall far lower than even that very low threshold for an ultra-orphan disease. ","When you combine that with natural history of these diseases, in PNH a third of patients die within five years of diagnosis, for aHUS 50% of patients will either die, progress to ESRD requiring dialysis or have permanent renal damage within 12 months of diagnosis. And then HPP and LAL-D as we reflected on the call the majority of the youngest patients don't live till their first birthday. And when you combine that with truly transformative benefits, that is for example with Strensiq now a 97% survival rate at 48 weeks compared to 42 % for historical control patients. And then 100% of the juvenile onset HPP patients had a response to treatment and a variety of different measures of mobility and growth and bone healing. And so when we combine all of that it gives us great confidence that just like we have experienced with Soliris and PNH and aHUS it is a long process. It takes time country by country but the underpinning of our approach of delivering true transformation has ultimately resulted in successful reimbursement discussions and we would expect it to be no different now for Strensiq and Kanuma as we move country by country across Europe.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Cyrus calling in for Matt. So can you detail some of these macroeconomic Latin America problems that you mentioned and are your currency expectations for the fourth quarter then be similar to third quarter and what are you expecting for currency for next year?","Vikas Sinha","Thank you for that question. This is Vikas, trying to respond to your questions. If you look at the macro-economic situation in Latin America in Q3, you can see that the impact on most of the currencies and the countries have been significant in Q3 and that flows into Q4. And I just want to talk through this a little bit because if you look at the currency impact and the guidance that we gave around $160 million earlier and that continues till now, we\u2019ve maintained that $160 million currency impact going into Q4. Where you see in Latin American countries, some of them we also sell in US dollar, so what\u2019s happened is they make budget \u2013 their own local budgets in local currencies and so you do get into constraints and we work with the governments to find solution around that. Now these things are not new to us because if you think through this, having a two-thirds of your business globally, we kind of see this happening in one country or the other once in a while. So if you go back and look at 2014 we saw that in Russia, over one or two quarters, we did feel the pain and then we found solutions around 2015 and we move forward. So we will see this thing going forward. ","Now, the other question, the last question that part of the question was impact of currency going into 2016. Yes, a large proportion, so we always hedge 50% of our currency on the major currencies that we deal with, other 50% is unhedged. But the hedge rates continue to drop and come towards closer to the market rate over a period. I will give a better view of that towards the analyst day and as we give the guidance for 2016. ","David Hallal","And then I would just add, as Vikas pointed to the situation in Russia for us last year, the strength of our global core business is vital across our 50-country operating platform and that enables us to continue to produce strong volume growth and overcome country by country issues that may present themselves. ","Operator","And we can go ahead and take our next question from Matt Roden with UBS.","Matt Roden ","Martin, I was wondering if we could turn this towards the pipeline a little bit. So first, can you talk about the agenda a little bit for the December 10 analyst meeting? Is this the right forum to disclose preliminary data for 103 and 1007, and is there anything else in particular we should be looking out for? And then I guess more specifically when we think about 103, I suppose the preliminary analysis is going to have a PK\/PD component. So just wondering your thoughts on how important the bio distribution is of the organ [ph] and the heparin sulfate reductions, I guess I am just coming from the angle that it seems logical that you want to see an effect in the CNS. So I guess just big picture, just trying to see what we should expect from the analyst meeting from a pipeline perspective and specifically what kind of data would give you a lot of confidence that 103 is going to be transformative?","Martin Mackay","Thank you, David and many thanks Matt for a pipeline question. We\u2019ve been now looking forward to these. In terms of analyst day, I think it\u2019d really be \u2013 I must say an excellent set of presentations and as you allude to, we\u2019d be looking to give updates on the catalysts that we mentioned on the call. So 103, 1007, but also give just more of a feel than you can give in a call for the other aspects of the pipeline, the complement inhibitor portfolio, the growing metabolic franchise, our portfolio that we have and then some things on the first in humans that we rolled out and to start in 2016. So I think it will be a full \u2013 I am slightly biased -- but enjoyable agenda. ","In terms of your question on SBC-103, I think it\u2019s a really great question actually and how we look at this, and again the part answer was in your question about where we expect to see things. As you know just to take half a step backwards, there are three doses in the study with 11 patients at 0.3, 1 and 3 milligrams per kilogram and certainly looking at heparin sulfate levels across all of those doses in the CNS, urine and serum and as you correctly allude to, the brain is clearly a key component of this disease. I mentioned the neuro-cognitive decline, neuro-degeneration occurs. So clearly if we were able to see dose dependent results in the cerebrospinal fluid, that would be something that would excite us before planning future studies in this disease. Hopefully that answers both your questions, Matt.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from Chris Raymond with Raymond James.","Chris Raymond ","And just on Kanuma and the LAL-D diagnostic pathway, our checks a while back indicated that the use of the dry blood spot assay was still fairly minimal among the physician community. And I am just kind of curious that on Slide 15 which I think you talked through in detail, on a previous question, just curious is it \u2013 from your view now that you\u2019ve had some time working on this pathway, is adoption and awareness of this assay one of the bigger opportunities you see to improve the diagnostic pathway or are there some other variables maybe that you are focusing on more than that?","David Hallal","No, thanks Chris. Carsten will take it on. I just \u2013 from the early experience that we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s following the trend that we observed very early on with PNH back in 2006 and 2007 and then later with aHUS in 2010, 2011 just before the first approval and then afterward which is very very significant educational gap due to the very very low awareness of the disease, always driven by the extreme rarity of the disease, and also having nothing you could do about the disease really, because in each area in which we pursue there is generally standard of care which isn\u2019t really improving outcomes to a great extent. Carsten, specifically on LAL-D?","Carsten Thiel","I think, David, just the two things that I would like to add is this diagnostic pathway has been designed very successfully with experts in the field, it is robust and easy to understand for the different specialties. I think the important angle as we touched upon earlier is that it is really relevant for our pediatric patients. And why, because there\u2019s got to be a sense of urgency in diagnosing those patients fast and accurately because the mortality in that patient population is so high. ","David Hallal","And I would just add one more point, Chris, is that our checks are pretty consistent with yours. As we engage with physicians there is that very significant knowledge gap on how to test, how to test which is the dry blood spot test, and even which labs offer that test, and that\u2019s what Carsten and the team are very focused on early in the launch planning with our disease and diagnostic initiatives. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from the Ying Huang with Bank of America. ","Ying Huang ","First of all, I have question on Kanuma because you just started early stage launch in Germany. Can you give us an idea of the launch pricing in Germany? And then secondly, on the second gen follow up program for Soliris. Are we going to expect to see data from ALXN1210 at ASH this year? And Martin, it seems you haven\u2019t talked about ALXN5500, where that\u2019s in the clinic and then just one more question on aHUS, I am glad that obviously at the same time you are seeing more patients for aHUS in therapy but can you talk about the net revenue per patient for aHUS and how does that compare to PNH?","David Hallal","Ying, that was from one question. But so why don\u2019t I answer just the last one first and then we will go to Martin and Vikas on Kanuma pricing in Germany and then the next generation programs with 1210 and 5500. The simple answer of the last question on aHUS is as you know the adult dosing is higher than that of the PNH dosing but there are five dose cohorts, that\u2019s where we first gained our experience with dose by weight and the youngest patients with aHUS actually consumed about 20% of the dose that the adults would consume \u2013 and again paediatrics are heavily involved in aHUS. So when you blend it all together the average per patient is very similar to that of our PNH experience. Martin, since we are on complement do you want to take on 1210 and 5500? And then Vikas can talk about Germany.","Martin Mackay","Yes, I heard two parts to the questions, question, Ying, one on 1210, I will start there and then go on to 5500. As we alluded to in the text, we have completed our single ascending dose study and we will be looking to and talk about those data this year. The multiple ascending dose study is again as you know ongoing and we will be looking at those data early next year and of course we intend to start the first in patient study in 2015, by the end of the year and therefore we will be looking at data in 2016 for those patients also. ","In terms of 5500, it\u2019s still a very much part of our cadre of our complement inhibitors and as I think both data that I alluded to, we\u2019ve now got this growing portfolio of complement inhibitors both in the C5 area with 1210 but other parts of the complement pathway which is really growing in our hands, I must say 1007 is obviously one that we talk about on a regular basis both in gastrointestinal graft versus host disease and antiphospho lipid syndrome. So the case of talking more about 1210 is simply it\u2019s our lead program, it furthers ahead in terms of the next generation Soliris molecule and we will be looking at to publish data set met and patient data over the next period. ","David Hallal","Great, and then for the third part of, Ying, single question, Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Ying, regarding the Kanuma price in Germany, as you know, in Germany when you launch it at this time you still have to go through the discussion with EMA over time. But we would give a much better view at the US launch but just for your knowledge, we are looking at annual cost of Kanuma to be very similar to Strensiq.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham","Just have a couple here. One for Martin and one for either Vikas or David. So for Martin, for cPMP I know you guys have breakthrough, I just wanted to get a better sense for maybe the size, scope of the pivotal study and would you view as clinically meaningful? And then for Vikas and David, you guys \u2013 you haven\u2019t had a supply disruption from the 43 of the warning letter and I wanted to get a sense for, now that you have two additional products, what is the update on manufacturing and what\u2019s the risk that you could ride into some supply constraints going forward?","Martin Mackay","Thank you, David and thanks, Geoff. In terms of molybdenum program, as David mentioned a couple of times about the ultra-rare arena we work in, and that\u2019s certainly the case for molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A. It\u2019s a very rare, very ultra-rare disease and therefore and specific answer to your question, this will be a small number of patients enrolled in the pivotal study and having completed the bridging study we are looking to start that study by the end of the year. There are really a small numbers of patients involved. ","And then the second part of your question, in terms of the regulatory pathway, again as David alluded to really well, these are poorly understood diseases with no path in front of us. We are certainly benefitting from the breakthrough therapy designation in that we are having highly interactive discussions with regulators, not only in the US but also in Europe to really define what these primary endpoints and important secondary endpoints will be in this truly devastating disease. Hopefully that helps, Geoff. ","David Hallal","And then Geoff, regarding supply, we really have an expanding global manufacturing network where our objective is redundancy in the system from both drug through fill and finish, and right out to labeling and packaging. And one of the objectives for Julie has been obviously to bring more of those capabilities in-house. As you know we\u2019ve announced expansion of our manufacturing facilities in Ireland which we are very excited about. In addition to that, it\u2019s just been a continuous focus under Julie\u2019s leadership on the best talent in the industry, industry leading quality systems and continuing to invest in our facilities which we think is represented by some of our announcements around CapEx in this area recently.","Operator","And we will go ahead and take our next question from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn ","Maybe just I know you don\u2019t want to give 2016 guidance yet at this point. But as we think about Soliris any new or different growth drivers that we should consider outside of FX as we consider 2016? And then with respect to SG&A, just wondering maybe Vikas, if you could help us think about leverage and timing of leverage coming on. ","Vikas Sinha","So Terence, the way to look at this is if you look at 2015 SG&A expenses, right, and you should literally focus on the percentage of sales in the second half because first half did not have the Synageva integrated into us. And when you start looking at that, we are somewhere around 27%, 26% levels. We expect to continue at the same percentage level going into next year primarily because we have to invest in making the metabolic franchise a success. And we\u2019ve got to put our full power behind Strensiq and Kanuma. So that\u2019s how we are thinking about SG&A next year. And the leverage will start coming as the sales of these drugs start coming into model over the years. ","Carsten Thiel","So Terence, for 2016 we really expect to identify a consistent number of patients, newly diagnosed patients on PNH and aHUS. And as we have mentioned earlier in the call, our view is that the majority of the opportunity both for PNH as well as for aHUS lies ahead of us. ","Terence Flynn ","Maybe can I just ask one on the pipeline quickly. Just wondering if you guys can maybe help frame success for 1007 for us at the interim, what are you looking to see?","Martin Mackay","Very simply, now we are looking at the overall acute GVHD response at day 28, the primary endpoint, as you know, it\u2019s an open label study, so we will be able to see those data in that timeframe. And I hasten to add that it\u2019s obviously our preliminary readout at that stage. ","Terence Flynn ","Is there a specific threshold to response do you want to see?","Martin Mackay","We always go into those studies with specific responses that we look for, but again I hasten to add, this is a preliminary readout, so it would be premature to state exactly given the number of patients we will look at that time. We will be in a much better position when we complete the study.","David Hallal","And the good news is Terence, we have a readout between now and the end of the year which is just a few weeks. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll go ahead and take our last question from Brian Skorney with Robert W. Baird. ","Unidentified Analyst","This is Mina [ph] in for Brian. I have a question about the Moderna program. I know you said that it would be moving into the clinic next year. Do you have any other updates on that? Could you kind of walk us through a little bit more on how that program is progressing? And then a little bit about for Strensiq, I know in the call last week you talked a little bit about the lift between some of the younger patients and the older patients. What do you think will ultimately play out in terms of the patient age, the average age of patients on the drug?","David Hallal","Sure, Martin, on Moderna?","Martin Mackay","Yes, thank you, David and thank you for the questions. Again without going into specific details of either the indication or the approaches here, we\u2019ve currently got seven programs in the research engine and we aim for one of those seven to go into the clinic in 2016. But then others will follow in due course. Similarly prior to that seven that we are working on, we have another cadre of programs that we are looking at to assess their suitability for messenger RNA therapeutics. Overall I can see that the collaboration is going exceedingly well. We have a highly interactive collaboration with Moderna folks up in Cambridge. We have a laboratory very close at there and so far it\u2019s just been a marvellous experience working with those, we are working with Moderna. ","David Hallal","Yes, and it\u2019s gratifying to see as we build out our global metabolic franchise with the two new product launches this year with Strensiq and Kanuma. Six of the seven first preclinical programs from Moderna are in the metabolic setting and again Martin will share a little bit more about the collaboration at analyst day. ","Turning back to the Strensiq question, as we \u2013 by the way you said last week, it was this week but I agree it\u2019s kind of felt like a very long week for many of us. But this week as we mentioned given the clinical trial experience across multiple multi-national trials and also the very early experience we\u2019ve had in Japan, in Germany, our expectation is that a very very high proportion of patients initiating Strensiq treatment will be infants and young children, and we believe that the typical patient weight across the population is likely to be in the 20 to 25 kilogram range. Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","And that was our last question, and this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Irving Adler, Executive Director of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Irving Adler","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the second quarter of 2014 and our outlook for the rest of the year. Today's call will be led by Dr. Leonard Bell, our Chief Executive Officer.","Lenny will be joined by members of Alexion management: Vikas Sinha, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; David Hallal, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Martin MacKay, Executive Vice President and Global Head of R&D; Steve Squinto, Executive Vice President and Chief Global Operations Officer; and Saqib Islam, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. Description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements apply only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after this call.","I'd also like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP operating results are adjusted from our U.S. GAAP operating results for certain items that we described in our press release issued this morning. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release.","Thank you. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thank you, Irving. In the second quarter, the global Alexion team continued to advance our commercial, clinical and operational objectives for 2014. During the quarter, our commercial organization provided Soliris to an increasing number of new patients across our operations in both PNH and aHUS worldwide. Our development teams continue to reach significant milestones in our lead programs, highlighted by particular progress with our next product, asfotase alfa. In Europe, our marketing application for asfotase alfa was accepted and granted accelerated assessment. In the United States, where we have already received breakthrough therapy designation, we have now submitted 2 of the 3 components of our rolling BLA. And as reflected in our financial performance during the second quarter and the upward revisions in our guidance announced today, we continue to execute on our initiatives to achieve long-term operational and financial efficiencies.","Turning first to our global commercial operation. We continue to see the majority of our growth ahead of us in both PNH and aHUS as our disease education initiatives help physicians to optimize patient care worldwide.","In PNH, newly diagnosed patients continue to make up the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris across our territories. In aHUS, we continue to add new patients in United States and Europe, as well as in Japan where we are in our first full year of our launch. The ongoing strength of the early stages of the global launch in aHUS further reinforces our confidence that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and perhaps larger.","As we consistently serve more patients with Soliris in our 2 current therapeutic areas, we are also rapidly building our capabilities to support a multiproduct portfolio. In parallel with our current registration activities with asfotase alfa, we are simultaneously driving our initiatives to support robust launches in United States and Europe in early 2015. In Q2, we deployed initial field-based medical teams in the U.S. and Western Europe to start educating physicians on the signs and symptoms of HPP.","We continue to make progress toward our anticipated series of as many as 7 new indication or product approvals through 2018. In addition to our next product, asfotase alfa, Soliris for AMR and DGF in kidney transplant and for both NMO and MG; our third product, cPMP, for infants with MoCD Type A; and we expect approval of one or more of our next-generation follow-on products to Soliris within the same period.","Turning briefly to manufacturing and following our continued improvements in our Rhode Island manufacturing and quality operations, earlier this year, we submitted our request for inspection to the FDA and we are awaiting their reinspection.","Looking at our financial performance. We are pleased that we achieved strong 38% growth in revenues in Q2 compared to the year ago quarter. We also continue to demonstrate strong operational leverage as we reported 53% growth in non-GAAP EPS in this quarter compared to the year ago quarter.","Looking forward, and based on our strong revenue performance anticipated for the year, we are raising our revenue guidance from the previous range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion now to the higher range of $2.18 billion $2.2 billion. And we are also now raising our 2014 guidance for non-GAAP EPS from the previous range of $4.75 to $4.85 now to the higher range of $4.90 to $5.05.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance in Q2, as well as our expectations for the remainder of 2014. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Lenny. The second quarter was another period of profitable growth and continued operating leverage. In Q2, net sales increased to $512.5 million or 38% above the year ago quarter despite an unfavorable currency headwind of approximately $5 million year-on-year and $3 million sequentially. Our sales performance reflects strong volume growth across all our territory. Non-GAAP EPS in Q2 increased 53% to $1.12, reflecting the efficiencies we are experiencing as we continue the global introduction of Soliris in 2 indications on our existing global platform.","As a reminder, to compare sequential quarter growth, our Q1 2014 revenues were $479 million excluding $88 million in revenue associated with shipments of Soliris in France before 2014.","Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.59 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During Q2, we experienced strong positive cash flow from operations, primarily offset by a approximately $156 million in share repurchases. The primary objective of our ongoing stock repurchase program is to mitigate the natural pace of stock dilution from equity grant.","Turning to guidance. We are pleased to be increasing our 2014 forecast for both sales and EPS as announced this morning. Strong performance in both PNH and aHUS across our territories enables us to raise sales guidance from the previous range of $2.15 billion to $2.17 billion, now to the higher range of $2.18 billion to $2.2 billion.","With this increase in revenue guidance, we are maintaining our current expense guidance in the areas of COGS, R&D, SG&A and taxes. Within this unchanged expense guidance, we expect to experience higher expenses in the second half compared to the first half due to the ramp-up of development programs and our ongoing infrastructure buildup as we prepare for the launch of HPP.","With increased revenue -- revenues and tightly controlled expenses, we have raised 2014 guidance for non-GAAP EPS from the previous range of $4.75 to $4.85, now to the higher range of $4.95 to $5.05.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to David. David?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Vikas. During Q2, we achieved strong Soliris in-quarter revenue growth of 38% over the year ago quarter. This reflects continued steady growth in PNH globally and the early progress of our ongoing aHUS launch.","Looking first at PNH during Q2. We were pleased with our steady performance in our core territories of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan, and we also continue to observe consistent growth in serving new patients in Turkey, Brazil and Russia. In all territories, including those where we have operated the longest, we consistently observe that the majority of patients with PNH newly starting on Soliris were also newly diagnosed. The steady identification of newly diagnosed patients and the ongoing uptake of Soliris in PNH reflect the ongoing positive impact of our disease awareness and diagnostic initiative. While awareness of PNH has increased significantly over time, more education is required to further enhance the understanding of PNH and appropriate testing of higher-risk patients. Our experience supports our belief that, on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.","In aHUS, the transformative clinical benefits of Soliris for patients with this devastating disease are reflected in the ongoing steady uptake of Soliris in the early stages of our launch.","The overall value proposition with Soliris is clearly recognized by public and private reimbursement authorities in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan. During Q2, we were very pleased with important updates in U.S. and EU Soliris labels with regard to aHUS.","In the U.S., the FDA converted our accelerated approval in aHUS to a full regular approval. The revised U.S. and European labels now specify important longer-term clinical benefits associated with chronic and sustained Soliris treatment with inclusion of results from 2 years of ongoing treatment, which will enhance and broaden our educational initiatives.","I would like to highlight a few key points from the revised labels. First, the longer-term data from our original registration trial, now 2 years, demonstrated that sustained Soliris treatment resulted in significant and continuous improvements in renal function over time. Second, the data from our original registration studies show that 28% of patients who deviated from the approved Soliris dosing experienced life-threatening TMA within 12 weeks of their first missed dose. In contrast, the patients who remained on sustained therapy through 2 years had complete inhibition of complement-mediated TMA. Third, with the addition of the new prospective trials, the updated labels now include positive data with Soliris as first-line intervention in adult and pediatric patients with aHUS. Fourth, we now have data in our label from the first prospective clinical trial in pediatric aHUS patients. Of 22 patients in this trial, 11 were on dialysis prior to treatment with Soliris and 9 of them or 82% were able to eliminate dialysis. And finally, across the 5 trials now included in the labels, responses to Soliris treatment were transformative in patients with or without mutations.","The additional clinical data in our U.S. and European labels will significantly enhance our commercial efforts over time as we educate physicians on the immediate and long-term benefits of sustained Soliris treatment.","We also continue to make strong progress in Western European countries and remain confident that we will further extend our aHUS launch across the EMEA region in 2014. Following the agreement with France earlier this year, we now look forward to completing the reimbursement process in England and Italy. In the interim, both countries continue to provide funded access to treatment for patients with aHUS.","Beyond the U.S. and EMEA, we made steady progress in our Japan aHUS launch in Q2. We continued to ramp up our disease education and diagnostic initiatives to hematologists and nephrologists and look forward to a steady uptake of Soliris for aHUS patients in Japan as the first year of launch progresses.","Globally, the ongoing strength in the early stages of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is, at least, as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and perhaps larger. As one measure, we continue to observe that, matched for time since their respective approvals, more patients in the U.S. are currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. In Europe, we are starting to observe a similar trend in the earlier stages of our aHUS launch. These results in the U.S. and Europe support our belief that the incidence of aHUS is higher than the incidence of PNH.","Beyond our current commercial operations, I would like to now turn to our preparations for the launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, for patients with hypophosphatasia or HPP. Importantly, in addition to the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation, feedback from the physician community confirms our view that there is a strong need for a transformative therapy for patients with HPP.","In Q2, we continued to deploy our initial field-based medical teams in the U.S. and Western Europe, and we are now hiring our in-country metabolic commercial teams. We are leveraging our learnings and expertise in PNH and aHUS to best serve patients with HPP, and our initial market research suggests that low disease awareness typically results in misdiagnosis. Thus, HPP patients often go for years without receiving an accurate diagnosis.","An early goal of our commercial plan will be to optimize patient care by educating physicians on the signs and symptoms of HPP and appropriate pathways for rapid and accurate diagnosis.","Beyond planning for the launch of asfotase alfa, we continue to establish commercial teams to assess and plan for our opportunities in AMR, DGF, NMO, MG and the next-generation Soliris molecules. These teams will work closely with our R&D colleagues as they advance these programs through the development process.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Thanks, David. I am pleased to provide an update on our lead development programs as we drive toward our goal of achieving up to 7 new indications or product approvals through 2018.","Looking first at asfotase alfa in the U.S. We filed the second of the 3 components of our rolling BLA submission. We remain on track to complete the submission in the fall as we look to build a strong label to serve patients with HPP. In Europe, our MAA was accepted and granted accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency. In Japan, we expect to file our dossier for asfotase alfa before year end. We are pleased with our discussions with regulators in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Our goal in all territories is to work collaboratively with regulatory authorities to obtain marketing authorization for asfotase alfa as quickly as possible.","As we proceed with our regulatory filings, we continue to build the growing body of clinical data reflecting the devastating nature of HPP and the potentially transformative impact of asfotase alfa for patients. In May, researchers presented new data from a large retrospective natural history study of patients with perinatal and infantile HPP that showed approximately 70% mortality with supportive care reported at 3 years.","Additionally, data from the extension phase of 2 ongoing Phase II clinical studies showed early and sustained improvement in all outcome measures in infants, children and juveniles with HPP receiving asfotase alfa for up to 3 years. These additional long-term safety and efficacy data support the life-transforming potential of asfotase alfa for HPP patients. And finally, the natural history study in juveniles with HPP is ongoing and is expected to be completed in the fall, which will enable us to finalize our rolling submission for the U.S. BLA.","Turning to our development programs with eculizumab, I would like to look first at antibody-mediated rejection or AMR in kidney transplant patients. We have now completed enrollment and dosing in both our living-donor and deceased-donor studies. In our program in delayed graft function, or DGF, we expect to enroll the first patient in a single multinational registration trial in the third quarter. This will be a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of eculizumab for the prevention of DGF after kidney transplantation in adults at increased risk of DGF.","In our neurology programs with eculizumab, enrollment and dosing is ongoing in our registration trial in relapsing neuromyelitis optica or NMO, a life-threatening ultra-rare neurologic disorder. We have also now started dosing patients in our registration study in refractory myasthenia gravis or MG, a rare debilitating neurologic disorder caused by uncontrolled complement activation. In Q2, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to eculizumab for the treatment of patients with MG. And in Europe, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products issued a positive opinion on the ODD for eculizumab in MG.","Finally, with regard to life cycle management of Soliris. We expect to initiate clinical studies with 2 next-generation Soliris molecules in 2014 with another molecule at an earlier stage of development.","Beyond eculizumab and asfotase alfa, we also have lead development programs with 2 additional highly innovative therapies, cPMP and ALXN1007. In our metabolic disease area, we continue to accelerate the development of our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A. The synthetic cPMP switch study in patients with MoCD is ongoing. We are also continuing our retrospective data collection and enrollment in our natural history study.","With regard to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, we have commenced screening in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in patients with a rare autoimmune disorder called antiphospholipid syndrome or APS. This open-label Phase II study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALXN1007. As previously announced, we also expect to commence the next proof-of-concept clinical study in another severe and ultra-rare disorder later this year.","Beyond our current late-stage clinical development program, we continue to make progress on the first 2 targeted early-stage preclinical projects as part of our exclusive strategic agreement with Moderna for the discovery and development of messenger RNA therapeutics to treat patients with rare diseases.","As we look to the second half of 2014, we are well on the way toward the 10 or more development milestones we expect to reach in our programs this year. To achieve these clinical development goals, a seasoned team leader is assigned to each program with a dedicated core team made up of all the necessary functions to ensure parallel progress of our programs in a timely and effective fashion.","We plan to continue enhancing our R&D capabilities through disciplined research collaborations, licensing and acquisitions. Our focus remains on developing therapeutic candidates with life-transforming potential for patients with severe and life-threatening diseases.","I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Martin. Throughout the remainder of 2014, we will build on our accomplishments to date as we seek to transform the lives of more patients with PNH and aHUS and advance the global registration for asfotase alfa in HPP. As always, we thank our employees for their dedication to our mission as we work to transform the lives of patients.","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now turn the question-and-answer portion of our call over. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Schmidt of Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe for Martin. With the 2 kidney transplant trials complete, looking at AMR -- complete in terms of their enrollment, when might we expect the data? And what do you think are the next steps post receipt of those results?","Martin MacKay","Thank you, Eric. As you know, the primary endpoint is treatment failure at 9 weeks at post transplantation, looking at number of endpoints. Clearly, the key piece here for the trial will be 12 months' results and we will get those towards the second half of 2015. As you may imagine, we're in regular discussions now with regulatory authorities and that will help inform the next step once we see the data from those studies.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Is there, do you think, a hurdle that you need to surpass in order to potentially file on these studies [ph]?","Martin MacKay","I don't see it so much a hurdle, Eric, as it will be dependent on the results that we achieve from the studies. Clearly, the 9-week point will be informative. It will be only after we see the 1-year data that we'll really know how to proceed.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","But at 1 year, do you think you need to hit a certain efficacy level and what might that be?","Martin MacKay","We certainly need to hit on efficacy level. I wouldn't describe that particularly at this time, but yes, we do expect to hit on efficacy level. As you know, post transplantation, we're looking at antibody-mediated rejection, graft loss, patient death and then lost to follow-up. So key endpoints will help inform the progress here.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On asfotase, I know you guys have talked about in the U.S, the regulatory -- the FDA seems the one agnostic to age when you look at the potential label. So a couple of questions: one, would you expect the EU and Japanese regulators to have a similar view? And then two, what would be some of the reimbursement challenges when you look at sort of adult versus peds for asfotase?","Leonard Bell","Martin?","Martin MacKay","Yes, I'll take the first part of the question, Geoff, and then pass on to David. I wouldn't actually describe it as agnostic to age. Onset is very important here and that was an outcome of continuing discussions with the regulators as we understand the development and the pathophysiology of hypophosphatasia better. As you know, the breakthrough designation is for perinatal, infants and juvenile, which span the pediatric population. David?","David L. Hallal","Yes, I would just say, Geoff, when I think about reimbursement, I think the implications of the approach that we're taking is -- what will be key for funding is when patients had their first symptoms of disease as opposed to how old they are. And I think that, that was what was particularly pleasing for us when we look at the progress that we were making. So we think that, that will be important. And then in terms of reimbursement, in general, for asfotase in HPP, it will be similar to PNH and aHUS and that will be reimbursement authorities having a clear understanding of the devastating nature of the disease and then the value proposition of our product, in this case, asfotase.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","David, could you talk a little bit more about the aHUS indication? First, your comments about the label were very interesting, and what do you think is the incremental potential in either patients or adoption from the changes in the label? And then could you comment a little bit more detail about where you are in the European launches? And then are you well at this point to start talking about nearly diagnosed proportions of patients, so is it virtually all the patients going on aHUS are newly diagnosed? Related questions.","David L. Hallal","No, no. They're very good questions, Geoff. So first in terms of the label, both the label updates in the U.S. and Europe, we would expect to see impact over time. We don't think it's necessarily an immediate turn on, but it is an important part of our commercial approach. If you think about the 5 points that I mentioned during the call, it really helps us upstream in terms of helping to achieve a more rapid diagnosis for patients as I was reflecting the impact of patients with or without a mutation is very important, as well as the new prospective trials that included patients that went right to Soliris before even receiving one session of plasma exchange. And then more importantly, the labels initially only had 6 months of efficacy data in them. And now to demonstrate the complete inhibition of TMA through a 2-year treatment period and continued and sustained improvements in renal function over that time is going to make a meaningful impact for us. As physicians, were looking toward that longer-term data. In terms of Europe, we really made a lot of progress, as you know, beginning second half of last year. Early in 2013, we brought in full reimbursement for all of Germany. Second half of the year, we started to see the interim program in England, funding for patients in Belgium and the Netherlands and then the interim program in Italy. National funding in Spain now translating into regional funding on an individual level slowly over time. So we're very pleased with the progress. And as I mentioned during the call, we're now seeing the same dynamic in Europe as we've observed in the U.S. when we look at -- matching for time, with the respective launches of aHUS and PNH, it's confirming our belief in the size of that opportunity. The final piece -- I'm sorry, Geoff, the final piece about newly diagnosed patients? This is an incidence-based disease. We continue to see that the majority of patients we add are generally rapidly and newly diagnosed.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I'm just going to ask a little bit about 1007. So you started your trial in antiphospholipid syndrome. Just can you help me understand why was the indication selected? How big is the opportunity? I mean, when can we see data from this trial? And I guess, you commented that we'll be hearing more about other indications.","Martin MacKay","Okay. Thank you, Robyn. I counted out 2 or 3 questions in there. Clearly, this is a proof-of-concept study of this novel, anti-inflammatory antibody, which we feel the mechanism is suited to APS. Hence, doing the study, and as you correctly see, we are preparing to launch another study with this antibody in another severe disease shortly, actually, over the next period where we'll be looking at that. Does that capture 2 of your questions?","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Well, how many indications of APS -- like do you have any -- give us any details on the market, I'm just not that familiar with the indications.","Martin MacKay","I'll say a little bit about the indication and then pass to David to say something. In terms of those indications, what we do know is it's a devastating -- a rare disease, which is very much coincident with our strategy in research and development as will be the next indication that we take actually with this novel antibody. David?","David L. Hallal","Yes, I would just say, Robyn, APS, in general, is a bit larger than what we focus on. But we're looking at those patients, for example, that are anticoagulant-resistant APS patients. And there has been some experience out there with those patients with the catastrophic form of the disease as well.","Robyn Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And do you know when we could get data? Any sense of, I guess, if there are more patients needed to enroll?","Martin MacKay","Really a little early to say, Robyn. We've started screening in the program now, a site activation. And we'll have a better idea when we start recruiting patients, but it will not be anytime soon.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Raymond of Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just to follow up on one of the previous ones. Clearly, these additions to the label and I got what you were saying about how the duration of treatment in aHUS is going to sort of contribute over time. But there has been a lot of dust, I think, kicked up recently about really what the duration is. I think, there's some anecdotal reports of patients coming off therapy perhaps prematurely. Can you maybe give us what you're seeing explicitly, the dynamics maybe overall in terms of duration in aHUS and these discontinuations? And then also maybe on the COGS line, I know last quarter was a little bit of an anomaly. You had some inventory adjustments that's helped COGS, but this quarter was also, I think, much better than we anticipated. Can you sort of talk about what's going on there?","Leonard Bell","David?","David L. Hallal","Yes. Thanks, Chris. So as we've noted in past calls, generally the compliance for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of aHUS is typically good, but less than what we've historically observed with PNH. And as I mentioned during the call, and you certainly did in your question, the new 2-year clinical data in the labels we think really provides physicians greater visibility into not just the immediate, and I think that, that is what you're pertaining to. The patients are presenting in an urgent medical state and physicians are actually looking to almost pull those patients out of that state to save them and not necessarily thinking about long-term impact of continuous improvement in renal function. And as I've stated, in our label -- and actually I think there's a few series that corroborate that. Somewhere between 28% and 33% of patients, very rapidly have a return of life-threatening TMA. And what we do know from the data is that there is a 33% to 40% risk of ESRD or death in patients with their very first TMA. So each one is truly feared. I think what physicians are asking, however, is because other TMAs, whether or not it's STEC-HUS or TTP, have typically have been viewed as shorter-term diseases. Our educational efforts are really focused on the genetic, lifelong nature of aHUS, and it is a distinctly different TMA that requires sustained treatment. So we see it evolving over time and we do think that these updated data in the labels are going to help us quite a bit. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Chris, on the question on COGS, we feel that 8% would be more sustainable at this time. Because as we established our operations in Ireland and validated our x U.S. production last -- late last year, we have benefit on the royalty payments that led to reduction in the COGS in Q2 and also in Q1. Q1 also had onetime impact from a settlement, but Q2 was more of a clean quarter. So taking 8% going forward is more reasonable.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm going to ask you question that I doubt you can give a direct comment to, but if you can sort of shed some light on your thinking it would be helpful. If you look at the clinical benefit you guys have with Soliris in both PNH and aHUS, obviously, very significant, particularly as it pertains to the impact you have on the natural history of those diseases. You've now generated that type of data, as well, in HPP. And so the question is, do you think that the HPP asfotase alfa confers as much value to the health care systems as you have with Soliris in your existing segment?","Leonard Bell","David?","David L. Hallal","Yes -- no. It's a really, really good question. Like PNH and aHUS, HPP, clearly, is a severe ultra-rare life-threatening condition. We recently presented new data that detail the devastating nature of HPP and treatment effect of asfotase alfa in infants, young children and juveniles at the Pediatric Academic Societies meeting up in Vancouver. The natural history study in infants and young children really details the devastating nature of the disease with a 29% survival rate at 3 years from diagnosis and median time to death was less than one year. And yet, in the separate, single arm investigational trial with asfotase in infants and young children, approximately 90% of the clinical subject actually survived at 3 years. So you just juxtapose natural history of disease and the absence of asfotase and then our infantile onset trial, I think that actually highlights quite a bit how we'll be leveraging the data once we're approved and seeking reimbursement from government authorities.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Friedman of Morgan Stanley.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just on -- in terms of work that you guys are doing on follow-on complement programs, the TT30 study -- clinical trials was listed as terminated due to inability to reach enrollment a little bit to go. But just wondering if you can discuss what was going on in that study and, as you think about developing follow-on programs, is the strategy to head into indications that you're already in? Or is it to look beyond to other complement-related disease?","Leonard Bell","Martin?","Martin MacKay","Okay. Thank you, David. I'll comment on the broader part of your question first and then get back briefly to TT30. As you may imagine, our objective here is to outcompete ourselves. Soliris is a terrific medicine and hence our plans in terms of next-generation molecules we will start 2 clinical studies with these next-generation molecules this year, and in fact, we have a third coming up on the reels [ph] of it were also as part of this next generation. It's fair to say that we're looking at a number of other approaches so that we can satisfy patients, satisfy the indications that we care about that are ultra-rare and devastating. And I really think our next-generation programs are on track to do this. Specifically around, TT30, any program and any molecule needs to be looked as a single case and to what that molecule can do in the indications that you're interested in. And hence, in this case, with TT30, as you correctly say, from ClinicalTrials.gov, we've stopped that program. But please know the other programs are moving ahead with gusto.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just any color as to was the enrollment related to, I guess, the perceived efficacy of that molecule in that indication? Or there is something more broadly about trying to enroll studies in indications that are already well served with a good drug.","Martin MacKay","Yes, in any development program, David, there's always multiple things going on, as you know, to come up with a medicine, whether it's dosage, whether it's the right indication, whether it's access to the target, mechanism and so on and so forth, and you weigh all of those up in any decision whether to progress with molecules or to terminate, as the case in TT30.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Liang of Leerink.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about the differences between the packages that you're submitting to the EU and the U.S. regulatory authorities for AA and whether that could result in a different scope for the label?","Martin MacKay","Just briefly, Howard, as you know, the U.S. and EU regulatory authorities are different and often demand different things into the submissions that you work on. I think it's fair to say in all the cases to date with hypophosphatasia and asfotase alfa, we've really been very pleased with our discussions in the EU. And as you know, from this morning, the MAA has been submitted and accepted with acceleration granted and will now follow EMA time lines. In the U.S., 2 of the 3 of the rolling BLA sections were submitted in March and June and the final clinical section will be in the fall, and obviously, we have the juvenile natural history study, which is still running and will be part of that submission. So really going ahead with good progress in both of those, and of course, I wouldn't leave out Japan also, which we expect to file by year end. In terms of the actual details of the submissions, I'll just say in different authorities, they often ask for different aspects of any disease.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up on that. Can you tell us the dose and schedule that you filed for in Europe? And then will that be the same in the U.S.?","Martin MacKay","We don't normally give that information, Terence, but just to say that it will be the same in both jurisdictions.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then maybe just one follow-up. Would love your latest thinking on the dry AMD opportunity and anything you guys can say there about the path forward.","Martin MacKay","This is an area that, I think, we've said on the phone before is obviously of interest to us. We think some of the mechanisms and the pathologies that we'd be looking at could be of interest to our molecules. And I think it's fair to say that we're considering all aspects of this area at the moment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of Nomura.","M. Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions, one on asfotase alfa. Any thoughts on evaluating in utero administration of asfotase alfa and maybe just thoughts on how different outcomes could be different if you were try that delivery strategy? And then just a financial question for Vikas. As you sort of model out the next 10 years and these levels of free cash flow generation that you're likely to sort of enjoy, can you just help us think about the tax strategy that is now in place? And whether it limits your ability to either, A, buy back stock; or pay dividend; and how you might need to potentially finance around it?","Leonard Bell","Martin, you want to take the tax? Or you want to take the development...","Martin MacKay","I think I'll go for the in utero question, if you don't mind, Lenny, and I'll leave the tax to Vikas. It's a really very good question about in utero treatment. The risk of stating the obvious, a really key thing with hypophosphatasia is diagnosis and early diagnosis. And certainly, we have the test available with very young perinatal and infants to be able to do that test and know when the appropriate use of hyper phosphatase occurs. As you, I guess, also know from your question, there are ways to diagnose in utero and it's something that clearly we're interested in. The treatment in utero provides some significant hurdles, but it certainly should be considered given the devastating nature of this disease. It's going to be absolutely key for us that we diagnose patients early and can start them on asfotase. Some of the data that David alluded to in the abstracts really highlight the potential benefit of asfotase alfa in these critically ill infants. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Yes, and your second question was on the tax strategy. I think on the cash generation, I have to say that our first and foremost objective is to invest wisely into our future pipeline to build our shareholder value, right. And secondly, we'll continue to buy back shares to match the dilution factor as we go forward. So those are the 2 key uses of our cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question on HPP. Now that you've deployed your new field-based team, was hoping you could talk in little bit more detail about what you're seeing as you pursue these educational efforts around signs and symptoms? How well recognized is the disease? Do you have any sense of the proportion of patients out there with HPP who are identified versus misdiagnosed versus under the radar? And how does the landscape here look relative -- in terms of disease awareness and diagnosis and understanding relative to PNH at the time when you launch Soliris in that indication?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Brian. The incidents and prevalence of disease is really hard to determine at this point, as I alluded to, given the high mortality rates and low awareness levels. To your point, though, what we are seeing with the early education programs and we're focusing on a variety of different specialties, whether or not you're a pediatric endocrinologist, endocrinologist, geneticist, pediatric nephrologist, rheumatologist, orthopods, we run a pretty broad group of physicians through some of our early education programs. And I think the common takeaway, as I alluded to in the call, is that they kind of walk into the program thinking that they hadn't managed a patient with HPP historically and I think they walk away from the program thinking perhaps they did and they just didn't know it. And so we're hopeful and we think that, that does follow a similar pattern from both our introductions of Soliris into PNH and most recently with aHUS. And so there's a lot of work to be done. And I would anticipate, given the early positive feedback that physicians are providing, about the opportunity to identify -- diagnose, identify and treat patients that it should support a very successful launch.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Yaron Werber of Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If you just don't mind, just a couple of questions. One is one of the key things with HPP, as we all know, is diagnosis and there's a potential to use the low alk phos assay to diagnose patients. And I know there's efforts underway, so I just wanted to get an update there. And then to Vikas, to you, you guys typically sort of raise guidance 3 times a year, those in other ways now. Would you just give us a little bit of the metrics or what sort of you're seeing in the second half for us to think about a potential further uptake more than expected in terms of demand?","David L. Hallal","Yes, just very quickly on diagnosis, I'll take that, Yaron, and then I'll hand it over to Vikas. So we recognize, first and foremost, many physicians don't even know what they're looking for is low alk phos. Some -- most diseases, they're trying to look at elevated levels of alk phos. So that's number one. And number two, how it's reported out is very important. Because what is a normal level of alk phos or a low level of alk phos varies by both gender and age. And so those are cornerstones in our pathway initiatives to help enable physicians to diagnose accurately and rapidly.","Vikas Sinha","And Yaron, regarding the guidance, right, we weigh in our risk and opportunities when we provide the guidance every quarter and we look at what's ahead of us. It's very difficult to know everything and forecast accurately in the future. But if we weigh in risk and opportunity, we kind of get to a number and then we kind of give for the next quarter. And if you look at where we are headed towards, with the significant headwind on the commodity currencies right now, that's what have weighed in right now.","Irving Adler","I'm sorry. Operator, go ahead. That's all the time we do have today. So please go ahead.","Operator","That was our final question, and this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

And welcome to the Alexion Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Conference Call to discuss First Quarter 2019 Financial Results. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Altschuller, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Susan Altschuller","Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's Performance for the first quarter 2019. Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer; John Orloff, our Global Head of R&D; and Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial Officer. You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations Page on our website.","Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today, and we undertake no duty to update any of the statements after the call except as required by law.","I'd also like to remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered, in addition to, but not a substitute for, our GAAP results. Thank you. Ludwig?","Ludwig Hantson","Thank you, Susan, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. I'm very pleased with the strong start to the year. We've delivered on the top and bottom line and have already made great progress so far on our 2019 key objectives here.","Here on Slide 5, I want to highlight some of these achievements. First, with ULTOMIRIS, we have an opportunity to redefine the standard-of-care in PNH and HUS. Our US launch for PNH is on track to meet our best-in-class goal of 70% or greater conversion by year two. We hope to launch in Germany mid-year and in Japan by the end of this year.","Furthermore, I'm pleased to announce that just this week we filed the approval of ULTOMIRIS for atypical HUS in US with a potential launch in early 2020 and are also planning to file in Europe and Japan this year.","Second, we are accelerating on the neurology portfolio, building on the best Alexion launch to date. We're seeing continuous strong patient growth with SOLIRIS in gMG.","With a PDUFA date of June 28 for SOLIRIS in NMOSD, our team is dedicated and focused on launch preparedness, as we hope to expand into our next [indiscernible] neurology indication. We also received orphan drug priority review for filing in Japan.","In May, we will present additional Phase 3 data at the AAN conference. Given the strength of our clinical data, we believe SOLIRIS could be transformative for patients with this devastating disease.","Third, our metabolic portfolio continues to grow with STRENSIQ & KANUMA. We also have an opportunity to bring a transformative product to Wilson disease patients with 1840. And enrollment is on track in our ongoing pivotal study.","Fourth, we're executing and expanding our pipeline. We continue to make progress with our internal assets and we have now dosed the first patients in the Phase 3 trial of ULTOMIRIS in gMG and a Phase 3 trial of ULTOMIRIS administered in a weekly subQ formulation designed to support potential registration in both PNH and atypical HUS.","Furthermore, we continue to build our portfolio with three business development deals, two clinical stage and one preclinical stage. Additional business development is a core focus and we have the financial and operational capacity to build our pipeline further.","Finally, we delivered very strong financial performance and have updated our guidance to reflect the upward trajectory and growth of the business.","Turning to Slide 6. Earlier this year, we laid out our strategy in building four durable growing blockbuster pillars, as we diversify our portfolio. With our hematology and nephrology, neurology, metabolics and FcRn franchises, we aspire to deliver continued double-digit revenue growth over the coming years.","However, we're not sitting still as we plan to further build each of these four pillars, as well as potentially expand in other areas of rare disease with a goal of delivering transformative therapies to even more patients.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss our first quarter financial results and updated guidance. Paul?","Paul Clancy","Thanks, Ludwig. We delivered an excellent quarter to start the year. Starting with Slide 8, we reported total revenues in the quarter of $1.140 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year, driven by growth in gMG, the ULTOMIRIS conversion in growth in the core business.","Our non-GAAP operating margin was 57% in the first quarter, an expansion of 741 basis points driven by top line leverage in phasing of R&D spend. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.39, representing 42% growth year-over-year.","Moving to Slide 9, first quarter net product sales were driven by volume growth of 26%, partially offset by FX headwind of 1% and a price headwind of 2%. The price headwind was largely a result of SOLIRIS price changes in Turkey, driven by our formalized reimbursement agreement in the third quarter of 2018.","Turning to Slide 10. SOLIRIS revenue in the first quarter was $962 million with year-over-year volume growth of 23%, driven primarily by strength in the U.S. and Japan owing to the growing contribution from gMG. SOLIRIS growth was partially impacted by the conversion to ULTOMIRIS.","On Slide 11, you'll see ULTOMIRIS revenue in Q1. The first full quarter since FDA approval was $25 million. Underlying volume growth into the PNH and atypical HUS business inclusive of both SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS remained strong in the quarter and we expect it to be in the high single digits for the full year.","Moving to Slide 12. STRENSIQ revenues for the first quarter were $130 million, representing 18% percent revenue growth and 26% volume growth year-over-year. KANUMA revenues in the first quarter were $24 million, representing 20% revenue growth and 28% volume growth year-over-year.","Turning to the P&L on Slide 13. During the quarter, non-GAAP R&D expense was $159 million or 14% of revenues. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $244 million or 21% of revenues.","The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 16%. The GAAP tax rate was negative 9%, driven by certain onetime tax benefits, primarily related to a tax election associated with the Wilson intellectual property.","We reported first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.39, growing 42% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per share was $2.61, inclusive of the onetime tax benefits. We ended the first quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and marketable securities.","I'll now turn to Slide 14 for the 2019 financial guidance. We're guiding to total revenues between $4.675 billion to $4.750 billion, an increase from prior guidance. This represents 14% growth year-over-year at the midpoint of the range.","For the combination of SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS, our revenue guidance is $4.020 billion to $4.070 billion. This assumes continued momentum in gMG, as well as a modest initial contribution from our anticipated U.S. approval and launch in NMOSD in the second half of the year.","Earlier this month it was announced that a SOLIRIS biosimilar was approved in Russia. While Russia represents a small portion of our overall sales, we anticipated this event and it was factored into our original guidance and included in our updated guidance today.","For ULTOMIRIS, we expect steady patient conversion from SOLIRIS to continue for PNH in the US. 2019 revenues benefit from conversion due to the loading dose in the first year.","Turning to metabolics, our revenue guidance is unchanged at $655 million to $680 million for both STRENSIQ & KANUMA. This includes the impact of a strategic pricing decision for STRENSIQ in the US to support sustainability, given weight based dosing.","We estimate price will be a 2% headwind in 2019 and FX impact net of hedging to represent a $50 million headwind. GAAP operating margin is expected to be 35% to 42% inclusive of restructuring and related expenses, as well as upfront payments.","Non-GAAP operating margin guidance is expected to be between 54% to 55% unchanged from prior guidance. Non-GAAP R&D expense is expected to be 16% to 17% of revenues and we expect R&D spend to increase through the course of the year. Non-GAAP SG&A spend is expected to be 20% to 21% of revenues.","At the midpoint of this guidance, non-GAAP operating profit is expected to grow approximately 18% year-over-year. We expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate similar to 2018.","GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $6.76 and $7.96, and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to be between $9.25 and $9.45. The midpoint of this range is approximately 18% growth year-over-year. With a strong first quarter, we're well positioned to deliver on our 2019 financial ambitions.","I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Orloff","Thank you, Paul. We continue to execute on advancing and building out our pipeline. We've made significant progress in each of our four blockbuster pillars, which I will highlight today.","As seen in the three right hand columns, we currently have 16 development programs in our pipeline. During the past 12 months we reported positive pivotal data in ULTOMIRIS and PNH and atypical HUS and with SOLIRIS and NMOSD have progressed ULTOMIRIS into additional Phase 3 trials and have announced a total of seven business development deals, four clinical stage and three preclinical stage.","Last month at our Investor Day we conducted a deep dive on the R&D portfolio and I would encourage you to take a look if you haven't done so already.","On slide 17, we have outlined our R&D program phasing over the next 18 months. As you can see we expect clinical trial activity to ramp up towards the back half of 2019 into 2020 with numerous Phase 3 ULTOMIRIS programs in our ongoing Phase 3 superiority trial for 1840 in Wilson disease. We expect early clinical research and business development will also contribute.","Moving now to slide 18, you can see our plans to expand patient optionality with our innovative C5 portfolio. Focusing on haematology, nephrology, we have an ambition to raise the standard-of-care with ULTOMIRIS every week IV in PNH and have filed for approval in atypical HUS.","With our planned higher concentration formulation which we plan to file in the back half of this year, ULTOMIRIS patients will benefit from both every eight week dosing and reduced infusion time of only 45 minutes.","We expect to follow our ULTOMIRIS once weekly subcutaneous, utilizing West\u2019s patient friendly SmartDose device in late 2020 or early 2021 with potential approval in 2021.","Our additional subcutaneous programs, including 1720 and our collaboration with Halozyme for ALXN1810 provide opportunity and additional indications. We expect these haematology and nephrology focused complement efforts to extend both the durability and longevity of our complement leadership.","Now turning to neurology on Slide 19. Building on our base of SOLIRIS, we plan to expand treatment options for gMG patients with ULTOMIRIS, as well as our Anti-FcRn program 1830. This portfolio approach would allow us to serve patients across the spectrum of disease. I would also note that it is our ambition to launch the first subcutaneous therapy in gMG with our weekly subcutaneous ULTOMIRIS.","In NMOSD we were granted priority review for SOLIRIS with the US PDUFA date of June 28 and hope to be the first FDA approved therapy. We are committed to innovating for patients and are finalizing our Phase 3 program design for ULTOMIRIS in NMOSD with plans to initiate a pivotal study by year end.","Given the success of SOLIRIS in neuromuscular junction and the CNS, complement appears to play an important role in neurological diseases based on existing scientific literature, as well as our own preclinical modelling, we see rationale to initiate a proof-of-concept study of ULTOMIRIS in ALS in an exploratory clinical trial for the treatment of PPMS in late 2019.","Turning to Slide 20, our collaboration with Caelum Biosciences is intended to expand and diversify our haematology footprint with the potential to serve patients with AL amyloidosis, a rare disease with a high mortality rate.","We saw early proof-of-concept for CAEL-101 which demonstrated clinical effect on organ function and target engagement in Vivo. Pending feedback from regulators, a Phase 2\/3 study investigating 101 as add the current chemotherapeutic standard of care is planned to begin in early 2020.","Our program in ALXN1840 in Wilson disease depicted on Slide 21, represents an opportunity to expand our existing metabolics business. The Phase 3 trial comparing 1840 with standard of care copper chelators is ongoing and we have enrolled over 70 patients.","We believe 1840 has potential to be differentiated with a 10,000 fold higher affinity to copper that results in a unique ability to extract copper directly from the liver, potentially improving liver function and neuropsychiatric symptoms.","Moving to our FcRn pillar on slide 22, with a recent Affibody deal, we will have the opportunity to address a wide range of IgG mediated autoimmune diseases with two products. ABY-039 is in a Phase 1 single ascending dose study. Recall 039 is a 19 kilodalton bivalent Anti-FcRn with a long half life stemming from its albumin binding domain. We believe there may be multiple chronic autoimmune diseases well suited for a potentially best in class subcutaneous Anti-FcRn.","With ALXN1830, our initial focus is in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and gMG. Due to CMC issues with our clinical supply, we have made some adjustments to the development plan. While we will not have supply to complete the Phase 1\/2 warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia study this year, we are now planning to move into seamless adaptive Phase 2\/3 studies in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and gMG. We have addressed the CMC issues and will have sufficient clinical supply to initiate these studies by year end 2019 or early 2020. We will also initiate a Phase 1 SAD, MAD study for our 1830 subcutaneous formulation by year end.","I'd like to thank the R&D and business development organizations for their continued efforts to advance our pipeline and portfolio strategy. I'm looking forward to updating you on our progress over the course of this year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss commercial highlights for the quarter. Brian?","Brian Goff","Thank you, John. Starting on slide 24, while only four months into the launch of ULTOMIRIS for PNH in the US, we're very encouraged with the initial progress we've made. As of the beginning of this week 27% of PNH patients were enrolled in one source, a leading indicator of conversion and 22% of PNH patients are on treatment with ULTOMIRIS.","So we believe we're on a very solid path towards achieving our goal of facilitating a best in class SOLIRIS to ULTOMIRIS PNH patient conversion of at least 70% within the first two years of launch.","The commercial and operational expertise of our team are critical to the success of our launch, and we believe ULTOMIRIS sets a new bar for patients. As you see on the left, ULTOMIRIS delivers on the key attributes of a best in class therapy for PNH.","So far patient and physician feedback has been positive and from a payer standpoint there have been minimal barriers for conversion and to date over 60% of commercial lives now have a defined policy for ULTOMIRIS.","We have a similar ambition to facilitate a rapid best in class conversion in Europe and Japan and pre-launch planning is underway with a first potential x-U.S. launch in Germany mid-year.","Turning to Slide 25, our neurology franchise represents a significant growth opportunity both near and long term. This franchise is built upon the success of our launch of SOLIRIS and gMG, the best Alexion launch to date.","In fact, as of this month we're proud to announce that in the U.S there are over 1000 patients currently being treated with SOLIRIS and by the end of this year our second full year of launch we anticipate gMG to be the largest US SOLIRIS syndication by patient volume.","We're excited to build upon our success with gMG, as we actively prepare for our potential expansion of SOLIRIS into NMOSD in the US midyear. There are currently no approved therapies for NMOSD. Patients live in constant fear of the unpredictable and potentially devastating effects of another attack. Therefore relapse prevention remains the primary treatment goal.","Given the strength of our data and the significant need, we have a sense of urgency to serve these patients. We are right now expanding our field and medical teams and pre launch internal training as well underway. We believe we have the right infrastructure in place ahead of our June 28 PDUFA date.","Moving to our metabolic franchise on slide 26, we reported first quarter STRENSIQ revenue of $130 million. We expect continued growth coming from STRENSIQ in 2019 as we identify new patients and seek reimbursement agreements in additional geographies. KANUMA ended the quarter with revenue of $24 million and continues on a path of steady growth.","With the addition of ALXN1840 for Wilson disease, we have the potential to further strengthen and grow our metabolics portfolio. We believe 1840 could provide meaningful differentiation and superiority over the current standard of care for Wilson disease with approximately 20,000 patients in the U.S. and EU 5 and the potential to be the first approved therapy in decades. We see significant opportunity for 1840, which if approved will share a strong call point synergies with KANUMA.","I want to thank our team for their dedication to bringing hope to patients suffering from rare diseases and we'd like to reiterate the organization's enthusiasm and commitment as we move through the year.","I'll now turn the call back to Ludwig for closing comments. Ludwig?","Ludwig Hantson","Thank you, Brian. We have already made great progress in the first few months of the year, but we are not stopping here. We are well positioned to build on the momentum and deliver on our 2019 objectives.","Alexion 2.0 is in its next phase of growth. We continue to execute on our strategy with the goal to make a meaningful impact on patient lives and create long term shareholder value. As always, I would like to thank our global employees for their dedication to our mission and the patients we serve for their continued trust in us.\\","With that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now turn to the question and answer portion of our call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Geoff Meacham","Morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I just had a commercial one and then a real quick one for John. So on ULTOMIRIS in the US Brian, what's been the gating factor for access, it seems straightforward to do so to switch and fairly quickly, but how would you expect that to differ outside the US? I would obviously think pricing would be a big driver outside the U.S. for example?","And then for John, you guys obviously have a pretty broad rollout for ULTOMIRIS in terms of new studies and it's having an impact on perhaps the competition enrolling patients, I want to maybe ask you that more broadly, are you finding it tougher as you - as you expand the ULTOMIRIS breadth of development to find patients for some of that - for you know, for - going back to aHUS and then also we're looking forward to gMG or to NMO?. Thank you.","Brian Goff","Yeah. Hey, Geoff. It's Brian. I'll start with your first question on access and for all ULTOMIRIS as I mentioned we're pleased with the progress. As I noted, we're now over 60% of commercial covered lives with a determined policy and that's right on track with the pace that we expected we saw the same general progress with gMG with the launch of SOLIRIS for gMV.","And really what in the US what [indiscernible] is you noted price of course, that's a key factor in the value story. But there's also - a lot of these payers have scheduled timing for the reviews to make their policy determinations. So we're working through that.","And then a little bit deeper in the institutional setting there also are formulary decisions that likewise need to be made and that's what covers the academic access for the most part.","X-US, I think you have similar dynamics in a way pricing, value becomes a key part of the discussion of course. And then there will be single payer policy determinations, which in a way could accelerate that pathway and then you get more locally the same thing at the institutional level.","I think just keeping in mind what happens for 2019 beyond the US, it's really a story about Germany at the mid year point and in Germany you essentially have free pricing in the first year of pre-AMNOG, and then later in the year we would look to a reimbursement determination for Japan, our second key launch. And then John\u2026","John Orloff","Geoff, this is John. So with regard to trial enrolment, as you know, we've completed the atypical HUS study we filed now in the US and we're on the verge of filing also in Europe and Japan. The gMV is probably the highest competitive intensity and yet we have the advantage of knowing those investigators and those sites worldwide. And we are in the process now of enrolling that study. So we're pretty confident we'll be able to enroll that as quickly as we possibly can.","For NMO that's going to start later this year. Lower competitive intensity, but again we know the players in the field and with regard to the high reward, high risk indications ALS and PPMS assets totalling new territory. So we're confident we can execute on the clinical development plan.","Geoff Meacham","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Ludwig Hantson","Okay. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Kennen MacKay","Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was wondering maybe if you could help us understand a little bit what some of the manufacturing issues were before getting the Phase 3 started - Phase 3 started for the FcRn and is this something that was in-house or is this an issue with the CMOs or intellectual transfer here?","And then, separately I was just wondering about the Russian biosimilars, I was wondering if you could help us understand the clinical trial that got that biosimilar there from Generium and whether that was something that could be supportive of an approval for that agent in the rest of Mainland, Europe, given that you have some partnerships with European such as?","Ludwig Hantson","Please go ahead.","Brian Goff","For the 1830 program as you know, we acquired Syntimmune and process the manufacturing that supported those clinical trials. And as you also know we had three Phase Ib\/IIa studies ongoing in PV warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and healthy volunteer Multiple Ascending Dose Study. And those were progressing well.","But we discovered an impurity in the drug a product that we've investigated. We've identified the cause and the source and we've corrected those manufacturing issues with new drugs substance runs that will allow for a clinical supply by the end of this year when we can sort of reinitiate these clinical program.","So we're doing everything we can to preserve the original timelines. But there will be a delay in starting the pivotal programs as we articulated previously for WAIHA and for gMG.","Paul Clancy","So Brian for the Russian biosimilars, so no surprise for us and also no surprise moving forward.","Ludwig Hantson","And maybe I'll start and Paul, if you want to add anything. As Paul had noted in his commentary, that we have worked this into our guidance. It's already included. We believe it's generally limited to Russia CIS.","In terms of the exact specifics of the clinical program, we don't know, we haven't seen it. But for EU and boundaries outside of Russia CIS there are different regulated requirements, like conducting clinical trials and having sites in Europe. And so generally we believe that this is isolated to Russia CIAs. Anything else, Paul.","Paul Clancy","I'd also Mac [ph] just point you to, that we have protection in Europe right now, as well as ODD protection. And just to reinforce what Brian said, the regulatory hurdles are fundamentally different.","Brian Goff","Yeah, which we didn't have in Russia. So\u2026","Paul Clancy","Exactly.","Brian Goff","Our IP was - we didn't have an IP in Russia. So I would say it is as expected. I think most of us and all of us have experienced with dealing with the Russian markets. We think it's going to be isolated to Russia, plus the countries that Brian highlighted. So we don't see anything happening in Europe with Generium.","Ludwig Hantson","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Porges","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. One perhaps for Brian and then one for Paul if I may. Brian, just quickly on the NMOSD as you prepare for the launch, can you give us a sense of what the unmet need in the patient population is, particularly what the population of recent relapses or more active and refractory diseases that you think is it's possible to start on treatment relatively quickly?","And then Paul, looking at all of the clinical trials you have getting under way in the beginning of next year and also the investments you're making in the neuro and muscle franchises. Could you give us a sense of where you think your operating margin could go? Is it feasible for us to be modeling stable operating margins next year or is it inevitable that they'll come under pressure?","Brian Goff","Yeah. Hi, Jeffrey. Good morning, it's Brian. I'll start with your first question on NMOSD and of course, I'll begin by saying that we're really pleased to have the opportunity, every time we reflect on the data and the strength of what we saw in terms of the patients who were relapse free, which we really think will be the key aspect of focus on NMOSD. The fact that we had nearly 98% at 48 weeks is very significant. So that's kind of the starting point for where our focus will be. It's all about the relapse.","That said to your question about you know, how do we think about the opportunity. We've talked that in the US it's 4 to 5,000 patients that are - that align with the present pivotal Phase 3 clinical program. It's a subset of that that we would expect in the early days would be in the so-called actively relapsing segment and that would be our very initial area of focus, once we do have approval from the FDA.","There are also important differences between them NMOSD and the launch that we had in gMC, maybe just to name a couple. One is that there are no approved therapies available but RITUXAN is commonly used as off label treatment and because of the severity and the significance of these attacks or these relapses in NMOSD, we do anticipate that there will be some patient reluctance to switch therapies and we're going to have to work through the educational aspects of both the patient level, as well as the provider level.","Secondly, we're also aware that there is potential near-term competition on the horizon, although what will be unique of course about SOLIRIS is the complement mechanism of action which we believe is fundamental to addressing this disease.","And then the third point is what I already mentioned that, the population is smaller than gMG. But still for us another example of potentially moving from ultra rare to rare. So we're excited to have the chance to expand on neurology footprint and focus.","Paul Clancy","Geoff, this is Paul. Thanks for the question. I'm going to try to answer it at a little bit more of a conceptual level because obviously we're not kind of getting into 2020 numbers at this point in time.","But I think you're absolutely right, from a thesis perspective that what we would love to see in it's part and parcel to the strategy of the company is growing R&D, driven by a growing and expanding pipeline. And as we progressed through the year, it's exactly as you kind of pointed out is probably three things that really drive that growing R&D, which is ULTOMIRIS broadening into additional indications and additional studies subQ, gMG and NMOSD, ALS, PPM.S. So it's a really big strategy around ULTOMIRIS for the long-term.","Progression of kind of what I call the newly - the newer assets into the pipeline through business development activity over the last 12 to 18 months, including Wilson, both the FcRn assets moving forward Caelum and we have dollars earmarked for additional pipeline coming from business development.","So we \u2013 you know, that's not - you know, we don't know what that is yet, but we do in that - that will flip over into 2020. I think that is very, very healthy and it's actually consistent with the strategy and it will result in a growing, hopefully a growing R&D budget.","I think we see SG&A leverage on the flip side and I wouldn't point to kind of SG&A dollars, you know, meaningfully coming down or anything like that. It's just more SG&A leverage on top of hopefully double-digit kind of revenue growth.","And the combination of those things I think can expand margins modestly and continue to progression margins. We will do what's right for growing the business over a long period of time, but with that mentality kind of - so keep it at a conceptual level for the for the time being. Hopefully that helps.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Paul Matteis","Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. A couple of quick questions on MG and ULTOMIRIS. I was wondering if you could offer any color on the characteristics of the early adopters of the ULTOMIRIS population, whether or not they're younger, whether or not they have more or less comorbidities and the insurance mix?","And then separately gMG, it looks like the patients on therapy are remarkably stable over the past couple of quarters. Are the underlying drivers of that stable being new prescriptions and also discontinuation? Thanks so much.","Brian Goff","Yeah. Hey, Paul. It's Brian. So I'll start - I'll go in the order that you just mentioned with ULTOMIRIS, I probably won't be able to give you as much detailed color as you're looking for - for the patient types. I think what you're seeing in the - in the uptake we've had so far which has been steady. I mean, we've been consistently reporting out the progress we've made is a function of a few different attributes.","One is patients who have awareness of the availability of ULTOMIRIS of course, and the motivation to benefit from that shift going from living life in two week cycles to every two months, which is significant. That has to be matched up with the doctors themselves being aware of ULTOMIRIS.","And it's interesting with PNH, it's an ultra rare disease. So in a lot of the cases you have doctors who - it might be the first time that they've actually been exposed to an PNH patient in the case of new patients. With the switchers, the awareness is pretty high with doctors who have PNH patients and then it's gated by their access. That's why we're pleased with the progress that we're making with commercial payers, as well as - as I'd noted at the institutional level.","And I just think as we progress you'll see continued different cohorts of patients moving on therapy once they pass through that access and their awareness of the product. So far, so good and very consistent uptake, as you've seen in the numbers.","In the case of gMG, I would agree with your commentary that it is remarkably stable, it's what we had predicted. That's the dynamic that we see. In rare diseases, we're looking at in the case of gMG a larger population of course than in PNH. And we continue to make - we continue to make progress on both breadth of prescribing, new prescriber, new neurologists who are experiencing SOLIRIS in understanding the complement mechanism and gMG for the first time.","And we're also beginning to make some inroads in terms of depth of prescribing, repeat prescribing that is and that with again the background of strong payer support and a product profile with SOLIRIS that plays out very nicely has just continued us on that journey of continued uptake.","Susan Altschuller","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Chris Raymond","Thanks. Just on the ULTOMIRIS PNH conversion. So your chart on slide 24, I think shows a really nice linear conversion trend and I guess I'm just eyeballing it, you know, it looks like if that trend continues linearly, you could be at that 70% number, quite a lot earlier than your guidance for that two year point.","So maybe could you just talk. Is there something that you see down the road that indicates the flattening of that conversion curve? You know, any sort of color there would be great.","And maybe for John, on the antibody compound, I know you guys have guided to disclosing initial indications I think in pursuit by the end of the year. But can you talk about what's gating that disclosure. Is it a matter of deciding between multiple options and that the healthy volunteer data will be you know, critical to picking that - those indications or are you more focused on keeping competitors in the dark you know, as long as possible?","Ludwig Hantson","Good questions, Chris.","Brian Goff","Yeah. Hey, Chris it's Brian. So I'll start. On ULTOMIRIS, we are really pleased with the progress that we've made. We put out what we believed to be a bold, but appropriate ambition to have facilitated patient conversion in PNH of 70% or more by the 2 year mark from launch. And we\u2019re, as I noted, we're right on track with that.","I would hedge to make any predictions about where we're going to be at the end of the year, other than to say we stick with the same ambition. Just as a reminder, we're only a little less than four months into the launch in the U.S. and it goes in a way back to the previous questions that Paul had asked about, what types of patients are we seeing in the early adoption. Too difficult to know at this stage and that's what makes it a little bit challenging to know what the exact uptake will be.","But I've been in rare diseases long enough to say that we're not seeing a bolus, we see consistent progress and that's essentially what I would expect going forward. And we're really proud of what the team has executed so far.","Paul Clancy","I would add that, the first six months define the success of the launch and we're really pleased with what we've seen so far. But I don't think anything in our business is linear forever. So we're going to stick to a 70% conversion \u2013 ambition. That the team has done a great job, but it comes back to the value of this molecule and what it means for patients and then Affibody?","John Orloff","Yeah. With regard to ABY-039, I think we're considering the same menu of indications that we're targeting for 1830 in terms of autoimmune rare diseases. It's differentiating features would include a longer half life, as well as a smaller volume for subcutaneous administration. So we're looking at diseases where you know, that is a key attribute for the target patient population.","And I would add also from 1830, we have very strong data supporting that product profile. And while we've had to prematurely pause the Phase 2 program, as we reported last year in pemphigus vulgariswe we had at what I would consider a sub therapeutic dose at 10 milligrams per kilogram, IV weekly over five weeks, a 57% reduction in IGT lowering and a reduction in PDAI scores and with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia study which we've also had to pause after the first cohort.","Again dosing what we consider as sub therapeutic dose at 10 migs per kig, over five weeks we had 55%percent reduction in IGT lowering with a clinical response seen in some patients. And then in the healthy volunteer MAD study, we\u2019re able to get up to 20 milligrams per kilogram IV times three weeks with 64% IGT lowering before we had to pause.","So we're very positive on this program. We want to take forward and get into Phase 2\/3 seamless adaptive pivotal studies for hemolytic anemia and gMG early next year.","Chris Raymond","Thanks.","Ludwig Hantson","We\u2019ll take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Tessa calling in for Anupam this morning. Thank you for taking our questions and for the update here. Maybe two from us, competitively how are you thinking about hemoglobin changes with ULTOMIRIS, SOLIRIS and PNH and what specifically are you hearing in the marketplace on this end point?","And then a second one if I could on SOLIRIS gMG. You highlighted a thousand patients on SOLIRIS Solaris in the US in mid-April. Have there been sources of efficiency in getting patients on therapy with time and just curious what percent of those patients are currently enrolled in one source? And how might these trends look outside of the US? Thanks so much, guys.","Ludwig Hantson","John?","John Orloff","So, we've previously reported the results of the 301 and 302 study which had hemoglobin stabilization in three quarters to 85% of patients transfusion independence and 74% in the 301 trial and 88% in a 302 trial.","So we have a really positive impact on hemoglobin which did go up in the 301 study. I think you may be referencing some of the competition that's looked at our patients starting out with a low hemoglobin. We have had increases and I think that those are carefully selected patients that had no bone marrow failure, high reticulocyte count and anemia to begin with to demonstrate that response which is a subset of patients as we've said previously with extravascular hemolysis, representing less than 10% of the overall population of patients with PNH that have that as a as a potential issue to address.","But it doesn't represent the broad population of PNH patients which is driven by intravascular hemolysis, which is well addressed and the past with SOLIRIS and now with ULTOMIRIS raising the bar.","Brian Goff","And then I'll - I'll pick it up with the gMG question, I tried to get them all, so just let me know if I missed one. But starting with your question on the - more than a thousand patients says of the midpoint in April that we're very proud of the continued progress.","I'll try a little bit of alliteration here on - you asked about efficiency, I think it comes down to number one expertise. We now have quite a significant expertise, particularly in gMG and we expect fingers crossed to be moving into the NMOSD space once we have approval there as well. So expertise comes into play.","The experience itself, not just our own experience, but as I noted with a growing prescriber base of neurologists, as we build out that breadth and depth. And then the third is, I had noted in my comments that we've expanded and we did that because we see a broad population for gMG that could benefit from SOLIRIS and we want to continue on that journey, and as well as I look ahead to NMOSD and potentially even longer term, other areas in neurology that we'd like to move into.","Outside the US, which was the other part of your question. We have gMG in both Germany and Japan. I think both of those markets are different from the US and in fact, different from each other.","Japan is making good progress, probably more similar to US types of prescribing dynamics. Germany has been slower going, which we've talked about on prior calls and tends to be more gated by dependency on guidelines, which just inherently take longer to form an update. So that's where we are. But again in the US, which is the bulk of our business in gMG we're particularly proud.","And one last one that you had asked about is, one source, the overwhelming majority of those patients are enrolled in the one source program, which is helpful for patients to get on therapy, as well as to navigate through the system.","John Orloff","As we have said SOLIRIS MG is never going to be a big business in Europe, but we're really pleased with the two biggest countries US and Japan.","Ludwig Hantson","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau","Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow up question on competition from the last one. First on the 301 and 302 studies, have you ever disclosed what the hemoglobin levels were for patients in those trials?","And then secondly, what is your understanding of the status of the competition that's out there, so where the biosimilars and enrolling patients, the other branded players like Chugai, Regeneron, are they - are they still planning to move forward in PNH and aHUS or have their plans changed?","Brian Goff","So with regard to the 301, 302 studies, baseline hemoglobin in 301 was 9.5 and we had about 70% that stabilized and there was maybe about a gram increase in response to therapy during the study. The 302 study had a baseline hemoglobin of 11 and I\u2019ll point out are based on our feedback from many KOLs in the field, typically the trigger for transfusion is about 8 grams per deciliter even though you know, a value of 9 or 10 or 11 is below the lower limit of normal. Normally patients don't have symptoms related to that of anemia.","Contrast that to some of the other trials that have been conducted where based on hemoglobin have been as low as eight, like in the PADDOCK trial, in a monotherapy na\u00efve PNH patient population, which I think represents a careful selection of patients with anemia and absence of bone marrow failure.","So you know, we are enrolling the broad set of patients in our program. This was the largest PNH program ever conducted with nearly 450 patients that represents the PNH population that we treat today.","John Orloff","With respect to the status of the competition for biosimilars we are not aware of any active enrollment in the Phase 3 program for the Amgen Phase 3 study. So our best estimate is that this will take at least three years from start. We think it's an 18 month study, but that's a question for Amgen, the regulatory timelines and so on. So I think it's at least three years away I would say to the best of our knowledge.","And then on Chugai and Regeneron, I think we all know the Apitope [ph] issue what it means now for PNH and HUS, because that\u2019s a question for Chugai and Regeneron, but we're not aware of any active phase 3 program.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Josh Schimmer","Hey, thanks for taking the questions. First, can you provide a little bit more granularity on the timing of the launch of gMG and the MO indications beyond US, Germany and Japan for the key incremental markets? And then there's clearly a pent up unmet need for the gMG population. Any thoughts as to how much longer it will take to work through those patients to get them on therapy and what are the gating steps for them considering the severity of that disease? Thank you.","Ludwig Hantson","John, do you wan to do?","John Orloff","Yeah. I would just say for NMO, we have a PDUFA date in the US for June 28 and we do anticipate approvals both in Japan and in Europe in the latter half of 2019. Those filings are under review currently and then\u2026","Ludwig Hantson","And Japan is a - it could be a strong NMO markets, Brian?","Brian Goff","Yeah. I'll just say that Japan has higher prevalence actually than most other countries in the world. And so it's an interesting opportunity for us in the case of NMOSD to match up with the launch in the US as an opportunity. So those are the near-term launch opportunities which would be in the second half of this year, with approval.","And then I think the other question you had was around gMG. And I just want to make sure I understood what you were looking for?","Josh Schimmer","So the first question was markets beyond US, Germany and Japan and then for gMG, how much longer do you think it'll take to work through this pent up unmet need of patients?","Brian Goff","Okay. Well, so for gMG the - I mean, it is a big opportunity. We've talked many times about the population that aligns with the REGAIN trial of in the US, 3 to 8,000 patients. But the overall population is 60 to 80,000 patients.","So what's the finish line of that opportunity? I don't know. We're very pleased with the continued progress we've had. The fact that we crossed over 1000 patients in mid-April, not just because it's a round number, but it just signifies that at this point in the continued launch, we are continuing to identify patients and to appropriately educate physicians around compliment as a novel mechanism of action if they've not had experience with before.","And I think what you have is a dynamic where the physicians are now seeing themselves personally how the product plays out with their patients and also hearing from others how their peers are experiencing SOLIRIS.","And so I just \u2013 I\u2019ll go back to the comment that, I think we'll stay on a solid trajectory of continued growth and penetration into that market and not only does that help the patients with gMG, it also continues to build experience for us in neurology and creates a pathway to move hopefully with approval and NMOSD from a peripheral neurological condition to one that acts centrally as well.","Ludwig Hantson","Operator, we'll take three more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew Harrison","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And just a clarification for John and then and then a second question. John on the \u2013on the FcRn [ph] study that you've had to stop. Will we end up seeing any of that data or just what you described earlier is that - is that all we're going to hear about that before we see Phase 3 data?","And then the second, I'm just wondering if you guys can maybe comment on the current pricing environment and you know, there's been more talk of maybe API coming back as a \u2013 as something that HHS will push forward. I wonder if you have a view on that? Thanks.","John Orloff","So with regard to 1830, as you know, we have shared the PV data, it was last year. And right now because we had to prematurely pause the hemolytic anemia Phase 2 program after only dosing the first cohort, we will not be sharing anything further this year beyond what I just said in terms of IgG lowering and the fact that we had a clinical response in some of those patients and look forward to exploring higher doses in the front end of a pivotal program that would include a dose ranging component to that study, so that we can properly identify a dose that we would take into the pivotal stage of the trial.","Paul Clancy","With respect to pricing and we've discussed this several occasions Matthew, so we believe in a global sustainable pricing strategy. It is essential that we continue to focus on innovation in ultra rare diseases. As you know, the 7000 rare diseases that we have a long, long way to go and trying to find solutions for those patients.","You also know that our growth is driven by volume, innovation being central. You know, what our ULTOMIRIS pricing strategy is in US where we have a 10% discount for PNH and once we get approval for HUS, we're talking about 30% discount and then we\u2019ll start HUS conversion at that point. We are focusing on a tight pricing band globally and we've done that in the past. And ambition is to continue to do so.","Having said that, we also are going beyond that, which means that we are proactively assessing and also implementing innovative ways of working with payers to support patient access.","There is also dialogue in addition to the international pricing reference, dialogue, dialogue, potential dialogue a dialogue on a single payer, a potential single payer system in the US. We have successfully operated in countries with single payer system.","And so we believe that the focus that we've had as an organization on this important topic is the right one and we believe that we are in a sustainable pricing situation. I hope that helps.","Ludwig Hantson","We'll take two more questions. Susan, I'm looking at you. We have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So just a simple questions on FcRn [indiscernible] do you think that there can be any difference in the profile as far as headache, given the trial administration and how it's acting on the body or if there is any risk as of lowering albumin too much without being concerned?","And second question would be, do you know [indiscernible] has an impact in lowering complement [ph] not just lowering IgG, do you - like IV, IgG does, so does it do other things besides lowering IgG? Thanks.","John Orloff","Yeah. So with regard to ABY-039, we do know the binding epitope on albumin for that molecule and we know that it does not share any overlap with the binding site for albumin on FcRn, so therefore there is no reduction in albumin with ABY-039. As we have also said for 1830 in contrast to some of the anti-FcRn competition where there is overlap with the IgG binding sites as well, yeah, the albumin binding sites on FcRn. So there is no effect on albumin. I can say that based on the fact that we've initiated the SAD, MAD studies already that are ongoing.","And then with regard to additional effects beyond IgG-lowering, we don't have evidence that there is per say reduction in complement, but of course, lowering IgG will have a downstream effect of less activation of complement.","The fact that we cannot lower it to zero and we don't want to lower it to zero, there will still be some underlying complement activation and diseases where that plays a role.","We also know that these molecules do interact with other receptors Fc gamma receptors and some of them are pro inflammatory or anti inflammatory and that could be potentially differentiating across the class.","Ludwig Hantson","I think Suzanne we can take two more.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Seedhouse with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Steven Seedhouse","Thank you. Good morning. Could you perhaps quantify what percent of patients on SOLIRIS and PNH have actually visited their physician so far since ULTOMIRIS approval, with the coverage policy in place and sort of made the explicit decision to either switch to SOLIRIS or switched to ULTOMIRIS to stay on SOLIRIS?","And is that number closer to 70% or closer or much higher. I am just trying to understand after you hit 70% conversion what the ceiling might be on total conversion?","And then secondly, as you think about new indications for ULTOMIRIS, it's like ALS and PPMS, it looks like those trials will utilize a IV ULTOMIRIS and if that's the case, what I guess drives the decision to start development and new indications with IV formulations as opposed to subQ? And is it because you know, the IV formulation might be the best proof-of-concept test or optimal exposure? Thank you.","Brian Goff","Steven, it's Bryan. Good morning. So I wish I could answer your question, but we're talking about an ultra rare population with a lot of variability actually in the cadence with which these patients visit their clinicians. That's dictated based on their own condition and the agreement that they have with their clinician.","So it's variable, you have some who see their clinicians, tends to be once a quarter, some who are every six months or so and some less frequently, again, depending on what intensity they agree on with their physician. So I can't give you the facts as to exactly where we are.","I think we're encouraged is that we are making progress as I noted with the payers and so that just removes one more sort of logistical barrier for when they do make that visit.","Secondly, the awareness continues to grow, particularly among those who have active PNH patients. And then there's also this scenario of new patients who are not switches per say, but has now been diagnosed with PNH, may see a physician who has not had any experience with cilia SOLIRIS or ULTOMIRIS and there there's a dynamic where they may actually prescribe SOLIRIS first and then what we do is deploy our teams to give appropriate education around ULTOMIRIS as a treatment option and that's also a part of the switching component. But it still is early days and I just can't give you too much more detail than that at this stage.","John Orloff","And with regard to the new indications, as you know we are studying the subQ formulation with an on body delivery device in PNH that will get us approval hopefully, pending successful completion of study in PNH, as well as atypical HUS.","I think the decision to go forward with IV is more related to timing and rapidity, as well as the plan to bridge to the 302 subQ through which would apply not only to PPM and ALS, but also to MG and NMO.","Susan Altschuller","Final question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is regarding the guidance you provided today with the update. So if I add up this quarter's revenue for both SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS, it gets to about $986.6 million. If I just flat life [ph] the next three quarters, I really don't see a lot of room for growth to the midpoint of the guidance. I was wondering if you can elaborate on the factors when you contemplate on your guidance besides the one-time $9 million tender?","And then secondly, maybe for John, you announced today that Alexion 1810, you have completed dosing in Phase 1. I was wondering when we might learn about the data from the Phase 1 compared to let's say the PK\/PD data and also can you remind us the volume of injection for the subQ? Thanks.","Paul Clancy","I'll start and it's Paul. I just point you to what we kind of have said in the past, as well as today, FX as we move through the year will be a little bit of a headwind. That's kind of a lot of the wraparound impact on Brazil, in Turkey. We think there's a bit of a price headwind that we pointed out, now about one third of that attributable towards SOLIRIS, included in our guidance is - it was included the beginning of the year as competitor trial estimates and we'll see how that plays.","And then as we had pointed out at the beginning of the year in some of the international markets we're making a direct to distributor change, that will be plus or minus PBT or profit neutral, but will be a little bit a headwind on the top line. That's a stuff I think I'd just point to.","And then you know clearly, you know, on the other side, the underlying growth, we think on a unit basis continues to be high single digit, on PNH and HUS, strong growth on MG contribution from NMOSD in the back end of the year.","John Orloff","And with regard to 1810, we've completed dosing in healthy volunteers study and the results of that indicate that we were able to increase bio availability from the previous studies we've done with 1210 subQ, which is about 60% bio availability and now we can increase that with the addition of PH20 and the 1810 formulation to 73% at a minimum.","This allows us to be able to dose at least every two weeks with a single on body delivery system and we're exploring the opportunity to dose it less frequently and of course, that \u2013 it depends on the on the volume which may require an additional device or devices.","Brian Goff","In the device, we show you the device during the IIR day, it was the \u2013 was small dose drug delivery platform and the volume for that device was 3.5 ml. And maybe you remember that John was on stage using one of those devices that didn't help me\u2026","John Orloff","With the\u2026","Ludwig Hantson","It happen to be though, and no product in it. I hope that answers the question. So we're going to stop the call.","Ludwig Hantson","So needless to say that, I'm really pleased with the start of the year. As you heard ULTOMIRIS is off to a great start, and MG continues to do very well and we continue to see great progress with our pipeline. We have a strong momentum and our objective is to continue to do so. I can tell you I'm very, very proud of the election team. So I want to thank all of our colleagues for what they've done and I wish you a good day. So enjoy the rest of your day everybody. Thanks so much."],"1090":["Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

And welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Alexion Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is [Alisha], and I\u2019ll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Dr. Leonard Bell, Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed, sir.","Leonard Bell","Thank you, [Alisha]. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss Alexion\u2019s performance for the first quarter of 2012. I\u2019m joined by members of Alexion management. Steve Squinto, Executive Vice President and Head of R&D; Vikas Sinha, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; David Hallal, Senior Vice President, Global Commercial Operations; and Tom Dubin, Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. We also welcome our entire Alexion team working around the world.","Vikas, David and Steve will join me on today\u2019s call to report on our financial, commercial and R&D accomplishments in the first quarter, and to update our strategic initiatives and accelerated execution plans for 2012.","Before we begin, Tom will apprise you of our potential to make forward-looking statements. Tom?","Tom Dubin","Thanks, Lenny. During this call we may make forward-looking statements, such as expected financial results, medical benefits, regulatory milestones and commercial potential of Soliris, asfotase alfa, and our other product candidates in the U.S. and other territories, plans for development and clinical trials of Soliris, asfotase alfa and our other product candidates, and operations reimbursement, price approval and funding processes in different territories.","Forward-looking statements are subject to factors that may cause our results and plans to differ from those expected, including decisions of regulatory authorities regarding approval or limitations on the marketing of Soliris and our product candidates for various indications. The possibility that results of clinical trials are not predictive of the safety and efficacy of Soliris or our product candidates in broader patient populations in the disease studied or in other diseases.","The risk that third parties won\u2019t agree to license any necessary intellectual property to us on reasonable terms or at all, the possibility that initial results of commercialization are not predictive of future results, the risk that third-party payers will not or not continue to reimburse for the use of Soliris at acceptable rates or at all, and a variety of other risks set forth from time-to-time in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2011. We do not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements after this call except when the duty arises under law.","I\u2019d like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP numbers conform to U.S. GAAP except in three respects. First, our non-GAAP numbers exclude share-based compensation. Second, we exclude non-cash tax adjustments associated with the utilization of our U.S. net operating losses. And third, with completion of three recent acquisitions, we also exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets and costs associated with acquisitions. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the press release we issued this morning.","Thanks you. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Tom. In the first quarter of 2012, Alexion made steady progress across our strategic objectives for the year as we continue to expand our initiatives to develop and deliver life transforming therapies for patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders.","Our development and commercial teams performed solidly in three key areas during the quarter. First, we again provided Soliris to a substantial number of new patients with PNH globally. Second, we are very pleased by the steady increase in new patients with aHUS beginning treatment with Soliris. And finally, we significantly advanced our eight lead development programs with eculizumab and four other highly innovative therapeutics. Steve will discuss the details and the specific areas of progress, and what is now the broadest pipeline in Alexion\u2019s history.","I\u2019d like to turn first our global operations of PNH and aHUS. In PNH, during Q1, we again achieved steady quarter-on-quarter growth in our core territories of United States, Western Europe and Japan.","Importantly and as in previous quarters, we again observed that a majority of PNH patients newly starting on Soliris were newly diagnosed with PNH indicating an ongoing and cumulative impact from our disease awareness programs and diagnostics initiatives.","We are driven by the recognition that even in the territories where we have operated the longest, the majority of PNH patients who can benefit from Soliris have still not received an accurate diagnosis nor started on appropriate therapy.","Turning to aHUS, we are very pleased to be serving a steady edition of new patients beginning treatment with Soliris in Q1. Patients newly commencing Soliris treatment represent a broad range of ages and clinical profiles, and are being treated by adult and pediatric nephrologists, as well as hematologists, indicating broader interest by the full range of physician who are likely to treat patients with aHUS.","As we have previously noted, more than half of aHUS patients not treated with Soliris are known to advance to dialysis from the kidney damage or die within the first year of following diagnosis. Based on this natural history, we identified two groups of aHUS patients prior to launch.","Patients with the longer duration of disease and substantial chronic kidney damage and as expected a larger proportion of patients were being identified during their first TMA clinical presentation and require emergent medical intervention.","Before approval, we focused on being able to serve all the patients with aHUS, including meeting the urgent needs of newly presenting patients by developing a range of patient centered initiatives. We are very pleased to see the early positive impact that our initiatives are having on the care of patients with aHUS.","As we have discussed, our PNH and aHUS operations in United States are driven by our recently expanded sales force, which is supported by our integrated hematology and nephrology therapeutic area teams. We observed strong marketing synergies that are focused on both hematology and nephrology with learning in each area that supports the other.","Our current commercial operations are only one part of our strategy for maximizing the therapeutic value of Soliris. As a long sort medical breakthrough, Soliris has the potential to transform the lives of patients suffering from a range of severe and ultra-rare disorders or uncontrolled complement activation beyond PNH and aHUS.","We are currently focused on applying the breakthrough innovation of Soliris and clinical development programs in four such disorders, acute humoral transplant rejection, STEC-HUS, neuromyelitis optica and myasthenia gravis.","As we seek to maximize the potential for Soliris to transform the lives of patients, we are also working diligently on expanding and accelerating development of our portfolio of other highly innovative treatments for patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders.","Our lead clinical development programs now comprise five innovative biologics, including Soliris, currently being investigating in eight severe and ultra-rare disorders in multiple therapeutic areas.","Importantly, even as we have significantly expanded our development pipeline, we have recognized a need to maintain the highest level of focus. Our eight lead clinical programs have been chosen for their strong fit with our longstanding objective to pursue the highest level of medical innovation to serve patients.","Specifically, all of these disorders manifest clinical complications that range from serve to fatal and all are ultra-rare. In the alignment with the severity of these disorders all of the therapies we have chosen to develop are highly innovative, first-in-class treatments with strong potential to provide a life transforming impact to patient.","As a recent indication of our high standards of breakthrough innovation, we note the publication last month of the highly encouraging asfotase alfa pediatric data in the New England Journal of Medicine. Given their various stages of development, our lead pipeline programs have the potential to make a growing contribution throughout our organization well into the next decade.","Turning to our financial performance, revenues in Q1 were $244.7 million, an increase of 47% compared to Q1 2011. By serving an increasing number of patients while maintain rigorous financial controls, we achieved Q1 2012 non-GAAP net income of $0.45 per share or $88.1 million, 57% increase year-over-year.","Following our performance in Q1, we announced this morning that we are raising our 2012 revenue guidance from the previous range of $1.04 billion to $1.07 million now to the higher and narrower range of $1.065 billion to $1.085 billion.","As we increase our revenue forecast for the year and continue to maintain tight control over expenses, we also raised our guidance for 2012 non-GAAP EPS from the previous range of $1.60 to $1.70 now to the higher range of $1.65 to $1.75.","We are gratified by our strong start in 2012 including our very encouraging and steady progress in serving patients with aHUS, as well as with a substantial expansion and acceleration of our research programs.","As the year progresses the global Alexion team will drive forward in each of its opportunities to serve current and future patients to the widest commercial operations and the deepest development pipeline in our history.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Vikas for a more detailed look at our financial results. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Lenny. Q1 2012 was a period of strong financial performance by Alexion with steady sales growth and increasing profitability. Cash flow was again robust and expenses were controlled well within our previously stated target.","Net product sales of Soliris were $244.7 million in Q1, an increase of 47% compared to the year ago quarter. Revenue performance in Q1 was supported by our core geographies of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan, augmented by serving a small but growing number of patients in other countries.","As we executed strongly on patient centered initiatives in Q1, we continued to control both SG&A and R&D expenses. In Q1, non-GAAP SG&A was $77.9 million and non-GAAP R&D was $42.1 million.","Strong topline performance combined with control of other key financial parameters resulted in a 57% increase in our non-GAAP net income year-over-year to $88.1 million or $0.45 per share in Q1 2012.","Turning to our balance sheet, cash, cash equivalence and marketable securities at quarter end were $359 million. These reflect positive cash flow from operations during the quarter and acquisition related debt offset by payment for the purchase of Enobia.","I would now like to review our guidance. Following our performance in Q1, we announced this morning that we are raising our 2012 revenue guidance from the previous range of $1.04 billion to $1.07 billion now to the higher and narrower range of $1.065 billion to $1.085 billion.","As we increase our revenue forecast for the year and continue to maintain tight control over expenses, we have also raised our guidance for 2012 non-GAAP EPS from the previous range of $1.60 to $1.70 now to the higher range of $1.65 to $1.75.","While, all other items of the guidance are being reiterated, I\u2019d like to provide some insights into our remaining non-GAAP SG&A and R&D expenses, and our GAAP tax rate.","First, I would note that non-GAAP SG&A is historically lower in Q1, compared to other quarters. In particular, we expect to have significantly greater non-GAAP SG&A expenses in Q2 and Q4 due to expenses related to medical conferences.","Additionally, excluded from our non-GAAP SG&A in 2012 will be approximately $20 million to $25 million in acquisition-related cost for Enobia and we have already recognized $12.4 million of this cost in Q1.","Turning to non-GAAP R&D, we expect that non-GAAP R&D in Q2 will increase to approximately $63 million to $68 million, mainly driven by asfotase alfa manufacturing and development costs.","Falling this peak in Q2, we expect R&D to be lower in Q3 than in Q2, though still above the Q1 level. We continue to expect that as a result of extra expenses related to Enobia, R&D will be 21% of sales in 2012 and will return to our target levels of 17% to 18% of sales in 2013.","Finally, regarding taxes, we expect to incur a $20 million to $30 million tax expense in Q2 for the integration and structuring of the Enobia acquisition. Excluding this charge, we continue to expect our 2012 GAAP tax rate of 32% to 34%. Our non-GAAP tax rate forecast of 8% to 10% remains unchanged.","Importantly, we expect to realize substantial long-term financial benefits from the structuring of our organization as we integrate Enobia.","Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2012. We are especially gratified at the discipline with which we are expecting our commercial platform in our development programs and the efficiency with which we are integrating our acquired drug candidates into a pipeline within our financial parameter.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David who will provide an update of our global commercial operations. David?","David Hallal","Thanks, Vikas. In the first quarter of 2012, global revenues from our Soliris operations increased by 47% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Q1 revenues reflect steady additions of new PNH patients in our core territories of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan augmented by a steady increase in new patients with aHUS commencing treatment with Soliris.","Looking more closely at PNH, we are gratified to observe the treatment is increasingly being optimized for patients. Through our disease awareness programs, we are discussing with physicians the large and growing body of clinical evidence regarding the morbidities and premature mortality associated with PNH and the positive long-term outcomes demonstrated with Soliris treatment.","Similarly, our diagnostic initiatives are aided by publications, which recommend testing for patients at higher likelihood for having the disease. Given the clinical evidence, more patients are being tested and if they are determined to have PNH, their physicians are more likely to rapidly initiate treatment with Soliris.","Our view of the global landscape remains unchanged. We continue to find that the majority of patients with PNH have not yet received an accurate diagnosis let alone are receiving appropriate treatment, even in those countries where we have been operating the longest.","As we expand our disease education and diagnostic efforts in both existing and new countries, we believe we will continue to transform the lives of more patients with PNH around the world.","Turning to aHUS, we are very pleased with the second full quarter of our aHUS launch with a steady addition of new patients beginning treatment with Soliris in Q1. Importantly, we note several dynamics from the early stages of our aHUS launch.","First, we are observing that patients who are receiving Soliris represent a broad range of ages and clinical profiles, including those with long-term disease and chronic kidney damage as well as those who are being identified during their first TMA clinical presentation.","Second, we continued to observe that a significant proportion of the new prescribers of Soliris for patients with aHUS are hematologists. Thus, we are able to apply our long-term presence in hematology for the benefit for both PNH and aHUS patients.","And third, our decision to expand our sales team in the United States has enabled us to grow our present and increase reach and frequency of our interaction amongst both hematologist and nephrologists, as each representative is able to focus on more physicians in a smaller geographic area.","Importantly, our aHUS disease awareness programs, which are focused on the morbidities and mortality of aHUS are underway and are being well received by physicians. These programs help educate physicians on the early signs and symptoms of aHUS, the role of chronic uncontrolled compliment activation as the underlying cause of TMA in these patients and the compelling clinical benefits that Soliris can provide to patient with aHUS by inhibiting compliment-mediated TMA.","Based up on the no natural history of aHUS, we identified two groups of patients with aHUS prior to launch. Patients with a longer duration of disease and substantial kidney damage and as expected a larger proportion of patients who are identified during their first TMA clinical presentation and require immediate medical intervention.","Before approval, we focused on being able to serve all patients with aHUS, including meeting the urgent needs of newly presenting patient. By developing a broad range of patient-centered initiatives in the areas of disease awareness, patient diagnosis, reimbursement support and providing supply of Soliris to treatment sites within hours.","For the implementation of these initiatives, we are currently supporting an increasing number of physicians as they identify emerging aHUS patients and seek to start them on Soliris therapy without delay.","We are pleased with the early positive impact that these initiatives are having on the patient care and look forward to serving more patients with aHUS in the United States overtime.","Turning briefly to our upcoming aHUS launch in Europe, we are on track with our reimbursement discussions with healthcare authorities in major European countries. We expect to start serving patients with aHUS in initial European countries later in 2012 with others commencing through mid-2013.","To prepare for our EU launches, we will start to expand our European field teams on a country-by-country basis with professionals who have experience in rare disorders and relevant medical specialty. As in the U.S., each member of our expanded European field teams will be fully cross trained on both PNH and aHUS and will manage a smaller territory than in the past.","While we expect that the initial use of Soliris and aHUS in Europe will grow only gradually due to the low prevalence and low awareness of the disease, we are confident that we will serve an increasing number of European patients with aHUS over time.","Turning now to HPP. In March, we attended the American College of Medical Genetics Meeting where we provided disease information and met with physicians who have experienced treating patients with HPP. Like PNH and aHUS, we know that HPP is often misunderstood given the rarity of the disorder and the wide range of its clinical signs.","Thus, we believe that disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives will be a critical component of our commercial program as we prepare for the potential introduction of asfotase alfa. As our clinical and regulatory teams drive the development program forward, the commercial team will continue to assess the needs of the HPP community as we prepare for the potential introduction of asfotase alfa.","Looking ahead, we are driving forward on every front to transform the lives of more patients in more countries who are suffering with PNH and aHUS while beginning to prepare for new Soliris indications and the launch of asfotase alfa. Driven by our commitment to patients and families, our global commercial operations team will continue to employ their experience, skills and talent to achieve our objectives for many years to come.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve, who\u2019ll review our expanding pipeline initiatives. Steve?","Steve Squinto","Thanks, David. In the first quarter of 2012, we continue to make substantial progress in our lead pipeline programs, which include five highly innovative compounds currently being investigated at various stages of development across eight severe and ultra-rare indications beyond PNH and aHUS.","I would first like to provide an update on our eculizumab programs, starting with STEC-HUS. Out of the total 198 patients enrolled in our STEC-HUS study in Germany, the interim data presented in November were from the 148 patients who were treated at the first nine clinical trial sites.","The interim data were very encouraging demonstrating that eculizumab treatment for eight-weeks substantially reduce the occurrence of serious morbidities in STEC-HUS patients. Interim data showed a rapid, large and sustained reduction in thrombotic microangiopathy or TMA and reversal of organ damage with eculizumab treatment.","Patients in the study were observed for 28 weeks following treatment initiation. We have now commenced the normal process of data collection and data cleaning for subsequent data base lock and analysis for the overall 198 patient intensive treat group.","After the final steps are concluded, we expect to have discussions with regulators regarding a pathway for filing an SPLA as early as the second half of this year. In our kidney transplant program with eculizumab, we continue to enroll patients in our company-sponsored multinational living donor kidney transplant trial in patients at elevated risk of antibody-mediated rejection.","Patients in this study are being dosed with eculizumab for nine weeks post-transplant and then will be observed for 52 weeks following transplant. In addition, we expect to initiate a disease donor study in the summer of this year.","We also have two neurology clinical development programs ongoing with eculizumab, in severe and refractory neuromyelitis optica and in myasthenia gravis. Data from the investigator initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of eculizumab in severe refractory NMO is expected to be presented at a scientific meeting in the second half of 2012. Even before these data are presented, we expect to hold a series of discussions with investigators to design the next study prior to our anticipated meeting with regulators.","With regard to myasthenia gravis, additional data from the 14 patient Phase 2 study are being presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting this month. We expect to discuss the plans for a larger perspective controlled study with regulators in 2012.","I would like to turn now to our other lead development program with highly innovative therapeutics beyond eculizumab, starting with asfotase alfa. We are highly encouraged by the progress made in asfotase alfa clinical development in just the first quarter of this year. It is noteworthy that this significant progress was demonstrated in the three distinct trials across a broad spectrum of HPP patients.","Turning first to pediatric patients. Our Phase 2 study of infants and young children with life-threatening HPP were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in March. Importantly, all the patients treated with asfotase alfa demonstrated an improvement in blood levels of PPI and PLP, two key biochemical indicators of HPP providing strong support for the potential of asfotase alfa to correct the underlying enzyme deficiency in patients with HPP.","The study made its primary end point with 90% of patients showing substantial skeletal healing at 24-weeks of treatment with asfotase alfa. In the study, skeletal healing became apparent as early as week three. All patients treated with asfotase alfa also had an improvement in respiratory function and patients also demonstrated improvements in fine motor and gross motor function and cognitive development. These findings are remarkable given the historically grim outlook for patients with life threatening HPP.","Also in pediatrics, data in juveniles were presented at the Sanford Burnham Rare Disease Day Symposium in February. Data showed that all patients who were treated with asfotase alfa had an objective response to therapy, with clinically and statistically meaningful decreases in enzyme substrate. These biochemical improvements were accompanied by improvement in bone mineralization as evidence by both bone biopsy and radiographic improvement. In addition, asfotase alfa-treated patients showed a marked improvement in physical function as measured by the six minute walk test.","In Q1, clinical data were also presented for the first time from the Phase II study of asfotase alfa in Adolescents and Adult with HPP at the American College of Medical Genetics meeting in March. In this study, all patients were treated with asfotase alfa, had an objective response to therapy with clinically and statistically meaningful decreases in enzyme substrate. And these biochemical improvements were accompanied by improvement in patient\u2019s physical function as demonstrated by an improvement in the six minute walk test.","Based on the significant accomplishments during the first quarter, we are accelerating the development of asfotase alfa as a treatment for a broad spectrum of HPP patients. Our efforts remained focused on three key areas.","First, we are optimizing the commercial scale manufacturing process to ensure our ability to provide long-term support to the HPP community.","Second, we are completing the clinical development program in children prior to an anticipated regulatory filing for pediatric patients in 2014. We will have further discussions with regulators regarding the studies required for registration in pediatrics and expect to complete a natural history study in infants to supplement the existing open label trial.","And third, our expanding adult program will now be further informed by the encouraging Phase 2 data. We continue to expect that we will need to initiate a placebo-controlled study in adults with severe HPP to support registration in this patient population. I look forward to updating you on our asfotase alfa program on future calls.","Beyond acetate alpha, we are also evaluating three additional highly innovative therapeutics as treatment for patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders. We are pleased that these cover a wide range of therapeutic areas, enabling us to employ our skills in developing ultra-orphan therapies to a growing universe of patients.","Looking briefly at these programs, first, in our new metabolic disease area, which includes asfotase alfa, we are also accelerating the development of our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A, a severe ultra-rare and genetic metabolic disorder that is fatal in newborns.","In 2011, we made substantial progress on our GMP manufacturing process for our cPMP replacement therapy. Following successful completion of the initial cGMP manufacturing runs at the end of last year, we now have commenced pre-IND toxicology studies. Additionally, we\u2019re also now increasing our cPMP manufacturing to provide sufficient supplies to commence clinical studies in early 2013.","Second, we continue to enroll patients in a Phase I study to characterize the mechanism of action of ALXN1102 formally known as TT30 and to develop initial safety data. As a remainder, ALXN1102 is a unique inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway with a mechanism of action different from Soliris and thus build on our world-class expertise in complement biology. Once we have the data from the study, we can better evaluate the overall therapeutic potential of ALXN1102, for various disease targets.","Lastly, we continue to enroll subjects in a Phase I clinical study of ALXN1007, a novel anti-inflammatory antibody, which is a product of our antibody discovery technologies. This Phase I study is evaluating the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this compound in healthy volunteers.","I would like to turn briefly to the multi-factorial disease age-related macular degeneration. Importantly, eculizumab or AMD does not fit within our core mission of developing life transforming therapies for patients with severe ultra-rare and life-threatening disorders. I would note that data from the investigator initiated study of intravenous eculizumab in patients with dry AMD will be available at the ARVO Conference on May 7th.","As a remainder, this is an investigator-initiated exploratory study designed to test the stomach, but not direct intraocular complement inhibition in patients with dry AMD. These data will help determine whether or not complement inhibition plays a role in dry AMD. We expect to review our options for this program later this year.","In closing, I\u2019m proud that Alexion\u2019s R&D team continues to be driven via passion and an urgency to help patients and families suffering with severe and ultra-rare disorders. I look forward to updating you on our progress on future conference call.","I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Steve. Out strong start to 2012 positions us to keep executing rapidly on our key objectives throughout the year. We are pleased that we continue to serve an increasing number of patients with PNH and now aHUS, and we\u2019ll continue accelerating our development programs with a goal of rapidly brining life-transforming innovations to more patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders.","As always, we thank all those who make our work possible, our employees, researchers and physicians around the world and of course, patients and their families who are always at the forefronts of what we do.","Operator, we will now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thanks very much and congrats on another good quarter. I guess, just two questions for me, one is that the first quarter historically is typically the weakest quarter-over-quarter sales that we see. I guess, is there any reason why 1Q 2012 would be different. And then just digging into aHUS a little bit more, you talked about these patients, this large proportion of patients that are this urgent need bucket. Can you give us a little bit more color on who sees those patients and how your approach might be different in helping to educate those physicians, are they more of nephrologists for example. Thanks.","Leonard Bell","Thanks very much, Rachel. I\u2019ll handle the first and Dave, do you want to handle the second?","David Hallal","Yeah.","Leonard Bell","So no, actually we have a very encouraging view of the remainder of 2012 which is -- as we mentioned why we\u2019ve raised our revenue guidance. So we anticipate further growth in -- as we may clear in the call. I think we see that growth coming now from both PNH and as we have greater visibility to aHUS we feel comfortable there as well.","David Hallal ","And then Rachel, regarding the sort of the emergent patients, we\u2019re actually seeing both hemes and nephs and that really depends on who has called in for the consult. There are both hematologic and renal complications obviously associated with TMA. And therefore, it really depends upon where that referral is made and that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to reach out to as many hematologists and nephrologists as we can. And one other dynamic as it is their first TMA clinical presentation. In this case, we tend to identify the patients as the physician is also rapidly making a diagnosis and moving to treatment.","Leonard Bell","Perhaps, certainly the most important dynamic, which I think David also mentioned on the call, Rachel that we\u2019re able to supply treatment very rapidly and within -- as David said, within hours. And we think that actually is being very attentive to the urgency of situation and we\u2019re very, very excited to the progress that we\u2019re being able to make on patient care.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company","Good morning, team. It seems like steady is the word of today at Alexion and like steady PNH new patients adds is certainly a considerable accomplishment at this stage of that market\u2019s trajectory. But I guess, I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s steady means and aHUS the more nascent market. Does that mean that new patient starts were the same in Q1 versus Q4 and if so, what kind has been your biggest barrier there?","Leonard Bell","Yeah. It\u2019s a steady question that will be asking us. I anticipate being asked that steady question several times when the steady quarters evolve. But no, I think that we are very, very encouraged really by the growth we\u2019ve seen in aHUS Q1 on Q4. We think it shows that we are starting to get strong legs as we built out further and further initiatives to help patients rapidly get treatment.","And I think as we saw early on PNH and maybe we\u2019re seeing it a little more clearly here in aHUS is that a few quarters in we\u2019ll start getting a meaningful visibility. So I think that we see steady growth going forward.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company","Okay. Thanks for the color. One follow-up may be for David. He mentioned that this aHUS market is sort of bifurcated into those with longer term previously diagnosed disease versus those who are now the first presentation crisis mode. Can you give us any few on of the patients who are on Soliris today which of these two markets that are coming from, and what your thought is over the next 12 months, whether there might be a differential in split between the two?","David Hallal","Yeah. Well, the other word you used to love Eric was gradual. Typically, you\u2019re sort of partially retired for the call. But based on the fact that there is low prevalence of the disease, we thought that there was unlike PNH where the majority of early patients that we started were from a prevalent pool, we actually saw some balance here early on. Some patients were longer term diseased and then the balance of starting to drove off of the proportion of patients with the emergent diseases.","So we\u2019re actually seeing relative balance at this point, would expect moving forward maybe a larger proportion maybe coming from those newly presenting patients.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. One for you on asfotase alfa, so it looks like filing in 2014 as what you guys have consistently said, may be help us with what the gating factor is, is it just waiting for the natural history study to mature or from a regulatory perspective, do you have to have full optimization of manufacturing prior to filing.","David Hallal","","Well, I think to start with the manufacturing, there already is a commercial scale manufacturing in place that we think we\u2019ll -- obviously support finishing the clinical development programs, but also will support early market launch as well. We are making modifications to it but the process already is in place.","In terms of further clinical development, I think as I mentioned on the call this morning, based on conversations that the Enobia team had with regulators prior to the acquisition. We do intend to initiate a natural history study in infants and it\u2019s also likely that we\u2019ll initiate a placebo-controlled juvenile trial as well, which will be another six months of therapy.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","And those things will be included in the 2014 filing or are those separate?","David Hallal","I think that will be supportive.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And just a follow-up for Vikas, any updates and progress for collections in Europe when you look at accounts receivable DSO, you are still up marginally on a sequential basis?","Vikas Sinha","Geoff, when I look at sequentially Q4 to Q1 without the VAT in the numbers they are more or less flat between the quarters. But definitely we have on our side increased our activities in collecting in two key areas that are Italy and Spain and which are actually showing good results right now.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JPMorgan","Got you. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Sapna Srivastava with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Yogesh Ahuja \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, guys. This is Yogesh on behalf of Sapna. Congrats on other good quarter. And thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the aHUS launch, in terms of patients with an already known, diagnosed in aHUS, are you seeing any difference in uptick in the so called plasma resistant or plasma sensitive patients or in those with known mutations and those that don\u2019t?","And then also any idea as to what we should expect from interim data in the transplant trials? Thanks.","David Hallal","Yeah. So I\u2019ll take the aHUS question. We actually are seeing both patients with existing disease, who have longer term disease and more chronic kidney damage associated with their disease progression, those fitting more that plasma sensitive group. We see those patients benefiting from treatment as their -- clearly, as data that suggested those patients are benefiting from long-term Soliris treatment.","And we\u2019re seeing patients go right to Soliris not even necessarily having plasma exchange and then of course, we do see some that start on some plasma exchange and then very quickly move to Soliris. So again, we\u2019re seeing relative balance across the spectrum.","Steve Squinto","To your question regarding transplantation, we don\u2019t expect interim data to be presented in the transplant program. We\u2019re enrolling patients as we said on the call and probably would expect to be enrolling patients into 2013 as well.","Yogesh Ahuja \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from the line Salveen Richter with Canaccord. Please proceed.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord","Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019m just wondering if there is a difference in messaging and education to physicians that treat the critical care patient bucket versus those with more advanced disease and then have you had any commercial aHUS patients come on board in the EU?","David Hallal","Yeah. So the messaging obviously based on the breadth of our clinical trial program where patients were treated very late and some patients were treated earlier. Obviously, our messaging is that Soliris in general can provide compelling clinical benefits to patients with aHUS and the earlier you get there the better.","But even for patients with longer term disease with long-term treatment benefits are being seen. Right now as it relates to the EU -- very few patients, really some initial patients in Germany and as I discussed on the call, we\u2019re engaging in reimbursement discussions right now with key European countries, we would expect adding more patients later on in 2012 and into 2013.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord","Okay. And then David, are you getting any pushback on physician misconceptions of the disease or do you feel like you\u2019ve addressed a lot of that part of the story?","David Hallal","Well, as it relates to pushback with the rare disease, I think even as we\u2019re in our fifth, sixth year with PNH, a lot of education is required. And we clearly for example are educating not just about thrombotic microangiopathy. But what is the underlying cause of it and when it\u2019s chronic uncontrolled complement activation it certainly points to aHUS.","So I think significant misconceptions clearly what we see in the marketplace exist and a long-term disease education program I think will make a meaningful difference and we\u2019re seeing very, very nice early impact so far.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord","All right. Thank you.","David Hallal","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays. Please proceed.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays","","Hi. Good morning, guys. Congratulations also on the quarter. Quantitatively, can you give us a little bit color around the ramp up for aHUS compared to what you saw in PNH back in 2007?","Steve Squinto ","I think, what we\u2019ve described before of course is unfortunately because more than one-half of aHUS patients either suffer end-stage renal disease, permanent kidney damage or die in the first year of diagnosis. We had anticipated and projected that there will be a gradual update of new patients. And I think that as we are out in the market, we\u2019re certainly very encouraged by the need to as rapidly as possible meet a significant number of patients needs that we see in United States. So we\u2019ve -- on that basis as we mentioned we\u2019ve also increased our guidance for 2012.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is (inaudible) calling for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. How should we think about pricing and reimbursement in EU, and given the tougher pricing environment in Europe compared to perhaps your previous negations there particularly countries like Germany and maybe additional color on timeline for country-by-country launch in Europe would be very helpful? Thank you.","Leonard Bell","Sure. Thank you very much for your question. I think just a key perspective remarkably and virtually all of licensed commercial experience and accomplishments they have coincided with a severe global financial crisis.","I\u2019d just remind people, we initiated our European country launches largely during 2008, 2009 and this is what many of us recall the time and cataclysm with banking crisis, across all the European countries as well as some of us may remember on the call in the United States, there was a housing of credit to backhaul that occurred as well.","And all of that actually, we established our commercial operations across the European Continent in that context. And successfully navigated through those world changing events by keeping our focus on identifying patients who have a life threatening and very rare disorder, providing them a treatment, which will be able to describe some market and transformational impact on their lives.","So as simply in 2012, we don\u2019t really see overall macro environment equal to what we saw in 2008 quite frankly. We see there is meaningfully more favorable than what we saw earlier. And then in that context, we also are increasingly focused in patients with aHUS, for example, who have clearly as we have marked several times.","More than half of these patients which of course includes a disproportionate number of children will unfortunately either have end-stage renal disease, permanent kidney damage or die within a year.","So we\u2019re encouraged by what we see. We obviously understand the processes on a country-by-country basis very well. And we\u2019re encouraged by the focus of governments continually since 2008 in the midst of the post financial crisis to really focus on the well-being of their systems.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, two quick ones on aHUS you had mentioned earlier upon approval that children dose or infant dose was 75% to 85% of the adult dose. I was wondering if you could give color on the average dose you\u2019re staying in aHUS patients or at least in children?","And second, you mentioned your diagnostic initiatives continuing to grow use of PNH -- use of Soliris in PNH. I was just wondering what is the bottleneck like, when do you expect sort of diagnostic to tick off or just will it be slow and steady as you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times or is there something that\u2019s really keeping doctors back from correctly diagnosing these patients.","Leonard Bell","So in regard to Robyn, -- it\u2019s Lenny. So regard to the question about aHUS, we actually commented that it was that dose in children can be 80% lower than the dose in adult as opposed to 80% of the adult dose, right. So it actually is only about 20% -- 15% to 20% of the adult dose in the smallest children.","And increasingly, we see of course, as we mentioned called urgently to meet the needs of children whether it should be based on their first presentation, whether it\u2019s unfortunately after -- it\u2019s survived the initial presentation but now unfortunately transplantation and all of the situation, of course the dosage is much, much less and that obviously has implications outside United States for governments who of course can treatment of their patients who are children, which I think are all very much favor of this as well as proven adults.","As regards to the PNH, I will turn it over to David to talk about the diagnostics efforts. But I would actually mention that at least we\u2019ve improved from a gradual to steady, so that\u2019s an improvement there. David?","David Hallal","Sure. As Lenny and I discussed during the call, when we think about the disease in general, there are still patients who medical literature suggests have signs, symptoms or another diagnosis, which suggest that they are at highly likelihood for having PNH and what we are finding in our core territories and new countries as well, the opportunity to educate physicians on those patients who need testing. And we continue to see a steady rise in testing amongst physicians and then once they do identify patients with PNH, they certainly are most apt to rapidly start them on treatment.","Steve Squinto","","One other, just closing to David\u2019s comments for diagnosis in PNH, it really is quite meaningful that 20 quarters into the launch, for example, from a more mature communities that we work in like United States, for example, still actually a majority of patients who commence treatment with Soliris are newly identified and newly diagnosed. So it is remarkable. It also indicates that underscores our view of a steady growth for a longer period to go.","Robyn Karnauskas \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Please proceed.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys and congrats on the good quarter here. Steve, you mentioned AMD, I appreciate the comments there. Just wondering if you could may be go one step deeper here. Given the mechanism, while the result of the investigator lead eculizumab trial fare up on new development plans for 1102.","You mentioned a slightly different mechanism, do you think if there is direct read across from the eculizumab data to potential for 1102. It sounds like the -- you might view the trial here as potentially proof of concept but in general, I was wondering if you can may be talk about that and may be talk about where you think this indication fits into your R&D priority? Thanks.","Steve Squinto","Yeah. I think a couple of things. The first comment I\u2019ll make is that you asked about the mechanism of action. Age-related macular degeneration generally is an extraordinarily complex disease. We have wet, we have dry forms, than within the drive forms you have geographic atrophy drusen.","I think unlike a lot of other diseases we study, I think mechanistically we know much, much less about what\u2019s really happening in AMD. And I think at this point, it\u2019s sort of too early to make comments about whether there might be learnings from this trial that might apply to ALXN1102.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Swann. Please proceed.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","Thanks very much. I know it\u2019s the early days, but I was wondering if you can talk about any experience of discontinuations on Soliris among aHUS patients, for example if you get a patient in a critical stage, how long do they typically stay on Soliris?","Steve Squinto","Yeah. Well, Howard as we had anticipated, compliances is generally good in patients diagnosed with aHUS and what we\u2019re finding is that it appears to be similar to the high levels that we have grown accustomed to observing in PNH over the past several years.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","Thanks.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Art \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hi. This is [Art] here for Geoff. Just a few question, first of all do you guys know what the impact of FX was in Q1?","And second, since you already had a lot of time to explore the HPP opportunity. Can you provide maybe a little bit of additional guidance of how big the HPP population is in pediatric, juvenile and adult? Thank you.","Steve Squinto","I can answer the second question and if you like, we actually don\u2019t provide patient numbers, regarding ultra-orphan disorders and it\u2019s still too early to be able to provide that sort of sense.","David Hallal","Let me try and answer the first one. From Q4 to Q1, between the several currencies that we deal with, we didn\u2019t see much of an impact on FX, but we definitely see going from Q1 to Q2, the currency is under pressure and we definitely see 2% to 3% FX impact coming in.","Art \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference.

Go ahead, ma'am.","Susan Altschuller - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Gigi. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the second quarter of 2018. Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer; John Orloff, our Global Head of R&D; and Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial Officer. You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Event section of our Investor Relations webpage on our website.","Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional details. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today, and we undertake no duty to update any of the statements after the call, except as required by law.","I'd also like to remind you that we'll be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to but not as a substitute for our GAAP results. Thank you.","Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Susan, and thank you for joining us this morning. We're very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, delivering strong top- and bottom-line growth as we continue to advance our leadership position in rare diseases. We've made significant progress executing on our 2018 key objectives to drive sustainability long term.","First, our Complement and Metabolic portfolios continued to deliver, including year-over-year revenue growth of 14% and volume growth of 16% with PNH, aHUS, gMG and our metabolic franchise all-important contributors to this growth.","Second, with gMG we're on track to meet our ambition of being the best Soliris launch. We continue to be encouraged, as we add new patients, particularly in the U.S. We will apply our capabilities from gMG towards the ALXN1210 launch.","Third, based on the positive data from both the ALXN1210 PNH Phase 3 naive and switch studies, which collectively comprised the largest ever PNH clinical trial program, we've completed U.S. and EU regulatory submissions and are planning for our first launches next year, pending regulatory approvals.","Filing in Japan is also on track for the second half of this year. In addition to the potential to provide an important new treatment option for PNH patients, ALXN1210 provides an extremely strong foundation for continued expansion of our Complement leadership. I look forward to John and Brian providing detail on the full ALXN1210 development programs, as well as our launch plans later in the call.","Fourth, rebuilding our pipeline is a key objective. And in the second quarter we completed the Wilson Therapeutics acquisition and began a collaboration with Complement Pharma. With WTX101, we believe we have a differentiated asset with potential to become the standard of care for Wilson's disease. I'm pleased to announce we're now powering the Phase III study for superiority and are evaluating other trial enhancements. In addition, we are actively evaluating other opportunities to build out our pipeline and hope to provide additional updates over the course of the year.","And fifth, once again we delivered very strong financial performance and have updated our guidance to reflect the strength of both the top and bottom line.","Clearly this is a great second quarter and we've accomplished a lot in the first half of this year, including the continued strengthening of our culture, our compliance and the opening of our new global corporate headquarters in Boston. And we remain focused on building on this momentum. As always, we will do so by following our mission to transform the lives of patients and their families affected by rare and devastating diseases.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss the second quarter financial results and to provide details on our updated guidance. Paul?","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Ludwig. This was a strong quarter. I'm happy to provide more color on our financial performance.","Starting with slide 7, we reported total revenues in the quarter of $1.045 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in Soliris in the Metabolic franchise. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 54.3% in the second quarter, an expansion of 719 basis points. This is above our goal to achieve 50% operating margin in 2019. We're anticipating a lower operating margin in the back half of the year, owing to increased R&D investment, driven by WTX101 Phase 3 trial, expansion of ALXN1210 program into gMG in subcutaneous formulations and spend earmarked for business development activities. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 33%, driven largely by top-line strength, in addition to strong operating expense control.","As we reported in our press release this morning, we're increasing our full-year 2018 guidance to reflect continued momentum in the business.","Moving to slide 8. Net product sales were driven by volume growth of 16% and an FX tailwind of 1%, partially offset by a price headwind of 2%. Second quarter revenues were favorably impacted by tender orders in rest of world markets compared to the first quarter of 2018 and also included an approximately $18 million benefit related to order timing ahead of the July 4 holiday in the United States. This will likely be a headwind in Q3.","Turning to slide 9, Soliris revenue in the second quarter was $898 million with year-over-year volume growth of 11%. Second quarter results were favorably impacted by tender orders in rest of world markets as mentioned, compared to the first quarter of 2018, and included approximately $9 million due to the order timing ahead of July 4.","Moving to slide 10, Strensiq remains a key driver of growth, and we reported revenues of $125 million in Q2, representing 50% revenue growth and 55% volume growth year-over-year. The second quarter included approximately $8 million due to order timing ahead of the July 4 holiday. We reported Q2 Kanuma revenues of $21 million, a 40% revenue growth and 51% volume growth year over year.","Turning to the P&L on slide 11. During the quarter non-GAAP R&D was $158 million, or 15% of revenues. Spend was lower than anticipated, driven by timing of clinical supply orders, lower program spend and lower workforce costs. GAAP acquired in-process R&D expense was $804 million, owing to the value of the in-process research and development asset acquired in connection with Wilson Therapeutics acquisition.","Non-GAAP SG&A was $230 million or 22% of revenue. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 14%. We reported second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.07, growing 33% year-over-year. GAAP EPS was negative $2.05, which is inclusive of the Wilson Therapeutics IP R&D expense.","During the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $358 million excluding the cash paid for Wilson. In June, we amended and restated our prior credit agreement. The new agreement provides for a $2.6 billion term loan facility and a $1 billion revolving credit facility. We drew $250 million against the revolving credit facility in the quarter. We ended Q2 with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities.","So let's now turn to slide 12, which outlines our updated financial guidance. We're increasing our topline revenue guidance to a range between $3.980 billion and $4.010 billion, which represents 13% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. For Soliris, our revenue guidance is $3.420 billion to $3.440 billion, an increase over prior guidance due to the growing contribution from gMG.","Turning to Metabolics, our revenue guidance is $560 million to $570 million, reflecting continued momentum in Strensiq. We now see Strensiq itself as providing nearly half a billion dollars of revenue this year. We estimate price will be a 3% headwind in 2018. This is unchanged from previous guidance, with two-thirds attributable to Soliris and one-third attributable to Metabolics business. We now forecast FX impact for 2018 to represent a roughly $25 million tailwind using current FX rates.","GAAP operating margin is expected to be 11% to 14%, which is inclusive of the Wilson acquisition as well as restructuring and related expenses. We're increasing our non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 49% to 50%, representing approximately 400 to 500 basis point expansion over 2017. This is inclusive of R&D spend of 18% to 19% of revenues and includes ongoing expenses for WTX101, additional ALXN1210 programs and spend earmarked for business development.","At the midpoint of this guidance, non-GAAP operating profit is expected to grow 24% year-over-year. We're forecasting a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 14.5% to 15.5%. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $1.25 to $1.50 per share. Non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be between $7.00 and $7.15 per share, and at the midpoint of the range, this is approximately 21% growth year-over-year.","With the strong first half of the year, we're well-positioned as we move into the second half, and we're really proud of the progress as we continue to execute on all five of the key initiatives that we laid out at the beginning of this year.","I'll turn the call over to John.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. We've made significant progress advancing our pipeline, in particular with ALXN1210 and WTX101, and as you see on slide 14, we have a number of upcoming trial initiations and data readouts.","Starting with our first ALXN1210 indication, PNH. As planned in the second quarter of this year, we filed for approval in the U.S., where we used a priority review voucher, and in Europe, and we look forward to working with regulators as they review our applications. Additionally, we remain on track to file for regulatory approval in Japan in the second half of this year.","For our second ALXN1210 indication, atypical HUS, enrollment is complete in our Phase 3 study, and we now plan to report results in early 2019, putting us on track to file atypical HUS regulatory submissions following approvals in PNH.","Moving to Soliris and relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD, we are happy to report that the final study visit for the last patient just occurred, and the PREVENT trial is now complete. Given the primary endpoint was time to first relapse, the trial required all patients remaining in the study to come in for final evaluations, and there is, therefore, a large bolus of data to be analyzed. We are now working diligently with all study sites and are anticipating a database lock in the coming months and results later this year. I'd like to emphasize that Alexion investigators and patients remain completely blinded to study results at this time.","We continue to raise the bar with ALXN1210 by developing multiple subcutaneous formulations to provide additional treatment options for patients. By the end of this year we plan to initiate a Phase 3 bridging study with subcutaneous ALXN1210 designed for once-weekly dosing. In addition, we filed a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, in the EU for subcutaneous ALXN1210 co-administered with Halozyme's ENHANZE technology PH20 and plan to initiate a Phase 1 study later this year. Pending co-formulation, this next-generation subcutaneous formulation will be called ALXN1810 and could potentially reduce dosing to every other week or once monthly.","Following the second quarter completion of our acquisition of Wilson Therapeutics, we now have an additional Phase 3 asset in WTX101. We also began a collaboration with Complement Pharma to codevelop CP010, a pre-clinical development inhibitor, a complement inhibitor targeting C6 for neurological disorders.","Slide 15 depicts the Phase 3 study design for ALXN1210 in adolescent and adult patients with atypical HUS. This is a single arm, multi-center study with the primary endpoint being a measure of complete TMA response, which is a combination of important improvements in both hematologic and renal parameters. We also look at a number of secondary endpoints, including kidney function. The filing will be an sBLA submission following PNH approval.","Now turning to slide 16. We're excited to advance another Phase 3 program and look forward to applying our clinical and regulatory expertise to bring a new potential standard of care to patients with Wilson disease. We believe WTX101 has a differentiated profile which we plan to demonstrate by now powering the Phase 3 study for superiority. We are also evaluating additional data generation to further differentiate 101, including a potential liver biopsy study. With the changes to the Phase 3 trial, we now expect enrollment timing to modestly increase and plan to file for regulatory approval with the required one-year Phase 3 data in 2021.","Turning to slide 17, this quarter we began a collaboration with Complement Pharma to co-develop CP010, a pre-clinical C6 complement inhibitor for neurological disorders. It is believed that C6 is primarily produced in the liver and subsequently crosses the blood brain barrier to enter the central nervous system. CP010 binds to this peripherally produced C6 and has the potential to decrease the level of C6 in the CNS, resulting in inhibited formation of the membrane attack complex, or MAC. While we continue to focus our BD strategy on building out our clinical stage pipeline, this preclinical collaboration is a strong strategic fit with our internal research programs and complement expertise. I look forward to providing you with further updates on these programs throughout the year.","With that I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the commercial highlights for the quarter. Brian?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, John. I'll start by providing an overview of our Soliris franchise, including an update on our gMG launch and then cover our Metabolic portfolio performance.","Starting with Soliris on slide 19, building on our foundation, which we've established over our 11 years on the market, we continue to identify new patients with PNH and aHUS. I'm pleased to report that in the United States we saw the highest number of new patient starts and net patient additions in PNH since our launch in 2007. In addition to our core indications of PNH and aHUS, we've been able to further grow our Soliris family of patients with our launch into MG, which is becoming an increasing contributor to Soliris revenue growth, and we expect this to continue going forward.","Slide 20 provides an update on MG growth in U.S. in the quarter. Given our adoption trends to date, we believe MG will outpace our launches in PNH and aHUS. We continue to increase the number of treated patients each month. As of the end of June in the U.S., we had 676 patients enrolled in one source, including 375 on therapy.","Turning now to slide 21. Here I'd highlight that 26% of prescribing physicians have now treated more than one patient. This trend, coupled with our efforts to expand commercial access now at 85% of covered lives in the U.S., gives us confidence in the ongoing trajectory of Soliris and MG.","While our U.S. launch is progressing ahead of our expectations, we continue to focus and refine our efforts in Japan and Germany. In Germany, we continue to see slower uptake, which was largely expected due to the lack of clinical trial experience in the region. In both Germany and Japan, we've launched new sales initiatives based, in large part, on our learnings from the U.S. Our dedicated neurology sales force is actively educating neurologists, including neuromuscular specialists, on the role of complement-mediated disruption of the neuromuscular junction in gMG as well as on the benefits of complement inhibition with Soliris.","Moving now to our Metabolics franchise starting with Strensiq on slide 22. We reported $125 million in revenue this quarter, and we now expect Strensiq revenues for the full year to be nearly $0.5 billion, which highlights our confidence in its continued performance. The sales trajectory is another powerful example of our demonstrated launch excellence, and we see significant growth opportunities ahead.","Looking at Kanuma on slide 23, we continue to expand lab testing to target an enriched patient population that are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D, such as those with NASH, NAFLD and familial hypercholesterolemia who have elevated ALT and LDL levels. We remain focused on securing new funding agreements in additional countries to expand access to this transformative medicine. I'm very proud of our global team, and I want to thank them for their tireless efforts to bring our three therapies to patients in need across five rare diseases.","Given the excitement and interest in the upcoming launch of ALXN1210 and PNH, John and I will now take you through a more detailed update on our ALXN1210 launch plans as well as the broader ALXN1210 development program.","John?","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. As we work toward our first ALXN1210 approval, we want to take the opportunity to discuss how we expect the ALXN1210 value proposition will meet the needs of physicians, patients and payers and how we intend to elevate the standard-of-care with our broader suite of ALXN1210 development programs.","As you may recall, as shown on slide 25, the ALXN1210 Phase 3 PNH program evaluated more than 440 patients in two studies, one in patients who had never received a complement inhibitor and one in patients who were stable on Soliris and switched to ALXN1210. In both of these Phase 3 studies, which collectively comprised the largest PNH clinical program ever conducted, ALXN1210 demonstrated noninferiority to Soliris across all 11 of the program's primary and key secondary endpoints. Importantly, immediate and complete C5 inhibition was observed and sustained throughout the entire 26-week treatment period. In addition, ALXN1210 had a safety profile consistent with that of Soliris. There were no reported cases of meningococcal infections in either of the Phase 3 studies, and there have been no further cases reported in the extension studies thus far. In total, we have more than 400 patient years of exposure across the entire ALXN1210 program.","Slide 26 shows the breadth of our work with ALXN1210 and how we plan to advance the standard-of-care with multiple next-generation programs, expanding into new modalities and additional indications over the next few years. As mentioned previously, we're expecting our first launches for ALXN1210 and PNH next year, pending approvals. We plan to file for approval for our second ALXN1210 indication, atypical HUS, in the first half of 2019 pending Phase 3 results and following approval in PNH. In parallel, we are progressing our higher concentration formulation, 100 mgs per ml, in order to reduce infusion times for patients.","Moving beyond 2019, we plan to further expand options for patients with multiple subcutaneous programs. We have an opportunity to provide another needed treatment option to patients with the initiation of our Phase 3 bridging study for once-weekly ALXN1210 subcutaneous later this year and a potential filing in 2020. We also continue to progress our second sub-Q program, ALXN1810, which is planned to be a coformulation of ALXN1210 and PH20 that could further extend the dosing interval to either every other week or once monthly.","We intend to initiate a Phase 3 trial of ALXN1210 IV in myasthenia gravis later this year, with the potential to file in late 2021 or early 2022.","So as you can see across the suite of programs, we are dedicated to raising the bar in complement innovation and are planning to provide a broad portfolio of treatment options to elevate the standard of care.","And now I'll turn the call back to Brian to further discuss ALXN1210's differentiated profile. Brian?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, John. Moving to slide 27, let me highlight the key attributes of ALXN1210 that we believe support a compelling value proposition. First, as John just highlighted, ALXN1210 has a strong clinical profile, given the data generated across two large Phase 3 trials in very diverse patient populations. Second, with every eight-week dosing we believe we will significantly reduce the treatment burden for patients. And third, weight-based dosing ensured complete complement inhibition in all patients.","Moving now to slide 28. The strongly differentiated profile addresses many of the needs of physicians, patients and payers. First, important to the physician community is the totality of the clinical data, which includes several key measures including LDH levels, transfusion avoidance and controlling breakthrough hemolysis. We saw strong clinical results on all three of these critical disease measures in our Phase 3 ALXN1210 PNH studies.","We consistently hear from patients the desire to minimize the burden of treating their disease and to have an extended therapy. ALXN1210's every eight-week dosing reduces the number of infusions, which could reduce the burden of treatment. Also, its complete C5 inhibition over eight weeks with no deviations could protect patients from breakthrough hemolysis. In our ALXN1210 Phase 3 studies trials, all but one patient continued in the extension studies, which indicates significant patient interest in ALXN1210 treatment.","Payers prioritize the totality of the clinical data and the predictability of treatment costs. Payers will look at total disease burden and cost of the system. With that in mind, we plan to partner with payers across the globe to convey ALXN1210's strong value proposition. While we're still generating extensive market research, our initial finding suggests strong physician and patient engagement supportive of adoption. Over 90% of PNH patients surveyed prefer ALXN1210's two-hour infusion every eight weeks. Additionally, more than two thirds of PNH patients surveyed had interest in trying an IV treatment dosed every eight weeks within one to two months of new product launch. Physicians surveyed saw an opportunity for spontaneous switching in over a quarter of their patients, suggesting strong initial interest shortly after launch. We also found more than two thirds of initial target physicians would switch some or all of their existing patients to ALXN1210. We view the data shared today as a positive initial read on the potential market receptivity to ALXN1210, giving us confidence in our ability to facilitate rapid PNH patient conversion.","Turning to slide 29. Given our decade-plus of experience with Soliris, we are uniquely positioned in the complement space to deliver a new standard of care to patients with the launch of ALXN1210.","We continue to charge towards a potential launch in PNH in early 2019 and advance our ALXN1210 pipeline to pursue additional indications, as well as subcutaneous delivery options. With each of these programs, we plan to further address patient, physician and payer needs, bringing new treatment options to our growing family of patients and striving to elevate the standard of care.","I'll now turn the call back to Ludwig for closing remarks. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. Let me close by reflecting not only on the past quarter, but on the past year when we first laid out our strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. Thanks to this team and to our talented employees around the world, we have established a strong foundation that positions Alexion well for the future. And as you can see here, we have made tremendous progress towards our 2018 goals. I would also like to thank our patients and their families around the world for the critical role they play in making our work possible.","In summary, I'm very pleased with our momentum. And most importantly, I'm inspired by our team's steadfast commitment to providing life-changing therapies for rare disease patients and their families.","With that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now turn to the question-and-answer portion of our call. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated. In order to accommodate as many people as possible, please limit your question to one.","Our first question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much, and congratulations on all the accomplishments and excellent operating results this quarter. A couple of questions, quickly. First, on the high concentration formulation, wondering if, John, you could give me a sense of what that would reduce the infusion time for ALXN1210 from and to, meaning what you're observing now that you've had all this clinical trial experience with current formulation and what it might go to. And then, just Paul, if you could just give us a little bit more clarity about \u2013 it looks as though gMG contributed about $30 million in sequential growth in the U.S. And just wondering if that's about the right number and then, what the implied underlying growth rate of the business in the U.S. is, ex-gMG. Thanks.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, Geoff , thanks. This is John. With regard to the current formulation in the Phase 3 program with ALXN1210, infusion times were approximately two hours, and that's given every eight weeks. With the newer higher concentration formulation, 100 mgs per ml, we hope to reduce that to below one hour, approximately 45 minutes.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Geoff, in the second part of your question, you're pretty close on the gMG. We're not giving revenue numbers as you know, but the patient numbers \u2013 we ended the quarter at 375 in the United States. We started a little bit below 200 in the United States, so you can kind of do that math. The lion's share of gMG comes from the United States business.","In terms of implied underlying growth, we've kind of talked about these numbers over the last number of quarters. If you strip out and try to, kind of, do apples-to-apples on all the dynamics on a quarter-to-quarter basis, in the second quarter for PNH and aHUS we saw underlying volume growth in the very high single digits. That's a modest attenuation from what we've seen in the last couple of quarters. I'd say the biggest factor that is changing that is rest of the world. As we've pointed out before, what was previously a key driver of growth, we see it as the geography that's got the lowest amount of growth.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And Paul, every quarter our base is bigger and bigger.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. Absolutely.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Geoff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Harrison for Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking the questions. I guess two for me. Paul, could you talk about how large were some of these tender orders that you received in the quarter? And it sounds like you think that should reverse next quarter, so maybe just give us an idea of what that swap will be.","And then second, on the Wilson trial, just remind us here about how many more patients you think you need to enroll and what additional endpoints, including the liver biopsy, that you need to maybe drive a superior result. Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Matt, for the first part of your question \u2013 this is Paul \u2013 I would characterize the benefit in the second quarter from tenders from a sequential quarter basis in the magnitude of around $20 million. I'd point you to the Soliris geographic sales breakdown. You can actually see that on a sequential basis. It is extremely hard to predict in the rest of world \u2013 many of these rest-of-world markets, the timing of that. No doubt, the headwind we do expect to see is the July 4 headwind, which we itemized in total as well as by product.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And Matthew, with regard to the Wilson program, first of all, we're really excited to have WTX101 in our own portfolio. The Phase 3 program, as you know, is already underway, and we don't want to disrupt the momentum that's already been achieved so far. So the primary change will actually be increasing the sample size from what was originally communicated to be 100 patients to at least 150 patients, possibly more, so that we can position the trial for superiority relative to standard of care for the primary endpoint which is non-ceruloplasmin corrected copper.","With regard to other endpoints, we're going to keep the endpoints as they are. We may even try to optimize them to ensure that we get them in the label. And the liver biopsy would be a separate study that we're now evaluating in terms of feasibility, sites, et cetera.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Our objective is to show that we can de-copper the liver. So there's the regularly objective and there's the payer's objective. And from a regulatory, we do need one-year data. The additional studies should help us to get a stronger label, as John was saying, and do better with payer discussions.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. We think this is a differentiated profile, and the liver biopsy study will help us to underscore the effect of this product uniquely to de-copper the liver, which is the pathophysiology that underlies the progression to end-stage liver disease.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wondering if you've had any preliminary discussions with either U.S. or EU payers regarding the value proposition of ALXN1210 and any feedback you can share. And then on your market research slide, I noticed that while two thirds of docs are indicating they prefer to switch patients, is there any feedback from the one third of docs that indicated they might not have a preference to switch patients to ALXN1210? Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. Hi, Terence. It's Brian. Thanks a lot for both questions. On the payer discussions with ALXN1210, first of all, we're, of course, very pleased with the strong data that we've been able to present. We do believe that the product profile addresses, as I had mentioned, many of the needs of physicians, patients, as well as the payers. And so we're engaged in those discussions. Our ambition, of course, is to set a high bar with ALXN1210 to make it the new standard of care. So that has a two-part benefit. Of course, that helps patients. It also for our business narrows the space for potential competition. And ultimately, as we continue with those engagements with payers, we'll make sure that the comprehensive value of ALXN1210 is well-recognized.","With respect to the initial market research discussions, as you noted, the two thirds and the one third of doctors, I think mainly what you're seeing here is a segmentation that has to do with kind of early adopters, those who are willing to jump in earlier in the course of launch, as well as those who might wait a little bit of time to see what the initial profile looks like and the patient response. But we'll continue to work on making sure that all of our target doctors see the full benefits of the product.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","The data Brian talks to that we should be able to deliver on our objective of facilitated conversion, fast conversion to ALXN1210.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Josh Schimmer - Evercore, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. For the myasthenia gravis adoption curve for Soliris, can you give us a sense of the persistence on therapy and how that...?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Josh, we can't hear you. Could you try again?","Josh Schimmer - Evercore, Inc.","Sorry. Is this any better?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","That's much better, Josh.","Josh Schimmer - Evercore, Inc.","Okay. Sorry about that. So I was just asking for the myasthenia gravis Soliris adoption curve, if you can give us a sense of persistence on therapy and how that might ultimately affect the launch trajectory compared to some of the other indications?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Josh. It's Brian, again. With respect to MG, as I noted on the front-end, the demand side of the equation, we're pleased with the continued uptake. Just as a reminder, we're only in the second full quarter since launch. And from the REGAIN study, we had looked at the 12-week mark, there were about 40% of the patients who were so-called nonresponders. What we're seeing in the real world early on is that the number is significantly less than that, which is encouraging because it really has a positive reinforcing benefit, of course, for patients on what this product means for them and for their journey through MG. And it also has yielded a positive reinforcement back to physicians who have prescribed Soliris for MG. So early on, but generally we're seeing more encouraging continuations than we saw in the REGAIN study.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. So just following up on the market research question, Ludwig, I think I heard you answer the previous question regarding the third of docs that wouldn't switch. I think I heard you say it was a matter of timing and waiting for clinical experience. Can you maybe clarify was there some specific issue that jumped out that they were looking for with the clinical experience? Was it safety? Or was it just waiting for the reimbursement dynamic or logistics or something like that? Any color there would help. Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Chris. It's Brian. Maybe I'll go first and Ludwig can add on any further commentary. As I mentioned, having had experience in rare diseases, what you classically see is a segmentation of one cohort of doctors, and in this case, we talk about two-thirds of the doctors who had seen the profile and market research who are more ambitious about a conversion. And one thing to keep in mind too when it comes down to actual conversion is there's a little bit that we'll have to work through in terms of the cadence of patients visiting their clinicians.","The second part of it and the one-third that you allude to oftentimes is a function of just waiting and getting more experience and exposure to the data and how it plays out. And I think that's more or less what we expect in terms of the launch uptake. But as Ludwig noted, the ambition here is make it the standard of care in PNH and really go after facilitated conversion for those patients.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","We've had over the decades a lot of experience with the market segmentation and launch and insights prelaunch. We're really excited about what we saw here. So the early adopters' percentage is high. So you have a group of fast followers, which we believe is also very favorable of what we see. And then you have this group of physicians who will need time. And the fact is that Soliris has a high bar and although we believe that we have a strong value proposition for each of our stakeholders, Soliris is a pretty good product but we believe we're in a pretty good position here.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Chris. Maybe I'll just add one more comment is that as we further our market research, I expect that we'll see a dynamic of one cohort of doctors who get the obvious point about ALXN1210 which is the eight-week dosing interval versus two weeks, and another who will need to digest \u2013 as we talked about the totality of the data, the LDH measures, the transfusion avoidance \u2013 as well as the breakthrough hemolysis. And that will be our focus as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Anupam Rama from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. On the gMG launch, you guys have talked about natural efficiencies at institutions that could get patients on therapy faster. What are you hearing anecdotally in the field on this? Thanks so much.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Anupam, it's Brian. Good to speak with you again. With respect to gMG, actually, most of the uptake initially has been with community neurologist, less so in the academic settings. And we expect over time that will continue to progress with the institutions. But in general, what we've been encouraged by is that we're seeing both breadth of prescribing improving, which is really important at this phase in launch. And then as I noted in my comments, we're also beginning to see some improvements in terms of depth. And that's a signal of the doctors who have had initial experience with Soliris for gMG have had that positive reinforcing signal of the patients responding well and so they're enhancing their uptake. And that's what you're seeing play out in the trajectory.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking our question.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jason Zemansky - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Wonderful. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Jason Zemansky on the call for Geoff. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on the quarter. Real quickly. In previous quarters you had talked about the steady underlying double-digit growth in both PNH and aHUS. And I'm curious, was that true of this quarter? And moving forward, are you still expecting kind of the same level starts or are we seeing a saturation point?","And then, in terms of Kanuma, Strensiq is really ramping nicely. I'm curious, is there a tipping point where you think that Kanuma can kind of achieve that same level as growth-driver? And kind of what needs to happen. And if so, when? Thanks so much.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Jason. This is Paul. I'll take the first part of that question. I think Geoff had asked it earlier on. You may not have heard, but we saw high-single-digit growth rates of the aHUS PNH business on an underlying basis when you kind of get all the apples-to-apples together. That is very much in line with our expectations. We're growing off of a larger base, so we continue to see patient additions, as Brian had noted, really strong PNH quarter in the United States. And then, just balancing that, we do envision rest-of-world, which previously was a big growth driver. We're seeing that being probably the slowest geographic growth rates from a regional perspective. Brian, I'll turn it to you for Kanuma.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Maybe just before Kanuma, since you asked the question I want to take an opportunity to go behind the numbers a little bit and say, again, I could not be prouder of the team. I think what you're seeing in the underlying growth is a team that is really expert in the diseases where we focus as well as the products and the patient needs. And they work day in and day out to deliver, and that's what you're seeing in terms of those results. So really proud of that group. With Kanuma, this is, as we've talked about for a few quarters, we really are convinced we're on the right strategy in focusing on, first of all, getting accounts set up one by one to do the lab testing, and secondly, to motivate clinicians to actually do the testing and make that as easy as possible for them. And we believe that, with increased volume of testing in these enriched populations, that we will see an increase with Kanuma. But it's a slower ramp, as you've seen, I'm not sure that I would predict at this stage a tipping point per se, but we do believe it's the right strategy.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. We're seeing that same passion in our sales force in the Kanuma as we see with Strensiq and gMG and PNH and aHUS. At the end of the day, the clock is ticking for those patients, and it's part of our mission to find those patients.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Another question on the conversion to ALXN1210, Ludwig, in response to a prior question, I think you said that you expected a rapid conversion, and I'm curious if you'd be willing to quantify that. What proportion of patients could convert from Soliris to ALXN1210 over what period of time? Maybe specifically, we're projecting about a third of patients, U.S. PNH patients, convert in 2019 and two thirds by the end of 2020. Do those estimates strike you as reasonable, aggressive, or conservative? Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So this is Brian. I'm going to jump in line here, and thanks a lot for the question. I mean -","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Great to hear from you by the way, Phil.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. I do appreciate the question. We've not provided any conversion targets at this stage. We're certainly ramping up in our launch preparations. As I've said a couple times, of course, we do believe in ALXN1210's differentiated profile, and with the totality of data we feel that that will support rapid market conversion. So our objective is to be best-in-class for facilitated conversion. And I think at this stage in the launch preparation, we'll leave it there.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Marty Auster from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Martin Auster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. It's Marty. Thanks for taking the question. Can you outline how you think the ALXN1210 aHUS clinical program could help differentiate the product, relative to Soliris in that indication? And then, are there any reasons why you might expect ALXN1210 conversion interest might look different in aHUS relative to PNH as you gather that data and start doing that work in 2019? And then, just lastly, housekeeping question, what proportion of the aHUS population currently do you think is pediatric versus adult? Thanks.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So Marty, this is John. So you know that our PNH program was a head-to-head program against Soliris in both Naive and Switch studies were. We believe we have a differentiated profile on a number of fronts that have already been highlighted. The aHUS study, which has completed enrollment and will have data at the beginning of 2019, is a single arm estimation study with complete TMA response as the primary endpoint. So we'll only have historical data to compare to. With Soliris, it will not be head-to-head. So it won't have that opportunity for direct head-to-head differentiation in that program.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And then the mix peds versus adults. Is your question, Marty, related to aHUS?","Martin Auster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","It is, yes. And I was just wondering if there's any, in terms of the less frequent infusions and any other potential benefits clinicians might find in ALXN1210's profile relative to Soliris, whether there is kind of a more pronounced benefit in the pediatric population versus adults and whether you think that conversion curve would look any different relative to PNH.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So what I can say is that the study we have ongoing is for adults and adolescents, and we have a pediatric program that's also underway and enrolling. And the average patient age, of course, with aHUS is less than PNH. So there'll be younger patients that would be able to take advantage of the eight-week infusion, I think would be better received on that end. I can turn it over to Brian to comment on that differentiation.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","We don't have precision on the split, but in terms of the expectations of how it'd play out, we have to see the data, of course, in the real world with Soliris. We don't see, and we wouldn't expect to see necessarily a difference between the two. But we'll have to wait for the data.","Martin Auster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Mackey from RBC. Your line is now open.","Keith Mackey - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Brian, first. You mentioned all but one patient continued into the extension study. I was just wondering why that one patient chose not to continue. And then, more broadly, just wondering if you could help us out with sort of what your internal expectations are for a potential biosimilar Soliris in Europe and if there have been any internal changes to those expectations recently. Thank you very much.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So this is John. I'll take that first question. First of all, it's extremely unusual and very remarkable for virtually all patients to go into an extension study. There's various reasons for patients to not choose to do that. In this case, it didn't have anything to do with their satisfaction, from our understanding of the experience taking the product during the randomized phase of the study. It was more of a logistical personal decision.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. With respect to your biosimilar question, I'll try to elevate maybe my answer to sustainability of our leadership position that we feel really good about it that we can sustain our leadership position in complement. We just had a long discussion on raising the standard of care with ALXN1210, which, I believe, is maybe the most important piece. We have a strong IP platform for Soliris, both U.S., Japan and we're prosecuting the same strategy in the EU. And then on the biosimilar front, nothing new from what we discussed before. So we have not seen any Phase 1 data and we are not aware of any Phase 3 trial that is actively enrolling.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ying Huang from Bank of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first one for Paul. The SG&A as a percentage of total revenue has continued to come down to now about 22% on a non-GAAP basis. So just wondering, is that a good proxy for the SG&A going forward or do you think there is more improvement potentially that could happen. And then also quickly on the research and development side, can you talk about potential indication for the Complement Pharma collaboration? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Let me \u2013 I'll take the first part of that, Ying. I think it was a little bit garbled, but I think you were asking about SG&A as a percentage of sales.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. So we're getting leverage. Obviously, a lot of that is leverage off the top line. Without kind of giving guidance or big expectations going into next year and the year after, I continue to expect that there is leverage on SG&A broadly.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And with regard to Complement Pharma, as you know, this is in a preclinical stage. We're now characterizing the antibody and doing some in vivo animal experiments to sort out its profile. Because of the biology of C6 that we believe it's not generated in the CNS, even in circumstances of injury, it lends itself to peripheral neutralization and inhibition with an antibody that would attack a range of CNS-related complement mediated conditions, including some of the ones we've already been evaluating with terminal complement inhibition. So the range is quite broad, and we'll share more, I guess, over the coming year as to which direction we may take it.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, we'll take three more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Your line is now open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and the progress. So I guess my question is two. One, it's for Paul. Kind of a follow-up to the last question. On operating margins, you talked a lot about all these trials going on and I was just wondering, help us think about how much pressure that could put on operating margins in the near term. I know you haven't given long-term guidance.","And the second question is on pricing. And if you think about like you're going to regulatory authorities in a year or so and asking them to reimburse ALXN1210, will you also be telling them we're going to have ALXN1210 for MG and ALXN1210 for aHUS and maybe doing similar things. You and other companies are doing multi-drug contracts. Is that on the table or a possibility so you could speed up conversions? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. Robyn, this is Paul. I'll try to tackle it. Great questions. So look, we're very pleased that we're actually nearing on an operating margin with the full year 2018 guidance. We're nearing what we set out as a financial ambition for 2019. So effectively, pulling it in a year. I think the way to think about it is as we continue to believe that we want to achieve double-digit topline growth in leverage to the bottom line, which implies as we go into next year and the following year, continuing operating margin expansion. The degree to that we'll have to kind of sort through.","As we get upward pressure from some of the programs that I noted, if there's potential over a longer period of time, downward pressure, as ALXN1210, PNH and aHUS trials effectively we kind of get to a different stage with them. That doesn't happen overnight and it doesn't even happen. But we do see that happening in sight. So we're still committed to kind of the margin performance growing for the company.","With respect to pricing, I mean, you kind of asked a broad question. I think it would be a great problem. It is very complex. As Brian noted, it'll be country by country. We'll be tackling this. And I think it's premature to get too specific on it but we do just kind of broadly see it as a good opportunity.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open.","Hartaj Singh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you. I appreciate the question. I just had a quick question on the aHUS trial in the ALXN1210. There have been some companies in rare diseases where there have been sort of these one-arm trials where regulators have had sort of a maybe not optimal view of it. Just any thoughts on your regulatory interactions and how that supplementary BLA to PNH will work out. Thank you.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So Alexion had extensive interactions with regulatory authorities before embarking on Phase 3 program for ALXN1210 and they got alignment with having a head-to-head trial in PNH and an estimation single-arm trial in atypical HUS. So we're very confident that it will meet regulator's guidelines for registration. As you know, we've already filed for PNH in the U.S. and the EU, and we're planning to file in Japan the second half of this year.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Yatin Suneja from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Yatin Suneja - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a broader question on gMG. Is there a possibility that Soliris, or perhaps other pipeline candidates that you have could move up front in the treatment paradigm? I mean, given that the pathway is validated to complement C5, just thinking, or how are you thinking about maximizing the value of this indication? Thank you.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Hi Yatin, it's Brian. Great question. I'll start just by saying that I hope so. Our ambition is on behalf of these patients who have, in many cases, suffered for a long time, that we continue to progress towards earlier course of therapy. Now, because, as I noted, we're in the second full quarter of launch in the U.S., we're still in that neighborhood of the REGAIN type population. And keep in mind, in terms of clinical treatment inertia, this Solaris for MG was the first new FDA approval in about 60 years. So there's a lot of education and reorienting clinicians to a different way of treating relative to IST therapy, IVIG, plasma exchange and so on. But that is the ambition, and maybe I'll ask John if he wants to comments from an R&D perspective.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. I think from a mechanistic perspective we know that patients with acetylcholine receptor antibodies activate complement. So theoretically patients further upstream and the journey would be amenable to C5 inhibition. There is a large unmet need continuing in myasthenia gravis, and so there's an opportunity here for additional innovation across the board as well as new mechanisms.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So we're going to close the call. First of all, I want to thank everybody for calling in. As we said, we are really pleased with this quarter and in what our employees are delivering to our patients and their families. So thanks for calling in, everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Irving Adler, Executive Director, Corporate Communications. Go ahead, sir.","Irving Adler","Thank you, Tony. Good morning and thank you all for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2014 and our plans for 2015. Today's call will be led by Dr. Leonard Bell, our Chairman and CEO.","Lenny will be joined by members of Alexion management; David Hallal, our Chief Operating Officer and CEO-elect; Vikas Sinha, our Chief Financial Officer; Martin MacKay, our Global Head of R&D; Julie O\u2019Neill, our Executive Vice President, Global Operations; and Saqib Islam, our chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements apply only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after this call.","I'd also like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP operating results are adjusted from our U.S. GAAP operating results for certain items that we described in our press release issued this morning. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release.","Thank you. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thanks very much, Irving. In Q4, the global Alexion team drove a strong conclusion to 2014 as we advance our relentless mission to provide transformative therapies to patients with severe and life-threatening disorders.","During Q4, our commercial organization again provided Soliris to an increasing number of patients with PNH and aHUS across our operations in 50 countries. Our development teams made continued and strong progress in the quarter, notably with the completion of the rolling submission of our BLA for asfotase alfa in the United States and also our submission in Japan.","Importantly, we reported the advancement of the first 2 next-generation Soliris molecules into the clinic, and based on initial clinical data, at least one of these molecules will advance into Phase II PNH trials this year. And finally, we expect another year of strong financial performance in 2015. Equally important, we now are pleased to announce that we expect significant improvements in both our 2015 and longer-term effective tax rates compared to previous guidance.","Our accomplishments throughout 2014 position us to reach a new set of significant milestones on behalf of patients this year and beyond. By every measure, Alexion is at the strongest and most promising point in our history. Our commercial and financial performance are at record levels. Our potential to deliver new therapies to patients is greater than ever, and we have a world-class team of talented and dedicated colleagues at every level of the organization.","Thus, I'm confident that the time is right for the company and for me, personally, to complete our planned leadership transition as we announced this morning. The Board and I are delighted that David Hallal will become our second CEO. David has been instrumental in driving our results and in shaping our high-performance culture. He has demonstrated outstanding leadership at Alexion playing a principal role in leading many of the company's key initiatives on behalf of patients, including the highly successful launches of Soliris for PNH and aHUS, while also driving the buildout of Alexion's 50-country operating platform.","Since joining Alexion 9 years ago, David's role has expanded across the entire organization. And over the last several years, he and I have increasingly shared responsibilities. Now is the right time for David to lead Alexion.","As Chairman, I look forward to continuing to contribute to Alexion as I guide the Board and advise the company on strategic matters.","I'll now turn both the company and the call over to David. David?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Lenny. I am deeply honored to become Alexion's next CEO. On behalf of the entire organization, I would like to thank Lenny for his extraordinary leadership in building Alexion into one of the most successful and innovative biotechnology companies in the world, developing a company-wide commitment to innovation, creating our patient-focused culture and instilling exquisite discipline and operational excellence that have driven our remarkable success over the last 2 decades.","I look forward to leading our dedicated and talented employees worldwide as we continue to execute on our long-term strategic plan focused on developing and delivering innovative therapies for patients with devastating and life-threatening disorders.","As we close another record year in 2014 and as I look at the company today, I see more than $2 billion in revenues with far more growth ahead of us in our in-line businesses; the launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, this year; the most robust pipeline in our history with 3 ongoing registration programs; and 4 additional highly innovative molecules in clinical development; global leadership and complement science to serve patients through the next 2 decades; a strong foundation for future growth, with an additional 17 preclinical development programs, spanning diverse modalities in therapeutic areas; and lastly, a balance sheet aligned with our strong growth objectives. We have never been better positioned to leverage our unique 50-country commercial platform to drive future product expansion.","Now turning to our performance in Q4. We advanced our mission by reaching significant milestones across our commercial and pipeline initiatives.","Looking first to PNH. Our performance in 2014 affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment. Throughout 2014, as in prior years, we continue to identify a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories in which we have operated the longest. As we look at 2015, we have strong conviction in our PNH franchise, as we aim to serve many more patients around the world.","Turning to aHUS. We continue to observe a steady addition of new patients commencing Soliris treatment in the U.S. and Europe in 2014, while we made important progress in the early stages of our launch in Japan. Globally, the ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and perhaps larger. As one measure in the U.S., now more than 3 years following their respective FDA approvals, more patients are currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. In Europe, we are observing a similar trend in the earlier stages of our aHUS launch. These observations support our view that the incidence of aHUS is likely higher than PNH.","Looking at 2015 and beyond, we continue to see that the majority of our aHUS growth is ahead of us, supported by our strength in labels in the U.S. and Europe, which demonstrate the immediate and long-term benefit of early and sustained treatment for patients with aHUS.","Our experience with PNH and aHUS provides us with key learnings to support the launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, for patients with HPP.","In 2014, we completed the regulatory filings in the U.S., EU and Japan and we expect approvals in all of these territories this year. This creates the potential to commence launches in the U.S. and Germany during the first half of 2015 and in Japan by year-end.","Asfotase alfa will be the first of as many as 7 new indications or product approvals through 2018. These include eculizumab, and DGF, NMO, MG, and AMR, one or more of our portfolio of next-generation Soliris molecules as well as cPMP for infants with MoCD Type A within the same period. As we progress each of these programs in 2015, we expect to reach at least 12 significant development milestones during the year, which Martin will discuss later in the call.","Looking briefly at our 2014 financial performance. For the full year, we achieved 38% revenue growth for 2014 in-year sales compared to 2013. We also demonstrated strong operational leverage with 57% EPS growth associated with in-year sales for 2014.","Turning to our 2015 guidance. We announced this morning our revenue forecast of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion despite currency headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we would expect an in-year sales growth rate of approximately 26%. Robust growth for Soliris reflects strong underlying demand with the anticipated addition of a similar number of new patients on treatment year-on-year. Our revenue guidance also includes a small initial contribution from asfotase alfa.","We are pleased that even with our increased investment in our global infrastructure, including preparation for the launch of asfotase alfa, our 2015 pretax operating results are expected to deliver similar margins as compared to 2014.","Finally, and as Vikas will describe in more detail, we expect to see immediate improvements in both our 2015 effective tax rate and our long-term tax rate as compared to prior guidance.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, David. In Q4, the steady increase in uptick of Soliris among PNH and aHUS patients in our core territories and newer markets resulted in strong revenue and EPS growth during the quarter and for the year.","Revenue in Q4 increased 36% year-on-year to $599 million despite the early signs of weakness in key FX currencies late in the quarter.","Turning to the full year. As noted in this morning's press release, 2014 in-year revenues of $2.15 billion, exclude $88 million related to reimbursement for prior year sales in France. Thus, for the full year 2014, in-year sales increased 38% compared to 2013. Excluding onetime 2014 price benefits, sales increased by approximately $500 million compared to 2013. By exceeding our revenue target while maintaining strict financial discipline in our growing commercial and clinical activities, we reported 2014 non-GAAP EPS of $5.21 per diluted share, an increase of 69% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of $88 million in pre-2014 sales, EPS would be $4.84, an increase of 57%.","Looking at our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at year-end grew by nearly $450 million to $1.9 billion. We achieved these gains through strong positive cash flow from operations, which also enabled us to repurchase $300 million of our own shares during the year. As a result of that repurchase, our total shares outstanding for Q4 2014 were 204 million shares, nearly unchanged from Q4 2013.","I would now like to turn to our 2015 guidance. We are guiding 2015 total revenue in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion. I would note that our 2015 revenue forecast assumes that key currencies remain at the current exchange rates through the year. As a result, and reflecting that 2\/3 of our revenues are outside of the U.S, our 2015 revenue guidance includes a negative FX impact of approximately 5% of revenues or $135 million after hedging.","On a constant currency basis, without this 5% impact, our total revenue forecast in 2015 would have been greater than $2.7 billion, which would represent an in-year sales growth rate of approximately 26%. This forecast reflects our expectation of continued strong growth at Soliris with expected addition of a similar number of new patients on treatment in 2015 compared to 2014 as well as a small initial asfotase alfa contribution.","Turning to Q1 revenue. I would like to note that the increasingly negative sequential FX impact during Q1 combined with 2 fewer days are expected to result in Q1 revenues in the range of $585 million to $590 million.","Looking at other elements of our 2015 guidance, I will highlight the following: First, cost of goods is expected to increase in the second half of the year, as we launch asfotase alfa, which will have higher cost of goods than Soliris; Second, despite the FX headwinds and our continued investment in our global infrastructure for the asfotase alfa launch, our 2015 pretax operating results are expected to deliver similar margins compared to 2014; Third, we see the benefit of our further improvement in our effective tax rates. Our 2015 non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 7% to 9%, lower than our previous forecast of 13% to 15%. This benefit results from entering 2015 with a higher level of tax credits remaining than we previously expected.","In addition, beyond 2015, we will continue to benefit from a reduced tax rate compared to our prior guidance. We now anticipate that our tax rate will be 12% to 13% in 2016, and 14% to 16% in 2017 and subsequent years.","Finally, our non-GAAP EPS guidance is in the range of $5.60 to $5.80. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would have been approximately $0.30 higher.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Thanks, Vikas. In 2014, our R&D teams made important progress in our mission to serve more patients with devastating and rare diseases. I am very pleased that we surpassed our goal of achieving 10 development milestones over the year.","Looking to 2015, I would like to update you on our lead development programs as we drive towards our goal of achieving up to 7 new indications or product approvals through 2018.","First, asfotase alfa, our highly innovative potential therapy for patients with HPP. As David mentioned, we continue to expect decisions in the U.S. and EU in the first half of 2015 followed by a decision in Japan by the end of the year. We are working with regulatory authorities to obtain these marketing authorizations as quickly as possible, given the high rates of mortality, severe debilitating effects and current lack of any approved therapy for patients with HPP.","We continue to build the growing body of clinical data reflecting the potentially transformative impact of asfotase alfa. In early March, at the Endocrine Society meeting, new data will be presented showing rapid and continued improvements in muscle strength, significant gains in physical function and reduction in pain in children receiving asfotase alfa for up to 3 years. Importantly, new Burden of Disease Data in Adults with HPP will also be presented at ENDO, and we plan to start a clinical study with asfotase alfa in adult patients with severe HPP in 2015.","I would now like to turn to our development programs with eculizumab beginning with our 3 multinational registration trials of eculizumab in delayed graft function, neuromyelitis optica and myasthenia gravis. We expect to complete enrollment in our DGF trial in kidney transplant patients at increased risk for rejection and early graft loss by the end of the year.","In our neurology programs with eculizumab, in Q4, we were pleased that Soliris was granted orphan drug designations in Japan for both the treatment of patients with NMO and MG. In our registration trial in relapsing NMO, the PREVENT study, enrollment and dosing are ongoing. In our registration trial in refractory MG, the REGAIN study, we expect to complete enrollment in this study this year.","As the leaders in complement biology, we advanced our portfolio of next-generation Soliris molecules in 2014. As we announced on the Q3 call, we initiated Phase I studies of the first 2 next-generation Soliris molecules, ALXN1210 and ALXN5500, with additional molecules and programs in our expanding portfolio at earlier stages of development. The data already support advancing both of these molecules into further trials, and we intend to progress at least one of them into a Phase II PNH trial this year with additional indications likely to follow. ALXN1210 is a longer acting anti-C5 monoclonal antibody, suitable for once monthly dosing. We are targeting approval of at least one next generation candidate in 2018.","We also have lead development programs with 2 additional highly innovative therapies, ALXN1007 and cPMP. We have commenced dosing in 2 Phase II proof-of-concept studies to validate the safety and tolerability of ALXN1007 in patients with 2 severe and potentially life-threatening autoimmune diseases: graft versus host disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, or GI-GVH, and antiphospholipid syndrome or APS. We expect to have interim data in the GI-GVHD study later in 2015.","In our metabolic disease area, we continue to advance our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A. The synthetic cPMP bridging study in patients with MoCD is ongoing and we expect to complete enrollment in 2015. We are also continuing our retrospective data collection and natural history study.","Within our portfolio of 17 preclinical programs to drive future growth, I would like to turn briefly to our collaboration with Moderna, where we have initiated preclinical development in our first 7 mRNA rare disease programs and are targeting our first candidate to enter the clinic in 2016.","As we build on our accomplishments in 2014, we are well-positioned to achieve at least 12 development milestones across our pipelines in 2015. These include the U.S., EU and Japan approvals of asfotase alfa; the initiation of a study evaluating asfotase alfa in adults with severe HPP; the completion of enrollment in the DGF and MG registration trials; the initiation of a company-sponsored clinical study with eculizumab for the treatment of AMR as well as data from the Phase II deceased donor study for the prevention of AMR; completion of the Phase I next-generation Soliris studies for the first 2 molecules; and the initiation of a Phase II study for one or more of these molecules in PNH patients; and interim data from the Phase II proof-of-concept study for ALXN1007 in patients with GI-GVHD.","Beyond our existing clinical and preclinical programs, we continue to evaluate a number of research collaborations, licenses and acquisitions across modalities and therapeutic areas. We look forward to providing more updates as the year proceeds.","I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thank you very much, Martin. Alexion's depth and strength as a global organization and the unprecedented range of the opportunities we are aggressively pursuing, underscore our potential to serve a continuously increasing number of patients in 2015 and beyond.","As always, we thank our employees and the many other people who make our work possible, including researchers, physicians, patients and families. We are united in our commitment to serve patients with severe and life-threatening disorders through breakthrough medical innovation to transform their lives from illness and desperation into health and hope.","Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Lenny, congrats on the last 23 years and thanks a lot for all the success. David, good luck on matching Lenny's success. I guess this [indiscernible] your tenure.","David L. Hallal","Exceeding. Exceeding.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Exceeding? Okay, sounds like you might be retiring in 2039 then or later.","Leonard Bell","No, he'll [indiscernible]. He's much younger.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Question's actually for Vikas. I'm not sure you're going to provide the worldwide geographic breakdowns of sales in 2014 until the cake comes out, but if you could, that'd be appreciated. And just wondering what kind of EU pricing pressures, if any, are in the guidance.","Vikas Sinha","In the press release we gave this time, we included the geographical breakdown, so that's why I didn't put it in the script. So it's right at the bottom of the press release. So -- but you know, it's very well spread out equally between U.S., Europe [indiscernible]. The 2 blocks are almost equal there. You have to take into consideration the $88 million, which is included in the European sales. If we take that out, you will see that [indiscernible]. What was the second question?","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","The EU pricing environment and any pressures on the guidance.","Vikas Sinha","What we have incorporated is a couple of percentage that we normally see as an erosion due to price. We've already started the overall view on U.K., and Italy is already incorporated in those numbers. And as we move forward, it is -- it just turns out to be a couple of percentage on a yearly basis. We definitely see the pressure on the overall price.","Operator","Our next question will come from Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Congratulations, Lenny. You'll be missed for many reasons and not the least being the entertaining conference calls. So congratulations and good luck, David.","David L. Hallal","Thank you.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Quick questions on asfotase. As you're preparing for launch, could you give us a sense of what your manufacturing capacity is? How many patients can you supply, for example, in 2016 and 2017? And then, as you're engaging in the market, David, what are you finding in terms of the sort of patient numbers? I'm sure you won't give us actual numbers, but is there a compassionate use population here that you can imagine starting on treatment immediately? And if so, when might you be announcing that and providing product in such a fashion?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Geoff. And I don't know about trying to be as entertaining as Lenny could be really difficult, but that was the door slamming, by the way. Regarding manufacturing, we -- we're well on track to be able to provide all of the patients that we intend to serve, obviously, ready for -- as we would expect a first half in 2015 launch in the U.S. and Germany. As it relates to patient numbers, I'll just sort of walk you through. We've had a study, the 1010 study, that has remained open and that has enabled some patients with HPP to access treatment, even after we had locked all of our databases associated with all of our clinical trials and utilized that for the submission to the U.S., EU and Japanese authorities. And as we look at 2015, U.S. and Germany first half of the year, and then Japan, near year-end. The challenging thing is, and as you've said, it's difficult to pinpoint the patient numbers given the very low incidence of the disease, and then of course, the very high mortality rate in the youngest patients with HPP and mortality rate of about 70% at 3 years. So as we look at the launch and the overall opportunity, we have very strong conviction on this opportunity to dramatically improve the lives and save the lives of patients who suffer from HPP, but it's something that I think is going to take some time. I think it will be a steady trajectory at approval, and we will buildout the portfolio over time.","Operator","Our next question will come from Salveen Richter with SunTrust.","Salveen J. Richter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Lenny, we will miss you -- definitely the commentary, and congratulations, David.","David L. Hallal","Thank you.","Salveen J. Richter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So in terms of asfotase, given the mechanism, it make sense that this drug could potentially be used in other indications, and we've seen some papers around this. Just wanted to get a sense of your thoughts here and when you might pull a trigger to potentially look at other programs.","Leonard Bell","Martin?","Martin MacKay","Yes, just very briefly, Salveen, you're absolutely right. Given the mechanism of asfotase alfa and clearly, we're looking at the potential use and other indications. As you also correctly say, there have been publications in certain indications, and of course, they're of great interest to us. The point I would make is clearly preclinical work has been done. And I would say that just more continuing with rigorous preclinical studies at this stage to really understand the benefits asfotase alfa could bring in those indications is very much on our mind.","Operator","Our next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Lenny, David, a huge congrats to you both. Love the glamour shot in the press release today.","Leonard Bell","That was the biggest change we'll make in the company.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So I have 2 -- so on asfotase, obviously, you guys will have a very wide range of drug volume per patient when you look at infants versus adults. Maybe just walk us through the complexities that this adds when you have reimbursement discussions this year, and would you expect the cap -- to cap the annual costs for adults? And then just a quick follow-up for Vikas.","Leonard Bell","Yes. So -- as we're looking at it, Geoff, and we look at asfotase and HPP, we have a little bit of experience as it relates to aHUS, right, for the first time following the PNH introduction, which was a set dose for every patient. We have patients who receive Soliris for aHUS. The youngest and smallest patients receive about 20% of the total Soliris dose that, say, an adult patient would receive. So we have a little bit of experience with this. Obviously, as we look at asfotase, we believe that the package of information that we have provided to the regulator supports the potential of this being a highly transformative therapy. And with that, we think that is the most important support mechanism for us in our discussions around pricing and reimbursement, and we believe for those patients with really bad HPP that are exposed to very poor outcomes or the risk of poor outcomes that we will have a pricing and reimbursement strategy to serve those patients.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. And then just real quick for Vikas. In the geographic breakout: last year, I think, Asia Pacific was one of your highest growth regions, although on a lower base. And this year, it's 20%. So just anything to call out specifically in that geography that may have been a headwind for 2014. And will that remain so, if there is one in 2015 and beyond?","Vikas Sinha","Asia-Pacific wise, when I look at that, this was the area where Japan falls under, and also Australia falls under that group. And that's where the headwinds came quite a lot early on this year on the FX. And if you see the [indiscernible] grew very significantly this year compared to that, right?","Operator","Our next question will come from Matthew Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Lenny, obviously, amazing value creation. Congrats on everything. And David, obviously, you have big shoes to fill here, but fortunately, you seem to have big feet.","David L. Hallal","Yes. Lenny doesn't wear shiny shoes, though. So at least I have [indiscernible] maybe a head start on me there.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I wanted to ask you about your comments on the tax rate. And you mentioned additional tax credits, but it sounded like there might be something more sustainable and long term in there, just trying to better understand that. Was there any kind of legal or accounting or structural change that's led to a sustained tax benefit over time versus prior -- what -- how have your long-term tax expectations changed today?","Vikas Sinha","Some of the -- on the short run, as I've said, it's a carryforward [indiscernible] tax credits. It's -- and in the longer term, what we were able to do this year is get down to much more detailed country by country forecast globally, which helped us better understand the jurisdictional mix of the profit compared to what we had done quickly early on in the year. So that's the shift that gave us several percentage break as we looked at which legal entity does the profit fall under. Does that help?","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It does, I guess. So I would say, how has your long-term sort of sustainable tax rate at a fully taxed level, how do you expect that to be now and has that changed?","Vikas Sinha","Yes. So earlier, we were looking at 16% to 18%. In today's guidance, we pulled it down to 14% to 16%, right? And that's purely a function of -- with the new exchange rates, with the new forecast that we're looking at, we actually built everything from bottom up this time and tried to really fine-tune where it lines up.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then lastly, just on the guidance as well. Unclear to me or maybe I missed it, is or -- is asfotase sales, are they reflected in 2015 sales guidance?","Vikas Sinha","Yes. A small contribution from asfotase has been included and we have not broken it out.","Operator","Our next question will come from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan.","Anupam Rama - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Congrats to Lenny and David. Just a quick question on the asfotase alfa adult trial, how are you thinking about this initial trial? And are you thinking about stratifying by onset of disease? Or will it still [ph] be an all comer severe adult HPP patient population?","Martin MacKay","It's Martin here. Just a little early days in terms of the exact nature of the adult study. It will be in severe patients. We know that. And as David alluded to, as we're learning in the field more about just the pathophysiology of the disease and the nature of the disease in the adult population, that will inform the exact nature of the trial that we run this year.","Operator","Next we'll move to Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'd like to offer my congrats as well. On -- the question I had relates to the EPS guidance and the ForEx headwind. I guess by our math, the 30% looks to be about 5%. But I think we were expecting about half as much given your xU.S. expenses. So just wondering if my math is right. And if so, what drove the delta?","Vikas Sinha","Yes. So Terence, what we looked at is, on the top line, we had $125 million headwind. And as we look at our expenses, we were able to cover half of it through natural hedges. And then the operating results are impacted approximately by half of the $135 million. That's how we came to the 60 [ph] -- $0.30 a share. And obviously, the -- based on your model, you'll get some offset on the tax right there. Net-net on the EPS side, it'll be a much lower impact for you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ying Huang calling from Bank of America.","Ying Huang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First question, Lenny, is this your last earning call or not? Just kidding, anyway. So maybe, David, can you outline the commercial opportunity of the adult patients with severe HPP for us? And then also for the indications for next-gen Soliris, are you going to test beyond PNH in a Phase II setting? And lastly, I guess, for Vikas, you are accumulating almost $2 billion in cash on balance sheet now, so any thought on the use of cash?","Leonard Bell","Yes. So I'll take HPP, and then Martin, next-gen, and then Vikas. As it relates and I think it's important to note that our breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. is for perinatal, infantile and juvenile onset disease. And as I've described, there are -- published very high mortality rates. And more recently at medical congresses, there has been presentations about those very high mortality rates in those patients, but there are also survivors as well. And certainly, independent of onset of disease, we would expect that adult patients -- and we know of them are suffering from high degrees of morbidity associated with HPP. And so when we look at our breakthrough therapy designation and the approach that we're taking with onset of disease with regulators, we would anticipate being able to hopefully serve those adults with severe disease. But of course, as Martin indicated, we are very interested in driving hard with additional better understanding of the nature of the disease and how the patients respond to treatment. Martin, next-gen?","Martin MacKay","Yes. Thank you, David, and thank you for the question, Ying. As we've discussed before, our mantra all along here with the next-generation portfolio is to outcompete ourselves. As I mentioned, based on the Phase I data that started in 2014 with 2 molecules, just to remind you that's the ALXN1210 and ALXN5500, both of these can go further into trials based on the Phase I data. And as we've said on the call, at least one will go into a Phase II trial in 2015, and as you correctly allude to, within PNH. But also, we're very keen to look at additional indications and that will follow those studies, obviously dependent on the data that we produce. I would also point to an earlier portfolio coming at the back of ALXN1210 and ALXN5500, where we broaden that portfolio over time and we'll be progressing those with urgency through the pipeline.","Vikas Sinha","And regarding cash, our -- we have 2 -- approximately $1.9 billion now, and we will accumulate more in 2015. And our first and foremost objective would be to broaden our portfolio through licensing or acquisitions. And secondary objective would be to stop the dilution, and we'll do some buyback for which we have a $500 million authorization right now.","Leonard Bell","And as we have quite a few people on the line still -- are going to try to finish on time, if we could limit questions to more or less one per person. Thanks.","Operator","Next we'll move to Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Evan Seigerman","This is Evan on for Rob, and sorry she's unavailable to ask a question today. Just going back to the AMR prevention trial. Do we know why the historical controls really didn't match up to what we saw in the clinic? And what are some potential reads for this going forward into the treatment trial?","Martin MacKay","The quick answer is we don't know exactly why the standard of care arm performed better than the historical studies that are being published. As we said also before, eculizumab actually behaved exactly as we predicted in those studies with a very good reduction in AMR. Clearly, we've looked at the 9-week data and looked at the primary endpoint. We will, obviously, look at the 1-year data and secondary endpoint. That may give us some indication as to what happens there. And then, obviously, we have the open-label deceased-donor study, which we'll readout in 2015. In terms of the latter part of your question, we are working with great tenacity now on what that treatment trial would look like, started speaking with principal investigators and key opinion leaders. And clearly, there's a strong desire here to look at eculizumab in the treatment setting. And I will update you on those discussions as the year progresses.","Operator","And next we'll move to Chris Raymond with Robert W. Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","My congrats to both David and Lenny, as well. Question on the next-generation Soliris program. I know you guys have answered some questions on this. But just curious, maybe 2-part question. You guys, I think, have said you'd take at least one forward. Could you envision a scenario where you'd take more than one forward? And then the second part is, we noticed in some of the patent filings that you do have at least some IP around a subQ formulation, could you confirm if one of the unnamed or undescribed programs is subQ?","David L. Hallal","Yes. So our objective actually is that we want to bring more than one forward. We really want to provide optionality. If you see the way we're developing Soliris today, not only in PNH and aHUS, but of course, the 3 registration trials and this soon to be initiated treatment of AMR trial. There's different specialties, different patients and all of them may benefit from unique, innovative attributes that we can provide with a portfolio of next-generation molecules. So when we talk about one or more, that's really putting a time point on it. When we really look at the portfolio, we intend to have 2 or more that would enter into the commercial arena, and we would be looking to provide physicians and patients with maximum optionality. Martin, do you want to...","Martin MacKay","I think your answers are perfect, David. We do recognize the transformative benefits of Soliris. As David articulated, more treatment options and absolutely taking more than one in there. And as I mentioned to a previous question, we have a deeper portfolio coming up at the back of ALXN1210 and ALXN5500. So we will continue to look for those options.","David L. Hallal","And Chris, we haven't disclosed whether or not what we're looking at precisely how it's administered. But over the course of this year, we'll be providing more perspective on the portfolio in general.","Operator","Next we'll move to Howard Liang with Leerink Partners.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Congrats to Lenny and David. Just going back to the Soliris AMR study. Just a follow-up. Have you looked at the patients in the control arm in terms of what percentage of those got Soliris, and whether there's a big difference between those who got Soliris and didn't get Soliris in the control arm?","Martin MacKay","That's part of the ongoing analysis -- how we're doing. As mentioned, we've got the 9-week primary endpoint data, and we will have more data in terms of secondary endpoints and the 1-year data. And that will give us time also to look at those patients that did move on to eculizumab during the study.","Operator","Next we'll move to Ian Somaiya with Nomura.","M. Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I wanted to echo the sentiment shared on both David and Lenny. Had a question for you on asfotase alfa. I was wondering whether in utero delivery is a viable option with asfotase alfa, and whether any type of formulation work would be required to evaluate that? And just on the guidance, Vikas, I might've missed this, but what was the benefit to the operating expense line from FX?","Leonard Bell","Yes. Martin will take the first part of your question.","Martin MacKay","It's an absolutely intriguing question, Ian, the notion of both in utero treatment, but also, in utero and diagnostics. Clearly, in these devastating diseases, there's a common theme, \"The earlier you can treat, the better.\" And certainly in the case of the perinatal and infantile form of hypophosphatasia, that would be an area we would like to look at. But please, and I know you wouldn't do this, don't underestimate the challenges of in utero delivery and diagnostics. But clearly, it's an area that we would be interested in but one step at a time in terms of the treatment of the infantile patient.","Vikas Sinha","On the guidance side, we normally land up getting benefit on the SG&A part, especially on the global infrastructure. And so my guess is around $50 million to $60 million.","M. Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Is that 5 0, 6 0 or 1 5?","Vikas Sinha","Yes, the 5 0, 6 0.","Operator","Next we'll move to Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelsey Harrison - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to ask around disclosure for some of these next-generation programs. Obviously, you've got some Phase I data you've talked about moving into Phase II. When should we start to think about getting data from the clinical studies? I mean, will we see anything this year? Or you think not until next year?","Martin MacKay","We won't -- we wouldn't anticipate clinical data this year, Matthew. Clearly, we'll run these trials with, again, great tenacity and urgency to push them along as we always do. But we will be mindful of waiting for the data, planning the trials accordingly. As David alluded to, we want to take more than one molecule and at this early stage, and we've got this portfolio coming up at the back. I would think a relatively steady stream of data next year and beyond. Another key fact for us is we aim to bring one of those forward to the market within that 2018 time frame that we talked about our 7 launches.","Operator","Next we'll move to Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My congrats to Lenny as well on all your accomplishments for the company and for patients and to David on the new position. I know the press release called out 17 preclinical programs. I'm curious: beyond the 7 for Moderna and the next-generation eculizumabs, just wondering if you could give us a sense of the therapeutic themes, technologies and stages of maturity for these programs, when we're going to learn more, and should we start to think about a significant expansion here of your internal discovery and development efforts going forward?","Martin MacKay","I counted 3 or 4 questions in there and you're right with the 17 preclinical programs. As you know, it's not really been our history to talk about such early programs in calls and at press releases, and I would say they are preclinical with all the caveats around them. But also say we're very excited in terms of the modalities that we're looking at. And that's over and above, as you correctly say, the Moderna collaboration, and also the therapeutic areas that we're working on. These are ultra-rare devastating diseases that we're working on in the portfolio. In terms of the last part of your question, I think it is fair to say we've built that portfolio over the last period. We're very keen to be able to fuel future growth after the next wave of products and launches that we talk about, the 7 -- up to 7 in the 2018 time frame. So beyond that, these will be the programs that will fuel that future growth.","Operator","Next we'll move to Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And congrats again to both David and Lenny. If you don't mind, a couple of questions. First one, Vikas, for you. COGS in Singapore, give us a sense -- is there sort of an incremental benefit over time in Singapore -- continues to capture more of the volume of sales? And then secondly, I'm not sure if you can comment, but is your thought to actually start one of the pivotals for the follow-on, the Soliris follow-on this year? Or is it probably starting more next year?","Leonard Bell","Vikas, why don't I just -- I'll take the second one and then over to you. So as Martin highlighted and we discussed earlier this month, one of our 12 development milestones is to initiate a Phase II trial in PNH in at least one of the next-generation molecules. And with that, Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Yes. So Yaron, in terms of COGS, we definitely having manufacturing outside of U.S. It's very beneficial for us depending on our -- based on our tax [indiscernible]. It's very hard to quantify that. So on the COGS line, it should remain the same -- stable [indiscernible].","Operator","Our last question will come from Bret Holley with Guggenheim.","Bret Holley - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'll add my congrats to both Lenny and David. My question is on your current thoughts on how strictly payers are likely to think about defining pediatric juvenile onset HPP? I mean, what's the nature of the discussions -- preliminary discussions, I'm sure -- had with payers.","Leonard Bell","We really -- in the preapproval phase, we haven't really had meaningful discussions. But to the extent it is what it is, and that is when was onset of disease, when was the first or more than one symptom of HPP first observed and presented to a medical professional. And so I think the key for us, obviously, is a good understanding of treating physicians, and truly recognizing the natural history of the patient's disease and recognizing what their medical history is associated with some of the early signs and symptoms of the disease.","Operator","That was our last question.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Altschuller, Vice President Investor Relations. Go ahead, ma'am.","Susan Altschuller","Thank you, good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's Performance for the Fourth Quarter and Full year of 2018. Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer; John Orloff, our Global Head of R&D; and Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial Officer. You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations Page on our website.","Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today, and we undertake no duty to update any of the statements after the call except as required by law.","I'd also like to remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered, in addition to, but not a substitute for, our GAAP results.","Thank you very much. Ludwig?","Ludwig Hantson","Thank you, Susan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. 2018 was a transformative year for Alexion. We established a strong foundation for continued growth and also advanced our mission of delivering innovative therapies to patients with rare diseases. As we move into 2019, we have an exciting future ahead.","As you can see on Slide 5, we achieved each of the 2018 objectives and exceeded in a number of areas. Let me highlight a few key themes, which will be critical to our future success. I strongly believe that how we achieve our objectives is equally as important as delivering on our goals. Today, we have a culture focused on compliance, serving our patients and acting with integrity, which will carry us forwards into our next phase of growth. We continue to demonstrate our development expertise in rare diseases, completing successful Phase III programs in PNH, atypical HUS and NMOSD. In parallel, we have proven our excellence in rare disease launch execution, as evidenced by Solaris in MG. We have launched Ultomiris for PNH ahead of schedule in U.S. and are preparing for launches in the EU and Japan, later this year. Finally, we rebuild and extended our pipeline through internal efforts and disciplined business developments.","As you can see on Slide 6, we delivered strong financial performance for both the quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter revenues of more than $1.1 billion represent our best quarterly revenues yet. As we move into 2019, there are five key areas, shown on Slide 7, where we will focus our efforts in order to continue building on our prior success: our first area of focus will be Ultomiris. We have a best-in-class goal of converting more than 70% of PNH patients within two years of launch. We're off to a strong start and are on track towards this conversion goal. Our second area of focus is neurology. In our first year with MG, we significantly increased the total number of patients on Solaris in the U.S. We filed for approval of Soliris in NMOSD in U.S. and Europe. We plan to take Ultomiris into several neurology studies, including Phase III MG and NMO studies as well as proof-of-concept studies in ALS and PPMS. We also intend to initiate a pivotal trial for 1830, formally known as SYNT001 in MG in 2019. Our third priority is continuing to grow on metabolic portfolio by increasing access to Strensiq and Kanuma and continued execution on our Phase III program in Wilson disease with 1840, previously known as WTX101. Fourth, we'll continue to build our pipeline to advancement of internal programs and business developments, including the recently announced deal with Caelum Biosciences. And finally, we are focused on delivering financial performance aligned to our long-term vision.","These five key objectives represent priorities for 2019 as well as opportunities to drive long-term sustainable growth. Looking ahead, we have aligned our corporate strategy to focus on our four therapeutic pillars as outlined on Slide 8. These pillars, PNH and atypical HUS, metabolic, neurology and FcRn, each have blockbuster potential. Later in the call, John and Brian will address how we plan to advance each pillar to drive durable long-term growth.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul, to discuss our 2018 financial results and 2019 guidance. Paul?","Paul Clancy","Thanks, Ludwig. This was a great fourth quarter camping off a strong 2018. Starting with Slide 10, we reported total revenues in the quarter of $1,129,000,000, an increase of 24% year-over-year, driven by continued performance of our Solaris in metabolic portfolios. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 53% in the fourth quarter, an expansion of 826 basis points, driven by top line leverage coupled with operating expense control.","Non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.14, representing 45% growth year-over-year. For the full year 2018, we delivered revenue growth of 16%, volume growth of 20% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 35%. Moving to Slide 11. Fourth quarter net product sales were driven by volume growth of 30%, partially offset by an FX headwind of 1% and a price headwind of 5%. The price headwind was largely driven by Solaris price changes in Turkey, as we formalized our reimbursement agreement subsequent to marketing authorization late in the third quarter of 2018.","Additionally, rebates in the United States and reimbursement agreements outside the United States in our metabolics business contributed to the price headwind. Turning to Slide 12, Soliris revenue in the fourth quarter was $977 million with year-over-year volume growth of 28%, driven primarily by strength in the U.S. and in Japan, including the growing contribution from MG. Underlying volume growth in the PNH and atypical HUS business remains solid through the year and was in the high single digits.","Moving to Slide 13, Strensiq revenues for the fourth quarter were $126 million, 32% revenue growth and a 43% volume growth year-over-year. Kanuma revenues in the fourth quarter were $26 million, a 17% revenue growth and 51% volume growth year-over-year. Turning to the P&L on Slide 14. During the quarter, non-GAAP R&D expense was $164 million, or 15% of revenues, and non-GAAP SG&A expense was $278 million, 25% of revenue. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 15%. We reported fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.14, growing 45% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per share was negative $0.20, which is inclusive of the Syntimmune IP R&D expense.","We ended the fourth quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. I'll now turn to Slide 15 for the 2019 financial guidance. We're guiding to total of revenue between $4,625,000,000 to $4,700,000,000, which represents 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range. For the combination of Solaris and Ultomiris, our revenue guidance is $3,970,000,000 to $4,020,000,000. This assumes continued momentum in MG as well as a modest initial contribution from our anticipated U.S. approval in the launch in NMOSD in the second half of the year. We assume MG patients will make up the largest population of patients on Solaris in the U.S. by year-end.","Also of note, we plan to transition from a direct to distributor model in certain international markets. The rationale for this transition is driven by focusing on our larger growth markets. While P&L neutral, we expect the net impact of this transition to be in approximately $25 million headwind to revenue in 2019. For Ultomiris, we expect steady conversion from Soliris. Recall, the first year loading dose results in a roughly 10% premium in the U.S. for the average adult PNH patient when compared to the labeled Solaris PNH maintenance dosing regimen. While hard to estimate, the guidance includes expectations of a headwind from competitor trials and studies of 1210 subQ and 1210 in MG.","Turning to metabolics. Our revenue guidance is $655 million to $680 million, reflecting continued patient additions for both Strensiq and Kanuma. This includes the impact of a strategic decision to proactively offer a discount for largest dose vial for Strensiq that began at the start of the year in the United States. We estimate price will be a 2% headwind in 2019 with approximately 1\/3 attributable to Soliris and 2\/3 attributable to metabolics.","We forecast FX impact net of hedging for 2019 to represent roughly a $60 million headwind, driven by the euro and the full year comparison of FX changes in Turkey, Russia and Brazil. GAAP operating margin is expected to be 36% to 43%, inclusive of restructuring and related expenses as well as milestone payments. Non-GAAP operating margin guidance is expected to be 54% to 55%, representing approximately 130 to 230 basis point expansion over 2018.","Non-GAAP R&D expend is expected to be 16% to 17% of revenue and includes increased investments for the ongoing 1830 clinical trials, the Phase III trial for 1840, regulatory filings for Soliris and NMOSD, our 1210 subcutaneous programs and initiation of 1210 MG, NMO, ALS and PPMS clinical programs. We also have R&D dollars earmarked for potentially new programs from business development efforts. Non-GAAP SG&A spend is expected to be 20% to 21% of revenues, as we expect to further invest behind the launch of Ultomiris in the U.S. and for potential launches outside the U.S. We'll also support our growing neurology portfolio with expansion of our MG sales footprint in preparations for the potential Soliris launch in NMOSD.","At the midpoint of this guidance, non-GAAP operating profit is expected to grow 17% year-over-year. We expect the non-GAAP effective tax rate similar to 2018. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $6.14 and $7.26. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to be between $9.10 and $9.30. The midpoint of this range is approximately 16% growth year-over-year.","With the strong momentum across the business, we're well positioned to deliver on our 2019 financial ambitions. I'll turn the call over to John.","John Orloff","Thank you, Paul. We've made significant progress advancing our pipeline over the past year and are entering 2019 with a robust portfolio of both early and late-stage development programs. On Slide 17, you can see our pipeline as of year-end 2017 following our rationalization and prioritization. In the span of only one year, through a combination of internal and business development efforts, we have dramatically expanded our portfolio as shown on Slide 18. Let me start with ALXN1210. We're moving forward with multiple programs in neurology. In parallel, we are investigating additional routes of administration including a high concentration 100 mg per ml IV formulation, which will reduce infusion time and be used in the development of multiple subcutaneous delivery options. Our internal once-weekly subcutaneous program is enrolling patients, and we expect to report bioavailability data from our Halozyme subcutaneous collaboration in the first quarter.","Moving to ALXN1840, we continue to advance our Phase III trial in Wilson disease. The trial is powered for superiority over current standard-of-care, as we believe 1840 could be transformative for patients with this devastating disease characterized by toxic copper accumulation. We have ongoing trials for ALXN1830, formally SYNT001, including Phase Ib\/IIa trials in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and in pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, or PVPF. We plan to initiate a Phase III trial for 1830 in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia in 2019 and are pleased to announce that we also intend to initiate a Phase III trial for 1830 in generalized myasthenia gravis. We believe there is a strong rationale for targeting FcRn in MG. We will provide additional updates on our pipeline programs at our upcoming Investor Day on March 20.","Turning to Slide 19. We reported top line results from our Phase III single-arm trial of Ultomiris in atypical HUS last week. The study met its primary objective with roughly 54% of patients demonstrating complete thrombotic microangiopathy or TMA response. This was a high bar, as patients had to meet all three criteria of complete TMA response: normalization in platelet count, normalization in LDH level and improved kidney function at the same time, at least, once over the course of the 26-week trial. In addition, each of these criteria had to be met for at least 28 consecutive days. With these positive data, we believe Ultomiris will be an effective, every eight week treatment option for aHUS patients, and we're moving forward with regulatory filings.","Moving to Slide 20, Soliris has provided a strong rationale for complement inhibition in neurology with the ability to impact both the neuromuscular junction and the central nervous system. As such, we plan to initiate Phase III trials of Ultomiris in gMG and NMOSD as well as proof-of-concept studies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS and primary progressive multiple sclerosis or PPMS. Our decision to initiate proof-of-concept trials in these indications is based on scientific rationale for the role of complementing these diseases. Recent publications provide evidence for elevated glial MAC protein and increased C5b-9 deposition in rapidly progressive ALS disease. Literature also supports elevated levels of C3 and C4 in PPMS at the time of disease progression compared to controls.","Turning to Slide 21. We remain committed to advancing our FcRn program with ALXN1830. 1830 has a strong product profile, demonstrating rapid IgG clearance in a dose-ranging study, high specificity for FcRn and no effect on albumin levels. We have planned to investigate every two week IV dosing in the upcoming Phase III studies. Furthermore, we plan to pursue a subcutaneous formulation. 1830 remains the first and only anti-FcRn therapy, currently in development for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a rare IgG mediated hemolytic disorder with no approved therapies. On the right hand of the slide, you'll see how FcRn fits into our vision with the evolution of our MG portfolio. We believe 1830 provides an opportunity to build on the MG footprint we've established since the launch of Solaris. Solaris, which was the first therapy approved for MG in more than 60 years has already transformed treatment for a growing subset of patients with the anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positive form of the disease, who continue to suffer from significant unresolved symptoms despite existing treatment options. However, the progressive and diverse nature of MG necessitates the need for additional and earlier treatment options. Most patients require some form of immunotherapy, which is generally associated with adverse events and also remains inadequate at controlling the disease.","1830 has the potential to be an important treatment option for patients and to be used earlier in the treatment paradigm. The possibility of a convenient, every two week or self-administered subcutaneous treatment option would be a meaningful improvement for patients. We believe that 1830, Soliris and Ultomiris are complementary assets in our growing MG portfolio and could address different needs of patients and collectively provide important optionality at different parts of the patient journey.","Turning now to Slide 22. Last week, we announced a collaboration with Caelum Biosciences to develop CAEL-101, a clinical stage hematology asset for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. This rare disease is characterized by overproduction of the misfolded monoclonal kappa and lambda light chains that results in deposits of abnormal amyloid and can lead to organ failure, most frequently in the heart and kidneys. AL amyloidosis is believed to affect over 20,000 patients in the U.S. and EU5, diagnosis may be protracted and only coincide with meaningful organ deterioration.","The current standard-of-care, which includes chemotherapy, does not address or treat organ failure and there are significant need for innovative therapies given the median survival time of less than 18 months following diagnosis. The clinical dataset includes in vivo imaging of CAEL-101 binding to AL amyloid in human organs. In a Phase Ia\/b trial, CAEL-101 demonstrated a 63% overall organ response rate as well as efficacy on cardiac and renal endpoints. We see a clear overlap with 101 in our hematology franchise. We believe, this partnership represents an opportunity to evolve our focus towards bringing innovative therapies to broader rare disease patient populations with significant unmet need. I'm very proud of the progress we've made advancing our portfolio over the course of 2018, and I'm looking forward to all we have planned in the coming year.","I'd like to take a brief moment to thank the broader R&D team for their work in the past year on business development, our ongoing developing programs, multiple pivotal trial readouts and regulatory submissions and importantly, the early approval for Ultomiris and PNH. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian, to discuss commercial highlights, Brian?","Brian Goff","Thank you, John. Starting on Slide 24, we're very pleased that the U.S. launch of Ultomiris is now underway. We believe, we can achieve a best-in-class conversion of at least 70% of patients within two years of launch, based on a number of operational components unique to our team. We have dedicated and highly-trained field teams, many of whom have years of experience and expertise in PNH. Our commercial product supply is ready, the Ultomiris REMs certification is in place and payer policy determination for access is underway. However, the most critical component of our launch is Ultomiris' strong clinical profile. By addressing the clinical needs, the clinical disease drivers of PNH, Ultomiris has the potential to become the new standard-of-care with LDH normalization, low incidents of breakthrough hemolysis, well-understood safety data and clear patient and physician preference for an every eight week dosing profile.","Importantly, since Ultomiris and Soliris bind to the same epitope on C5, we've shown in our pivotal 302 trial, the patients can safely switch without requiring a washout period. While still early in our launch, we're seeing promising early indicators of success and initial stakeholder feedback is very positive. Specifically, as of the end of January, our first full month of Ultomiris launch in the U.S., we already have approximately 5% of Soliris PNH patients confirmed, as OneSource cases for potential conversion and approximately half of those have already initiated Ultomiris therapy.","We have similar ambition to facilitate a rapid best-in-class conversion in Europe and Japan, prelaunch planning is underway with the first potential ex-U.S. launch in Germany midyear.","Turning to Slide 25. 10 years after the launch of Soliris, just 18 months ago, there were approximately 2,500 PNH and atypical HUS patients in the U.S. on therapy, and we've seen continued steady growth in this core ultrarare franchise. However, by the end of this year, our ambition is to have at least 5,000 patients on either Ultomiris or Soliris.","So as you can see in just over two years, we plan to expand our patient base by the same amount that previously required 10 years. This patient growth, driven primarily by neurology, is consistent with our strategic transition from a focus on ultrarare to rare diseases. It's also consistent with our global, sustainable and durable pricing strategy for Ultomiris, especially, as we expanded to new geographies and indications with larger addressable patient populations.","Moving to our metabolics franchise, on Slide 26. Strensiq ended the year with revenues of $475 million. We expect continued growth coming from Strensiq in 2019, as we identify new patients and seek reimbursement agreements in additional geographies.","Looking at Kanuma. We reported full year revenue of $92 million. Kanuma continues to grow steadily, but of course, is starting at a lower base. To date, Kanuma is launched and reimbursed in eight countries. We believe, Strensiq and Kanuma provide a solid base, as a build our metabolics portfolio into a sustainable blockbuster franchise. There's meaningful growth potential with 1840 for Wilson disease, which, if approved, will share strong call point synergies with Kanuma.","As you can see on Slide 27, our neurology franchise will continue to grow significantly, driven by continued uptake for Soliris in gMG as well as expansion into NMOSD, where we estimate there are 4,000 to 5,000 addressable patients in the U.S. We look forward to the prospect of bringing hope to these families and - to these patients rather and their families.","Moving to Slide 28. With a dedicated neurology field sales force as well as payer and market access teams, we believe, we have the right infrastructure in place to continue our momentum in gMG. We're especially pleased with the breadth of our gMG prescribing base with over 500 unique prescribers around the country as well as the depth given that roughly 1\/3 of gMG prescribers have more than one patient on Soliris therapy. Furthermore, we've still only addressed a small percentage of the targeted refractory population with Soliris treatment and expect gMG will be the largest patient volume indication for Soliris in the U.S. by the end of this year.","At the same time, we're actively preparing for a potential launch in NMOSD by training our growing neurology team. Relapse prevention remains the primary treatment goal for patients, who live in constant fear of the potential devastating effects of another attack. Given significant need and the strength of our data, we have a sense of urgency in preparing for launch.","I want to thank our team for their continued efforts and dedication to bringing hope to patients suffering from rare diseases and would like to reiterate the organization's excitement, as we move through the year.","I'd now like to turn the call back to Ludwig, for closing comments. Ludwig?","Ludwig Hantson","Thank you, Brian. As we've discussed, 2018 has been a year of tremendous growth and evolution. It has also been a year of great success. Thanks to the efforts of our employees around the world. On Slide 32, you will see our four blockbuster pillars for growth, overlaid with our 2019 objectives. This list, while not exhaustive, provides a means to benchmark our accomplishments over the course of the coming year. I'm proud of our achievements and looking forward to our future. Most importantly, I'm excited that we'll be able to help more patients than ever before. We know that many of these patients do not have any treatment options today. I look forward to updating you on our progress, as we go.","With that, we will now open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.","Geoffrey Porges","I'll start off, Ludwig, with a sort of macro one, if I may. You were probably saying perhaps some long awaited consolidation in the industry. And could you talk a little bit about the M&A environment that you see? You've obviously had some experience with this. And give us a sense of how your investors are sort of talking to? Because, of course, one of the things we're hearing is that company's trying to pivot away from dependence on one franchise and Solaris, Ultomiris is still about 85% of your business. So if you could just give us a little bit of color on that? And then could you explain the Strensiq price effect a little more clearly? What will be the net reduction in the per patient per year revenue? That will be really helpful.","Ludwig Hantson","Yes, absolutely. So I'll talk about strategy and then Paul and Brian will talk about Strensiq. Going back, Geoff, 2017, we had a refocused strategy that we've put in place. And what you've seen is that the team has delivered, and I would say, maybe over delivered on, what we said, we were going to do. And you and I had that discussions. I'm very proud of what the Alexion team has achieved. We're staying on course. We're staying on strategy. And as we discussed over the last months, we're moving our strategy from ultrarare to rare. I think the MG launch is a great example of that. We have therapeutic areas that we will continue to focus on. We're building for blockbuster franchises that we believe will be durable, sustainable. From an M&A perspective, I think, what we've done in 2018 is a great example of how we think about M&A, how we think about moving forward. You'll see that we'll continue to focus on clinical assets and think the Caelum acquisition is again a great example on how we think about accelerating our pipeline. And then with respect to the Strensiq question, Paul?","Paul Clancy","Yes. I'll be glad to thanks, Geoff, for it. Let me just try to provide a little bit more clarity. It's been an evolution over the last year and a half. So it's actually started probably 14 months ago. It all is tied towards trying to have a sustainable pricing strategy, mostly for the adult population of Strensiq. So we are proactively, on the largest vial, kind of, taking - putting some rebates in place in order to accommodate that. For the company, next - 2019, we have about a 2% price headwind, of which metabolics is about 2\/3 of that. So you step away from it and really not much price dynamics going on. So it's really a kind of that proactive move with the adult population.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","May be just one for Paul on the guidance. I mean, if we analyze the fourth quarter Soliris sales, it looks like you can easily achieve the bottom end of your complement franchise guidance for the year for '19. So maybe you can help us think about the tailwinds from MG and Ultomiris versus the headwinds of competitor trial enrollment? I know, in the past, you guys have quantified that. Can you give us a little bit more granularity on that?","Paul Clancy","Yes. Terrence, I think, everybody just heard the price impact for the total business. So let me kind of give you a complete answer of kind of the puts and takes on the numbers, particularly on the revenue fronts. Price, we just went over, foreign exchange, we expect - we build a plan based on the current spot rate. And the net effect is about a $60 million headwind on foreign exchange net of hedging. And that's inclusive of effectively the wraparound effect of changes in FX or currency in Russia, Brazil and Turkey. We do have embedded - more specific to your question, Terence, we do have embedded a headwind, if you will, for competitor trials. It's effectively an estimate based on what the publicly announced clinical trials are for those competitors in PNH, HUS and MG. We don't give the number just largely, because it's going to be hard to reconcile, as we go throughout the year. We just won't have that visibility. And then, as I had noted in the script, we are intending to change some of our smaller international markets to distributors. These kind of all about focus. And that's about a $25 million headwind. And that's effectively all attributable to Solaris. Now the tailwinds, which is way more important, is we expect to have underlying PNH, HUS continued high single-digit growth. NMOSD, while modest, it's an important, what we hope to be, a launch in the United States this year. And we're effectively planning for continued kind of steady momentum in MG, which ends up being a big part of our growth business and continue momentum in metabolics.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital Markets.","Kennen MacKay","Maybe one for the clarity and also tying in Brian on this one. I was just wondering if you could help us understand the sort of one quarter to 1\/3 of Soliris sales that are coming from the EU? Sort of how this breaks down by market over there? Is this predominantly Germany and the U.K? Or are there some other factors that we should be thinking about there? And for Brian, wondering in the EU, aside from sort of a country-by-country launch over there, is there any different dynamics we should be thinking about, as it relates to switching patients from Soliris to Ultomiris and sort of the guidance we've seen in the U.S. versus what we could expect there?","Paul Clancy","Let me kind take the first part of that, Kennen. So it's been a while since I'm being called Clancy. So that sounds good. It was back in high school. Look, I think, the way to think about Europe is, Germany is by far and away the lion share and the biggest market. And very similar to other places. I'd say, the big five in Europe makeup well north of 2\/3 of the business in Europe. We have obviously strong country penetration, but it still is pretty much dominated by the big five.","Brian Goff","Yes, and this is Brian, or you can refer to me as Goff, if you want. The - in Europe as well, thinking about Ultomiris, our ambition first of all is the same as we have in the U.S. that when we launch in a given country, we would look to convert at least 70% within two years post-launch. And 2019 really is a Germany story when we think about Europe. The dynamics are a little bit different in that we've known for many years, of course, the payer challenges can be significant. So we're engaging with those payers as early as we possibly can and as well systems tend be a little bit more integrated. The hospital and the outpatient system, for example, particularly in Germany, so that will play into our launch dynamics as well.","Ludwig Hantson","For 2019, Brian, we think that Germany will be the only European country to launch.","Brian Goff","Yes, it's really a story of the U.S., which started as we mentioned our first full month is now reported. And then Germany, hopefully, at the midyear point and then, of course, we'll look ahead to Japan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham","Just had a few. Ludwig, another one on strategy. You've come out of 2017, the trough quite nicely, but are there global commercial markets, for example, like Latin America that are worth revisiting or less penetrated overall. And then Paul, I know, the goal is 70% conversion to Ultomiris in two years, but do you think it'll be linear? I'm just trying to get a sense for the conversion implied in your 2019 guidance. And congrats on the Super Bowl, by the way.","Paul Clancy","It's about time someone said something. Thanks, Geoff. Coming from you, that means a lot.","Ludwig Hantson","So I'll take the first one with respect to the strategy and your question, Jeff, is in reference to geographical footprints. When you think about the biosimilar footprint and the geo opportunity that we have, we believe that we're in a position of strength. We clearly have a strong position in North America as well as Europe. There are some pockets of opportunity outside of those markets. And we do believe that we have the footprint and the capability to do business. So we look at the LATAM, as a country of growth that will move up the ranks within our geo footprint, I would say, the answer is not necessarily. With the portfolio that we have, we will continue to focus on our key markets. And our key markets are, U.S., Europe as well as Japan.","Brian Goff","Jeff, it's Brian. And I'll take the second part around the trend that we expect for that conversion of Ultomiris. I mean, so far, it's one full month in. We're encouraged by the progress we've made. We're right on track where we wanted to be. And I would expect because of the puts and takes that often happen in rare and ultrarare diseases, it'll be more of a linear progression, is what we would expect. Of course, in this case, it's conversion. So we have a good sense as to where the patients are. As I mentioned in my comments, we have experience that goes back to years and many cases with our commercial field teams. And we have a now early adopters, physicians, who have already identified patients and those have moved through the system. We'll be waiting in the coming weeks and months and working towards additional payer policy determinations. And then, of course, as clinicians get more experience with Ultomiris and patients get into the cadence of visits to see their clinicians, we would expect that conversion to continue.","Ludwig Hantson","So as we discussed weeks ago during the Q&A session, we should not expect a bolus of influx of new patients. As we - we don't have too much clinical - patients in our clinical program, the commercial uptake will take months and - but we're really, really pleased with what we have so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray.","Christopher Raymond","Just on the 1210 aHUS data, you guys kind of, I think, verbally, a few days back, when the data came out, called attention to differing baseline patient characteristics that I think you guys were saying sort of made comps to the Soliris data difficult. Knowing that you maybe want to say some of this for publication, can you give us some summary differences around each percent on dialysis and maybe other markers with the disease severity just - so folks - so we can have a sense of how to contextualize that?","John Orloff","Sure, Chris. This is John. So I would just say at the top that we're very pleased with the data that demonstrated a meaningful effect in patients with atypical HUS. As you know, these are very sick - critically ill patients. And it's always difficult to make cross-study comparisons, in fact, this is generally inappropriate, because the populations are somewhat different. And I can speak to that in a minute. But also, there is an evolution in standard-of-care, how patients were diagnosed, how they are managed. And the Soliris trials were done a decade ago. Having said that, this was generally a sicker patient population. They were older, there was a higher proportion that were on dialysis, over 50% were on dialysis. They had extrarenal signs and symptoms in about 90% of the patients. And if you look at baseline LDH, platelet levels and estimate a GFR, they're all more severe than the Soliris study that you've seen published in American Journal of Kidney Diseases and is also part of our label.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Matteis from Stifel.","Paul Matteis","Just on Europe for 1210. I was wondering if you could just speak at least at a high level on your current thinking on pricing there and whether or not maintaining pricing parity with the year one dosing of Ultomiris to Soliris is feasible in that market if you need to use price as a lever. And then just quickly on NMO, I'd love to see a comment qualitatively on how developed that market is in the U.S. relative to MG? And whether or not you think the MG launch is at all a reasonable comp?","Brian Goff","Yes. Paul, it's Brian. I'll start with a question on Ultomiris and Europe for pricing. As we've talked about with Soliris, we maintained a narrow pricing globally, narrow pricing band, I should say. So the goal would be to maintain generally the same with Ultomiris. It's too early to get, of course, into specifics while we wait for the European approval. And as I'd mentioned in a prior question, our expectation is that Germany will really be the key European launch opportunity in 2019, in this year, and the way it works in Germany is that for the one year period, which is pre-AMNOG, it allows for open market-based pricing, which, as we get closer to launch, we'll, of course, finalize. And then with respect to NMOSD, that's a really exciting opportunity for us. We're very pleased with the data, of course. We have an ambition to make NMOSD, a meaningful contributor to our neurology business, if approved.","There are clear differences between gMG and NMOSD, including, maybe top of the list would be the available treatment options. Just as a reminder, there are no FDA-approved treatment choices for patients in NMOSD. And the other key consideration is, this is all about the relapse. And so we'll have a very strong focus when we get to the point of launch around education of our data, the significance and the fear that exist at the patient level for each subsequent relapse as well as focusing clinicians on really reconsidering what stable means. And that's one of the classic things that happens in rare diseases is where there are limited treatment options, there tends to be some inertia, which will lead to overcome with our educational efforts, both on redefining stability as well as the role of complement in that this is treating that patient in a completely different way than they've ever been treated before. So we look forward to it. And hopefully, that's a kind of midyear opportunity.","Ludwig Hantson","And the disease, Brian, has a high diagnosis rate.","Brian Goff","Yes, highly diagnosed. And the other thing, I guess, I should mention is the prevalence would put this in the neighborhood of about 2\/3 of the regain kind of population that we look at for gMG. So it's somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000 patients in the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.","Robyn Karnauskas","Sorry, I'm losing my voice. This question, I think - we've had a lot of questions regarding Europe and Ultomiris and pricing. I think big picture, I think, what we're trying to get out is does Soliris and Ultomiris have a real future in Europe, given that Hantson is saying now that they're going to start enrolling your biosimilar program in patent situation. Before thinking about Europe, conservatively, how do you internally think about that part of the business? I know you've mentioned before, because the split is going to be greater to the U.S. versus Europe and we should think about that over time, but maybe help us give some sense if you're trying to be more conservative then how to think about Europe as a revenue stream for those two products?","Brian Goff","Yes. Robyn, it's Brian, again. Well, I'll pick up with the same thread on - first on the pricing, as I mentioned, our ambition will be to stay in the same band that we've had with Soliris. So I think I've added enough color on that. The other key point is, with our ambition for conversion itself, we believe, we have a pathway towards the 70% conversion within two years. And the good news is when we think about a potential biosimilar entry point, we don't see that occurring inside of a three year horizon. So the key point here is that we believe we have enough time to convert those patients. The other benefit I would add is, it's always helpful if you have the U.S. sort of going first as it is right now, because we have all kinds of launch learnings that we'll be able to amortize once we get to the point of launch beginning in Germany, hopefully, at the midyear point. And we have the exact same dynamic with gMG, of course. So that's how I would see Europe unfolding.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America.","Ying Huang","The first one I have to ask about the European patent. Since the EPO recently revoked the 2027 formulation patent for Soliris, can you talk about your confidence level on the composition of matter? And also the better use applications in Europe? And then secondly, maybe, for Brian. You mentioned that there are 4,500 addressable NMOSD patients in U.S., can you talk about the diagnosis rates? Are these all diagnosed and under active care by physicians, therefore, whenever it's approved, you're ready to launch?","Ludwig Hantson","Sure, I'll take the first question and Brian will take the second one. I want to go back to what Brian just said. Our strategy in Europe is to redefine the standard-of-care in PNH and, eventually, hopefully, also in HUS when we get the approval. We believe that, that strategy is a conversion strategy and we have time to execute on that. Brian was talking about at least three years for PNH. Our situation - we also have the regulatory exclusivity apart. Our situation for HUS, I would say, worst-case scenario, is six years. I think you're all aware of the November 2023 timeline that we have. So that's our strategy is to redefine standard-of-care in PNH and eventually in HUS. And we believe, we have the time to do that. Now with respect to the EPO situation, we are aware of the formulation challenge and the outcome. We have not seen the written documentation. We will be assessing our appeal process in the next weeks once we get the document. These are two different processes. So the formulation process as well as the composition of matter and matter of use process, these are two different processes. We believe that we have a strong position here. Brian, with respect to the second question?","Brian Goff","Yes. Ying, your question about the NMOSD and the 4,000 to 5,000 addressable patients. First off, the - when we say addressable, what we mean by that is, these are patients who have active disease, meaning they have relapses that fits with the PREVENT pivotal Phase III trial. Secondly, it's that they've been tested for aquaporin-4 antibody, which is fairly ubiquitous, that's a test that's done fairly frequently. And the third is that there - in some form of treatment, and it's really the third point that will be the heavy-lift educationally that we will go after. And that's again to focus on redefining what stability means for the clinician, because they just have had not had therapeutic options certainly that have been approved. And secondly, to really emphasize the point that it is all about the relapse. It's terrorizing for patients, it's very unpredictable and unfortunately, what it means for patients often times is they have blindedness or some form of paralysis or loss of bladder control or all of the above or higher rates of mortality. So we will focus heavily on those educational aspects and the role of complement. But we do believe that many of those patients are already diagnosed, they're in the system and they tend to be in NMOSD centers of excellence, which are fairly concentrated or in MS centers and having built up now quite a neurology team that has experience now, not only with gMG, but also coming from the MS world, that gives us confidence as well with our launch potential.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anupam Rama from JP Morgan.","Anupam Rama","I think at the conference, you mentioned that the Phase III NMO data, may be at AAN, is that still the case? And if the data are at AAN, what's the sort of scope of data we're going to be getting? And are there any particular endpoints beyond relapse we should really be focusing on?","John Orloff","Anupam, this is John. Yes, we've submitted a late-breaker to AAN. So we do plan on presenting, that hasn't been accepted yet. But we will plan to present that. That's in early May. And we'll be showing, in addition to the top line results, the key secondary endpoints that include measurements of disability and disease progression.","The data itself, we think, is extremely strong. I mean, these are critically ill patients where every relapse gives a potential devastating complication for patients. And so when you look at the competition, where the percentage of relapse raise in the 70% range, 70 percentage-wise, and we have 98% of patients that are relapse-free after 48 weeks, 95% reduction in annualized relapse rate, that is an important factor, because that next extra relapse could be devastating for those patients, could cause death, blindness, paralysis. And so the goal should be to achieve a relapse-free world in these patients.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Harrison","I was just wondering if you could just give us a little bit of color on what the payer discussions are like in the U.S. for Ultomiris. How those are going? How those are progressing? How you think they may impact uptake in the U.S.? And sort of what sort of coverage you'd expect to get?","Brian Goff","Matthew, it's Brian. Sure. We're very active in payer discussions. And so far, I would summarize to say they're quite encouraging. So a little bit early right now to have policy determinations that takes typically weeks if not months. It really depends on the payer. But on the commercial side, it has been quite productive. And I think the payers generally recognize the value that Ultomiris offers at the patient level, of course, with the every eight week dosing relative to every two week infusions with Soliris. And then the pricing decision that we have taken with all the clinical data behind it, you might say was a bit surprising to the payers, pleasantly surprising, particularly given the trend that they see with most other follow-on type products. So that gives us a position of strength as we wait for the coming weeks and months for those determinations. And so far, we're right on track.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen and Company.","Philip Nadeau","A couple of questions for Paul. Paul, first in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that there is R&D funding set aside for business development in the guidance. Could you give us some sense of how much R&D funding is set aside for business development? And whether we should expect any more collaborations to be announced near term? And then second, as we look to model Ultomiris in aHUS, it looks like based on the dosing difference that there's - there will be a 40% average price discount for Ultomiris in aHUS versus Soliris. Is that accurate? Is there anything that we're not taking into account, like average weight per patient or something that makes the pricing more similar than different?","Paul Clancy","Yes. Let me start with the second part, Phil, thanks for the questions. It's - that's a little high. It's probably closer to 30% discount on kind of patient-to-patient basis on an ongoing basis. With respect to - and that obviously, that's in the United States, where we've announced the pricing. With respect to the kind of earmarked funds for business development, it's in the range of kind of $60 million to $80 million. And we just do that so that we ensure that it is part and core to our strategy. So we hope that we keep a kind of drumbeat of business development where we'll remain disciplined, obviously, so there you go.","Operator","Our next question comes from Martin Auster from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Martin Auster","I had a couple on the Ultomiris opportunity in aHUS. I know there is a bit more turnover in that market compared to PNH. And I was just wondering if you think the Soliris, Ultomiris conversion rate were both any different there? And then secondly, when we talk to clinicians, they often say, both the kind of the administrative difficulties with Soliris relative to Ultomiris and then also the price. I'm curious if you think Ultomiris could achieve greater rates of chronic use than Soliris has in aHUS with advantages on both of those factors.","Brian Goff","Martin, it's Brian. Good questions. First, our ambition is the same best-in-class conversion in atypical HUS, as we talk about for PNH. We just, of course, released our very strong atypical HUS Phase III data, which we're quite pleased about. So the team is moving forward with the submission for that. And there are differences, of course, between PNH and atypical HUS, as you know. However, with both diseases, the every eight week dosing is quite meaningful for patients and for physicians. We expect that will resonate very well. And then as you noted, there could be an opportunity to improve the persistence with patients on atypical HUS with Ultomiris. We'll have to see how that plays out. But that could in part address some of the shorter-course therapy that can happen with Soliris. And the last thing is just reflecting on Paul's earlier comments that the fact that Ultomiris' U.S. pricing has established a discount to Soliris when we get to the point of launch for atypical HUS, will really also create an opportunity to address some of the concerns that have existed around cost in excess.","Operator","And our final question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI.","Joshua Schimmer","I just want to understand the comments about key markets being the U.S., Europe and Japan. Maybe you can elaborate or expand on the global filing and pricing strategy for the C5 franchise in myasthenia gravis? And then will you press to launch in the rest of the world territories? Which territories are you not targeting and why? And do you expect incremental indications for Ultomiris beyond PNH will have any impact on price or is the initial launch price in PNH the one that you expect will set the tone across indications?","Brian Goff","Josh, maybe I can just start. It's Brian, again, on paraphrasing. What I'm hearing the question is about is U.S., Germany, Japan, those are three very important markets for us that's also - that's been the entry point for our launches as of late. Starting with gMG, which has been a big storyline throughout 2018 and moving into 2019. We continue to engage with payers and minsters of health and the like across our geographic footprint. But because pricing and economics and reimbursement are increasingly globally linked, we're quite careful to make sure that the economics all lined up before we look towards a market or entry point. And we've seen that in the case of Strensiq and Kanuma where we have continued to progress with thoughtful geographic expansion where the payers have recognized the value of those products. We do the same thing with gMG. And we would expect looking ahead with Ultomiris, particularly beyond 2019. As those discussions unfold, for example, in Europe, then we would be looking at continued launch sequencing beyond Germany.","John Orloff","And Josh, this is John. I'd just add, as you know, we're planning to start the MG trial for Ultomiris this quarter. We have plans to initiate the NMO program for Ultomiris later this year as well as two proof-of-concept studies in diseases that have high unmet need, a little bit higher risk than those core indications where we already have proof-of-concept for C5 inhibition. But it allows us to potentially expand into a larger patient base across neurology therapeutic area.","Ludwig Hantson","Perfect. So we're going to close the call. The - needless to say that we're very proud of what the Alexion team has achieved in 2018, but also 2019, I believe, will be an exciting year. We have two launches ahead of us. The Ultomiris PNH conversion is going to be a key priority. Also, talking about accelerating our neurology portfolio and clearly, we'll have some key R&D milestones. So I believe, 2019 could be another strong year for Alexion.","So with that, we'll close the call. Thank you all for dialing in and enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions]. ","I would now like to hand the conference over to Susan Altschuller. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Susan Altschuller","Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for Alexion's performance in the third quarter 2019. Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer; John Orloff, our Global Head of R&D; and Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial Officer. Aradhana Sarin, our Chief Strategy and Business Officer and Incoming CFO will be available for Q&A.","You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website. Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today, and we undertake no duty to update any of the statements after the call, except as required by law.","I'd also like to remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, our GAAP results. Thank you. Ludwig?","Ludwig Hantson","Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share the outstanding performance in the third quarter and the continued progress of Alexion 2.0. I\u2019m proud of the excellent execution across all aspects of our business. For the second quarter in a row we received multiple regulatory approvals, including most recently ULTOMIRIS for aHUS in the U.S. and SOLIRIS for NMOSD in the EU. These are in addition to the ULTOMIRIS PNH approval in the EU at the start of July. ","Collectively, we have received five global regulatory approvals in the last four months and all launches are off to a strong start. We have also made significant progress further growing and diversifying our clinical stage pipeline with three business development deals; Eidos, Stealth and Achillion and we expect to add four new clinical stage assets, including two in Phase 3 developments. We are continuing to make remarkable progress evolving the company. ","Slide 6 highlights key third quarter achievements beyond those I\u2019ve just mentioned. First, our team has continued to demonstrate launch excellence across the globe, driving rapid PNH conversion to ULTOMIRIS. The U.S. launch trajectory continues upwards and the conversions in Germany and Japan are outpacing the rapid start we saw in the U.S. ","Second, we continue to accelerate our neurology portfolio. Today is the second anniversary of the FDA approval of SOLIRIS for gMG, marking the company's entrance into rare neurology. Now just two years later, neurology is on track to be our largest franchise, driven by continued strong adoption in gMG as well as robust early demand in NMOSD. ","Third, we continue to grow our metabolics portfolio with new STRENSIQ and KANUMA patients while also progressing the Phase 3 study of 1840 in Wilson Disease. ","Fourth, we have further built our pipeline through both internal and external efforts. In addition to the new business development additions I highlighted earlier, we have also grown our pipeline by progressing our internal assets, including late stage with multiple registrational programs underway and even we\u2019re on track to start in 2020, as well as early stage moving 1720 into the clinic. ","And fifth, we have once again delivered on our financial ambitions, with strong revenue and volume growth this quarter. ","As we look to the future, we're focused on the durability of our core franchises, as well as the further diversification of the portfolio to drive continued near and long-term growth. In order to do this, we're focused on three key priorities highlighted on Slide 7. The first is conversion. We believe that ULTOMIRIS is the future of C5 inhibition and the patient demand we see supports this. ","Second is expansion. In particular of our C5 franchise there is an opportunity to help even more patients with ULTOMIRIS. And we have expanded the development program to seven diseases. PNH, HUS, gMG, NMOSD, HSCT-TMA, ALS, PPMS and also weekly subcu dosing. In addition, 1720 moved into the clinic. With both 1810 and 1720, we have optionality and the potential to treat a variety of complement-mediated diseases not addressed by our current portfolio. ","A third area of focus is diversification, which we have specifically focused on as we have grown our pipeline. Much of this is driven by our ongoing business development efforts, which have included 11 deals in less than two years, seven of which have been clinical stage and we continue to look for additional opportunities. We are rebuilding our pipeline from the ground up. Just two years ago, we had only three programs in late-stage clinical development: ULTOMIRIS for PNH; and aHUS; and SOLIRIS for NMOSD. ","As you can see on Slide 8, our significantly expanded pipeline is poised to deliver at least 10 potential launches over the coming years. These launches span a range of disease areas, patient populations, routes of administration and geographies. Our expanded portfolio positions us well to deliver long-term sustainability and value creation with many important catalysts in 2020 and 2021. ","Transforming a company does not happen overnight. And I'm incredibly proud of how much we've accomplished in a short time, meeting, and in many cases exceeding expectations. ","We have established a very strong foundation on which to continue building Alexion 2.0 and remain committed to further evolving and growing the company to ensure it is positioned to deliver well into the future. ","With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss our third quarter financial results. Paul?","Paul Clancy","Thanks Ludwig. Starting with Slide 10, we reported third quarter total revenues of $1.263 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year. This was driven by gMG, continued growth in the core business and ULTOMIRIS PNH conversion. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 57%, an expansion of 357 basis points, driven by top-line growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.79, a 38% growth year-over-year. ","Moving to Slide 11, third quarter net product sales were driven by volume growth of 23% and partially by a price tailwind of 1%. ","Turning to Slide 12, SOLIRIS revenue in the third quarter was $991 million with year-over-year volume growth of 11%, driven primarily by strength in the United States and Japan, which both include the growing contribution from our gMG business. SOLIRIS revenues were partially impacted by ULTOMIRIS conversion. ","ULTOMIRIS revenue in the third quarter was $90 million, which now includes contributions from Europe and Japan. Recall, there's a benefit in the quarter that each patient starts ULTOMIRIS treatment due to the loading dose impact. Subsequent quarters are then impacted by the maintenance dose discount in extended every 8-week dosing interval. We expect this dynamic will create some revenue fluctuation on a quarter-over-quarter basis going forward for ULTOMIRIS. Recall with aHUS, we anticipate the dynamic maybe more pronounced given the even greater maintenance dose discount to SOLIRIS. ","The total revenue for our C5 franchise, which includes SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS, grew 22% year-over-year across PNH atypically aHUS, gMG and NMOSD. Underlying volume growth in the PNH and aHUS business remained solid in the quarter, and we continue to expect high-single-digit underlying volume growth for this year. ","Moving to Slide 13, STRENSIQ revenues for the third quarter were $154 million representing 36% revenue growth and 36% volume growth year-over-year. KANUMA revenues in the third quarter were $28 million representing 12% revenue growth and a 16% volume growth year-over-year. ","Turning to the P&L on Slide 14, during the quarter non-GAAP R&D expense was $186 million or 15% of revenues. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $260 million or 21% of revenues. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 11%. The GAAP rate was approximately 13%. Both Q3 non-GAAP and GAAP taxes benefited by a change in estimate of our current and prior year foreign-derived intangible income deductions based on additional guidance provided by the U.S. Treasury Department related to U.S. tax reform. ","We reported third quarter non-GAAP EPS of $2.79 growing 38% year-over-year, GAAP EPS was $2.08. We ended the third quarter with approximately $2.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. In the third quarter, we repurchased $335 million in shares, in accordance with our share stabilization plan to offset equity awards. We've completed share stabilization for all of 2019 and a portion of 2020. ","This week, the Board has approved a new authorization for $1 billion as we've nearly completed the prior authorization. This is primarily earmarked for share stabilization for future years. Strategic deployment to further build the pipeline remains our primary focus for capital deployment. ","I'll now turn to Slide 15, for our updated financial guidance, which Aradhana and I jointly developed. We're guiding to total revenues between $4.860 billion to $4.890 billion, an increase from prior guidance. This represents 18% growth year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. ","For the combination of SOLIRIS and ULTOMIRIS, our revenue guidance is $4.180 billion to $4.200 billion. This assumes continued momentum in gMG, incorporates our ongoing launch of NMOSD in the U.S., and the launch of ULTOMIRIS for PNH in the U.S., Europe and Japan. ","Turning to metabolics, our revenue guidance is $680 million to $690 million. We estimate price will be a 2% headwind in 2019 and foreign exchange impact net of hedging is expected to represent an approximate $40 million headwind. GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 41% and 42% inclusive of restructuring and related expenses as well as upfront payments. ","Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 55% to 56% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. Non-GAAP R&D expense is expected to be 14% to 15% of revenues. We intend to further build and progress the pipeline and expect clinical program spend especially for late stage development to increase in 2020. ","Non-GAAP SG&A spend is expected to be 21% to 22% of revenues for full year 2019, slightly increased from prior guidance as we support the numerous launches around the world. We expect the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 13%. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $8.58 and $8.78. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $10.25 and $10.40. The midpoint of the non-GAAP earnings per share is approximately 30% growth year-over-year. This guidance excludes the financial impact of the recently announced agreement to require Achillion as it's not anticipated to close until the first half of 2020. We\u2019ve delivered a strong quarter and we're well positioned to deliver on our 2019 goals. ","I'll now turn the call over to John to provide an R&D update. ","John Orloff","Thank you, Paul. Here on Slide 17 is our development portfolio, which has grown substantially this year. We now have 22 planned development programs. And as Ludwig mentioned earlier, this leads to the potential for at least 10 launches by 2023, with significant milestones in 2020 and 2021. This further diversification includes three business development deals announced in the past two months with Eidos, Stealth and Achillion. ","I will also note that we entered into a asset purchase agreement, pending bankruptcy proceedings with Immune Pharma to acquire an anti-eotaxin-1 antibody for potential development in inflammatory diseases. So we continue to bolster our early stage pipeline as well. ","Turning to Slide 18 and our key late-stage programs starting with ULTOMIRIS. We expect to have at least five ongoing registrational trials in 2020 including HSCT-TMA, gMG, NMOSD, ALS and weekly subcutaneous formulation for PNH and atypical aHUS. We also anticipate initiating trials in additional indications and expect to update you on our strategy to further expand ULTOMIRIS next year. ","Moving to ALXN1840 for Wilson\u2019s Disease, we remain on track to complete enrollment in our Phase 3 trial in early 2020. 1840 has the potential to be highly differentiated from current treatments due to 10,000 fold higher affinity for copper, potentially improving liver function and neuropsychiatric symptoms and significant improvement in dosing. Following review with regulators, we will be moving forward with a registrational Phase 2\/3 trial for CAEL-101 in AL light chain amyloidosis stratifying patients by Mayo Clinic stages II, IIIA and IIIB.","Turning to our emerging anti-FcRN portfolio. We remain on track to manufacturer sufficient supply for 1830, our lead anti-FcRN asset by year-end and plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia early next year. We will also begin a Phase 2 study of subcutaneous 1830 in gMG in the second half of 2020, following generation of subcutaneous data in healthy volunteers. ","In addition, we anticipate data from the SAD\/MAD study of ABY-039, a potential best-in-class subcutaneous anti-FcRN we are developing with Affibody in the first half of 2020. On the right, you see the late-stage programs from our three recently announced business development deals. I will provide a little more detail on each of these in the coming slides. ","Moving to Slide 19, which illustrates that across these late-stage programs and platforms, we have the opportunity to diversify and significantly expand the reach of our portfolio to many additional patients with significant unmet needs. We're able to leverage our ultra rare and rare disease capabilities for these patients, who have very limited treatment options. And this is only the beginning. For example with oral Factor D and FcRN, we see opportunity in numerous complement-mediated diseases, many that impact much larger populations than those we currently treat. ","Moving to Slide 20. We announced last week that we entered into an agreement to acquire Achillion. Pending the satisfaction of customer and closing conditions and relevant regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2020. This acquisition would add two clinical stage oral Factor D inhibitors to our pipeline. Factor D is a critical control point for the complement\u2019s alternative pathway and is implicated in numerous rare diseases with significant unmet needs. For example, in the areas of nephrology and ophthalmology. ","Importantly, selective inhibition of the alternative pathway allows Lectin and Classical pathways to continue to fight infection. Therefore, Factor D inhibitors have the potential to advance the standard-of-care with oral administration for multiple rare complement-mediated diseases. And both 4471 and 5228 provide important opportunities to diversify our complement portfolio beyond C5. ","We also recently announced an option to co-develop and commercialize a late stage therapy for mitochondrial diseases with Stealth Biotherapeutics, elamipretide is a novel potential first-in-class therapy that targets mitochondrial dysfunction, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 study in people with Primary Mitochondrial Myopathy or PMM, a genetic mitochondrial disease. There are no therapies approved to treat PMM, which is characterized by debilitating skeletal muscle weakness, chronic fatigue and exercise intolerance. ","Phase 2 results from Stealth\u2019s MMPOWER-2 study showed strong improvement in six minute walk test results among patients with low walking ability. These results informed the inclusion criteria and primary endpoints for the ongoing Phase 3 MMPOWER-3 study, from which topline results are expected in the first quarter of 2020. ","In addition, to exercise the option provides the opportunity to treat patients with Barth Syndrome, Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy and geographic atrophy associated with dry age-related macular degeneration. We believe elamipretide has the potential to meaningfully improve the treatment of mitochondrial-driven disease, and we look forward to the opportunity to work with our partners at Stealth to bring this treatment to patients. ","Moving to Slide 22, and our agreement with Eidos Therapeutics to develop AG10 for transthyretin amyloidosis or ATTR in Japan. ATTR is a progressive fatal disease in which transthyretin can be destabilized and misfolded, leading to amyloid fibroid deposition in organs. The majority of patients present with either neuropathy, cardiomyopathy or both, and often go through a series of specialists and misdiagnoses before eventually receiving a diagnosis of TTR amyloidosis. ","AG10 is currently in Phase 3 development for ATTR cardiomyopathy in the U.S. and EU after Phase 2 results successfully show greater than 90% average TTR stabilization at day 28 of treatment. ","Alexion will be responsible for development in Japan, where we look forward to applying our expertise to bring AG10 to Japanese patients. ","The R&D organization has grown significantly to support our extended pipeline. It is exciting that the effects of this are already starting to be seen. I'm incredibly proud of the progress this quarter and we'd like to thank the global R&D organization for their dedication to advancing and further building our pipeline and portfolio strategy. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to provide a commercial update. Brian? ","Brian Goff ","Thank you, John. I'll start on Slide 24 with an update on ULTOMIRIS conversion, then move to our great progress in neurology and the continued growth of the metabolic franchise. Starting with ULTOMIRIS for PNH in the U.S., we continue to be very pleased with the launch in our efforts to facilitate patient conversion. ","As of the beginning of this week, 51% of patients are on treatment with ULTOMIRIS. This is unprecedented progress for rare disease facilitated conversion in just 10 months of launch. As with any launch curve, we do not expect to continue on a linear trajectory as we now have a majority of PNH patients converted. ","That said, we have some promising developments to help maintain our momentum. First, a permanent J-Code for reimbursement was implemented on October 1st, removing that as a barrier for prescribing. And second, we're starting to target a greater breadth of treaters. So we remain on a very solid path towards achieving our accelerated goal of best-in-class patient conversion of at least 70% by mid-2020 in the United States. ","Moving to our European launch progress, starting with Germany where we launched in July, we are already at over 45% conversion, which is more than three months ahead of the U.S. launch at the same time point. This is tremendous progress and a credit to the strength of the ULTOMIRIS product profile, the local team in Germany and benefited by the concentrated treater base. ","We've also launched in Austria, Denmark and Finland, providing access to ULTOMIRIS in other European countries as a priority. And we're working towards additional launches in the EU as we seek reimbursement agreements. In Japan, we received approval in June and while we were waiting for the National Health Insurance price listing in order to launch, we were actively engaged in efforts to improve physician awareness of ULTOMIRIS. We officially launched in September and while it's still early days, conversion is tracking ahead of the U.S. launch at the same time point. ","Turning to Slide 25, we're pleased to now have FDA approval for ULTOMIRIS to treat atypical aHUS in adult and pediatric patients. Here we'll leverage the strength of our PNH launch experience to drive rapid atypical aHUS facilitated conversion in stable patients. And our goal is to continue to deliver towards a best-in-class launch. I'll highlight a few subtle differences in the patient dynamics specific to atypical aHUS.","First, duration of therapy varies depending on etiology and is in general shorter than that in PNH given the silent nature of the disease between TMA events. We hope that with the profile of ULTOMIRIS and its every eight week dosing, there will be potential to improve persistence and compliance given the significantly increased risk of a TMA event if a patient stops treatment. That said, for some shorter duration populations, for example, atypical aHUS in pregnancy, there may be patients that choose to remain on SOLIRIS. ","Second, newly diagnosed patients often present in acute settings. So we'll be working to help start patients on ULTOMIRIS or facilitate rapid conversion of SOLIRIS initiated patients once they transition to the outpatient setting. ","Finally, we launched ULTOMIRIS with the objective of a global sustainable pricing strategy. Given that the labeled SOLIRIS dose for atypical aHUS is higher than that in PNH, this translates to maintenance dosing at a roughly 33% discount to SOLIRIS annually. This dynamic has already resonated very well with both patients and payers. Our team is highly prepared and we look forward to updating you on our progress here. ","Moving to Slide 26, I'd like to step back and provide a bigger picture view of how we see ULTOMIRIS conversion, providing the foundation for the durability of our C5 franchise, focusing on the four core SOLIRIS indications. ","Our ambition is to deliver best-in-class facilitated conversion for patients across the portfolio, and we're off to a strong start with the launches already underway. We believe that the vast majority of patients will be treated with ULTOMIRIS before even the earliest potential biosimilar launch. ","Furthermore, we plan to have a weekly subcutaneous formulation available to provide even more optionality for patients. So we believe the market will move to and remain on ULTOMIRIS, given its strong clinical profile, globally sustainable pricing strategy and compelling value proposition including 20 fewer infusions needed per year. ","Consistent with the U.S. timeline shown here, we expect to see similar dynamics play out in Germany and Japan, which can be seen in the appendix. ","Turning to Slide 27 with an update on our neurology franchise which continues to deliver significant growth. As you can see on the left, we ended the quarter with more than 1,500 gMG and NMOSD patients treated with SOLIRIS in the U.S. This was our strongest quarter to-date for gMG and the NMOSD launch is also off to a great start. We believe our footprint and learnings in gMG have helped to accelerate the early trajectory in NMOSD. ","Furthermore, the efficacy of SOLIRIS in NMOSD is profound and resonates with physicians, patients and payers given the unpredictability and the devastating and often irreversible impact of even a single additional relapse. ","In particular, data from the Phase 3 extension showing that all patients on SOLIRIS monotherapy remain relapse free through 144 weeks is highly compelling. ","Turning to Slide 28 and our metabolics franchise, we reported third quarter STRENSIQ revenue of $154 million or 36% year-over-year growth, driven by volume. With our CALIPER age-adjusting lab testing initiative, we're working to increase awareness and adoption of the appropriate diagnostic ranges for HPP helping to support earlier diagnosis, particularly of pediatric patients. ","We reported third quarter KANUMA revenue of $28 million or 12% year-over-year growth. Again, this was driven by volume. With both LAL-D and HPP we continue to identify and treat additional patients and look to expand our geographic reach. ","Once again, the hard work, expertise and dedication of the commercial team is inspiring, and has enabled us to deliver on multiple fronts and bring hope to patients with numerous rare diseases. ","I'll now turn the call back to Ludwig for closing comments. Ludwig? ","Ludwig Hantson","Thank you, Brian. We have made significant progress in the third quarter, as highlighted on Slide 29. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of all of our employees. Alexion 2.0 is off to a great start with a core business that is performing better than ever before, as well as an expanded and diversified pipeline. ","As you can see on Slide 30, we are focused on durability and long-term growth by driving facilitated conversion, expansion of our current medicines into new diseases and further diversification of our portfolio.","Our current portfolio spans across hematology, nephrology, neurology, metabolics and cardiology, and is poised to deliver at least 10 additional potential launches by 2023 which will significantly evolve the composition of our core business. ","There are many exciting milestones in the next 12 to 24 months. In particular, including multiple INDs, new programs entering the clinic, and new pivotal programs, as well as several data readouts from ongoing programs and we're not stopping here. ","We continue to look to add additional rare diseases to our portfolio through further disciplined business development and internal research efforts. We also maintain our unwavering focus on patients and our commitment to advancing our mission of delivering life changing therapies to people living with rare diseases. ","With that, we will now open up the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session"," Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Josh Schimmer of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Josh Schimmer","Maybe a quick one on myasthenia gravis launch in the U.S. Given the care paradigm, I might have expected that most of your diagnosed patients would have come on to SOLIRIS fairly quickly. And we might have even started to see a plateauing effect by now. It doesn't seem to be the case. Maybe you can help us understand the market dynamics here and the implications for the sustainable growth of the myasthenia gravis franchise? Thanks.","Brian Goff","Hi, Josh. This is Brian. So I'll take that as a compliment. So thanks a lot. Yes, the launch is going well. And we are -- as I noted, we're at the 2-year anniversary mark for our entry into neurology. We said at the time, when we started at the end of 2017 that we did not expect a bolus. We knew it would be heavy lift in terms of education around the role of complement in the underlying pathophysiology of gMG and we've made great progress. And along the way, we also expanded our commercial team to make sure that we could balance both depth of prescribing as well as breadth. And we did that as well to prepare, of course, for the NMOSD launch. And I think what you're seeing is just continued progress towards that educational effort. ","And again, I'll just say that this is a population where while we talk about being over 1,500 patients now in the U.S. for gMG, that we're still just at the, I guess the leading edge, you can say, of the population that could be our addressable market. And that's 6,000 to 8,000 on the severe end of gMG in the U.S. alone, with the broader population of 60,000 to 80,000. So that continued educational effort we believe will continue us on our expansion journey.","Aradhana Sarin","And just to clarify, at the end of September, we were over 1,500 patients across gMG and NMOSD.","Brian Goff","Yes.","Aradhana Sarin","And have continued to add more patients since then.","Brian Goff","That's right.","Aradhana Sarin","Next question?","Ludwig Hantson","I was going to say that Brian and the team are doing an excellent job. And we believe that this business is sustainable as we're focusing on the refractory population. We know there's a lot of competition on the clinical trial side, but we're focusing on the patient type that might be different than some other technologies are focusing on. So we're really, really pleased with the progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew Harrison","I was hoping to just take a little bit more into AML and see what sort of metrics you could provide thereon. Launch uptake, how we should think about that relative to what you saw from the MG launch. And any other feedback as you -- especially as you think about potential competitors coming on next year?","Ludwig Hantson","Good morning, Matthew. With NMOSD, I would characterize it as seeing strong start. And we're still relatively early in the launch. I've communicated before that, again, this will be a significant educational lift for clinicians. One starting point is to make sure that it's clear to clinicians that this is not MS. And the reason that that's important is because they think about, oftentimes relapses in MS as being recoverable. And we have a very strong focus on the fact that every relapse matters in NMOSD. And oftentimes, as I noted, these relapses are unpredictable. They're devastating and very often irreversible. So that's really the beginning point. And the second is the role of complement, which is very different. And there's a lot of off-label Rituxan use that\u2019s out in the NMOSD community. ","So this is the first approved treatment for NMOSD and we're pretty emphatic that there's a sense of urgency that clinicians need. In the early days what we're seeing right now is there are clinicians who have had some patients that they have already thought about as a candidate for SOLIRIS and so that's good. They're moving on to therapy. And now we're intensifying our educational efforts to make sure that they identify others who could make that transition from things like Rituxan or immunosuppressive therapy. ","John Orloff","And I'll just add this is John, with regard to competitive data. Well, the majority of our patients were on background ISTs, about 25% were on no background IST. That is essentially monotherapy and they showed a 100% relapse free all the way up to three years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of SVB Leerink.","Geoffrey Porges","Quickly -- and I'm not sure whether it's a question for Brian or perhaps Paul, but a lot of confusion about all the moving parts in terms of the transition. But could you give us some sense of whether you believe SOLIRIS can remain flat over the next two to three years, even as the ULTOMIRIS transition occurs? Because obviously SOLIRIS is still being driven by NMO and MG. So could you give us a sense of how we should be thinking about that? ","And then on a related note, your transition slides for U.S., EU, Japan, et cetera are very helpful. But could you talk a little bit about how often drug exclusivity will play out when a biosimilar is available? Do you have any examples where orphan drug exclusivity for a protected indication has been sufficient to avoid erosion by a biosimilar that\u2019s already on the market for an alternate indication? So is that's what we're going to be facing in the \u201823, \u201824 timeframe? ","Paul Clancy","Geoff, let me -- this is Paul, I'll try to take a little bit of a crack at the first part of that question and then Brian will kind of give a perspective on the orphan drug. I think you want to think about it with respect to on a geographic perspective. Our neurology business is disproportionately and we expected probably to stay that way, U.S. and Japan. ","And then, I think the way we think about the PNH and aHUS business around the world is converting to ULTOMIRIS. So, that's probably the guide posts that I'd give you, we're seeing SOLIRIS hanging in there now, because of the strength of gMG, which as we said before, by the end of this year, neurology will be the largest patient franchise in the United States.","So, we expect that to continue to grow. And then, over a longer period of time, obviously, we've got ULTOMIRIS that we're studying in both gMG and NMOSD, which we were a little bit biased here, but we think those are high-probability trials. So over a longer period of time, we kind of see the business completely moving to ULTOMIRIS.","Brian Goff ","Yes, And Geoff, I'll take the second -- I'll take the second part on, this is Brian on ODD. We're not aware of an exact analog of the situation that we that we faced where there is rare disease or in this case ultra-rare disease, ODD a biosimilar. And then a generation-one to generation-two switch that has the kind of delta between the product profile of SOLIRIS, which at that time, will be 15-plus year old technology versus ULTOMIRIS.","So, we haven't seen that. We do believe that ODD provides a level of protection, but I think the more important side of this whole story is that we will have conversion that will be in such a way where patients will have had many multiple infusion experiences with ULTOMIRIS.","So, it becomes a part of their life and the feedback that we get from everybody from clinicians, from patients as well as from payers is very encouraging. And so, I feel very good about the strength of the ULTOMIRIS product profile. Even if there were the availability of, at some point, a biosimilar, I don't see a switchback dynamic and we're starting to hear that reflected by KOLs as well.","Ludwig Hantson ","And from the regulatory perspective, with ODD protection they wouldn't be able to get that indication in their labeling and therefore, it wouldn't be able to promote of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Chris Raymond ","Thanks. And just maybe sort of a little strategic question with regard to all the deals you guys have done and sort of the pipeline backfill. So just noticing with Stealth and the Achillion deals that you guys kind of have the beginnings of a nice little ophthalmology portfolio and I know these aren't lead indications.","But you still kind of highlight them and talk about them. So clearly, it's been very successful moving in a neurology as an indication expansion, but should we maybe start thinking about ophthalmology is maybe another area that it's of interest here or is that just a byproduct of these two deals? Thanks.","John Orloff ","Yes, I think from a strategic perspective, clearly we're focusing on rare diseases -- ultra-rare and rare diseases. We're focusing on medicines that can be transformative and ophthalmology for sure, it's within that range. If we believe that we can make an impact on the journey of our patients, we will.","So, I wouldn't look at this as a byproduct, but have we agreed on which path we're going to take strategically within this disease area, I would say maybe more discussions to come in the next months.","Paul Clancy ","And I would just add with the Achillion deal, we're most excited about the opportunity for alternative indications that expands into new territory for us and that includes ophthalmology. With -- I think proof of science in terms of alternative pathway involvement in various ophthalmological diseases. And then, of course Stealth that has ongoing Phase 2 studies in geographic atrophy and AMD as well as hereditary optic neuropathy. I think gets us squarely in potentially in the ophthalmology space very soon.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Phil Nadeau ","Just a question on the subcutaneous version of ULTOMIRIS, could you remind us of the volume of the injection there, and how long it takes to administer? And then as we look forward to the launch, what percent of ULTOMIRIS do you think would transition to the subcu, The patients consider this a big benefit? And what will happen in future indications? We have to investigate the subcu in each future indication or do you expect conversion based just on the PNH, aHUS stated that you're generating now? Thanks.","Paul Clancy ","So, with regard to the subcu program, we are using two West Gen I devices, which deliver 3.5 mills, it's delivered over 9 minutes. And again, the device is user friendly, applied to the body, they don't see the needle and it has been actually tested and commercialized with other products. So, we're very bullish on the device and we're in the middle of our subcu program now, which is nearing completion of enrollment and we should have data sometime in the second quarter of next year.","Ludwig Hantson ","And the fact it\u2019s already commercially available will facilitate the regulatory process so, which is an important step. And I'm really excited about the subcu optionality. So, Brian.","Brian Goff ","Yes. Hi, Phil, it's a good question and it is one that we're excited about, we've talked about subcutaneous is providing options for patients it may be, though, as we continue to do more market research that it goes beyond that and there are, clearly, some patients that with the profile that we believe we can offer with ULTOMIRIS that may be the choice that they go for with subcutaneous, it could be a function of their lifestyle, how active they are? It could be a function of the distance from an infusion center, or just simply that it's minimally invasive, once weekly or so formulation versus an IV delivery. And so, that's one that we look forward to, as well as we continue on that conversion journey.","Ludwig Hantson ","Yes, I think the subcu could be another critical component to address the durability, but more to come next year when we should be able to share you -- with you the Phase 3 data for PNH and eventually also aHUS. Okay, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham ","I just have a few. Brian, on ULTOMIRIS your conversion rates are strong, so far, as you guys get closer to 70%, what would you say are the remaining barriers across the geographies? And then, I understand the dosing differences between conversion PNH and aHUS. But are there access or payer differences between the two? And then bigger picture for Ludwig or Paul, with all the recent transactions, the pieces are definitely in place for diversification.","I just wanted to ask you how you characterize R&D capacity at this point, are there room for continued product specific deals, platform sort of technologies or maybe are we at the later part of the innings in terms of the step up in BD? Thank you.","Brian Goff ","Yes, Geoff, it's Brian, I'll start then on the ULTOMIRIS question, and maybe I'll just take a moment to do a little mini victory lap, because I am really proud of the progress of the team has made. We're really pleased that we're well on track towards our goal of greater than -- 70% or greater by the middle part of 2020. And just as a reminder that is moving the goalpost earlier than we originally thought that's based on the progress.","And as you know there will be an ambition to go beyond the 70%, but it's interesting that not long ago the questions that I was asked all the time is, is our ambition to bold? Is it achievable? And here we are 10 months in the launch and we have the majority of patients already converted, which is, as I noted, that's unprecedented.","And by the way the simple math is that 51% of 70% means we're already three quarters of the way there in terms of our goal. So what we focus on from here on, to your question is a broader range of prescribers, these are oftentimes clinicians who have one or two PNH patients so that -- that requires more time and effort for the broader reach. The other thing that is a tailwind and it came earlier than is typical, is the availability now of a permanent J-Code. Usually that comes in a year, we achieved it at the beginning of this month, which is 10 months into launch and that's very important for clinician confidence of reimbursement.","And we believe that that will be particularly helpful as we move forward toward the next phase of the launch. So we feel really good about our progression that we'll be able to make. Again, not just in the U.S. but in Germany and Japan, which is actually tracking even faster than the U.S.","Paul Clancy ","Geoff, this is Paul. And I'll take a crack at your question as it relates to R&D capacity and the connection with business development. A few perspective on -- from a financial resource allocation perspective, I think we welcome the upward pressure on R&D and that's how our planning is thinking about it, particularly as we go into 2020, we've alluded to that over this call as well as the last call, so I think we want to kind of welcome that if there is good pipeline builds. From a people perspective, no doubt the R&D organization is feeling kind of the added work that is going on and we do plan to kind of address that with additional hires and additional kind of keep building capability.","So, while that's not trivial but it is absolutely solvable. And then, I think what Aradhana has built in terms of business development organization connected with the opportunity set in rare diseases, I think there is a pretty strong opportunity set externally to kind of press on with respect to the strategy of kind of continuing to build the pipeline and continuing to build the clinical pipeline as well. John, Aradhana anything to add?","John Orloff ","Yes. I would just say that we've certainly grown considerably this year to keep pace with the BD deals that have come in and the pipeline growth both internally and externally. And we're in a position really to tell a really good story to get of high-quality people in the organization and expand our expertise. So, that's ongoing now and it's going well.","Aradhana Sarin ","Yes, I think the other part of your question was, will we look at any different type of transactions? And I think it will stay true to, again adding to what is a good strategic fit for us whether that's staying within the rare disease focus, focusing on clinical stage assets. But again, expanding our capabilities we have been sort of therapeutic area agnostic.","We have been technology-agnostic and will continue to be that way. Again, looking for sort of the best assets in our view that can solve unmet clinical needs.","Brian Goff ","And Geoff, it's Brian, again I -- Susan reminded me that I missed one part of your question to about atypical HUS, and the payer feedback that's I expect that to be a very compelling discussion, they already have a lot of knowledge now of ULTOMIRIS, we've made great progress with PNH with over 80% of commercial covered lives. Now with a defined policy, the economic story for ULTOMIRIS is even stronger with a 33% discount versus SOLIRIS in the maintenance fees. And as I noted, we have the permanent J-Code which covers PNH and atypical HUS.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Matteis of Stifel. Your line is open.","Paul Matteis ","I think I have two for Brian. So now that you're halfway through conversion in the U.S., Brian, I was wondering, have you noticed anything demographically that is different or unique about the patients -- the PNH patients who haven't switched from SOLIRIS? And I'd be curious what the implications of this are, if any? And then secondarily, what's going on in Germany? Why do you think that's gone so well so far? And what's the read through there on to dynamics in other European countries? Thanks so much.","Brian Goff ","Hey, Paul. So on the first one in -- as we move into, I call it the next phase of our launch, some of the dynamics that we're seeing you -- anybody would expect there is, in some cases, lower awareness on the part of the patients around ULTOMIRIS or they're not as connected perhaps with other patients through advocacy or the like. There also is the process we're still working through is the frequency of patient visits to clinicians varies pretty widely across PNH.","And so some of it is just waiting for either a visit, or they need to have a few visits to have that appropriate discussion with the clinician. And then, the third thing I would notice again, we've moved largely through the -- I call it, the higher-volume type clinicians. And when I say high volume, it's with quotes, because this is ultra-rare and now we're moving into sort of one-off clinicians.","They have one or two patients as I had noted that's mainly the U.S. dynamic. In Germany, first of all, we've been able to really amortize the learnings of launch from the U.S., that's a real advantage of the sequential progress of U.S. then Germany. And as I noted, Japan is going well. Additionally, one key difference in Germany, is that the prescribing treaters are more concentrated than in the U.S.","So, that's not a discredit to what the team in Germany has done, but I think it's aided them with some of their speed to conversion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal of Citi. Your line is open.","Mohit Bansal ","I would like to start with congratulating Aradhana for her new role and also a big thanks to Paul for all the help. You will definitely be missed. Now on the question side, you saw quite a big jump in the number of patients in neuro side, could you clarify, to what extent it was MG versus NMO? And our math actually suggests that neuro could already be contributing 40% or so to SOLIRIS U.S., making it the biggest already. Can you please confirm that too? Thank you.","Brian Goff ","Yes, we -- so Mohit, this is Brian. And by the way, I'll congratulate Aradhana as well. We're really thrilled to be -- to have Aradhana in her new position. On neurology, we have not given the breakdown of gMG versus NMOSD. In fact, it's the same -- commercially, this is the same line and so we think about it as a dedicated franchise. What I have noted is we're really pleased with the progress that we see on both fronts. This was our best quarter to date that we've had on our two-year anniversary actually with gMG. So that part's going really well. And as I had noted, we continue to make excellent progress with educating clinicians. So now we've got good balance of both breadth and depth of prescribing in gMG. In NMOSD, we're just a few months in, but are also very pleased about how that's progressing, that's going to be a journey, very similar to gMG with not a bolus but linear progression. And we see that becoming a very meaningful part of the business going forward. And we have made the stated ambition that neurology by patient volume in the U.S. becomes our biggest franchise and we're well on track for that goal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Salveen Richter ","Just maybe one on the pipeline. When we look to this proposed, the Achillion transaction. Could you comment on your prior work with SOLIRIS in C3G and just contrast it with this approach and read through?","John Orloff ","Yes. There's only been anecdotal reports of the use of SOLIRIS in C3G and certainly, nephrology has been an area that we're evaluating now, multiple renal diseases that -- where complement plays a role and that includes terminal complement as well as upstream complement targets. And so, with the Achillion's program, clearly, they've got two Phase 2 studies that are ongoing, that will read out next year with promising proof of mechanism data in patients following 14 days of treatment where they showed consistent effects on various biomarkers of the complement pathway that leads us to be optimistic about the potential results as we look at the Phase 2 studies, which will be evaluating our renal biopsy scores as well as eGFR and proteinuria.","Ludwig Hantson ","We take two more questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laura Chico of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Laura Chico ","I was wondering if you could step back to the theme of kind of the diversification efforts. And if you could talk a little bit about the strategy around the ALS program that you're anticipating starting soon here, just in terms of patient selection and trial design? And I guess related to that we also noticed a patent filing on C5 inhibitors and AMD and I know there have been prior studies with SOLIRIS in dry AMD, but just curious on your thoughts about the potential for ULTOMIRIS in AMD? Thank you.","Brian Goff ","So, I'll take the first part of that anyway. With regard to ALS and we've had input from a number of key opinion leaders and we're seeking regulatory guidance on a program that would be registrational in nature that delivers on endpoints that would be satisfactory to the multiple major regions, including the U.S., Europe and Japan.","We do have a final study protocol, we will be engaging regulators shortly and I hope to begin that trial in the first half of next year, that includes both functional evaluation. So the ALSFRS, our rating scale as well as looking at survival given that their mortality is high and rapidly progressive. So we'll be looking at both of those. In addition to that, we'll be looking at other functional evaluations such as pulmonary capacity, forced vital capacity and slow vital capacity. Right now, until we have the final design approved by regulators, we can't really say much more than that.","Ludwig Hantson ","That we were at the top of the hours. So we take one, one last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Rahul Prasad of William Blair. Your line is open.","Rahul Prasad ","Assuming the Achillion deal closes, can you just kind of discuss danicopan and how it relates -- how will it relate to the ULTOMIRIS conversion? Would you plan on kind of initiating studies with ULTOMIRIS as an add-on therapy? And then just one question on BD, do you have a threshold of debt capacity that you'd be willing to take on with deals? Thanks.","Brian Goff ","So, with regard to the first part of that, as you know, they will be sharing their Phase 2 data fourth quarter with regard to add-on to SOLIRIS. And then, the plan is to proceed with the regulatory engagement, since the deal hasn't closed, we really can't comment specifically on the plans, but we are excited about the opportunities beyond PNH and in PNH, we think it's certainly as add-on, can play a role for the unmet need in a small subset of patients who continue to have extravascular hemolysis. However, this is a disease of intravascular hemolysis, which is served by C5 inhibition, LDH reduction being the biomarker that's most closely associated with reduction and the risk of thrombosis and only a small subset have that extravascular hemolysis that's clinically -- of clinical consequence.","But we are really excited about the opportunities outside of PNH, including C3G but as well as many in nephrology, ophthalmology, dermatology and other areas that allow us to expand our therapeutic footprint.","Aradhana Sarin ","And in terms of, in terms of business development, we do have obviously substantial financial capacity. You've seen the transactions that we've done both from a licensing and partnering standpoint as well as from an M&A standpoint, which Wilson, Achillion and Syntimmune transactions. We are right now, under one times leverage. So we do have substantial capacity. We really focus less on sort of what our threshold capacity is but really our ability to create value from the acquisitions that we do, and the greater the transaction size, obviously, we want to make sure that those transactions are value creating.","Ludwig Hantson","This is going to be it for today. As was already mentioned on the call, a big thank you to Paul. Paul was instrumental in transforming this company and he will continue to work with us in the next -- for the next nine months. Paul, thank you. A big welcome to Aradhana, great to have you as our new CFO.","As you saw, it was a great quarter and I really want to thank our employees for their hard work, the organization is on an exciting journey, we're transforming our business and thank you for your time and enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"1404":["Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Elena Ridloff, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Rebecca. Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the third quarter 2017. Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer; Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial Officer; and John Orloff, our Head of R&D. You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website.","Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail.","These forward-looking statements apply only as of today, and we undertake no duty to update any of the statements after the call. I'd also like to remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for our GAAP results.","Thank you. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Elena, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I want to start today's call by saying I'm very pleased with the FDA approval for Soliris as a treatment for patients with generalized myasthenia gravis. This is a tremendous accomplishment for Alexion. But more importantly, this is a significant milestone for patients and their families that have been waiting a long time for new treatments. I would like to thank the cross-functional teams at Alexion, who worked to make this approval a reality, the FDA, for their review of our application and the investigators' patients and families who participated in our trials. We will discuss the gMG approval in more detail later on the call.","Turning now to our Q3 performance, as shown on slide 5. During the quarter, we made significant progress, advancing our mission to bring hope to patients and families affected by rare diseases. And positioning the company to deliver on its long-term growth objectives. Continued execution generated strong commercial R&D and financial performance in the quarter, including year-over-year revenue growth of 8%, volume growth of 9% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 17%.","Recent highlights includes our commercial organization once again delivered on serving more patients, driven by continued volume growth of Soliris, despite rapid enrollment in the ALXN1210 studies and continued momentum of Strensiq. In addition, our MG team launched Soliris in Germany. Our R&D team achieved regulatory approval in the EU, for patients with refractory gMG and we received FDA approval earlier this week. We're very pleased with the label which John will discuss in more detail.","In addition, we completed enrolment in the ALXN1210 IV Phase 3, PNH Na\u00efve and Switch studies and progressed our plans to initiate a single PK-based Phase 3 study of ALXN1210 delivered subcu. We strengthened our patent portfolio with three new U.S. patents for Soliris, issued in the third quarter that extend patent protection into 2027. These new patents work in concert with other patents and regulatory exclusivities to protect Soliris in all indications. We announced the restructuring plan that aligns the global organization with our refocused strategy. By streamlining our operations, we are creating a leaner organization with greater financial flexibility. And we added Paul Friedman, a respected and highly accomplished executive with extensive R&D and biotech experience to our board of directors.","I'm pleased with our accomplishments in the third quarter and our performance year-to-date. Before I turn it over to Paul to discuss the financial results including our updated guidance for 2017, I want to reiterate the four objectives that will drive our next phase of growth as shown on slide 6.","First, we continue to see meaningful opportunities to grow our rare disease business. Second, we will focus research on our complement expertise and development on our core therapeutic areas. Third, we will build our pipeline through disciplined business development and additional complement indications. And fourth, we are optimizing our infrastructure to deliver margin expansion, EPS growth and increase cash flow.","Our third quarter results position us well for the remainder of 2017 and beyond. We are in a great position to build on our strengths by executing on our strategy to generate long-term growth with a clear goal of delivering increased value for our shareholders.","I will now turn it over to Paul to review the third quarter financial results. Paul?","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Ludwig. Starting with slide 8. Total reported revenues in the third quarter were $859 million and grew 8% year-over-year. As we had forecasted and previously communicated, growth this quarter was lower than the previous two quarters due to a few factors.","First, the second quarter benefited from approximately $35 million due to timing of orders, which directly impacted quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth for this quarter. Second, the impact from ALXN1210 and other clinical trial enrollments increased. We estimate that this impact in Q3 was approximately $30 million versus approximately $20 million for the first half of the year. This is a welcome headwind as we continue to advance this program.","And, third, pricing was a 1% headwind in Q3, a slight increase versus the first half of the year, although lower than we had anticipated. The third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44 grew a strong 17% year-over-year.","Moving to slide 9, our product sales were driven by growth in the U.S., Europe, and the Asia Pacific region, whereas growth in the Rest of World was impacted by the timing of orders. You can see we delivered a 9% increase in volume, partially offset by FX headwind of less than 1% inclusive of hedging and a pricing headwind of 1% compared to the same period last year.","Turning to slide 10. Soliris revenue was $756 million and year-over-year volume growth was 3%. ALXN1210 and other clinical trial enrollment was an approximately 4% headwind to year-over-year volume growth in the quarter with the largest geographic impact from enrollment in Europe and the Asia Pac region. Importantly, when you strip away a number of the moving pieces over the last few quarters, we continue to see underlying volume growth for Soliris maintaining its momentum. More specifically, when adjusting for ALXN1210 in ordering patterns, Q3 volume growth was around 13% which is consistent with what we've seen in the last five quarters.","As shown on slide 11, we reported Strensiq revenue of $87 million as we had continued momentum from existing patients continuing on therapy, as well as new patient additions. Growth was impacted by changes to our pricing strategy in the U.S. as we work with payers to better align the value for higher dose patients.","Looking at Kanuma, we achieved revenues of $16 million. Turning to operating margin on slide 10. During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 45%, benefiting from revenue growth and focus on operating expenses. Non-GAAP R&D was $175 million or 20% of total revenue. The decreased R&D spend compared to third quarter of 2016 was due to cost savings from the announced deprioritized programs and terminated partnerships, offset by increased investments in ALXN1210.","Additionally, R&D spend in Q3 of this year benefited by approximately $6 million due to the timing of batches of clinic drug compared to our expectations. This expense is now expected in Q4. Non-GAAP SG&A was $230 million, 27% of total revenue. The year-over-year increase includes spend associated with the build of the dedicated field teams in preparation for the gMG launches in the U.S., Germany and Japan. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 10% and benefited from the conclusion of a routine IRS audit for the years 2013 and 2014. This contributed approximately $0.07 to non-GAAP earnings per share in the quarter. For the full year, we now expect the tax rate to be between 12% and 13% including this benefit, and expect an increase to 13% to 15% in 2018.","Non-GAAP EPS in the quarter of $1.44 grew 17% year-over-year, driven largely by revenue growth and a favorable tax rate. We reported Q3 GAAP EPS of $0.35 and recognized $164 million in restructuring and related expenses as outlined on slide 13. The majority of these expenses were associated with our planned closure of the Rhode Island manufacturing facility and employee separation costs. Of the $164 million, $74 million will be cash outlays.","In the quarter, we generated over $580 million in free cash flow and ended September 30 with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 35% is in the United States. We repurchased approximately 475,000 shares in the quarter.","Let's now turn to slide 14 and walk through the full-year guidance and a few items to keep in mind as we move forward. Total revenues are now expected to be between $3.475 billion to $3.525 billion, up from our prior guidance range of $3.45 billion to $3.525 billion; we're effectively increasing the low end of the revenue range. At the midpoint, this represents 13% total revenue growth year-over-year. This includes an updated estimate of $30 million to $40 million of foreign currency headwinds and our expectations for the impact of ALXN1210 and other trials on Soliris, which I'll discuss in a moment. Excluding these, revenue growth would be approximately 17%.","For Soliris, our revenue guidance is $3.09 billion to $3.125 billion. Similarly, we've increased the low end of the range. This assumes continued underlying volume growth with PNH and aHUS globally. It also assumes the impact of Soliris revenue from ongoing ALXN1210 trials as well as other studies, which we believe will fall within $80 million to $90 million now.","To touch briefly on 2018, we do expect incremental headwinds to Soliris revenue from the ALXN1210 studies, given the ramp of enrollment through 2017 and that these patients will remain in extension studies until a regulatory decision which we're targeting for PNH in the first half of 2019.","In addition, we expect some limited incremental headwinds due to our plan to initiate a Phase 3 subcu study in 2018. With regards to the MG launch, given the timing in the year, we expect limited contribution from MG in Q4 2017.","Turning to Metabolics. Our revenue guidance is $385 million to $400 million which is also an increase at the low end of the range. GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 16% and 19% with the reduction due to restructuring and related expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin guidance is unchanged. We anticipate a sequential increase in operating expenses in the fourth quarter due to seasonal medical congresses, as well as the timing of clinical drug batches I previously mentioned. This will be partially offset by savings from the restructuring.","The guidance now assumes a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 12% to 13% versus our prior expectations of 13% to 14%. GAAP earnings per share of $2.00 to $2.35 includes the restructuring and related expenses. Our revised non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $5.50 to $5.65, an increase over our prior guidance range of $5.40 to $5.55. This EPS guidance represents approximately 21% growth at the mid-point of the range.","Turning to slide 15, we're executing on the restructuring plan we provided last month in working towards the 2019 financial ambitions as shown on slide 16. These include double-digit revenue growth, operating margin growing to 50% in 2019 and leverage from the top line to the bottom line, leading to greater non-GAAP EPS growth. We anticipate delivering on these objectives while simultaneously investing in our pipeline, including through disciplined business development.","On this note, I'm pleased to announce that Dr. Aradhana Sarin will be joining us as Senior Vice President of Business Development and Corporate Strategy. Aradhana brings to Alexion over 20 years of professional experience at global financial institutions, has a strong orientation for science, an excellent understanding of the sector and deep transactional experience.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. I'm pleased to report in our commercial performance in the third quarter starting with Soliris on slide 18. Our global commercial operations continue to serve more patients with PNH and aHUS with Soliris despite the rapid enrolment in the ALXN1210 trials.","In PNH, our longstanding focus on disease education enables us to continue to identify new patients and we still believe that the majority of patients with PNH have yet to initiate treatment. In aHUS, we're seeing a growing number of new patients starting on Soliris and patient retention remains a focus.","Our disease education programs target specialties with high potential for patients with complement amplifying conditions and we continue to further our understanding of optimal treatment for patients with aHUS.","We also continue to believe that the opportunity with aHUS is even greater than that of PNH. We're very pleased with the Soliris performance in Q3 and year-to-date even as we simultaneously enroll patients into the ALXN1210 trials and expect continued growth ahead of us in both PNH and aHUS.","Now, moving to generalized myasthenia gravis on slide 19. We're extremely gratified to be launching Soliris for patients with this chronic and debilitating neuromuscular disorder. Our initial focus for the gMG launch will be in the U.S., Germany and Japan.","Starting with the U.S., earlier this week, the FDA approved Soliris for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who are anti-acetylcholine antibody positive. This is the first FDA approved treatment for these patients in more than 60 years.","In addition, Soliris is the first and only complement inhibitor available to treat gMG. Our focus will be on the studied patient population in the Phase 3 REGAIN trial, patients with AchR antibody-positive gMG who had inadequate response to appropriate immunosuppressive therapy and continue to suffer from significant unresolved disease symptoms, which represent approximately 5% to 10% of the total MG patient population.","As a reminder, we estimate the total MG population to be 60,000 to 80,000 patients in the U.S. These patients are in urgent need of treatment, as shown on slide 20, despite cycling through existing therapies, often over many years. They continue to suffer from profound muscle weakness and severe disease symptoms that limit function, including difficulties walking, talking, swallowing, and breathing.","They're also at increased risk of disease exacerbations and crises that may require hospitalization and intensive care and may be life-threatening. Based on what we observed in the Phase 3 REGAIN study, we also estimate that approximately 60% of AchR antibody-positive gMG patients will respond to treatment with Soliris and that most patients who respond will do so by 12 weeks of treatment.","To serve the gMG community in the U.S., our specialized and dedicated field team is fully staffed, trained, and now deployed in the field. Having just returned from the launch meeting, I can say that our team is excited about the opportunity to educate neurologists, including neuromuscular specialists, on the critical role of complement-mediated destruction of the neuromuscular junction and, now, the benefits of complement inhibition with Soliris.","Our expectations are that there are initial patients who have been waiting for another treatment option. However, patients need to be vaccinated and go through benefit verification, as well as infusion scheduling prior to initiating treatment, which can take several weeks. Given the timing in the year, we would expect patients in the U.S. with gMG to largely start on Soliris later this year or early 2018.","Moving now to Germany, the initial launch is underway following the approval by the European Commission in August for AchR antibody-positive patients with refractory gMG. And in Japan, our supplemental new drug application for Soliris in refractory gMG was accepted for review by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, and we expect a decision in early 2018.","Turning now to our metabolic therapy starting with Strensiq on slide 21. In Q3, we continued to identify new patients with HPP in the U.S., Germany, and Japan and also continued to focus on geographic expansion. Following the national funding agreement with NICE and NHS England, patients in England with pediatric onset HPP in most need of treatment will have access to Strensiq starting in November.","We also reached an agreement in France in the third quarter that will cover patients of all ages similarly to England. We expect that the France funding agreement will go into effect by the first quarter of 2018, and we're also working diligently to ensure that patients with HPP in other countries also have access to the transformative benefits of Strensiq.","Looking at Kanuma on slide 22, we continue to expand lab testing to target an enriched patient population that are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D such as those with NASH\/NAFLD and familial hypercholesterolemia who have elevated ALT and LDL levels. We're also establishing additional lab partnerships to drive an increase in testing. In addition, outside of the U.S., we're pleased to report that we reached an agreement for the treatment of patients with infantile-onset LAL-D in Italy in Q3, which will go into effect later this year.","I'm very pleased with the commercial team's performance in the third quarter and believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver on growth in the remainder of 2017 and beyond. And I'll now turn the call over to John for an overview of the R&D highlights from the quarter. John?","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. I'm proud that Alexion's deep understanding of complement biology led to the recent FDA and EC approval of Soliris for the treatment of patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positive, gMG. As Brian mentioned, our focus will be on the patient population evaluated in the REGAIN study, which were acetylcholine receptor antibody positive patients who had inadequate response to appropriate immunosuppressive therapy and continue to suffer from significant unresolved disease symptoms.","Turning to slide 24. I want to first make a few moments, comments on, the highlights from the FDA-approved label. The clinical trial experience section of the prescribing information includes robust data from the REGAIN study, including the change from baseline to week 26 in MG-ADL and QMG total scores, which showed a statistically significant difference favoring Soliris compared to placebo.","Also of note, the proportion of clinical responders with no rescue therapy was significantly higher for Soliris compared to placebo for both QMG and MG-ADL. For both endpoints and also at higher response thresholds, the proportion of clinical responders was consistently greater for Soliris compared to placebo. We are pleased that the FDA recognized the comprehensive clinical data supporting the benefits of Soliris for patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody positive gMG.","Also, in neurology on slide 25, we have now completed enrollment in the PREVENT Study, a single multinational placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial of eculizumab in patients with relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD, and expect to report data in mid-2018. As a reminder, this study is based on results from a small investigator-initiated Phase 2 trial in 14 patients that showed a reduced frequency of attacks in patients with severe relapsing NMO.","Beyond Soliris and to drive continued innovation, we are rapidly progressing the development of ALXN1210, our innovative, next generation C5 antibody that has the potential to address important patient needs.","Turning now to slide 26, we now have over 500 patients enrolled in the ALXN1210 development program and about 130 patient years of exposure. Before discussing our ALXN1210 registration trials, I wanted to mention that additional Phase 1\/2 data will be presented at this year's ASH congress. As a reminder, the Phase 3 dosing and study designs were determined based on empiric data from the Phase 1\/2 studies, our 20 years of experience in complement development, robust PKPD modeling data and discussions with regulators.","Turning to the Phase 3 trials, we have completed enrollment in both the PNH Na\u00efve study and the PNH \u2013 Switch study which both administered ALXN1210 intravenously every 8 weeks. We expect data from these studies in the second quarter of 2018 and as Ludwig mentioned, we are targeting an approval in PNH in the first half of 2019. On slide 27, we also continue to enroll patients in the Phase 3 atypical aHUS study in complement inhibitor treatment-na\u00efve adolescent and adult patients and expect to complete enrollment in early 2018. In addition, we initiated enrollment in a Phase 3 study in complement inhibitor treatment-na\u00efve children with atypical aHUS.","Turning to slide 28. To provide even more optionality for patients, we are also developing a higher concentration formulation of ALXN1210 delivered subcutaneously. Based on encouraging Phase 1 PK and tolerability data and discussions with the FDA and EMA, we are planning to proceed with a registration trial, which we're in the process of designing. We expect to initiate a single PK-based Phase 3 bridging study to support registration in both PNH and atypical aHUS, evaluating a weekly subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210, utilizing a commercially available device.","As a reminder, our Phase 1 study was a single-dose study in healthy volunteers. We are completing additional device and drug combination work to initiate a Phase 3 study in late 2018. Our ambition is to establish ALXN1210 as the new standard of care for patients with PNH and aHUS.","Touching briefly on our R&D strategy, we have a clear strategy that will, first of all, expand beyond ultra-rare disorders and evaluate opportunities in the rare disease space, focus on our core expertise to grow our leadership and complement, drive greater R&D efficiencies and returns, and execute on disciplined business development to build a portfolio that is diversified by stage and risk. With strategic parameters in place, I'm confident that we'll be able to build a leading rare disease pipeline, and I look forward to providing an update on our R&D progress on future calls.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Ludwig. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, John. Let me conclude today's call by saying that I'm confident we're on the right path to deliver innovation and sustainable growth for Alexion to be the global leader in rare diseases. We have accomplished a great deal, and I look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls. As always, I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and performance.","We will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Our first question comes from Eric Schmidt at Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Co. LLC","Thanks for the question. Congrats on the approval in myasthenia gravis. Maybe a question for Brian on the gMG launch in Europe. Is it just Germany where the drug is available? Can you characterize the reception? Do you already have some patients on drug or is there a growing queue of patients who are seeking therapy? Thank you.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. Hi, Eric. And thanks for the congrats. As you can imagine, we're very excited to have the approval. And as I mentioned in the prepared comments, this is really important for patients who really have not had \u2013 in the case of the U.S., they've not had a new FDA-approved treatment option in over 60 years. So it's quite a statement for those patients.","As you mention, our launches are focused in Germany, in Europe, and then, of course, now we have the U.S. and we'll be awaiting Japan approval ideally the end of this year for launch late this year into early next year. And in Germany, so far, we've deployed our field team. They're trained. They're talking to neuromuscular specialists. They're highly engaged.","It's pretty early in terms of the German launch so far, so probably too early to give a sense as to what that uptake will look like. And then, one comment I should make about Germany in particular is that unlike in the U.S., we didn't have any clinical trial experience. So, we're limited in terms of the number of thought leaders who have first-hand experience with the product. And that'll likely lead to a slower uptake than we might expect in the U.S., for example.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Co. LLC","Thank you.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on all the execution throughout the year as well. I know Paul had in his script, which was helpful, around the volume trends, when you back out all the stuff, I think it was around 13%. But maybe you can talk a little bit more on a geographic basis, in particular Latin America? What you're seeing there and kind of how the trends are holding up. Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Alethia, thanks for the question. And I think what you noted is probably the soft spot in terms of our affiliate performance, with respect to kind of affiliates around the world. When we kind of dialed down, the dynamics in Latin America around ordering and the macro trends that I think are probably common across the whole sector, is actually \u2013 we think it's impacting us as well.","So, I think some of those countries there, which had been growth countries, probably \u2013 will probably won't be growth countries in the future. But what \u2013 even in light of that, what we're seeing is, on a global basis, kind of maintaining overall global volume trends that we've seen over the last five, six, seven quarters.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. I'm a bit impressed with the ALXN1210 progress on the IV and subcu front. But you guys have been talking about biz dev for quite some time. And obviously, it would be huge to diversify the portfolio. So the question is, is there a tipping point in your decision? In other words, does MG approval for the upcoming ALXN1210 data in 2Q influence the timing? Or is it a matter of trying to manage seller expectations? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Let me try to take, this is Paul, Geoff. Thanks for the question. I think I understand it. It's a little bit \u2013 I'm trying to weave in. I don't think we think that our business development efforts per se are tied to progression on ALXN1210. No doubt we've been talking about it kind of for the last 90 days. And that comes a lot out, in terms of an outgrowth of prioritizing the pipeline and a number of terminated programs that we'd certainly feel great about ALXN1210 as a pipeline within itself in kind of that alone. But beyond that, we certainly need, we believe we need to rebuild the pipeline.","I would characterize it, despite we've talked about it, is that while we have a good sense of what we want to do with respect to strategy, I mean moving from ultra-rare to rare, staying in the disease areas of focus, leveraging our development capabilities in rare disease and our launch in commercial capabilities and pointing towards kind of Phase 1, Phase 2 assets, I'd still characterize it as we're building internally a set of capabilities to be able to do this over a long period of time.","We just hired a new head of the group. We'll build out the team even more and I think we still have to get into the flow before we actually begin executing transactions.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs, Terence Flynn.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Was just wondering if maybe you could give us any more details on the ALXN1210 subcu Phase 3 trial, just wondering kind of remind us of the non-inferior requirements for bioequivalence. Is it going to enroll a mix of na\u00efve and experienced patients Will the subcu dose be weight-based or fixed? Thanks a lot.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks for the question. This is John. So, we recently got clear feedback from both FDA and EMA on the trial design, which is a PK-based single study for registration, roughly 100 to 150 patients required for that, which will be a comparison and bridging back to the IV dosing regimen. The details of the study design, we will disclose at a later point as we initiate the trial in later in 2018.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","But, it will not be a bioequivalence...","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","That is correct.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","...approach because the PK profiles of IV and subcu are different.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","And that will come from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much, and again, congratulations on the approval. Just wanted to follow up a few questions around MG. Given the numbers that you are suggesting, it sounds as though it could potentially be as large an indication as PNH and just make sure that we're thinking about it the right way. But more importantly, are you \u2013 should we expect that you have to give any price concessions as you introduce this new indication to payers in the U.S. or indeed in markets outside the U.S.?","And then, lastly, when might you start a study of ALXN1210 in MG? Presumably, that's going to be front and center now and might you look at some other patient populations in MG other than those that you have studied in the pivotal trial?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Geoffrey. It's Brian. And maybe I'll start with that one in a few different parts, and again, I'll say thanks for your enthusiasm as well for gMG. We think it's obviously a very important approval and, again, very important for patients as well. As everyone knows, it's always difficult in the early going to anchor on the shape or the kinetics of a launch trajectory curve. There is a number of different factors that we'll be putting into that assessment.","First is the patient population and our focus will be on the REGAIN study which, as I mention and you know, were AchR antibody-positive gMG patients who had an inadequate response to appropriate immunosuppressive therapy.","So, when you carry that forward, we estimate that's 5% to 10% of the total MG population. And then to anchor that, as I mention in my prepared comments, on the U.S. population, call that 60,000 to 80,000 patients, you carry forward the math, and we're talking about an opportunity of 3,000 to 8,000 patients in the U.S.","So, that'll be our focus. We do think it's a significant opportunity. Some of the factors to consider when you talk about the puts and the takes of what that launch curve will look like is, on the one hand, we do believe there is an initial cohort of patients who have been waiting for treatment. And on the other hand, in terms of the timing of the uptake, there are logistical steps that the patients will need to go through, including the vaccination, of course, the insurance benefit verification, as well as the calendaring of infusion scheduling itself.","And so, as I mention, we expected that that will take some time. The ambition, of course, is to get to as many of those customers to educate them around the benefits of Soliris as quickly as possible, and then to help facilitate those conversions of the patients.","And in terms of your question about price, obviously, what we're focused on is moving into markets where the value of Soliris across the indications the portfolio has recognized. So, the initial cohort of countries as I've mentioned is U.S., Germany and Japan. And then, going forward, we'll continue to assess what the uptake looks like as well as the economics that different countries are willing to support for the value of Soliris.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, we have a very strong Soliris pricing strategy and we're not going to undermine the pricing strategy and that's the reason for Europe that we're focusing on Germany at this point. The rest of the countries will discuss on a \u2013 one-over-one basis. And then, ALXN1210, MG...","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. With regard to the life cycle management for ALXN1210, right now, of course, we're focused on execution in the PNH and aHUS trials. We have disclosed that we will be considering up to two different proof-of-concept trials this coming year. And of course, with the success of the MG program with Soliris and the significant clinical impact across a number of clinical assessment scales, we're also evaluating the opportunity for ALXN1210 in myasthenia gravis and we'll be in a position to share more of our LCM plans in 2018.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","But certainly, a subcu version for an MG patient would be \u2013 will be a great treatment option.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. If I could just push on two topics that people have asked about already. So, I think, first on subcu ALXN1210, can you just sort of walk through what needs to be done before you can initiate that study? Is it just study planning or is there more work related to both the device and formulation that has to be done?","And then, I think, the second question is just following up on Geoff's question around BD, what's the sense of urgency there? I think many investors would like to see you work to diversify the revenue stream in the near term, and I'm just trying to understand those expectations relative to your current plans. Thanks very much.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, with respect to the subcu program, we do have the higher concentration formulation that we've already studied in the Phase 1 healthy volunteer bioavailability study. What needs to be done now before we initiate the trial is that additional device and therapeutic work performance, compatibilities testing, as well as stability testing, and then we need to do some human factor testing to ensure that patients and physicians can use the device. As we said, we're using a commercially available device, which provides some de-risking of the program as we go forward into the once-weekly subcu later in 2018.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Matt, this is Paul. With respect to the second part, the second question, we absolutely have a sense of urgency here. I mean, it's a new team here, a new business development team being formed. We will undoubtedly balance that with focusing on quality, not quantity of assets.","I fundamentally believe that in where we're looking strategically, there's likely to be more competition than there was 5 or 10 years ago, but the opportunity set is, probably offsets that. So, there's a \u2013 I think that in \u2013 but I think absolutely sense of urgency balanced by making sure we get quality assets.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","But discipline as well. Sense of urgency and being disciplined.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","That'll come from Chris Raymond with Piper Jaffray.","Christopher Raymond - Piper Jaffray","Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a two-part question on MG. So, I was struck by the label, and I don't think a lot of investors were \u2013 the fact that you got a stat sig benefit in the primary endpoint. Just maybe \u2013 as you guys were thinking about the scenarios of having it or not having it, maybe talk about how you view the impact here commercially with payers? I mean obviously, having the stat sig benefit is great.","But was there a potential downside that you can quantify, that would've existed without \u2013 with the label, but maybe without the stat sig benefit? And \u2013 what does that mean now going forward?","And then also maybe, a follow-on question on that. The prior management team used to talk about a warehousing effect, if you will, in MG. That you may not have seen with aHUS or with PNH. I wonder if maybe you could sort of put some brackets around \u2013 with your fresh set of eyes on that dynamic. Is there potential for that effect or maybe not? Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Chris. It's Brian. So, I'll start on that and then I think John will probably want to make a few comments as well. Without necessarily going into specifics on upsides, downsides, I mean, if I just react to the label that we have, obviously we're very pleased with the FDA approval. We think it's a label that positions us well, moving forward with the launch.","And as I mentioned in the prior question as well as in the prepared comments, the real anchor point for us, since you asked about payer reactions, our anchor point will be on the REGAIN patient population. That's our core focus, that reflects what we found in terms of the benefits from REGAIN, as well as in the label. Those patients who are AchR antibody-positive gMG, that's the 5% to 10% of the total MG population. And we think at least in the early going that that will be the right positioning, particularly with payers. And then, of course, what we'll have to do is look at what the uptake looks like and make adjustments appropriately from there on.","With respect to patients who are already in the system and identified, you called it the warehousing effect, that is a different dynamic of course than we've had with PNH as well as atypical aHUS with Soliris, and so on. Again, on the one hand, there are patients, who are well diagnosed, known in the system, we as a new entrant into neurology and the gMG space, we're working really hard to identify the right targeting of clinicians and make sure we get to them as quickly as possible. So, that's on the tailwind side.","On the headwind side, as I had mentioned we have some logistics that we'll need to work through at the patient level, which comes down to the vaccination REMS process as well as the benefit verification in the calendaring of the infusions itself. So, with those puts and takes, that will really determine how we do in terms of the early uptake.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And maybe in addition to that, it's a very broad prescriber base as compared to what we see with PNH and aHUS, but that's going to be a little bit different.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","(44:45)","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. If I can add to that. To clarify some of the reported results in the primary manuscript, which came out earlier this week in Lancet Neurology versus what is reported in the label. I think it's important to recognize the totality of the clinical data is robust and clinically meaningful. We had 18 out of 22 primary and secondary end points that were statistically significant. And the robustness of the data, I think is underscored by the fact we have two major regulatory bodies that have approved Soliris now for gMG with various differences maybe in the language of the indication. And the primary endpoint in both \u2013 in the study was MG-ADL and that was analyzed statistically using a number of different statistical methodologies.","The primary analysis was a worst-rank analysis and that was reported in the REGAIN manuscript and there were also additional pre-specified sensitivity analysis around the worst-rank test and that what's reported in the label. That accounts for some of the limitations in the primary approach that assigned patients who had discontinued therapy to a worst-rank even though they had a clinically meaningful clinical response. And so the sensitivity analysis is statistically significant and that's what's reported in the label along with a more traditional least squared (46:12) means of repeated measures which is the other p-value provided in the table and the label.","Christopher Raymond - Piper Jaffray","Great. Thank you.","Operator","From Citi, we'll go to Robyn Karnauskas.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Robyn, are you there?","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Can you hear me? Sorry. My phone keeps dropping everyone (46:35). So, the real question I have is about follow-up questions around MG. So, a lot of people try to do work around the MG market and it's hard to find doctors out there who prescribe and who have a lot of patients. So can you tell us more about your market research and how comfortable that you are that you've actually identified all the doctors and how you identified the doctors in this situation given its broader doctor data base that you have to go after and how comfortable are in your steps (47:00) on the MG market?","And the second question's on the international IP. You have U.S. IP issued. If the EU patents are issued or Rest of World patents are issued, how far would that take you out and when do you think those would be issued? Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Robyn, it's Brian again. And so, I'll start on the first part of your question about finding the clinician targets and who to call on and how good we feel about that. I would say, as I mention, obviously neurology is new for us. But having just come back from our launch meeting in the U.S., what I felt really great about is that we have, you could call it, hand-selected the best of from across the industry in rare diseases. We have a lot of neurology experience for the team that we've now deployed in the U.S. And so, on that front, we have a group that really understands the space very well.","However, we are working through the learning process, I would call it, in a new therapeutic area where we feel good about our understanding of the high potential physicians. Here, I'm talking about neurologists, neuromuscular specialists, as well as the, you could call it, a few hundred centers where MG patients predominantly are treated. But we're in that learning mode. And as we deploy and we get more experience, we'll continue to sharpen our pencils and our targeting accordingly.","And the other dynamic, as Ludwig alluded to, is that this is admittedly a wider prescribing base in MG than we certainly have experienced with the other side of Soliris in PNH and aHUS.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","With respect to the IP, we're very happy with the new Soliris patents in the U.S. until 2027. We're following a similar approach ex-U.S., Europe, as well as Japan. And this might take \u2013 it's difficult to say what the timelines are, but it might take another 6 to 12 months before we find out.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have one on AXLN1210. For the Phase 3 PK study, is it fair to assume you're seeking registration or approval with the subcu formulation based on biomarkers such as LDH reduction? And then, secondly, when are we going to see maybe a more Phase 2 data from AXLN1210 before the Phase 3 result? Thanks.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, I'll take the first \u2013 the second question first. We are \u2013 as we mention, we'll be sharing some Phase 1\/2 data at ASH in December. We've previously shared the SBC-103 data at a couple of congresses. And for the first time, we'll be sharing the SBC-201 data.","Based on the aggregate results from both SBC-103 and SBC-201, we've modeled that data out to arrive at a Phase 3 program dosing for ALXN1210 that's based on achieving maximal benefit in patients, maximum number of patients with a minimum dose.","The first question you had had to do with the subcu program and how that is designed. Essentially, we'll be looking at C trough concentrations. At the end of dosing intervals, we'll be looking at LDH normalization and all the biomarkers as a basis for that registration study.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for the clarity.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we'll hear from Anupam Rama.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I was wondering if I could ask a quick one on Strensiq, actually, and how we should be thinking about the net price long term here in the U.S.? And maybe you could provide a little bit of color on how your strategy with payers here for some of these higher dose patients?","Thanks so much.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Anupam. Good morning. It's Brian. And so, I'll start with that and maybe turn it over to Paul for added color. With Strensiq, the highest level our focus, of course, remains to continue to identify and serve patients with HPP. And as you heard in the prepared comments that the growth has been affected by pricing adjustments in the U.S. I think the way to characterize that is that we continue to work with payers to make sure that the value of Strensiq is aligned particularly for the higher dose patients. We've worked through much of that in the U.S. at this point, and now pivoting from the U.S., we continue to work on geographic access expansion. And as I had mentioned, the NICE funding agreement is a good example of that, which will go into effect in, next month, in November of this year.","And maybe, Paul, I don't know if you want to add anything else?","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","No. I think, I mean, the starting point that we talked before, it just is trying to adjust for a slightly different mix between pediatrics and adults that was originally thought through. So, I think of it as not really changing our outlook at all for essentially what it could achieve in terms of peak sales. So, I think it's actually just a smart strategy working with payers in the United States.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks so much for taking our question.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, Andrew Peters.","Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the all execution. So, I guess kind of a bigger picture question, coming back to the financial ambitions that you've outlined. I guess, on the top line, when you think about the contribution, was hoping to see if you can kind of run through some of the puts and pulls of that guidance a bit more. Specifically, how you think about growth in underlying patient demand across the now three marketed indications that you have? And how you think about the relative contributions of each? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. This is Paul. I think your question is focused on Soliris, but I'll actually broaden it out as well. What we're, no doubt seeing is growth across PNH and aHUS, but aHUS outpacing the growth of PNH. That is relatively consistent. We actually have a few markets, where our best estimate of revenue is that aHUS is now crisscrossed over PNH. And hope that that continues on, without sacrificing, obviously, continued PNH penetration, where in both indications, they're quite, quite a lot of headroom.","No doubt, what we hope is MG ends up kind of being a big, kind of, accelerator as well. The timing of that is still unclear, as it kind of really kick-in in 12 months out or 6 months out or whatever the timing is. And then I think the Metabolics franchise for us, driven by Strensiq, I think can continue to be meaningful contributions to, if you will, almost a cause of change contribution to growth on a year-after-year basis.","Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","From SunTrust, Yatin Suneja.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is David (54:51) on for Yatin. Just a quick question on NMO, congrats on completing the enrolment. Could you elaborate on your expectations on the event-driven primary endpoint? How much improvement do you need to see for success? And also remind us of the market opportunity in this indication?","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, we showed in our Phase 2 study a significant reduction in relapse rate. The design of the Phase 3 study is time to event in relapses, and this study is, actually randomizes a 2:1 eculizumab versus placebo. So, we'll be looking at the difference between those two arms. It is an event-driven trial with a completed enrollment. We anticipate being able to share the results in the middle of 2018.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And then, this is Brian. Maybe I'll just jump in on the market. So, anchoring on the U.S., it's generally cited that NMOSD is about 1% to 2% of the MS population. That's the generally cited number. So, you could think of it as a few thousand patients in the U.S. which, again, we think could be a nice opportunity for Soliris as well if the data plays out.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you.","Operator","From BMO, we'll hear from Ian Somaiya.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks for taking my question. Would love to hear a little bit more about subcu ALXN1210, just the profile from a patient's perspective and does the higher concentration formulation allow you to develop it in IV maybe to address some of the concerns related to duration of infusion, maybe even provide a different scheduling.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, I'll start with that. Yes, we are pursuing the higher concentration formulations as well with IV because it has the opportunity for us to reduce the infusion time substantially. So, that's something we will be pursuing as well this year.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think there's anything else I should add to that. I think it's a great opportunity for us to address IV, as well as the subcu with a higher concentration.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Should we assume the regulatory path will be similar to what you've sort of advocated for subcu, just a bridging study?","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","It'll be much quicker, actually, because we just have to do a fairly small IV study with the formulation to bridge to the existing DLA with the subcu program. We will have to also show safety in addition to the primary PK analysis that I alluded to earlier. So, that's a little bit more extensive program. But again, fairly limited, as I said, to 100, 150 patients we're estimating for the subcu program.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Kennen Mackay with RBC Capital Markets.","Kennen Mackay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, thanks for fitting me in here. I just wanted to say congrats on the strong guidance and the clarity on Soliris and really the turnaround that you've accomplished in such a short amount of time here. I'm really looking forward to seeing what we could have coming on the M&A front down the line. Maybe just a quick question, I guess for John. I just wanted to get a better sense of really what your perspective is on the additional unmet need in Generalized MG versus Refractory MG.","So, I'm thinking you must have applied for a broader label, but can you help us just understand really how the unmet need is being thought of outside of Refractory MG. I know that's where you're focusing but really, what is it that drove the FDA's decision to grant a broader label in Generalized MG versus Refractory, which was the REGAIN population?","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, for the population overall, patients with generalized myasthenia gravis who have positive antibodies to acetylcholine receptors, we know that complement activation is a part of their disease and that current immunosuppressive therapies do not address the underlying complement activation, and some of that destruction that's related to that at the neuromuscular junction, that study population that we enrolled in REGAIN, however, were patients who had inadequate responses to two immunosuppressive therapies or one immunosuppressive therapy and chronic use of IVIg or plasma exchange. So, I really can't complement. I can't comment on the use of the product outside of that. The FDA, obviously, granted us a label for generalized myasthenia gravis and we'll leave it at the discretion of prescribers and healthcare providers to determine whether patients beyond those that we enrolled in the study are appropriate for eculizumab therapy.","Kennen Mackay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you. And is there any opportunity in crisis given the fast mechanism of action of treating complement here? Or, is that something where we just don't have the data to say?","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","We don't have the data on typically in crisis, they're treated with IVIg or plasma exchange. And you could, I guess speculate, there's a role for complement, but again, we don't have the data in that setting.","Kennen Mackay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks again for taking my questions.","Operator","And that was our last question and this concludes today's conference call.

Third Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Irving Adler, Executive Director, Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Irving Adler","Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the third quarter of 2014 and our outlook for the rest of the year. Today's call will be led by Dr. Leonard Bell, our Chairman and CEO.","Lenny will be joined by members of Alexion management: David Hallal, our Chief Operating Officer; Vikas Sinha, our Chief Commercial Officer; Martin MacKay, Global Head of R&D; Steve Squinto, our Chief Global Operations Officer; and Saqib Islam, our Chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements apply only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after this call.","I'd also like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP operating results are adjusted from our U.S. GAAP operating results for certain items that we described in our press release issued this morning. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release.","Thank you. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thank you, Irving. In the third quarter, the global Alexion team continued to execute on our key commercial, clinical and organizational objectives. During the quarter, our commercial organization again provided Soliris to an increasing number of new patients across our PNH and aHUS operations worldwide. Our development team has made strong progress in the quarter, in particular, with completion of the juvenile onset HPP natural history study, which will now enable us to complete our asfotase alfa BLA submission in the United States. In addition, we have recently submitted our asfotase alfa registration dossier in Japan, which follows our Q2 EU submission.","And as reflected in our financial performance during the third quarter and the upward revisions in our guidance announced today, we continue to execute on our initiatives to achieve long-term operational and financial efficiencies.","Turning first to our global commercial operations. In PNH, newly diagnosed patients continue to make up the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris across our territories. And in aHUS, we continue to add new patients in the U.S. and Europe. We are likewise seeing an ongoing steady uptake in Japan in the first full year of our launch.","In 2015 and beyond, we see the majority of our growth ahead of us in both PNH and aHUS, driven by our disease education initiatives as we help physicians to optimize patient care worldwide.","While we continue our growth in PNH, our ongoing experience in aHUS further reinforces our confidence that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and perhaps larger.","As one measure, match for time since their respective approvals, more patients in the U.S. are currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH.","In Europe, we are seeing a similar trend in the early stages of our aHUS launch. As we consistently serve more patients with Soliris in our 2 current therapeutic areas, we are also rapidly progressing our development pipeline. With regard to our anticipated next product, asfotase alfa, we reached key milestones in Q3 and in the early days of Q4.","First, we have recently completed our juvenile natural history study in patients with HPP. With this supportive data, we are now completing our BLA submission to the FDA for asfotase alfa. We will remain on target for our launch in the U.S. and Europe in early 2015.","Second, and as announced last week, we have submitted our NDA for asfotase alfa for HPP in Japan and expect to launch in late 2015.","Turning to the life cycle management of Soliris, we are pleased to now announce that we have initiated clinical development programs for our first 2 Soliris next-generation molecules and look forward to updating you on our innovative portfolio of investigational candidates as our activities proceed.","We continue to make progress toward our anticipated series of as many as 7 new indication or product approvals through 2018, in addition to our next product asfotase alfa, Soliris for AMR and DGF in kidney transplant and for both NMO and MG, our third product cPMP for infants with MoCD Type A. And we expect approval of one or more of our innovative Soliris next-generation products within the same period.","Turning to our wider objectives for growing our global organization. As we announced last month, I am pleased to note that David Hallal has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer and has also joined our Board of Directors. In his 9th year at Alexion, David's strong leadership of our global commercial operations continues to contribute significantly to our growth, while he is also increasingly expanding his leadership of our broader enterprise to includes key growth strategies and initiatives across all areas of our company.","We also recently announced in Q3 that Ed Miller has joined Alexion as Senior Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer. Ed is building upon the strong compliance function that Alexion has established over the past several years. And finally, we've also recognized the major contributions of 2 key leaders with the promotions of Clare Carmichael, our Chief Human Resources Officer; and John Moriarty, Alexion's General Counsel, each to the level of executive Vice President.","Looking briefly at our financial performance, we are pleased that we have achieved strong 39% growth in revenues in Q3 compared to the year-ago quarter. We also demonstrated strong operational leverage as we reported 53% growth in non-GAAP EPS in this quarter compared to year-ago quarter. As we continue to achieve strong financial performance into the final months of the year, we announced this morning that we are raising our revenue guidance to the higher range of $2.220 billion to $2.225 billion. And we're also now raising our 2014 guidance for non-GAAP EPS to the higher range of $5.15 to $5.20, reflecting ongoing financial discipline and the operational benefits of our global structure.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance in Q3 as well as our expectations for the final quarter of 2014. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Lenny. In Q3, we achieved another quarter of profitable growth, strong cash flow and continued operating leverage. Net sales increased to $555 million in Q3 or 39% above the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting strong unit volume growth. Strong revenues combined with ongoing financial discipline resulted in a 53% increase in non-GAAP EPS in Q3 compared to the year-ago quarter.","Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.78 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During Q3, we experienced strong positive cash flow from operations, offset by approximately $105 million in share repurchases. The primary objective of our ongoing stock repurchase program is to mitigate the natural pace of stock dilution from equity grants.","Turning to guidance. We are pleased to be increasing our 2014 forecast for both sales and EPS as announced this morning. Strong performance in both our current businesses, PNH and aHUS, enables us to raise our 2014 sales guidance to the higher range of $2.220 billion to $2.225 billion. This upwardly revised revenue guidance takes into account the expected increase in FX headwind in Q4.","We are reiterating our 2014 guidance for R&D and SG&A. As in the past, we expect to experience higher expenses in Q4 compared to Q3, due to the ramp-up of development programs, our ongoing infrastructure build-out for HPP launch and major medical conferences that take place in the final months of the year.","We're also reiterating full year 2014 COGS at a level of approximately 8%. With regard to tax, we have lowered our full year 2014 tax guidance to approximately 7.5%, largely as a result of our regional income mix.","Finally, with regard to EPS. With our increased revenue guidance and ongoing control of expenses, we have raised 2014 guidance for non-GAAP EPS now to the higher range of $5.15 to $5.20.","I'd like to highlight that excluding the $0.37 impact earlier this year on EPS associated with pre-2014 sales, this would reflect non-GAAP EPS growth of approximately 56% year-on-year from 2013 to 2014.","As we look at 2015, we expect to maintain our pretax operating margin similar to Q3 levels as we continue to invest for our asfotase alfa launch and our late-stage pipeline. Also, with regard to 2015, we are reiterating the longer-term guidance for our non-GAAP tax rate, which we provided earlier this year. As we expect ongoing operational benefits from our centralized supply chain and business operations, we continue to forecast our non-GAAP effective tax rate rising to 13% to 14% in 2015 as we use up available tax credits.","Beyond 2015, we are reiterating our forecast of a range of 16% to 18% tax rate in 2016 and beyond. This unchanged longer-term tax rate guidance reflects our current expectation of our forecasted tax rate, inclusive of the recently announced proposed changes to the Irish tax policies.","We are very pleased with our financial performance for the first 9 months of 2014 and look forward to finishing the year strongly.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to David. David?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Vikas. During Q3, we achieved strong Soliris in-quarter revenue growth of 39% over the year-ago quarter. This reflects continued steady growth in PNH globally and the strength of our ongoing aHUS launch.","Looking first at PNH during Q3. Newly diagnosed patients continue to make up the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris across our territories. We are pleased with our steady performance in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan, and we are also observing consistent growth in serving new patients across Turkey, Brazil and Russia.","Overall, we are seeing consistent expansion in the number of patients we serve across our nearly 50-country platform as we implement our strategic initiatives. While awareness of PNH globally has increased significantly over time, more education is still required to further enhance the understanding of PNH and appropriate testing of higher-risk patients.","Our experience supports our belief that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.","Turning now to aHUS. We continue to add new patients in the U.S., Europe and Japan. During Q3, our global field teams continue to educate physicians on the additional aHUS clinical data in our U.S. and European labels, which demonstrates the immediate and long-term benefits of sustained Soliris treatment. The revised labels, which now specify important longer-term clinical benefits associated with chronic and sustained Soliris treatment with inclusion of results from 2 years of ongoing treatment, will enhance and broaden our commercial efforts.","Indeed, market research in the U.S. shows that the updated label is helping physicians better appreciate the chronic nature of aHUS and the immediate and long-term benefits of sustained Soliris treatment. In Q3, we continued to make progress in Europe. In England, NICE reaffirmed the very significant clinical value of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS and has now officially recommended funding.","Importantly, new and existing aHUS patients continue to receive funded access to Soliris as we look forward to confirmation by NICE for a final policy.","Likewise, in Italy, aHUS patients continue to receive funded access to treatment as we work toward the expected completion of the reimbursement process by the end of the year.","Beyond the U.S. and EU, we made steady progress with our aHUS launch in Japan and Turkey during the quarter.","Globally, the ongoing strength in the early stages of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and perhaps larger. As one measure, we continue to observe that match for time since their respective approvals, more patients in the U.S. are currently receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. In Europe, we are now seeing a similar trend in the earlier stages of our aHUS launch.","These results in the U.S. and Europe support our belief that the incidence of aHUS is higher than the incidence of PNH. We are very pleased with our performance in Q3 and we continue to see that the majority of our growth is ahead of us in both PNH and aHUS.","Turning now to HPP. With the significant progress by our regulatory and development teams, we are advancing our commercial preparations for the launch of our next product, asfotase alfa, in the U.S., Europe and Japan in 2015.","In Q3, our initial field-based medical teams in the U.S. and Europe continued to expand our disease awareness initiatives, including their presence at international medical congresses, like ASBMR. Also, we continue to hire and train our in-country metabolic commercial teams. As we establish relationships with the HPP community, we are acutely aware that low disease awareness typically results in misdiagnoses and thus, HPP patients often go for years without receiving an accurate diagnosis.","An early goal of our commercial plan will be to optimize patient care by educating physicians on the signs and symptoms of HPP and the appropriate pathways for rapid and accurate diagnosis.","Beyond planning for the launch of asfotase alfa, we continue to establish commercial teams to assess and plan for our opportunities in AMR, DGF, NMO, MG and the next-generation Soliris molecules. These teams are working closely with our R&D colleagues as they advance these programs through the development process.","Finally, in looking more broadly across all of our functions and all of our geographies as we continue to grow, I have expanded my focus to build upon our long-standing patient-centered values so that we can deliver many more transformative therapies to more patients. We will continue to improve upon what we know well and what we do well with quality, urgency and our core passion to transform the lives of patients. I look forward to updating you as we grow our corporate operations.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our research and development programs. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Thanks, David. I am pleased to provide an update on our lead development programs as we drive toward our goal of achieving up to 7 new indications or product approvals through 2018.","Looking first at asfotase alfa in the U.S. We are very pleased that the natural history study in juvenile onset HPP patients is now complete and supports our filing as we look to build a strong label to serve patients with HPP.","Following the previous submissions of the CMC and preclinical portions, we are on track to finalize our rolling submission for the U.S. BLA this quarter. In Europe, our MAA continues to progress through accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency. And as announced last week, we have now filed our dossier for asfotase alfa in Japan. Our goal in all territories is to continue working collaboratively with regulatory authorities to obtain marketing authorization for asfotase alfa as quickly as possible.","As we proceed with our regulatory filings, we continue to build the growing body of clinical data, reflecting the devastating nature of HPP and the potentially transformative impact of asfotase alfa for patients with the disease. At the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research meeting in September, clinical researchers presented new data from a survival analysis that showed improved survival in pediatric HPP patients with severe disease treated with asfotase alfa for up to 5 years. The analysis showed that patients with HPP treated with asfotase alfa in 2 Phase II studies had overall survival of 89% versus 27% survival for untreated matched historical controls.","Additionally, at both ASBMR and the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology congress in September, researchers reported new data from the ongoing open label extension phases of the Phase II clinical studies in which sustained gains in physical function and reductions in disability and pain were observed in pediatric HPP patients receiving asfotase alfa treatment for up to 3 years. These additional efficacy data support the life-transforming potential of asfotase alfa for HPP patients.","Turning to our development program of eculizumab. We have completed enrollment and dosing in both our living-donor and deceased-donor antibody mediated rejection or AMR studies in kidney transplant patients. We will have data from both trials in the second half of 2015 and are having discussions with regulators in both the U.S. and Europe on filing strategies.","In our program in delayed graft function or DGF, we are opening sites and enrolling patients in a single multinational registration trial of eculizumab for the prevention of DGF after kidney transplantation in adults at increased risk of DGF.","In our neurology programs with eculizumab, enrollment is ongoing and our registration trial in relapsing neuromyelitis optica or NMO, a life-threatening ultra-rare neurologic disorder. Enrollment is also ongoing in our registration study in refractory myasthenia gravis or MG, a rare debilitating neurologic disorder caused by uncontrolled complement activation.","In Q3, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to eculizumab for the treatment of patients with MG.","Finally, with regard to our portfolio of innovative candidates for the life cycle management of Soliris. We are pleased to note that we have now initiated clinical development programs on the first 2 next-generation Soliris molecules with additional molecules and programs at earlier stages of development. We look forward to updating you on these programs as they proceed.","Beyond eculizumab and asfotase alfa, we also have lead development programs with 2 additional highly innovative therapies, cPMP and ALXN1007.","In our metabolic disease area, we continue to develop our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A. The synthetic cPMP switch study in patients with MoCD is ongoing. We are also continuing our retrospective data collection, which we expect to be complete by the end of the year, and enrollment in our natural history study is also ongoing.","With regard to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, we have now commenced dosing in a Phase II proof-of-concept study in patients with a rare autoimmune disorder called antiphospholipid syndrome or APS. This open label Phase II study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALXN1007.","We have started site activation in another severe and ultra-rare disorder, graft versus host disease involving the lower gastrointestinal tract or GI-GVHD. This Phase II proof-of-concept study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ALXN1007 in newly diagnosed GI-GVHD patients, and we aim to start dosing by the end of the year.","Beyond our current late-stage clinical development programs, we continue to make significant progress to bring forward our next wave of potential breakthrough treatments.","Turning to Moderna. We have accelerated 4 additional targeted early stage preclinical projects for a total now of 6 different preclinical mRNA rare disease programs. We are targeting the first candidate from these 6 different programs to enter the clinic in 2016.","In addition, our research team is currently evaluating several additional preclinical candidates across a range of severe and ultra-rare disorders.","As we enter the last quarter of 2014, we have delivered on our goal of 10 development milestones this year and we expect to reach additional development milestones in Q4, most notably completing the U.S. filing for asfotase alfa.","These accomplishments reflect a momentum from the continued build-out of a broad and deep global R&D organization, which enables us to simultaneously progress multiple development programs. We are committed to drive our programs forward with great urgency, both our current internal programs and through our research collaborations, licensing or acquisitions. We are combining increasing skills with unwavering commitment to urgently bring forward new therapeutic candidates with life-transforming potential for patients with severe and life-threatening diseases.","I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Martin. Before closing, I want to acknowledge the enormous and lasting impact that our former Chairman, Dr. Max Link, has had on the biopharmaceutical industry, on Alexion and on me, personally. Max joined me at the company's inception in 1992. He was a colleague, friend, mentor, confidant and guide over the course of 22 years. I miss him very much. He is also greatly missed by the entire Alexion family and by the stream of other organizations he lead over the past 4 decades with his commitment to drive medical innovation to benefit patients around the world.","At this point, operator, we'll take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe for Martin on the next-generation Soliris candidates that have entered the clinic now. We've noticed there's no mention of those on the ClinicalTrials.gov. So just kind of wondering why that is, and when we might or how we might learn anything about the candidates themselves?","Martin MacKay","Thank you, Eric. And obviously, you're correct about the ClinicalTrials.gov piece. These are actually volunteer studies with our first 2 molecules. And as we mentioned in the script, they're really part of an innovative portfolio that we're building around the life-cycle management of Soliris now. We're really using our clinical experience with eculizumab and deep expertise in complement biology. We're building these molecules. In terms of when you can expect, we are committed to giving you updates on these programs as they progress over the next year or so.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just on asfotase, a couple of related questions. So could you give us a sense on when we might see the natural history study presented or published? And then, David, you mentioned on asfotase, the large number of unidentified patients. Where in the clinical environment are those patients? Do you envisage that you're going to have to reach out to pediatricians or to dentists or -- I mean, where -- how are you going to find the unidentified patients with HPP?","Leonard Bell","You're going to start with the natural history study?","Martin MacKay","Yes. In terms of when you can expect to see the results of that, we'll continue to publish the results of -- several trials are going on with HPP over the next period and the obvious conferences. Well, I would say though is the natural history study did confirm what we've seen before the really serious morbidities associated with HPP: Serious bone dysfunction, growth abnormalities, physical disabilities, leading to reduced mobility and agility. So a real confirmation of that. And again, if we compare that with the 3-year extension study that we did present at ASBMR with our colleagues and to see the difference of significant growth -- rapid improvements in physical function and decreases in disability and pain when patients were treated with asfotase alfa. David?","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Martin. Yes, Geoff, and it is a fairly broad audience that would see patients either with HPP or patients that are higher likelihood for having HPP. So we are -- we're taking some time to understand in the following specialties, whether or not it's pediatric or adult endocrinologist, geneticists, pediatric nephrologist, rheumatologist, orthopods, neonatologist. We've taken some steps to try to understand which of those physicians are at higher likelihood for either having managed a patient in the past, currently managing a patient today or frankly patients that may have the disease and they just have not necessarily been worked up appropriately, diagnostically. And as we -- this is the community in which we're building the relationship with. And so over time, this is where we would anticipate will help to identify our patients.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn S. Karnauskas - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess on the follow-on Soliris program. You mentioned before that once you've identified the drugs that you're going to take forward, that you may have a very broad development program. I was just wondering if these first trials will help you to make that decision to go into a direct, very broad program? And then on aHUS, what percentage of patients do you think that getting time off the drug or having gaps in use versus continuous use of Soliris?","Martin MacKay","I'll take the first question on the next-generation, and correct, we will have a broad development program. But we'll also have, we believe, many options within that -- with the programs and the molecules that we're progressing. And really on a simple basis of giving treatment options to both physicians and patients alike in the diseases that we're interested in.","David L. Hallal","Yes, Rob, and as it relates to aHUS, as we've noted in past calls, we -- we're observing that the compliance for patients with the confirmed diagnosis of aHUS is good, but less than we have historically observed with PNH. And -- but I think it's sort of an important point to recognize when both I and Lenny talk to matched for time for their respective approvals, the patients that are actively on treatment for Soliris with aHUS is actually higher than what we observed in PNH. And that is sort of with lower patient retention rates. I will say that early, the feedback has been positive with our new expanded labels in the U.S. and Europe. We see it in market research, we're seeing it in that physicians that we dialogue with directly and through that, a greater appreciation for the chronic nature of the disease and the longer-term clinical benefits of ongoing Soliris treatment through 2 years.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Ying Huang with Bank of America.","Ying Huang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a couple. So first one is you have submitted the filing to Europe and also Japan as well as FDA in the U.S. Can you confirm that the definition of so-called early onset is the same for all 3 regulatory agencies for asfotase in HPP indication? And then the second question I have is the readiness of launch for asfotase here. It sounds like you do you have a very well-organized commercial infrastructure established in the U.S. Can you talk about your readiness to launch HPP in Europe and also Japan?","Martin MacKay","Ying, I'll take your question in terms of the indication. Let me just take half a step backward and confirm what you have said that we have filed in Europe in June and have accelerated assessment. We've now filed in Japan in 15th of October and also, that's going through the process. The U.S.A., both in terms of the breakthrough designation that we have and also the fact that we have a rolling submission -- and already 2 parts of the rolling submission and with the completion of the juvenile natural history study will allow us to complete the third part within this quarter. As you may imagine with all regulatory authorities now, we are in discussions and as part of those discussions to label indication statement and other pieces of it. So I would say, normally progressing at this rate.","David L. Hallal","Thanks, Martin. And as it relates to the build-out and preparation for the asfotase alfa launch, the way we've approached this is -- our objective, much like for PNH and aHUS, is to build not just the capability, but a core competence in the area of metabolic disorders. So the -- a few years ago, we developed a global therapeutic area focused on metabolic disease in planning for the strategy and tactics for the launch of asfotase alfa. As you've mentioned, U.S. versus Europe, I take a look at really our leading countries that generally are going to contribute for us the most significant opportunity to serve patients for HPP. And what we've been doing, as I mentioned on the call, is hiring and now training our in-country metabolic teams in the form of a metabolic business unit. And these teams are collaborating now with the medical teams that we've built and deployed in the field to prepare to serve patients. So I think Europe, we are every bit as we look country to country for when that opportunity will be, we will be on par, we are on par with where we are in the U.S.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Matt Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My question is in transplant AMR. You're waiting for presumably the 12-month follow-up data, which puts you into the second half of the year. But if I heard you correctly, you mentioned that you're already in discussions with regulators about the next step. So when I think back to the prior data that you presented in AMR, the effect looks pretty transformative. So it occurs to me that along the lines of early stoppage of oncology trials, I just wonder if there are any decisions or accelerations, program on earlier follow-up would be possible with this AMR program? I'm just -- I don't know if that's too aggressive of an assumption. I'm just trying to understand what the potential range of outcomes are for the program and next steps.","Martin MacKay","I do think it's a little aggressive on assumption there. As you know the primary endpoint is a 9-week end point, but the primary analysis will be 12 months. And also, as we said, and you correctly articulated it, we are in discussions with regulators and that will really help our -- dictate our strategy. But first and foremost, let's see the data, that will help enormously.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just to follow-up on the commercial side. You guys have been reticent to talk about any segment growth, but just wondering if you can give us the sense as to whether or not there's any -- anything sort of nonrecurring in the Soliris number this quarter? Whether or not it just simply reflects underlying demand growth? And then for Vikas. I gather from the results that you appear to have been pretty well hedged on foreign exchange. Just wondering if there is anything worth noting there for the quarter or anything to keep in mind going forward?","David L. Hallal","Yes. We saw growth across all geographies, including Latin America in Q3. Looking at Q4 in Russia, we see an impact on regional healthcare budgets due to increased economic pressure in that country. I think it's also important -- and as a reminder, 2\/3 of our business is outside of the U.S. and we anticipate an impact on our non-U.S. business from both major and commodity currencies. And maybe Vikas can provide a little bit more color on that.","Vikas Sinha","Going -- moving from Q2 to Q3, the impact wasn't as great. But when we look at going from Q3 to Q4, there's a dramatic change, as David was mentioning, on the commodity currencies, like ruble and Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. All of these are showing tremendous weakness, in addition to euro and yen. Euro and yen, we definitely hedged pretty well, almost 50% of that is hedged. So going in to next quarter, that portion we definitely will be able to get there with a lesser impact. Overall, we also don't hedge our expenses. So net-net, you'll see some impact on the top line, which has been factored into our guidance that we provided today. But with the natural hedge, the impact on EPS will be minimal in the next quarter.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Salveen Richter with SunTrust.","Salveen J. Richter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just regard to asfotase. You mentioned that your educating physicians on the diagnosis of HPP. I'm wondering what the specific initiatives are here? And then are you seeing these efforts kind of paying off in the diagnosis of these patients? And just a quick question for Vikas as well. Their COGS were a little bit higher than expected this quarter. Is that a onetime impact or something we should think about going forward?","David L. Hallal","Yes, just -- first-off -- it's difficult to necessarily see is it paying off. But what we can see is that, and I sort of alluded to this on the call, there's an appreciation by physicians. They're probably not thinking about this disease enough when that they're seeing patients present with symptoms that are consistent with the disease. They're certainly not an appreciation for how to confirm a diagnosis with this disease. As an example, alk phos tests are readily available, but I don't think that physicians are really thinking that low alk phos adjusted for gender and age can actually relate to a confirmed HPP diagnosis. They're usually looking for elevated alk phos in a number of different metabolic bone diseases. So I think what we're qualifying early on is that there is -- there's an educational gap. And there is for a very good reason, the extreme rarity of the disease. And that after these interactions with our field-based medical teams, physicians are certainly appreciating what they need to do sooner to help to create a more rapid and accurate diagnosis for patients.","Vikas Sinha","Yes, Salveen, on the COGS question. Yes, going forward, we'll be back into our 8% guidance level. For the full year also, we'll still remain at the 8% guidance level. Q3, we saw maintenance cost as a rollout in facility. That's what impacted the quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Back onto the -- under the aHUS compliance issue. So I think I heard your answer to an earlier question on the early receptivity to the new label and the positive feedback. But I wonder if you could maybe directionally sort of describe any observed sort of revenue impact this quarter from these efforts? Are you seeing benefit now? Or is this something that might have more follow through into 2015? Obviously, I know you don't want to give details, but any sort of the directionality would be great.","David L. Hallal","We don't necessarily see an immediate impact from the label change. What I -- and I think that I've discussed this in the past, what we would expect to see early on is feedback from physicians that give us a sense that taking data in our label out to 2 years where we generally had to launch with only 6 months of data makes a meaningful impact. And that impact is mostly on their -- sort of where they frame their view on the benefits that they can expect from long-term therapy. So from a revenue impact perspective, we would expect us to see it, but we would expect to see it over a long period of time. And again, early on, we are encouraged by the receptivity of the community.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Howard Liang with Leerink.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Regarding Soliris for NMO and MG, ClinicalTrials.gov says potential data in early 2016, January or so. I don't know if this mean anything, but is there any possibility that in the best-case scenario that you -- one of those -- of these trials could have data in 2015?","Vikas Sinha","That's highly unlikely, Howard. These are both, for us, relatively large studies as you'd see from ClinicalTrials.gov, the randomized, double blind, placebo controlled and multi-center. So we continue to activate sites and recruit patients into the study. As you will also remember then in more trials and event-driven trial, and although we have a number that we think we will need to reach in terms of the patients that will be dictated by the events, but we are looking to 2016 to see our results from both neuromyelitis optica and myasthenia gravis trials.","Operator","And let's take our next question from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just last year at ASH, you guys have mentioned a compassionate youth program for asfotase, that was already underway in Japan. I was just wondering if you can share any update on that program with respect to either the type and\/or number of HPP patients that are involved.","David L. Hallal","Yes. We've locked and analyzed data from our 10-10 study, which you maybe familiar with, which is included in our regulatory submissions. And in order to continue to maintain access for pediatric patients indeed -- in need, we actually had increased the number of sites for the study, and we're looking to continue to enroll patients. And in that way, it puts us in a better position to help the patients with this devastating disease. In terms of patient numbers, the way that I would frame it up is when you look in aggregate of all of the asfotase alfa trials, the enrolled patients at this point in time is about 1\/3 of that we had in our overall PNH trials. So it's a fairly limited number as opposed to our PNH program.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from M. Somaiya with Nomura Securities.","M. Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just had a question on the Soliris line expansion strategy. I was disconnected when the Q&A session began, so I apologize if this question's already been asked and answered. I think, Lenny, you began by saying that one of the first Soliris line extensions will be approved within your sort of 3-year time frame. And I'm just wondering, given the close proximity to 3 of these antibodies moving into clinic, when should we expect the other 2 to reach to market? And it would help if we can just get a sense for what the strategy is from an indication perspective.","Martin MacKay","This is Martin, I'll take that question. As you heard on the script, we've -- 2 molecules have entered the clinic and as Lenny said, when he was rounding up that we are looking for up to 7 indications or approvals in the 2018 time frame. So that's actually 4 years. So we're moving 2 molecules into the clinic and having what we believe is our innovative portfolio coming off at the back of that, it really will depend on results. At the end of the day, what we want to do is give treatment options for both physicians and patients as part of this life cycle program.","M. Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And if I could just ask a follow-up. What was the sort of the minimum criteria that you set for yourself to even pursue development of a follow on?","Martin MacKay","That's a really good question because as you know eculizumab's transformative for patients in PNH and atypical aHUS. And as we conduct other trials across transplant neurology, the hurdles are high for sure. It really comes back to my statement about treatment options and being able to offer those for physicians and patients alike. So that's what we're aiming to do with this life cycle program.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned the Phase II study for 1007 is beginning for acute GI graft versus host disease. So I was just wondering if you might be able to speak a little bit about the epidemiology and current treatment paradigm in that indication, the scientific rationale and whether you'd be able to move straight into a Phase III following this study?","Martin MacKay","Yes, in terms of -- that's our second study, actually, with Alexion 1007. The first, as you know is an antiphospholipid syndrome, which I would actually started with patients now. So in terms of the epidemiology, like the vast majority of the diseases, we look at the numbers, they are small, but the disease is devastating. And commonly found after transplants -- often stem cell transplants and cell transplants, where the transplanted cells really attack the host body. And there's a range of clinical manifestations across liver, skin, mucosa and the GI track area that we are most interested in. With particularly in the GI track, it's really a very nasty disease with intestinal inflammation, sloughing, severe diarrhea and a number of other manifestations. In terms of your question about where this can go and how quickly? It really depends on the results that we achieve with 1007 in this indication. And based on these data, will allow us to move forward and progress accordingly.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a follow-up on the low alk phos kind of screen. I don't know -- do you have any good data what percentage of adults present sort of -- or have concomitant low alk phos. I'm trying to get a sense sort of how good of a biomarker is it? And sort of what's your plan as to how you can use that as a tool to actually finding patients? Is it sort of on a hospital-by-hospital basis? Or is there some kind of -- I don't if you call it diagnostic that you can sort of market along with the drug?","David L. Hallal","I think it's -- again, sort of important, I'll restate. We're focused on a few key specialties, as I mentioned. That's where we would go with our disease and diagnostic initiatives and that's where our field-based medical teams have started. And eventually where our commercial teams will move to post-approval. And that's with the pediatric endocrinologist, endocrinologist, geneticist, neonatologist, some rheumatologist, orthopods, a series of physicians who -- we take a step back and we understand which ones are treating patients with metabolic bone diseases. Now it's not just simply test everybody, but it's patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, patients with osteomalacia, there's a few examples where these are patients who are showing a disorder, that perhaps in additional tests, can help to determine if the diagnosis is accurate. And that's the approach that we taking. Now in terms of the percentage of patients that would actually have low alk phos that would point to HPP, very difficult to determine right now. And something that we'll be looking to better understand over time.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","David or Lenny, given all of your recurring comments about the trajectory of aHUS compared to PML, I was wondering if you'd give us some indication that the aHUS revenue in the U.S. market will exceed the -- sorry, PNH, I beg your pardon, revenue in the U.S. market? And if that will happen, when it might happen? Is it within a couple of years or is that still something that's more remote than that?","David L. Hallal","No. I do want to clarify. While we don't work in the MS space that it's PNH versus the PML, I just want to -- but no, as it relates to the acceleration as you are stating now, aHUS was launched in late 2011 as opposed to the PNH indication in the U.S., which was launched in April of '07. And we continue to see a tremendous durability to our PNH franchise, that is in the U.S. 2014. We continue to identify and see treatment initiation in a similar number of new patients on a quarterly basis today as we did back in 2007 and 2008. So that durability means PNH continues to roll forward. Now again, matched for time, we see now 12 quarters into the aHUS launch, there are more active patients on treatment for Soliris than we had 12 quarters into the PNH launch. It really depends on our continued success in really building both of those opportunities. As we said, both opportunities we see the majority of the growth in front of us. And so what's the acceleration, what is the rate of growth in both, will be that over time. The good news is we see more of our growth in front of us than behind us, and that's where we are focused on at this point.","Operator","That was our last question, and this concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Altschuller. [Technical Difficulty] (00:17-00:28)","Susan Altschuller - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the third quarter of 2018. Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer; John Orloff, our Global Head of R&D; and Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial Officer.","You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website.","Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional details. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today and we undertake no duty to update any of the statements after the call, except as required by law.","I'd also like to remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, our GAAP results. Thank you.","Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Susan, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We continue to build on our momentum, advancing our mission of bringing hope to patients and families affected by rare diseases. We had an excellent third quarter with a number of significant achievements to highlight.","Yesterday marked the anniversary of the FDA approval of Soliris for patients with MG. One year later, I'm very proud to say that we have delivered on our ambition of making MG the best Soliris launch yet.","Last month, we reported remarkable topline results from our Phase 3 PREVENT study of Soliris in NMOSD. We're moving quickly to prepare global regulatory submissions, which can make Soliris the first approved therapy for patients with this devastating disease.","Also last month, we announced an agreement to acquire Syntimmune and with its SYNT001, an innovative FcRn-targeted asset that holds great promise for treating IgG-mediated diseases. And once again, we delivered strong top and bottom line growth.","Moving to slide six, we've continued to execute on our five key objectives throughout the year. We have made notable progress in addition to the achievements I've just mentioned. We continue to grow the in-line business with our Complement and Metabolic portfolios, delivering year-over-year revenue growth of 20% and volume growth of 26% in the quarter.","MG remains a significant growth driver. And at the end of September, 560 MG patients were on therapy in the U.S.","The PNH regulatory submissions for Ultomiris, formerly referred to as ALXN1210, have been accepted in the U.S., EU and Japan, and we're actively preparing for anticipated launches.","I'm very pleased with the significant progress we've made in building our pipeline this year with Syntimmune, Wilson Therapeutics, Complement Pharma, and most recently, Dicerna. Our pipeline today is far more robust and diverse.","Again, I will highlight the groundbreaking results from our Phase 3 study of Soliris in NMOSD, which showed a 94.2% reduction in the risk of adjudicated relapse and an adjudicated annualized relapse rate of 0.02.","Finally, given our strong financial performance, we have increased our guidance. We have accomplished a lot in the first three quarters of this year: executing on our base business, successfully launching in MG, preparing for Ultomiris launches, and rebuilding our pipeline for long-term value creation, all while maintaining a focus on transforming the lives of patients with rare diseases.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss the third quarter financial results and to provide details on our guidance. Paul?","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Ludwig. I'm pleased to be reporting on another strong quarter. Starting with slide 8, we reported total revenues in the quarter of $1.27 billion, an increase of 20% year-over-year, driven by continued performance of Soliris and Metabolic portfolios. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 54% in the third quarter, an expansion of 916 basis points. This was well above our prior forecast, driven by topline leverage, timing of program spend and lower workforce costs.","We're anticipating a lower operating margin in the fourth quarter of the year due to an expanding pipeline and sales and marketing investment to support our growth opportunities. I'll provide further details. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was 40%, driven by topline performance and strong operating expense control.","Moving to slide 9, net product sales were driven by volume growth of 26%, partially offset by an FX headwind of 1% and a price headwind of 5%. The price headwind was largely driven by price changes in Turkey and Brazil. Specifically, we formalized reimbursement agreements subsequent to marketing authorization for Soliris in Turkey in the third quarter of 2018 and Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additionally, changes in our Metabolics business contributed to the price headwind.","From a geographic perspective, recall that in the third quarter of 2017, we had a low amount of orders in Latin America. When taking that into consideration, we continued to deliver exceptionally strong revenue growth in the United States, in Asia Pacific, while delivering more modest growth in the rest of world.","From a sequential basis, it's worth noting that the second quarter included an approximately $18 million benefit related to the order timing ahead of the July 4 holiday in the United States. Approximately half of this was for Soliris and half for Strensiq.","Turning to slide 10, Soliris revenue in the third quarter was $888 million with year-over-year volume growth of 24%, driven primarily by the strength in the U.S. and Japan, which both include the growing contribution from our MG launch.","Moving to slide 11, Strensiq revenues for the third quarter were $113 million, representing 30% revenue growth and 37% volume growth year-over-year. Kanuma revenues in the third quarter were $25 million, representing 54% revenue growth and 74% volume growth year-over-year.","Turning to the P&L on slide 12. During the quarter, non-GAAP R&D expense was $162 million or 16% of revenues. Spend was lower than anticipated due to lower program spend and lower workforce costs. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $225 million or 22% of revenue. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 14%. We reported third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.02, growing 40% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per share was $1.47.","We ended the third quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities.","Now, turning to slide 13, which outlines our updated financial guidance. Before getting into specifics, I'd like to call out a few items. First, our updated guidance reflects the strength of the business especially MG. Second, as we move into the fourth quarter and beyond, we anticipate increased investment in R&D due to our expanding pipeline and increased investment in medical affairs in sales and marketing given growth opportunities in neurology. And third, GAAP guidance includes accounting for two asset acquisitions: Wilson Therapeutics in the second quarter and the planned acquisition of Syntimmune expected to close in the fourth quarter, as well as our collaboration with Dicerna announced this morning.","We're increasing our topline revenue guidance to a range between $4.020 billion and $4.050 billion, which represents 14% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. For Soliris, our revenue guidance is $3.460 billion to $3.480 billion, an increase over prior guidance driven by the strength of MG.","Turning to Metabolics, our revenue guidance remains $560 million to $570 million, reflecting continued momentum in Strensiq. We estimate price will be a 3% headwind in 2018 with three quarters attributable to Soliris and one quarter attributable to Metabolics.","We now forecast FX impact for 2018 to represent roughly a $10 million headwind using current foreign exchange rates.","GAAP operating margin is expected to be 0% to 5%, which is inclusive of the Syntimmune and Wilson acquisitions, the Dicerna collaboration, as well as restructuring and related expenses. We're increasing our non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 51% to 52%, representing approximately 600 to 700 basis points expansion over 2017. This is inclusive of R&D spend of 16% to 17% of revenues and includes increased investments for the ongoing SYNT001 Phase 1\/Phase 2 trials, the WTX101 Phase 3 trial, preparations for regulatory filings for Soliris in NMOSD, initiation of ALXN1210 subcutaneous and MG programs, and increased workforce spend.","We also expect to further invest in medical affairs and sales and marketing as we intensify preparations for potential launches of Ultomiris in PNH and support our growing neurology portfolio, including expanding our MG sales footprint and preparing for the potential launch of Soliris in NMOSD.","At the midpoint of this guidance, non-GAAP operating profit is expected to grow 30% year-over-year. We're forecasting a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 14% to 15%.","GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between negative $0.08 to positive $0.26 per share, inclusive of Syntimmune and Wilson acquisitions. We're increasing non-GAAP EPS which is now expected to be between $7.45 to $7.60 per share. The midpoint of this range is approximately 29% growth year-over-year.","With the strong year-to-date performance, we're poised to deliver on our 2018 financial ambitions.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. With our impressive Phase 3 NMOSD results, the acquisition of Syntimmune and our new collaboration with Dicerna, our pipeline has progressed considerably in the third quarter. I'm very proud of our team for all they have accomplished, and we remain committed to advancing and rebuilding our pipeline.","Slide 15 reflects key updates in our development portfolio. Starting with Soliris in NMOSD, we're actively engaging with regulators and plan to file early next year.","Moving to Ultomiris, our PNH BLA filings have been accepted in the U.S., Europe and now Japan. Recall our U.S. PDUFA date is scheduled for February 18 of next year.","We remain on track to report Phase 3 topline results for ALXN1210 in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, or aHUS, in early 2019 and plan to file our sBLA subject to Ultomiris approval in PNH. We now plan to initiate our Phase 3 study investigating ALXN1210 in MG in early 2019.","Our subcutaneous programs are progressing on schedule and it is our ambition to be first to market with a subcutaneous C5 inhibitor. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 bridging study or once-weekly subcutaneous ALXN1210 in the fourth quarter.","We initiated our ALXN1810 Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers in the third quarter. Recall this trial is investing a co-administration of ALXN1210 and Halozyme's PH20, and co-formulation work remains ongoing. With Halozyme's ENHANZE technology, we see potential for every-two-week or once-monthly dosing schedules.","We expect to add two clinical stage assets to our portfolio this year with the previously announced acquisition of Wilson Therapeutics and agreement to acquire Syntimmune. Our Phase 3 WTX101 trial is ongoing and we see meaningful opportunity for label differentiation as the study is now designed to demonstrate superiority over the current standard of care.","I'll remind you that our trial enhancements have modestly increased enrollment timelines and we plan to file for regulatory approval with the required one year data in the first half of 2021.","In addition to the two ongoing Phase 1b\/2a programs for SYNT001, there's an ongoing Phase 1 healthy volunteer dose-ranging study which will be informative for dose optimization. We look to initiate two pivotal trials for SYNT001 in 2019.","Slide 16 provides an overview of the devastating nature of NMOSD. Stepwise disease progression is driven by each unpredictable and debilitating relapse. Therefore, the primary goal of treatment is relapse prevention. Each relapse may result in worsening disability including vision loss, paralysis and even premature death. The majority of NMOSD patients continue to have high disease activity despite long-term off-label treatment with ISTs so there's a critical need for an effective treatment.","While we continue to refine our global addressable population estimates, in the U.S., there are approximately 8,000 diagnosed patients with 90% of those patients meeting our criteria for high disease activity. Roughly 75% of those patients test positive for the anti-aquaporin-4 auto-antibody and roughly 90% are treated. A relatively recent introduction of this test has improved awareness and diagnosis of NMOSD and has been included in the most recently published diagnostic guidelines.","Slide 17 highlights key findings from our Phase 3 PREVENT study evaluating Soliris in patients with anti-aquaporin-4 auto-antibody confirmed NMOSD. The trial enrolled patients with high disease activity despite treatment with immunosuppressant maintenance therapy.","Per protocol, patients in both the Soliris arm and the placebo arm were allowed to remain on maintenance IST therapy provided a stable dose was confirmed at screening. Approximately 75% of patients enrolled were on IST maintenance therapy and approximately 32% of patients enrolled have been previously treated with rituximab.","The study met its primary endpoint of time to first adjudicated on-trial relapse, demonstrating that treatment with Soliris reduced the risk of adjudicated relapse by 94.2% compared to placebo, with a p-value of less than 0.0001. Nearly 98% of patients in the Soliris group were relapse-free at 48 weeks compared to approximately 63% of patients in the placebo group. Additionally, the Soliris adjudicated on-trial annualized relapse rate was 0.02 versus 0.35 for placebo.","Soliris was generally well tolerated with an overall safety profile consistent with that seen in clinical studies and real-world use in all three approved indications, and we did not observe any meningococcal infections. We're very happy with these results, which we believe confirm that the complement inhibition achieved by Soliris has a profound effect on relapse prevention and marks a potential turning point in the treatment of this disease. Pending regulatory review, we believe Soliris has the potential to be the first approved treatment for NMOSD.","Moving to slide 18, this quarter, we announced our planned acquisition of Syntimmune, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing antibody therapeutics targeting the FcRn receptor. We are excited to help shape the FcRn landscape and view this acquisition as a great step towards diversifying our pipeline. The acquisition will bring SYNT001, an anti-FcRn antibody with demonstrated proof of mechanism into our pipeline.","On the right, you see a range of IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases that could be treated by targeting FcRn. We see potential for broad application across a number of indications with SYNT001. We have already decided to move forward in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or WAIHA, and plan to initiate a pivotal trial in another undisclosed indication next year.","WAIHA, a rare hemolytic autoimmune disorder, affects approximately 65,000 patients across the U.S. and EU5. The disease is characterized by profound, potentially life-threatening anemia and other acute complications, including severe hemolysis, fatigue, congestive heart failure and enlargement of the liver and spleen. There are currently no approved therapies. SYNT001 is the first and, at present, the only anti-FcRn asset in clinical development for WAIHA.","We expect data from the ongoing Phase 1b\/2a study in 2019 and intend to initiate a pivotal program following its completion. We plan to provide updates on our SYNT001 development plans in the coming months.","Turning to slide 19, today, we announced a collaboration with Dicerna Pharmaceuticals to discover and develop RNAi therapies for complement-mediated diseases with a GalXC technology platform. This innovative RNAi-based approach to blocking the production of complement pathway factors and with potentially broad therapeutic applicability across rare diseases offers us the opportunity to pursue multiple targets. This preclinical collaboration is a strong strategic fit with our complement expertise and internal research programs.","I'm very proud of the progress we have made rebuilding our pipeline, and I'm excited for what lies ahead in our development portfolio.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the commercial highlights for the quarter. Brian?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, John. Starting with Soliris on slide 21, we continue to execute on our base business and importantly, on our MG launch, which is now confirmed to be the best Soliris launch to date.","As of quarter-end, we had roughly 1,000 MG patients enrolled in OneSource, including 560 patients on therapy. We continue to see strong movement through OneSource and on to treatment with a run rate of approximately 16 net new patient additions per week.","We also continue to see growth in our PNH and aHUS businesses, and believe there is still room for expansion with roughly half of the addressable U.S. patient population treated. We believe this underlying momentum lays a strong foundation upon which we can facilitate Ultomiris conversion once we've achieved regulatory approvals.","Turning to Strensiq on slide 22, we reported revenues of approximately $113 million this quarter and we continue to believe Strensiq will exit 2018 with revenues approaching $500 million. As of quarter-end, Strensiq is on market and reimbursed in seven countries.","Looking at Kanuma on slide 23, we reported $25 million in revenue this quarter. We remain focused on securing new funding agreements and partnerships in additional countries to expand access to this transformational medicine. To date, Kanuma is launched and reimbursed in eight countries.","Turning to slide 24, we remain confident in our abilities to facilitate conversion to Ultomiris in PNH and are rapidly advancing our launch preparation ahead of the February 18 PNH PDUFA date, as well as potential launches in Europe and Japan. We're leveraging our deep PNH experience to inform our sales force, medical affairs and case management strategies ahead of launch, and we're developing payer dossiers to articulate the unique Ultomiris value proposition.","We're also utilizing market research in our existing footprint to segment physicians while actively engaging with payers in advance of the launch. We believe the extensive depth of our PNH knowledge and stakeholder engagement is key to facilitating rapid conversion.","I'd also like to highlight findings from recent physician and patient market research that suggests Ultomiris IV infusion every eight weeks is the preferred route of administration in PNH, which reinforces our view on market receptivity and launch. Importantly, in every eight-week IV profile was preferred over monthly, weekly and daily subcutaneous dosing. We believe minimizing the burden of managing the disease, improving compliance and co-pay considerations are all important factors driving these preferences.","We expect Ultomiris IV-based dosing to achieve and maintain significant market share. However, we feel that there is an opportunity for subcutaneous dose therapies to provide additional options for patients, and we'll be in the lead initiating our Phase 3 trial of once-weekly subcutaneous ALXN1210 this year.","As you can see on slide 25, we're also focused on maximizing our neurology portfolio. We have plans to further expand our footprint in order to build on our success in MG. Given the strength of the data and the lack of approved therapies, we're preparing for a potential launch in NMOSD with a significant sense of urgency. I want to thank our global team for their continued efforts and reiterate the organization's excitement as we evolve our broader strategy and prepare for numerous potential launches in 2019.","I'd now like to turn the call back to Ludwig for final remarks. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. Beginning on slide 27, we continue to make progress on each of the five objectives we laid out at the beginning of the year. We are not only achieving, but in many areas surpassing our plans to grow the in-line business, launch MG, extend our leadership with Ultomiris, rebuild the pipeline and deliver financially.","Turning to slide 28, thanks to this team and to our talented employees around the world, we now have a strong foundation and are advancing our strategy to enter the next phase of rare disease leadership. We remain committed to delivering innovative therapies to patients in need and believe the Syntimmune acquisition and Phase 3 NMOSD readout are critical next steps in doing so.","We have expanded our portfolio to drive long-term sustainability in our core therapeutic areas. Our goal is to further build upon this as we continue to redefine what it means to live with a rare disease. I'm very proud of what we, as a company, have achieved so far this year and I'm very excited for the future we are continuing to build not only for Alexion, but also for patients with rare diseases.","While we have accomplished a great deal, we also know there are many patients and families still waiting. So we continue to forge ahead with the utmost urgency. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go.","With that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now turn to the question-and-answer portion of our call. Our first question comes from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink. Your line is open.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much, and congratulations on really all the phenomenal progress.","Couple of financial questions related. Paul, you highlighted the operating margin improvement, but then you also highlighted the incremental investments that you're going to be making both in pipeline and in commercial preparedness. Can you see your way clear to maintaining that 50%-plus operating margin, so not just in the immediate future because we've sort of been waiting for that to improve for a while?","And then secondly related, on guidance for next year, given that you'll be guiding ahead of the ALXN1210 approval, should we be assuming that you'll guide assuming that approval when we hear from you in the first of the year? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Geoff. Great question. Appreciate the initial comment as well.","We're definitely pleased and are committed to the 50% operating margin, right. I mean, that was put out with Ludwig in the new strategy a year ago for 2019. We actually are surpassing it with the guidance for 2018. So in my mind, that's excellent, excellent progress. It's exactly as you said, and we understand that that is really kind of earning the trust back from our investors that was so critical.","As we move into 2019, it's premature to kind of give spot numbers and exact numbers that \u2013 we'll hold that obviously for the guidance call. But let me kind of give you at least a framework to kind of \u2013 and some guardrails to think about.","We still want to have top-line to bottom-line leverage. I think that the thought process of the degree that we delivered this year is actually quite astounding, right? And it's on the heels of good strong revenue growth, coupled with kind of pulling through the restructuring and cost containment efforts going into next year.","We purposely \u2013 and I purposely wanted to kind of frame up that those dynamics probably aren't as strong going into next year in terms of margin expansion for all really what we think are positive reasons. We actually do have, as we go into next year, what we start to now envision is a meaningfully expanded pivotal trial pipeline. When you combine Wilson that is in Phase 3, our objectives for the FcRn product to be into two Phase 3s by the end of next year, continuing to move ALXN1210 into other indications both subcutaneous as well as MG, potentially others. So that's a high-class problem, as well as making sure we've put wood on the fire with respect to making sure Ultomiris is launched extremely well.","I mean, there's obviously tremendous amount of synergy with the existing footprint. But MG has really kind of exceeded our expectations this year. We want to keep that going, and then this new opportunity that we probably didn't envision around NMO. So all great stuff. But I still think we will commit to topline and bottom-line \u2013 leverage to the bottom-line. The degree of it will probably not be at the pace that we saw in 2018.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then timing for guidance and the basis?","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I'm sorry?","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Will you guide \u2013 assuming ALXN1210 approval, when you gave us the guidance in June 1 (30:10)?","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes, yes, yes, we will. I think we think that that \u2013 you never know, but we think that that is a very, very high likelihood.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question which I've realized might be more difficult to answer, but I was hoping maybe you guys could provide some perspective for us. So overnight, Chugai confirmed that they're going to present data from SYK59 (sic) [SKY59] in patients at ASH and you've also got another potential competing product coming at ASH.","And I'm just wondering if you might be willing to help us think about what are the key metrics that you're going to focus on when you think about that data versus what you've demonstrated with Soliris and ALXN1210. Thanks.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, Matt, this is John. Thanks. Yeah, well, we're really anticipating the ASH congress. We have a big presence there with four abstracts; three of them are oral, presenting data from our Phase 3 program with Ultomiris in both na\u00efve and experienced patients, switch patients that will build on what we shared earlier this year. And we think our data is really raising the bar. And we anticipate the approval for ALXN1210 here shortly in the U.S., and of course, we filed also in the EU and Japan.","So we'll certainly be first to market raising the bar from what Soliris has demonstrated. And I don't really want to speculate what they may or may not show, but I will say that they are targeting a different epitope than we target, that Soliris targets and that Ultomiris targets. And so there are some considerations relating to switching patients in that scenario.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Congrats on yet another good quarter and thanks for the question. Brian, on the MG launch, I wanted to get more context from you for the OUS perspective, what the experience has been, from access, reimbursement and looking forward maybe what hurdles remain.","And then for Ludwig or Paul, you guys have done quite a bit of BD to expand the pipeline. Do you feel like you're at capacity now meaning, is the pace going forward expected to slow down, or are there still more deals to do? Thank you.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Geoff. It's Brian. Good morning. I'll start. So with MG and, obviously, as we talked about on the call, we're really excited about the progress in the U.S. Outside to your question, we're still looking for more in Germany and Japan, and we have recently made some changes in our approach to essentially better leverage the learnings that we've had, the progress that we've made in the U.S.","The changes predominantly include adjustments to our sales education, the initiatives that are more effective at explaining the role of complemented physicians, as well as I would say broader and more effective KOL engagements. And we'll look to continue on that journey ahead.","We also, by the way, now have approval for MG in Canada, and so that's also now becoming a part of our geographic footprint for gMG. And the benefit of all this is, of course, such strong momentum in the U.S., we can amortize those learnings around the world.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Geoff, I'll take the second part of the question on business development. Short answer is no. We don't think we're at capacity. We want to press on. I think what you had seen in terms of \u2013 there was a lot of questions like, what are you trying to do on BD at the beginning of the year. I think what you've seen now through, call it, ten months of the year is exactly what we set out to achieve: rebuild the pipeline, clinical-stage assets, manageable deployment of capital with what we hope to have meaningfully strong returns for shareholders, all in the category of rare disease and transformative-type therapies.","So we've got a couple of those that, kind of, tilted towards the research stage. We may be at capacity on the research stage. That one, probably we raised the bar. But with respect to trying to bring in more clinical stage assets, we will press on.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, we will keep a disciplined approach on BD. Awesome job so far.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Geoff.","Operator","And our next question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Joshua Schimmer - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm just curious over what period of time do you expect the ALXN1210 trial patients to shift from the $90 million to $100 million unfavorable to favorable? And do you expect that whole amount to be converted?","And given that you'll have ALXN1210 data in PNH and HUS, do you expect that you might see off-label adoption in myasthenia gravis and NMO before those indications are added to the ALXN1210 label? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Josh, let me try to take both of those. On the ALXN1210 patient conversion, I would characterize that as we move into 2019 not a headwind but not a tailwind yet, just because of the nature of where those patients were, kind of, coupled with where we expect to have launches and reimbursement.","Remember, MG-301 was disproportionately Asia Pacific, MG-302 disproportionately Europe. Those are going to be a little bit staged. The other dynamic just that we're trying to keep a close watch on is competitive impact of \u2013 kind of \u2013 into the kind of commercial. So competitors moving into trials, which I think it's just going to be harder. It's been harder to predict this year. It will be harder to predict. But we're just going to try to be cognizant of that.","As it relates to the second part of your question, we are focused on on-label promotion for Ultomiris moving into PNH. That is critical for \u2013 and particularly with the backdrop of where we've come. Compliance in culture is a critical part of where we are as a company, and that will kind of be \u2013 will guide all of our behaviors there.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, I think all of you know from last year that I'm very passionate about compliance and this is front and center at Alexion, and we have high standards for our marketing and sales practices. So, we will wait until we get the regulatory approval and the label before we get going on any discussions on the new indications.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, I'll just add. We do anticipate approval in PNH in 2019, followed by aHUS in 2020. And as we said, we're going to be initiating a Phase 3 trial in MG with ALXN1210, and we're in the process now with a positive readout from NMO evaluating our neurology strategy and our potential beyond those that we've disclosed currently.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Citi. Your line is open.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you. And again, congrats on the progress. Just a couple of questions with patient dynamics, both on MG and the PNH side. So for MG, we're going to get competitor data in earlier stage MG with an injectable that may be priced cheaper later this year in Phase 2 (38:15). And I'm just trying to understand a little bit the dynamics. How \u2013 for MG you've launched (38:21) for a year, do you think patients will want to get a complement drug earlier stage in the disease, maybe in front of even (38:29) FcRn or an IVIg. What do you think the dynamics are for MG for an injectable versus an infusion?","And then for PNH, for switching, Neurotech (38:38) indicates that some patients might be reluctant to switch because they had such a horrible (38:43) event. And how do you help patients get over that hurdle or concern when they're switching onto a new therapy? Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Robin. I'll take both of those. On MG, I think we have to remind ourselves where we are in terms of both the size of the population and where we are in our launch progress. And then we can have a little discussion on method of infusion or injectable.","So the total population, as you know, is 60,000 to 80,000 patients in the U.S., and if we just take the kind of extreme end of that, the out-of-option patients that align with the REGAIN criteria, that's about 5% to 10%. So we've always talked about 3,000 to 8,000, and what we talked about this morning is we have 560 patients on therapy, which we're really pleased about and I'm especially proud of the team that's behind those numbers. But that's also a pretty healthy reminder about how much more work is to be done and how large a space this is for potentially a number of different therapeutic options which is also why we continue to look at neurology as a really important area of interest for us.","As it relates to method of delivery for the products, the patients that we're focused on right now are again generally out-of-option patients and all the signals that we hear are very encouraging. We're talking about Soliris Q2 week infusion, and I can tell you when I spend time in the field talking with, whether it's our commercial teams or the customers themselves, the physicians, the feedback is really strong on what patients are reporting back.","The other aspect is that these are patients that are generally quite disabled. They have extreme fatigue and weakness as you know. And so just to have not the burden of having to self-inject is one aspect that we take into consideration. And the other one is from a payer dynamic, once you move into the subcutaneous world, particularly in this population you're talking about, Part D on the Medicare side, and that comes with a co-pay. So we'll look at all of those elements as we look at optionality for patients.","On the second part of your question for PNH, all I can say right now is that we think the most important thing for these PNH patients is that the options are based on Soliris and that's why we're encouraged by the progress we continue to make with Soliris in our base business, both PNH and aHUS. And the profile that we have with Ultomiris gives us a very strong platform, and we know, as I had said in my comments, that there is very strong patient preference for a once every eight-week IV formulation. So we feel confident about our facilitated conversion opportunity.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And, Brian, with respect to MG, we also see lower DC rates.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, so far the discontinuations as we've talked about now on a few calls, has tracked well below what we saw in the REGAIN patient population. And in that pivotal study, the discontinuation rates at 12 weeks was around 40% and we've been below that line, which is another signal about the performance of the product.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the guidance, I think, Paul, see you guys raised full year 2018 guidance, but that number infers sort of flattish Q4 revenue sort of quarter-on-quarter. But you highlighted in the Q3 report order timing headwinds, et cetera. So, I guess, one would assume that potentially could be made up in Q4. So first of all, is that assumption wrong? And if not, is there something else that might hold Q4 revenue back like FX?","And then maybe if I can slide in a quick question on the Dicerna deal, a key RNAi player has already had relatively well documented setbacks, specifically with respect to knocking down enough C5. With this deal, you must believe there's a solid path here I guess with RNAi. Can you maybe talk about what you think makes Dicerna different? Or is there perhaps another non-C5 target that makes more sense? Any color there would be great. Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Let me just kind of clarify the revenue sequentially kind of dynamics. The July 4 holiday effectively increased dynamics \u2013 effectively increased Q2, depressed Q3. So as we move into Q4, I think we're behind those dynamics, and it's pretty straight forward at that point in time.","John, I'll turn it to you for the Dicerna...","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. So first of all, C5 is not one of the targets we're looking to prosecute with the Dicerna deal. We believe that we've addressed the C5 inhibition with Soliris. We've raised the bar with Ultomiris in PNH and we'll look for the data with aHUS. Rather we're using this technology platform which is proprietary to Dicerna to pursue additional targets in the complement cascade that will allow us to expand the potential number of indications that are complement mediated. This technology is designed to silence gene expression and inhibit translation of MRNA for key proteins that maybe mediating disease. And with their GalXC technology platform they're targeting liver production of various complement factors.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your line is open.","Paul Matteis - Stifel Financial Corp.","Great. Thanks so much. Just a follow-up on that RNAi question. I wanted to just even delve deeper and understand why you think RNAi is a potentially better or a good approach relative to antibodies and complement disease given that the Soliris data in PNH looked much better than the Alnylam data for ALN-CC5 (45:10).","And then just separately on FcRn, I wonder if you wouldn't mind commenting on kind of the developing competitive landscape there with Momenta's updates in their early safety data and how you're kind of refining your view on where the Syntimmune compound fits in. Thanks so much.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So for the first question, we believe the technology has been de-risked by the fact that they have already demonstrated proof of concept in primary hyperoxaluria and as you know Alnylam does have an approved product, the first approved product with RNAi technology. We are targeting other upstream complement cascade factors, and we will be pursuing indications that go beyond the current footprint.","So we're not focused as much on PNH as other complement-mediated diseases, whereby factors that are primarily produced in the liver are potential attractive targets. And this is all about shots on goal. It's about optionality and it doesn't mean that necessarily this is better than an antibody based approach but depending on the target, we may pursue it. It supplements our own internal discovery efforts where we're pursuing multiple internal programs with complement based targets, and we think this is a great strategic fit for us from the research perspective.","With regard to Momenta, what I can say is that the Syntimmune molecule and all of the FcRn molecules are not appreciably differentiated at this stage. They all have the same mechanism. They all reduce IgG in dose-dependent fashion. They all share an adverse event profile characterized by headaches which are for the SYTN001 molecule is mild to moderate. And they have specificity to some degree for FcRn and IgG reduction.","The Momenta data shows that there is some reduction in albumin. We do not see a reduction in albumin, so we are specific for IgG that's been shown, and we're pursuing three programs right now. One Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, it is designed to optimize the dose to help us select an appropriate dose for Phase 3 next year, as well as a Phase 1b\/2a study in pemphigus and another in WAIHA, again, which will inform our execution of a Phase 3 program in WAIHA and another Phase 3 study in a different indication next year.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","It's a class of drugs that potentially could transform the Ig treatment landscape over the next few years. And as you know, IVIg is widely used in autoimmune disorders. WAIHA is our lead indication, but the way that we think about this is we have a pipeline opportunity in the product, and it's a technology platform, and the addressable market opportunity is huge. So at this stage, we're the only one in the WAIHA space. We're very pleased with that and hopefully we can move to Phase 3 next year. And this is a unique opportunity for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A question for Brian. Brian, you mentioned that you've already started to work with payers on ALXN1210 in advance of the launch. Can you talk about what you've been doing with them? And in particular, I'm curious whether you think reimbursement's going to be gating to the conversion from Soliris. Do you expect there to be immediate access to reimbursement? Or will it take some time for access to develop? Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Phil. We have been engaging with payers very actively since we now have the profile of the product itself. I'd say that, generally, we feel really good about the fact that we have two very large distinct studies with all 11 of the primary and secondary endpoints all moving the same direction. That creates a strong value proposition for payers. And then, the second part in addition to the data is to begin discussions around what the totality of both direct and indirect cost savings could look like.","So we haven't locked in on any specific pricing discussions. Of course, it's too early for that. But the feedback that we have had so far is that we feel good about our abilities to engage with those payers and to get the kind of access that, we believe, is needed to have the facilitated conversion that we want to be on the pathway to eventually make Ultomiris the new standard-of-care for PNH. So more to come as we continue to engage, but so far, it's been promising feedback.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Was just wondering on NMO front if you can talk about your views of the recent competitor data there. And then of the 4,000 to 5,000 patients on treatment that you cited on the slides, do you have a sense of how many of those might have previously received Rituxan? Thanks.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Terence. This is John. So first of all, I'll just say that we're really pleased with the outstanding results we have from our Phase 3 program. I think they're very definitive, and this is a patient population that has significant disability. No approved therapies currently. And with these data that show 94% reduction in adjudicated relapse and a 95% reduction in annualized relapse rate with an absolute rate of 0.02, we think it has potential to be first-in-class and best-in-class.","We're the first approved therapy for NMO. So I think that there is opportunity here in the NMOSD space for multiple therapies, and the IST use in our population was about 75% of patients that had concomitant IST use. About 32% of them had prior use of rituximab within three months of the study's start.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And Terence \u2013 this is Brian. Maybe I'll jump in and just add that the difference between NMOSD and gMG, of course, is as John noted the relapses themselves are terrifying. They're unpredictable. They have potentially devastating consequences, where patients without any warning can have blindedness (51:54), can have some form of paralysis, or both. And so the heavy emphasis and we're so grateful for the data, of course, will be on making sure that the goal will be to get to a no-relapse state. And even small differences, as data continues to play out, can be really significant for these patients and for clinicians, who have had quite literally in this case no approved therapeutic options.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","The objective should be for those patients to live in the relapse-free world. And I think we \u2013 the PREVENT study came very close to that. And I think that's the bar that's out there for NMOSD treatment. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Laura Chico from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","We can't hear you.","Operator","Please check that your line is not on mute.","Laura Chico - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Sorry about that. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick housekeeping questions for you. On ALXN1210 in aHUS, we noticed one of the child adolescent studies was expanded to encompass some switch subjects. I'm just kind of curious if you can comment on how that might affect the labeling implications.","And then secondarily, I just wanted to clarify on the Phase 3 study in MG, has the start timing changed? I'm noticing in the deck that it's got a first half 2019 start timing. I'm just wondering if you could add any additional clarity perhaps on design attributes and, kind of, how that all might come together to potentially affect timing for launch there. Thanks.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Laura. If you come in on mute, you should only have one question.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So with regard to the AL study, the pediatric study, yes, was we added some switch patients based on interactions with the regulatory authorities. But it will not have an impact on our plans to file with the adult study, which will readout in first quarter of 2019 followed by subsequent submissions to regulatory authorities which are being gated by the action dates for PNH in the EU and the U.S. With regard to the...","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","ALXN1210 MG timing.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","The MG timing, yeah, so initially we had a target to start at the end of this year but with the availability of the great results from NMO as well as the Syntimmune deal, we took a step back to evaluate our \u2013 re-evaluate our neurology strategy as we look at the opportunities before us, and we've recommitted our effort to proceed with a ALXN1210 MG trial that will begin in the first quarter of 2019.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, we will take two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one for Paul. When you mentioned the pricing assumptions for the updated guidance for 2018, there's a 3% headwind there. So besides the Brazil and also Turkey reimbursement agreement, can you talk about what happens with the pricing ex-U.S. especially in Europe, and what is your outlook for 2019 on pricing in general?","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, good question, Ying. Thanks for it. I'll hold off on 2019 because we're kind of getting into guidance as well. But like we kind of the \u2013 really the only meaningful change versus kind of what we thought in previous guidance and coming into the year in terms of the business plan is the dynamics in Turkey, which we pointed out on the call. That's what drove Turkey and Brazil, that's what drove it this quarter, that's what kind of changes the full year dynamics a little bit different.","It was a formalized agreement subsequent to marketing authorization in both those countries. We had expected it. I think even going back a year ago, I think I had pointed out that what we felt in terms of rest of world wouldn't be the growth trajectory that we had experienced over the last handful of years going forward. Still important parts of the business, but as we moved into a formalized reimbursement agreement, it's changed. The strength of the business is United States, Asia Pac, solid performance in Europe.","(56:39)","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Anupam Rama from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just quick one on Strensiq, outside of unfavorable order timing, were there any other headwinds to note? The quarter over quarter growth seems like a decline even if you back out the unfavorable order in 2Q. And then what's assumed in sort of that approaching $500 million? Is it increased penetration in the seven countries that you're in for Strensiq or additional geographic expansion as well? Thanks so much.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, I think Brian and I will tag team this. Anupam, thanks for the question. No, nothing meaningfully different in terms of trends, I think you've got to back it out of Q2, put it into Q3. It's one of those type of dynamics. So on a sequential basis when doing that, we still kind of see sequential growth. Brian?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Anupam I'll just add. I mean, again I'm really proud of the Metabolics team behind this product, and what you have here is strong underlying demand growth. Paul talked about the volume increases of 37%. It's an ultra-rare disease, so there is variability on both patient identification and at times too sometimes genetic testing is required. So there could be a lag effect on patients' onboarding to therapy.","But generally, we feel really good about the continued progress we're making. And it's always a two-parter. It is about continued progress on that end in the U.S. and then geographic expansion. As you noted, we're pleased that we're now available and reimbursed in seven countries around the world.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So thanks, everybody. So we'll end the call here. And I'm going to say the obvious that I'm very proud of the Alexion team and everything the team has achieved this year. We're growing our base business. We're delivering on our ambition of making gMG the best Soliris launch. We're advancing towards the Ultomiris launch. We're rebuilding our pipeline internally and through business development. We're delivering on our financial ambitions. So we're basically executing on all the five objectives that we laid out at the beginning of 2018. So a big thank you to the entire Alexion team for an awesome job.","So we'll keep you posted on the progress that we're very pleased with what we've done so far. So thanks for calling in. Enjoy the rest of your day, and we'll talk soon. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

And for opening remarks and introduction, I'd now like to turn the call over to Elena Ridloff, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Elena H. Ridloff - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the first quarter of 2016 and our plans for the full year. Today's call will be led by David Hallal, our CEO. David will start the call with an overview of our global performance, and be joined by Vikas Sinha, our Chief Financial Officer; Carsten Thiel, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Martin MacKay, our Global Head of R&D. Also with us today is Julie O'Neill, our Global Head of Operations.","You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website. Before we begin, I will refer you to slide 3. We will be making forward-looking statements all which involve certain assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.","A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filings with the SEC and our subsequent SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements apply only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after this call.

A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release. Thank you. David?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Elena. In Q1, the Alexion team extended our global leadership in rare diseases and made significant progress on a number of priorities as we continue to provide life-transforming-therapies to more patients with rare and devastating disorders.","During the quarter, we achieved many commercial and R&D milestones. First, we grew our core Soliris business, largely driven by a steady number of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Second, we progressed the Strensiq launch in initial countries with the strong addition of new patients. Third, we commenced the U.S. launch of Kanuma, and began to serve initial patients with LAL-D. And fourth, we advanced our robust rare disease pipeline including, exceeding target enrollment with more than 30 patients dosed in two initial studies of ALXN1210 in patients with PNH, commencing the planned dose escalation for SBC-103, as six-month data showed the potential for an IV therapy to cross the blood brain barrier for patients with MPS IIIB, and progressing three registration studies of eculizumab with MG data expected mid-year, DGF data expected in the second half of 2016, and the NMO trial on track to complete enrollment this year.","Looking at Soliris in Q1, we grew our core business by serving a consistently high number of new patients with PNH and aHUS in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the territories where we have been operating the longest. This was offset by increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin American countries, primarily in Brazil and Argentina. Despite the weakness in Latin America, we continue to see the majority of growth ahead of us, for both PNH and aHUS across our 50-country operating platform.","Looking more closely at PNH in Q1, globally, we identified and served a high number of newly diagnosed patients by executing our PNH diagnostic initiatives with urgency. Given that one-third of untreated patients with PNH will die within five years, we aim to deliver the life transforming benefits of Soliris to more patients in 2016 and beyond.","Our experience affirms our view that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis let alone commence appropriate treatment. In aHUS, in Q1, we once again served a consistent number of new patients who presented with complement-mediated TMA. Matched for time, now 18 quarters from their respective approvals in the U.S., there are more patient actively receiving Soliris for aHUS than there had been for PNH. And we continue to see the same trends in Europe, supporting our view that the opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH.","Turning now to Strensiq, we are very pleased with our performance in Q1 as we served a growing number of new patients in the U.S., Germany, and Japan, driven by our highly successful HPP disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives, which have been underway for more than three years. Also in the quarter, we continued to have success early in the launch in identifying both newly and previously diagnosed patients with HPP.","As we continue to apply our expertise, we are confident that our work with the medical community will enable physicians to make a more rapid and accurate diagnosis and better informed treatment decisions for a growing number of patients with HPP over time.","Now looking at Kanuma, we commenced the U.S. launch in early Q1, and are now making progress serving initial patients with LAL-D in both the U.S. and Germany. In order to reach more children with LAL-D faster, we are educating pediatric specialists, and have enhanced our diagnostic pathway to aid patient identification and earlier treatment. While these improvements are leading to an increase in testing in appropriate patients, we are accelerating our efforts to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to a greater number of our target physicians.","Throughout 2016, we look forward to serving increasing number of new patients with HPP and LAL-D in the U.S., Germany, and Japan while we progress our country-by-country funding processes throughout Europe. Carsten will provide more color on the launches later in the call.","Looking ahead for the year, we have multiple R&D milestones including several highlights from our ALXN1210 program including additional data in PNH and the initiation of an aHUS clinical program. Data from the registration trials of eculizumab in MG and DGF, completion of enrolment in the NMO registration trial, and continued development of SBC-103 with a planned dose escalation in our Phase 1\/2 study in MPS IIIB. We look forward to providing updates on our robust pipeline, which we expect to deliver up to six additional product or indication approvals through 2018.","Looking at our financial performance for the quarter, we achieved total revenues of $701 million, a 24% increase in volume compared to the year-ago quarter. Our revenue was negatively impacted by 5% or $30 million in currency headwinds, net of hedges in Q1, over the year-ago quarter. We also achieved non-GAAP EPS of $1.11 per diluted share.","Turning briefly to our 2016 guidance, we expect total revenues to be at the low end of our previously guided range of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, primarily due to increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, partially offset by early strength of the Strensiq launch and the strengthening of foreign currencies versus our previous expectations. We also expect 2016 non-GAAP EPS to be at the low end of the previously guided range of $5.00 to $5.20 per diluted share.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our financial performance. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, David. In Q1, total revenues increased to $701 million. This 17% revenue growth was driven by a 24% increase in volume, negatively impacted by 5% or $30 million in currency headwinds compared to the year-ago quarter.","Soliris revenues were $665 million in Q1. While growth in our core territories remained strong, Soliris revenue growth was impacted mainly by three factors: increasing macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, resulting in an impact to new patient starts and treatment interruptions, primarily in Brazil and Argentina; currency headwinds; and our usual seasonality that we see every year as we move from Q4 to Q1. Year-over-year, Soliris volume growth was 18%, and was driven by continued growth in PNH and aHUS.","Turning to our metabolic therapies, we are very pleased to report Strensiq revenues of $33 million as we progress our initial launches in the U.S., Germany and Japan. In addition, we achieved Kanuma revenues of $2.5 million in our first quarter of the U.S. launch. During the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.11 per diluted share.","Looking at our balance sheet and capital allocation, we ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.3 billion in debt. In Q1, we purchased 2 million shares, and have approximately $460 million remaining in our share repurchase program.","Our strong financial position and future cash flows provide us with financial flexibility to support our long-term capital allocation strategy, which includes: investing in the core Soliris business, and our Strensiq and Kanuma launches; advancing our robust pipeline; taking advantage of external opportunities; and repurchasing stock opportunistically.","Turning to our 2016 guidance, we expect total revenues to be at the low end of our previously guided range of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion. Soliris revenues will be in the range $2.835 billion to $2.875 billion. While we continue to see growth in our core territories and expect to benefit from strengthening foreign currencies, we expect Soliris revenue growth in 2016 to continue to be negatively impacted by increased macroeconomic weakness in Latin America.","At this point, we are expecting to see continued weakness in the region for the remainder of the year. Latin America accounts for approximately 10% of Soliris revenues, and our updated Soliris guidance reflects our forecast that approximately 20% to 30% of our Latin American revenues are at risk in 2016.","In addition, we are now forecasting total metabolic revenues to be above our previous expectations and are guiding to a range of $180 million to $200 million, due to the early strength we are seeing in the Strensiq launch.","Looking at our expenses, we are guiding to the high-end of the range primarily due to three factors: investing in key programs in our robust pipeline; advancing the global commercial launches of Strensiq and Kanuma; and the strengthening of foreign currencies. As a result, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be at the low-end of our previously guided range of $5 to $5.20. For other elements of our 2016 guidance, I'll refer you to our press release that we issued this morning.","Turning briefly to Q2 guidance, revenues are expected to be in the range of $735 million to $745 million, which includes $20 million to $25 million negative FX impact year-over-year. As a reminder, as in prior years, Q2 expenses will be higher than Q1. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.12 to $1.17.","Looking beyond 2016, we will accelerate EPS driven by the continued growth of Soliris and PNH and aHUS by serving an increasing number of patients with Strensiq and Kanuma, and by expanding our operating margins to 48% to 49% in 2018.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Carsten for a look at our commercial operations. Carsten?","Carsten Thiel - Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer","Thank you, Vikas. In Q1, our global commercial operations delivered 18% volume growth year-over-year for Soliris, progressed the Strensiq launch in initial countries with a strong addition of new patients and commenced the U.S. launch of Kanuma.","Starting with Soliris, we grew our core business driven by a consistently high number of new patients treated in the U.S., Europe, and Japan offset by macroeconomic weakness in Latin America, impacting new patients starts and causing treatment interruptions in the region. Despite this weakness in Latin America, we are pleased with our progress on a global basis.","In PNH, in Q1, as in prior years, we consistently identified a high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH and we continue to see that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. In aHUS, we also continue to observe a consistent number of new patients commencing Soliris treatment. Given that the incidents of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we continue to expect that over time our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS will be larger than that of PNH.","As we aim to reach more patients with aHUS, we are focused on three key initiatives. First, increasing the number of patients with TMA tested for aHUS. Second, helping a higher proportion of diagnosed patients receive the benefits of Soliris as first line treatment. And third, enabling more physicians to better understand the genetic lifelong nature of aHUS. During the quarter, we continued to identify a consistently high number of patients with PNH and aHUS across our 50-country operating platform, and we continued to see the majority of our opportunity in both diseases in front of us.","Now, I'd like to turn to our initial country launches of our two highly innovative, newly approved enzyme replacement therapies. Starting with Strensiq, in the U.S., in Q1, we are very pleased with the early stages of launch. Our revenues in the quarter benefited from identification of patients prior to approval, clinical trial patient transitions, and our long-term disease education efforts which have been focused on the morbidities and high mortality of HPP.","In Q2 and beyond, we will create greater awareness through our disease and diagnostic initiatives which are helping physicians identify the appropriate patients to test for HPP. Today, physicians are increasingly recognizing the role of Strensiq in treating the underlying cause of the disease by replacing the missing vital enzyme, and payers are recognizing the value of Strensiq based on the compelling clinical benefits included in the label.","A growing body of medical evidence continues to enhance our understanding of HPP. Importantly, new longer-term data presented at ENDO, this month, showed sustained improvements and survival rates, bone healing, respiratory support, and growth and mobility in children with HPP with ongoing Strensiq treatment. As the U.S. launch of Strensiq progresses, we are also applying key learnings to the other initial launch countries of Germany and Japan, where we're also serving patients with HPP.","Turning now to Kanuma. We commenced the launch in the U.S. in January and are now serving initial patients as we apply our deep expertise in ultra-rare diseases to serve the LAL-D community. To support our launch, we are deploying disease education programs and more targeted diagnostic initiatives. These efforts are helping pediatric specialists better understand which children are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D and the importance for early diagnosis.","This is critical as the median age of disease onset is 5.8 years, and 50% of non-infants progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, or liver failure within just three years. With our diagnostic and disease education programs under way, we are observing both interest and receptivity, and an increase in testing rates in children with liver and lipid abnormalities. We expect these programs, directed at pediatric specialists, to help accelerate the diagnosis of children with LAL-D over time.","While our field teams are educating physicians to increase testing in appropriate patients, we continue to accelerate our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives to drive more testing with a greater number of our target physicians. Our efforts are further supported by the growing body of medical evidence for Kanuma. At the WORLDSymposium meeting in March, new two-year data in infants with rapidly progressing LAL-D, who were treated with Kanuma, demonstrated a substantial survival benefit to beyond two years of age. As we continue with our global disease education efforts, these data underscore the importance of early diagnosis of patients with LAL-D. We were also pleased in Q1 to receive marketing authorization for Kanuma in Japan and expect to serve initial patients in Japan in Q3.","Turning to the timing of additional country launches for Strensiq and Kanuma. We have initiated the funding processes with healthcare authorities in other major European countries for both products. We expect to start serving patients in initial countries outside of Germany in the second half of this year, with additional countries to follow in 2017. Strensiq and Kanuma have broad and strong labels, and we anticipate access to expand as the transformative clinical benefits for the small number of patients with HPP and LAL-D are recognized.","Now, I will turn the call over to Martin who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?","Martin MacKay - Executive VP, Global Head-Research & Development","Thank you, Carsten. In Q1, we continued to advance the most robust rare disease pipeline in the industry which includes 10 clinical programs and 30 pre-clinical programs, with at least four moving into the clinic in 2016.","Starting with eculizumab, our three ongoing registration trials continue to progress as planned. In neurology, we expect to have data in refractory myasthenia gravis midyear. In kidney transplant, we expect data from our delayed graft function registration trial in the second half of this year, and we are on track to complete enrollment in the relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder trial this year.","In addition to Soliris, we have eight complement inhibitors that we are developing with urgency. Our lead program, ALXN1210, a longer acting C5 antibody that has a half life nearly three times that of Soliris has shown rapid, sustained and complete inhibition of free C5. We have two ongoing clinical studies to evaluate LDH reduction and safety in patients with PNH receiving ALXN1210. In these two studies, we are evaluating monthly and even longer dosing intervals, and have exceeded target enrollment with more than 30 patients dosed.","We expect data to be presented mid-year from our Phase 1\/2 study and continue to target an approval for ALXN1210 in PNH in 2018. We will also be initiating a clinical program with ALXN1210 in patients with atypical aHUS later this year.","Turing to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody targeting C5a, we progressed our Phase 2 study in patients with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease or GI-GVHD, a severe and life-threatening rare auto-immune disease.","In Q4, we shared interim data, which showed a 28-day overall response rate of 80%, and a 28-day complete response rate of 70% compared to historical response rate of 56% and 49%, respectively. The interim data support the continued advancement of ALXN1007, including their evaluation of higher doses in additional patients with GI-GVHD.","Moving to our cPMP replacement therapy for patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency or MoCD Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting newborns. We have initiated a pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ALXN1101 in neonates with MoCD Type A and we look forward to progressing this registration study in 2016.","Turning now to SBC-103. SBC-103 is a recombinant form of the NAGLU enzyme, produced with our unique and proprietary protein expression platform, which is administered intravenously for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB or MPS IIIB. This is a rare devastating disorder characterized by CNS and systemic accumulation of heparan sulfate due to a genetic deficiency in the NAGLU enzyme. At the WORLDSymposium in March, the six-month results for patients in the Phase 1\/2 study showed continued improvements in the heparan sulfate cerebrospinal fluid reductions, with a mean reduction of 26% in the 3 milligram per kilogram dose.","The 24-week results coupled with the increased dose response observed in preclinical studies, support dose escalation for all patients in the study. We are now in the process of randomizing all patients to either a 5 milligram per kilogram or 10 milligram per kilogram dose. We are encouraged that SBC-103 has the potential to provide both systemic and CNS clinical benefits due to blood brain barrier penetration and look forward to updating you on the results from the dose escalation phase of the study.","The interim data for SBC-103 provide evidence that our unique and proprietary protein expression platform could enable other enzyme-replacement therapies to cross the blood brain barrier, opening up a large set of potential treatment options for patients. We have initiated preclinical research initiatives in other lysosomal storage diseases with CNS morbidities, and are prioritizing development of novel ERTs against these disease targets by evaluating the severity of patient CNS symptoms, applicability of technology for CNS transport for each disease, and the potential to provide a transformative benefit to patients.","I look forward to providing updates on our progress with our platform in future calls. We are excited about the multiple milestones and our expanding pipeline and are driving toward as many as six additional product or indication approvals through 2018.","I will now turn the call back to David. David?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Martin. During the quarter, the Alexion team continued to strengthen our global leadership in rare diseases, and we served more patients across our global operating platform. 2016 is shaping up to be another transformative year as we grow our Soliris business, execute on the Strensiq and Kanuma launches, and advance the multiple milestones and our robust pipeline.","As always, we thank our talented employees for their dedication to our mission as we work to transform the lives of patients around the world, and we look forward to updating you throughout the year as we progress our ambitious commercial and R&D initiatives. Thank you.","Now, let's open the line for questions. Greg?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Of course, sir. We'll now turn to the question-and-answer portion of our call. Our first question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Vikas and David, I just wanted to drive down a little bit more into the Latin American impact in Q1. Could you qualify what that was on a year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter basis? And when you talk about steady patient adds outside of Latin America, in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, can you give us sort of a volume growth rate in that non-Latin American business, and tell us how consistent that's been?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So as we said during the call, Eric, we served a steady number of new patients in the U.S., Europe and Japan with Soliris. It's consistent with what we've seen over the year since launching PNH and aHUS in those countries. In Q1, the revenue growth in LatAm was clearly affected by increased macroeconomic weakness, and the new patient starts and treatment interruptions impacted us primarily in Brazil and Argentina. And actually the weakness expanded geographically versus the fourth quarter where we saw weakness primarily in Brazil only.","Vikas can kind of talk you through the impact of LatAm across our entire business and how we see that impact not only in the quarter, Q1, but moving forward.","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Eric, if I look at 2016 in a full year perspective, we guided towards the lower end of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, which is actually, if you look at it in terms of percentage growth year-over-year, that turns out to become 17% at the lower end, right. There's couple of factors that \u2013 three factors, I would say, impact us year-over-year. Obviously two you already knew from the beginning, which is FX, which was previously we were talking about $120 million; now it's down to \u2013 we're expecting somewhere closer to $80 million. Approximately, it works out around a couple of percent impact because of that. And then you have \u2013 we also guided this year about price impact coming around 2%, 3%. And then LatAm would be another 2%, 3%, right. So these are the three things that takes the overall growth, which is -- 17%, if I adjust it to all of these things, more closer to the 23%, 24% level. So Soliris on that, if I take the Soliris, and not do the new drugs, then it will probably be around 18%, 19% levels.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","18%.","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On a volume growth. On a volume growth.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, I got you. And can you tell \u2013 okay. I got it. And can you tell us what the impact was in Q1 specifically from LatAm?","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So if you \u2013 Q1 specifically, if you look at year-over-year, that is a 2% to 3%, as we have said, it's probably will be at the same range.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And just one, maybe quick one, is the ALXN1210 recruitment that seems to be going quite well, is that hurting you on Soliris in other geographies?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So Eric, yeah, as we said, we've now enrolled more than 30 patients in the ALXN1210 program. But the way that we look at it, we're clearly recruiting patients in countries in which we operate. But as I've said, we continue to see that the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone commence appropriate treatment.","So as we look to recruit, we continue to see a steady addition of new patients across our platform with commercial Soliris. And we continue to focus, frankly, on both initiatives exclusively, right. We're looking to develop the program as rapidly as possible. That's what Martin and his team is doing. And Carsten and the team continue to identify a steady number of new patients with PNH, and we see them commence treatment. And that is \u2013 obviously, outside of LatAm, we are pleased to continue to see that happening in a steady way.","Operator","All right. And moving on. From JPMorgan, we have Anupam Rama.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe a quick one for Vikas. How should we be thinking about the R&D spend long term with the guidance being moved towards the higher end of the 2016 range? Should we still be thinking about that 18% to 19% level for the 2018-plus timeframe outlined at the R&D Day? Thanks.","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Anupam, there are two parts to that question. This year we are guiding towards the upper end, and the longer-term, whether we get down to 18%, 19%. The reason why I wanted to highlight the fact that R&D would be at the upper end is, in both SG&A and R&D is, when we get a benefit of FX on the top-line, our expenses are un-hedged, and it actually gives us additional expenses because of FX, when you convert it into U.S. dollar, the local currencies, right? So that's why it's moving up towards the upper end. We are, this year, closer to 20%, 23% levels. Well, we definitely are looking at getting down to 18%, 19% level by 2018. That is our objective.","Operator","All right. Next up, we have Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. Thanks for all your transparency. First question maybe for Vikas. You are reaffirming your guidance for 2016. So has that low-end of the range captured the worst case in LatAm? For example, we potentially could have a new government in Brazil, so what could that impact your revenue in Soliris?","And then I have one maybe for Martin. So for SBC-103, how much do you think we need to see in terms of CSF level reduction for heparan sulfate in order to make an impact in the function from the patients? Thank you.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Vikas?","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, thank you. Thank you, Ying. So, the question is did we \u2013 have we gotten to the bottom of the Latin American issues? So we see two risks right now. One in Brazil and one in Argentina. Argentina is really driven by the budgetary issues because they had a major devaluation going into this year, and there's an adjustment required, right? And on the Brazil side, it's more the political instability in the country, that's what we see. And to the best of our knowledge, today, what we have done is looked at the risk profile with taking no patient additions there, and taking some business interruption in the existing patient, treatment interruption to existing patients, and taken a view that out of the 10% total sales that we have exposed towards Latin America, 20% to 30% of that sales, or 2% to 3% of our total global sales will be exposed there.","At this stage, I feel good about it that ranges between $60 million to $90 million, which we have factored into our guidance. Now, so, as we go forward, I think we'll give you more color how these things change, but clearly some of the political issues are well beyond Alexion's ability to forecast.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Martin?","Martin MacKay - Executive VP, Global Head-Research & Development","Yeah. Thank you, David, and thanks for the question, Ying. The quick answer to your question is we don't know. But as just a reminder of what we've seen today, the 3 milligram per kilogram dose and the first data that we showed, we saw 11% reduction in heparan sulfate in the CSF. And then, at the six-month level, which we presented more recently, we saw the 26% reduction over that time period. In addition, these were tracking towards what we saw pre-clinically, and both the preclinical data and the clinical data, now point towards moving to higher doses. And as we said on the call, we're now randomizing the patients in the study to both the 5 milligram\/kilogram and 10 milligram\/kilogram doses. That will give us a real strong clue as to the dose response that we see in the higher doses. And of course in parallel, we will be looking at brain structure and neurocognitive development, which then begins to ask the very good question that you asked. Hope that helps.","Operator","All right. And our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Raymond James.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question on the myasthenia gravis data that's coming up here. And I don't want to put the cart before the horse, because obviously we haven't seen the clinical data yet, but one dynamic that kind of intrigued us is that one would assume that the existing applicable patients are likely to be much more identifiable, assuming they are already under the care of a physician, if they're refractory sort of by definition. So assuming you have a filable dataset, would uptake here potentially be a bit steeper than what we've seen with PNH or aHUS, or is that kind of the wrong thinking and should we be looking at this as something that follow a similar trajectory? Thanks.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Chris. I've addressed this in the past, and of course, as you said, it is well before even seeing data, and whether or not we have a package for submission. But nonetheless, I do think the dynamics are slightly different. MG, in general, is a more common disease, and we are targeting the most severely affected patients, in which no unapproved support of care that is being used as making any meaningful improvements in the patients. And those were the ones that we enrolled in our trial. And so, given the fact that MG is different than the \u2013 we're looking at a patient population in an ultra rare disease range, but as you say, sort of the efforts to identify the patients are different here. And so I think that one could conclude the dynamics might be, perhaps, a little bit different than what we've experienced with PNH, aHUS, and here in the early of HPP and LAL-D. Nonetheless, still a small patient population affected by in extremely severe and devastating disease, and we will see. But of course, as you said, what's most important is we've got to see the data. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we have Geoff Porges with Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Vikas, I don't want to beat up on this Brazil issue too much, but to try and paraphrase what you said, and just correct me if this is a reasonable interpretation. It sounds as though, were it not for the disruptions in Latin America that your actual demand growth would have been something, I think, you said two to three percentage points higher than the 18%. And backing into numbers, it feels like it's about a $20 million year-over-year headwind. That you've now taken out of subsequent quarters as you've adjusted your guidance. And that's offset partly against Strensiq. Is that the right way to interpret it? And then could you just give us a little bit more color on the trajectory for Strensiq? Tremendous sequential growth from Q4 to Q1, are we just sort of beginning here in terms of recruiting and identifying new patients for treatment or is there some sort of bolus effect that we shouldn't be expecting to continue?","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Geoff. I think \u2013 glad that you asked this question. I think I was trying to address that with Eric earlier. So there's two ways to look at this, right? You look at \u2013 one way to look at this is Q1 2015 versus Q1 2016, and the other one is to look at it sequentially. I think there's a lot of confusion here. When you look at year-over-year, what we are seeing here is, the numbers what you are quoting is absolutely right, right. So, year-over-year we're going to have 2% to 3% revenue growth getting impacted by the Latin American new patients non-starts and treatment interruptions. So that's where we feel that the growth is getting hurt, right, on the volume side. You're absolutely right on that. And when we try to analyze that going into the full year, it's like 20 times 40, right? So, you get to like $60 million to $90 million range, which is absolutely correct.","Where I think there is some confusion, I feel \u2013 I'm just kind of feeling here is going from Q4 to Q1. And if you look back in the history, these two quarters have a little bit of, leaving all these issues out of LatAm or FX, we normally see a very flat quarters between Q4 to Q1, primarily because we see less number of days in Q1 compared to Q4. And it's \u2013 especially in Soliris, it tracks very closely to infusion days of the patients. And when you have less days, automatically that also puts into a spot. And as you know that every year, when you look at the holiday season from December to January, the infusion days do get 1, 2 days up or down delays. So that's why the reason of there is always very close to each other, that's what we see over the years.","Now, from that number, when you start seeing two issues are different this year is we had the revenue growth impact that we just talked about and FX impact from Q4 to Q1, we had a negative FX impact of approximately $6 million. So, if you put that in perspective, your numbers will totally tie-up. Did I answer your question before we go to...","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So non-Lat \u2013 so, Geoff non-LatAm would carry over in a straight level as it did last year, right?","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. That's very helpful. I appreciate it.","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, for Strensiq, then David, do you want to answer that?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Just \u2013 so, Geoff we're very pleased so far with what we are seeing in the early dynamics of the Strensiq launch. Carsten, maybe take us through the observations that we're currently seeing.","Carsten Thiel - Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. Thank you, David. So, remember Q1 is actually the first full quarter of Strensiq because it was approved in the U.S. in October. So let me share some insights of the early dynamics in the market so far. The uptake is really driven by patients.","And I'd like to point down three of them. First, we observed conversions from clinical trials to commercial supply. Secondly, we observed patients initiating treatment who were actually identified prior to approval. And then thirdly we are seeing the success of our long-term educational initiatives and diagnostic initiatives that leads physicians to test, diagnose and initiate treatment with Strensiq. And our focus is to continue on this trend and to serve more patients on Strensiq.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'll just say this, Geoff, it's early days. It's initial countries, as we said, U.S., Germany and Japan. But at the same time, as we said prelaunch, the majority of clinical trial patients for Strensiq were outside of the U.S., and so as we look at all these dynamics that Carsten just shared, we are extremely encouraged about our opportunity to serve patients, and also in the quarter just observing not only the benefit of patients identified with our long term disease awareness program for the prior three years, where we had identified patients prior to approval. But we're also seeing newly identified patients that are either newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed, all confirming a level of optimism about the opportunity to serve patients, not only in these initial countries but beyond.","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just one more thing, Geoff, is I'm probably missed out earlier in my statements. When you start comparing year-over-year, right, last year was \u2013 2015 was a very good year when it came to pricing because we got no price cuts last year. You can go back and look at our 10Ks. And we had guided this year, because normally, we get 2% to 3% price adjustment every year. And this year, we are looking at that 2% to 3% levels.","So we literally skipped a year last year. And when we file the 10-Q very soon, you will see that the price impact year-on-year is very, very close to 2%. So that is also a year-over-year comparison that when you look at the volume growth, you probably are not getting the equation correct.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Terrific. Thanks.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Geoff. Greg?","Operator","All right. Next from Morgan Stanley, we have Matthew Harrison.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Matt?","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry, can you hear me? Yes, I'm here.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. So I guess I have two parts. So first, just on the pipeline, maybe can you help us set expectations around what kind of data we should be expecting to see from ALXN1210, and what more work that you're going to need to do after you've got this initial data that we'll see midyear? And then second, just on MG, because I know someone else asked about this. But also can you just help remind us and frame how you see that opportunity commercially, and if you see or know of any off-label use already, and just how we should think about that opportunity commercially? Thank you.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Matt. So, regarding ALXN1210, Martin?","Martin MacKay - Executive VP, Global Head-Research & Development","Thank you, Matt. Yeah. In terms of the \u2013 as we said on the call, we've exceeded our target enrollment in both the Phase 1\/2 study and the Phase 2 study with now over 30 patients, PNH patients, enrolled. For the midyear results, which will be the Phase 1\/2 study, we'll present the monthly dosing data from that study.","The Phase 2 study is ongoing where we are looking at monthly and longer dosing intervals, and that will clearly lead in to our plans for a Phase 3 study to be started this year. And again, as a quick aside, as we mentioned on the call, atypical HUS we'll also start that study.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Because we've had a lot of questions, Matt, about what we would see, so as Martin was saying, ALXN1210 where we've enrolled patients into this multiple infusion interval Phase 2 study, right, with longer dosing cohorts. As we've talked about sort of data midyear, that will be the Q4 week dosing data that one would see, and then later one would see the results of intervals beyond that.","As it relates to MG, again, it's just as Chris was saying, it's a little early because one would want to see the data. I think the opportunity commercially as we see it, again, it's when you really get down to the refractory generalized myasthenia gravis patient population, it's a size that we sort of see as an ultra-rare disease population, much like we've observed with the PNH and aHUS, HPP, LAL-D. And I think as Chris was getting to it, there might be a slightly different dynamic in that the patients may already be diagnosed. And so, it may be a different approach that one might take and we might take. And we're thinking about that, clearly, but at the same time we're obviously first and foremost, we'll want to see the data.","Elena H. Ridloff - Vice President, Investor Relations","Next question please.","Operator","Next, from SunTrust Bank, we have Yatin Suneja.","Yatin Suneja - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter on Strensiq. So, maybe could you help us understand if there are any differences that you might be seeing in terms of patient mix or demand trends in the U.S., Germany, or Japan? And I know it's a bit early, but any updated understanding on the prevalence of this disease in these geographies?","And then a quick one for Vikas. I know you guys are getting some benefit from FX starting in Q2. And how should we think about 2017? I think in the past you guys have said $30 million to $40 million FX headwind. Maybe help us understand how should we think about it now that FX has improved?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure, Yatin. So, regarding Strensiq, I think what we've seen is, at least initially here, a strong addition of new patients that have commenced Strensiq treatment. And clearly, some of our early observations have been aided by the elements that Carsten covered.","I think if you look at the geographic differences, what we, at least, see early on is that in Japan, given what has been characterized as a lethal mutation for HPP in the Japanese population, there's perhaps at least our early observations is there perhaps might be less of a prevalent pool just because patients have not had anything that they could rely on, and most of the patients have deceased.","But nonetheless, we are identifying in Japan, clearly, some children and even adults with pediatric onset HPP. But that might be one of the geographic differences that we've observed thus far. Between the U.S. and Germany, we see very similar dynamics in terms of the perinatal-, infantile- and juvenile-onset population, all of which are at different ages. And so, we're going to continue to extend our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives. We're still going to be reaching out and looking to identify new patients quarter-over-quarter, and that is what the team has lined up and doing on a daily basis. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Yatin, thanks for asking the FX question. There's two parts to this question, right. One is what's the top-line impact, and what is, again, the bottom line impact, right?","On the top line front, as we had previously guided, $120 million would be the impact going from 2015 to 2016 in our FX because we are hedged 50% of the stuff. The view today we have is, based on today's current exchange rate, that number would be much closer to $80 million impact for the year. So we saw $30 million already included in Q1 2015 over 2016.","Q2, we are guiding more closer to $20 million, $25 million levels, and the remainder will be towards the second half. Definitely, we saw the advantage of $40 million plus coming in. That we have factored into the guidance. So the LatAm negative was compensated partially by this policy, right?","Now, when it comes to expenses, we have kind of a natural hedge, but when foreign currency strengthens, it goes the other way around. That's why we talked about today that being on the upper end of our guidance, and hence, a very small impact will trickle down into the EPS. And that's why we guided, still keeping our guidance of $5.00 to $5.20 despite the Latin American weakness. Does that help?","Yatin Suneja - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","(52:35)","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. Greg?","Operator","All right. Next we'll move to Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for taking the question and again, sorry to harp on Latin America like the others. But Vikas, just want to make sure that you're comfortable that this is not a harbinger of some kind of delayed reaction trouble in other oil-based economies, I guess, either in that region or more remote.","And also, do you see an opportunity here to make some lemonade and maybe shift some of the ALXN1210 development program focus to Latin America during the time that they're not able to necessarily afford Soliris, they can always help with the development program of ALXN1210? Thanks.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, I'll just start on the second half of that, Josh. I think that we have said all along, we are developing our programs with urgency. I think we'll always look at the global platform in which we operate for the best and fastest and most high quality ways of identifying sites, opening them up and enrolling patients. And I think as evidenced from the more than 30 patients already enrolled and dosed in the ALXN1210 initial studies, we see a tremendous amount of excitement from investigators to innovate over and on top of Soliris with ALXN1210. So we'll be thoughtful about the global platform to enroll patients. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Josh, on the oil-based economies, we saw a little bit of an optimism going into Q2, primarily because the oil price is moving to $40 is highly correlated to some of these currencies, especially if you look at ruble, right? It moved from RUB 80 to RUB 62 now. It's a rapid move, because as the oil approach $40, and forecasted to go to $45 towards the year end. So there's some positive movement on that side. The issues on LatAm are actually one step more than that, which is a political side on top of the oil. So, at this stage, I think when we gave the guidance, when we did our FX improvement, some of these currencies like ruble are actually working in our favor right now. But on the other hand, when you look at LatAm, which is very unique.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks Josh.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question?","Operator","Next from Goldman Sachs, we have Terence Flynn.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just was wondering on the Kanuma launch, it sounds like you are making some additional efforts there on the commercial side. Maybe some expansion, some changes. Just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more there? And then what's the impetus to make those changes now versus maybe a little bit later in the year? Thanks.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Terence. One of the things that Carsten and I have been talking about is, so we have the single metabolic field team which we expanded obviously ahead of the Kanuma launch and the Strensiq launch, right? So we felt like okay we are going to double up one single sales force, and they'd promote both disorders, and they're a common call point.","As we talk about accelerating those efforts, it's largely in two ways, right? We said that we want to focus on reaching more target physicians, and then also, we want to really extend this new and improved diagnostic pathway. So what we are planning to do, as an overlay, with this one single unit is to allocate some dedicated diagnostic specialists to HPP and to LAL-D. Now, that will take some time for the team to recruit, train, deploy that group, should have an impact for us over time. But that would enable some dedicated diagnostic help above the single unified sales team.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So it's not a Kanuma-focused effort, it's more for both Strensiq and Kanuma in terms of (56:53)","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, yeah. I mean, it's a good question, Terence. And that \u2013 look, we see this very strong start to the Strensiq launch. And, yet, I think Carsten and I, and the team feel like we're only getting started. There is a tremendous opportunity to reach far more patients, right? So we feel like on both sides a dedicated diagnostic effort will actually enable us to reach more patients and extend our initiatives on both sides, right, into the strength of Strensiq, and into some of the inertia that we're breaking through on the LAL-D side to take a more targeted diagnostic pathway, targeted at pediatric specialists to the LAL-D community. So we feel like there is great upside with this modification on both sides of our business. And again I think that it's going to take some time to deploy the team but these are our plans.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. In terms of the pediatric specialists, how much do that broaden your footprint, I guess, in terms of when we think of target audience on a percentage basis?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Carsten?","Carsten Thiel - Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer","Terence, what our emphasis is really about is increasing the disease awareness, and in particular once physicians understand the devastating nature of the disease that they'd change from a few individual tests to routine testing, that is a key success factor in the launch right now. As you know, the DBS test is inexpensive and it's broadly available. But there's many, many misdiagnosed patients that are masked by other diseases. And so what David has outlined is really to increase this testing in the market dramatically. That's our key focus.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think, Terence, just to cap that off, it doesn't necessarily mean a wider group of physicians. In fact, on the LAL-D side, we see it as slightly narrow, but I think we also see reach and frequency with those very enriched targets, it is the way to change the treatment patterns, and clearly what Carsten and the team are focused on. Thank you. Greg?","Operator","All right. Ladies and gentlemen, at this point we have time for two more questions. Next, we'll move to Barclays. We have Geoff Meacham.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, data dependent, just on myasthenia gravis, I wanted to ask you guys what the gating factors were for a filing? Is it possible that this could be a 2017 launch in the U.S., or is there a strategy perhaps to wait until the DGF data as well to sort of accelerate the package from that direction?","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think, it's again, pre-data. It's sort of early to comment on timing of submission and launch, but again I think that clearly, we're looking forward to data, and as you know to \u2013 based upon that data determine what our next steps would be. Geoff, I didn't \u2013 the DGF part of that, maybe I missed?","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The DGF, so the data will also be back half of this year, what's required for that package just given the prior data that you guys have had in the graft space?","Carsten Thiel - Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer","I think the same answer applies, Geoff, in terms of until we see the data that will dictate the submission package.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","David L. Hallal - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Geoff. Last question?","Operator","And our final question is from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And all right, so last math question, Vikas, because I'm struggling again, is this math right. So, the FX impact is less now by $40 million, so you lowered it by $40 million, and the 2% to 3% impact for LatAm means there is a $50 million to $75 million impact. So if you net-net the impacts $10 million to $35 million negative due to these factors, but your guidance drop was higher than that. So $50 million to $75 million for Soliris. Just help understand that discrepancy? Thank you.","Vikas Sinha - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the way we talked about it, right? So the math is, not math is math, right, which you get it right and I get it right also. We just have to make sure that both are maths, add up to the same number. So when we say 2% to 3%, we also said $60 million to $90 million impact on LatAm. And so we also are guiding, first quarter was already $30 million in FX, right? And we are guiding closer to $80 million issue for the rest of the year. So you're left with $50 million to go, right?","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

First Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Irving Adler, Vice President, Corporate Communications. Please \u2013 go ahead, sir.","Irving Adler","Thank you, Catherine. Good morning and thank you all for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the first quarter of 2015 and our plans for the full year. Today's call will be led by David Hallal, our CEO. David will start the call with an overview of our global performance and be joined by Vikas Sinha, our Chief Financial Officer and Martin Mackay, our Executive Vice President and Global Head of R&D. Also with us today are Saqib Islam, our Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer, Julie O\u2019Neill, our Executive Vice President for Global Operations; Dominique Monnet, our Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer; and Carsten Thiel, our Senior Vice President for EMEA and Asia Pacific.","Before we begin, I'd like to note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements apply only as of today's date and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after this call.","I'd also like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP operating results are adjusted from our US GAAP operating results for certain items that we described in our press release issued this morning. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release.","Thank you. David?","David Hallal","Thank you, Irving. In Q1, the global Alexion team delivered a strong start to 2015 as we executed on an expanding and unprecedented range of opportunities to provide life-transforming therapies to patients with rare and devastating disorders. During the quarter, our commercial organization delivered leveraging our world-class expertise in rare diseases to serve more patients with both PNH and aHUS. This resulted in a 25% increase in revenues and a 31% increase in volume year-on-year. And our R&D team continued to advance the broadest pipeline in our company's history, driving toward as many as seven new indication or product approvals through 2018 starting with asfotase alfa, which we will launch globally under the brand name Strensiq.","Looking at our operating performance with the strong addition of new patients receiving Soliris in Q1, and with the expected continued growth across our 50-country platform, we are reiterating our 2015 revenue and EPS guidance despite increased currency headwinds, reflecting the ongoing strength of our core business.","Looking more closely at our PNH franchise, in Q1, as in all prior quarters since 2007, we identified a consistently high number of newly diagnosed patients with PNH in the US, Europe and Japan, the three territories in which we have operated the longest, as well as in other key markets such as Turkey and Brazil. The success of our PNH diagnostic initiatives drives our steady growth as we continue to see that the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. Our experience affirms our view, that on a global basis, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis let alone commence appropriate treatment. ","In aHUS, our global launch continued to progress. In Q1, we again added a consistent number of new aHUS patients on Soliris treatment. We now see the same trend in Europe three years post approval. The ongoing strength of our aHUS launch confirms our view that our opportunity to serve patients with aHUS is indeed larger than our opportunity to serve patients with PNH. Given that the incidence of aHUS is higher than that of PNH, combined with the success of our diagnostic initiatives, we expect this trend to continue and perhaps even widen.","As we strive to serve more patients with PNH and aHUS, we will now be aided by the recent strengthening of the Soliris label in Europe. Earlier this month, the European Commission approved key updates to the label, which includes important information to help optimize care for patients. In PNH, the updated label confirms that patients with hemolysis are at high-risk of morbidities and pre-mature mortality regardless of whether they have received a blood transfusion. This is important, because many patients suffering from PNH do not require transfusions. The label update now guides physicians that this additional group of patients will also benefit from Soliris treatment.","For aHUS, the updated label informs physicians that the longer term Soliris treatment helps a greater proportion of patients experience clinically meaningful improvements. Importantly, the revised label underscores the risks of taking patients off of Soliris, stating that severe complications of (Technical Difficulty) as early as one month following discontinuation of Soliris treatment. Further, the EU label now includes clinical experience for patients who discontinued Soliris, showing that monitoring may be insufficient to predict or prevent life-threatening complications, including severe TMA and end-stage renal disease.","As our Soliris operations continue to grow, we are preparing to serve patients with HPP with our next product Strensiq. Upon submitting our regulatory filings for the FDA and EMA, we have had frequent and positive interactions with both agencies and are looking forward to bringing this potentially transformative therapy to patients as quickly as possible. While the review processes continue to progress positively, we now do not expect the final decisions will be made in the remaining weeks of this quarter.","In Europe, while we are on track for a CHMP opinion for Strensiq in the first half of this year, come shortly thereafter. In the US, Strensiq was granted breakthrough therapy designation and our rolling BLA was accepted under priority review last month. We have recently updated our submission to include data from the ongoing extension studies which strongly support our submission. Some of these data were recently presented at medical congresses. Given where we are in the review process, we expect FDA approval and launch in the second half of this year.","Turning to Japan, the review process is proceeding rapidly. Following recent discussions with the PMDA, we now expect that Strensiq will be approved near mid-year rather than our previous expectation of year-end. Importantly, our 2015 revenue guidance remains unchanged and we continue to expect an initial small revenue contribution from Strensiq in 2015.","As we prepare for this global lunch, we are completing the build out of our in-country metabolic teams. Building on our highly successful experience with Soliris, these teams continue to establish relationships with the HPP community and are focused on expanding our disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives as they educate physicians on the signs and symptoms of HPP and the appropriate pathways for rapid and accurate diagnosis.","Once approved, Strensiq will be the first of as many as seven new indications or product approvals for patients with severe and rare diseases through 2018. To achieve this goal, we\u2019re advancing the broadest pipeline in our history, including our late stage programs with three ongoing registration trials with eculizumab in MG, NMO and DGF and four additional highly innovative molecules in clinical development. Expanding on our global leadership and complement, our objective is to develop and deliver multiple innovative therapies for patients suffering from a wide range of complement mediated diseases.","In Q1, we strengthened and broadened our portfolio of highly innovative complement inhibitors to seven molecules across diverse platforms. Three of these molecules are already in clinical development. This includes the first two of our next-generation Soliris molecules, ALXN 1210, a longer acting anti-C5 antibody suitable for monthly dosing and ALXN 5500. We're driving toward an expected approval of at least one of these molecules in 2018.","We are also developing ALXN 1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, which targets C5a. Beyond these clinical programs, we are using our in-depth scientific knowledge and experience and complement biology to progress an additional four preclinical programs, two of which we added through strategic license agreements in Q1. Our future growth is also supported by a total of 17 preclinical programs, expanding diverse disease mechanisms, delivery modalities and therapeutic areas, all of which target devastating and rare diseases.","As we progress each of these programs in 2015, we expect to reach at least 12 significant development milestones during the year. Martin will provide more details on our pipeline later in the call.","Looking briefly at our Q1 financial performance, we reported revenues of $600 million, reflecting 25% in-year growth over Q1 2014, despite the continuing significant weakness in ex-US currencies. This revenue growth was driven by an increase in volume of 31% compared to the year ago quarter.","With this steady, patient and volume growth in our core business, combined with our effective hedging program, we are reiterating 2015 financial guidance. This guidance includes total revenues of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenue guidance would have been $2.71 billion to $2.76 billion, representing in-year revenue growth of 27% year-on-year. We are also reiterating 2015 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.80.","At this point, for a closer look at our financial performance, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Vikas. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, David. In Q1, we continued to deliver a strong financial performance, while increasing our investment in our long-term growth. First, the underlying strength in our core business has enabled us to reiterate our guidance this morning, despite the further weakening of global currencies, notably the euro, which has fallen from $1.18 when we provided our initial forecast to $1.07 today.","Our Q1 2015 revenues of $600 million were above our forecast of $585 million to $590 million, reflecting 25% growth of in-year sales over Q1 2014. This 25% revenue growth was driven by a 31% increase in volume, partially offset by a 6.6% currency headwind in Q1 over the year ago quarter, net of hedging.","The strength of our core business enabled us to increase our investments in R&D and SG&A as we drive to broaden our product portfolio. In this regard, our R&D investment in the quarter reflected the continued progress of our late-stage pipeline and the broadening of our portfolio of early-stage assets. SG&A in Q1 reflected the ongoing build-out of our global operations in preparation for the Strensiq launch.","Turning now to EPS. We achieved Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.28 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of $24 million charge or $0.11 per share associated with the single manufacturing camp in Strensiq unrelated to launch inventory, EPS would have been $1.39.","Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.93 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During Q1, we experienced strong positive cash flow from operations, which was offset by two factors. First, we are $112 million in upfront payments related to three strategic license agreements. Second, we purchased approximately $60 million of our shares as we continue to mitigate a natural pace of stock dilution from equity grants. As a reminder, we have an ongoing share repurchase program of $500 million.","I would now like to review some aspects of our 2015 guidance. Foreign currencies have continued to weaken since we provided our guidance in January. With roughly two-thirds of our revenue from ex-US countries, the full year impact of foreign exchange to our total revenue is now expected to be approximately 6% or $160 million compared to our previous expectation of 5% or $135 million, net of hedging. Despite these increasing currency headwinds, we are reiterating our 2015 total revenue forecast of $2.55 billion to $2.60 billion, driven by strong volume growth in our PNH and aHUS operations globally and our effective hedging program. This 2015 guidance includes a small initial revenue contribution from Strensiq. ","On a constant currency basis, revenue guidance would have been $2.71 billion to $2.76 billion, representing in-year revenue growth of 27% year-on-year. Now looking specifically at Q2, we anticipate continued strong volume growth and expect revenues to be in the range of $625 million to $630 million, despite continued FX headwinds of approximately $40 million compared to Q2 2014.","Looking now at other elements of our guidance, I will highlight the following two points. Due to the strength of our underlying core business, we are reiterating our 2015 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $5.60 to $5.80, despite increased FX headwinds and the impact of the manufacturing charge in Q1. And cost of goods will be at the upper end of our guided range of 8% to 9%.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Martin for the look at our research and development programs. Martin?","Martin Mackay","Thanks Vikas. In the first quarter of 2015, our R&D teams advanced the more robust pipeline in our Company\u2019s history, driving toward our goal of achieving up to seven new indicational product approvals through 2018, beginning with Strensiq, our novel therapy for patients with HPP this year. ","As David mentioned, since submitting our regulatory filings to the FDA and the EMA, we have had frequent and positive interactions with both agencies and are looking forward to bringing this potentially transformative therapy to patients as quickly as possible. While the review processes continue to progress positively, we now do not expect that the final decisions will be made in the remaining weeks of this quarter.","In Europe, while we are on track for a CHMP opinion for Strensiq in the first half of the year, the easy decision will come shortly thereafter. In the US, Strensiq was granted breakthrough therapy designation, and our rolling BLA was accepted under Priority Review last month. We have recently updated our submission to include data from the ongoing extension studies which strongly support our submission. ","Some of these data were recently presented at medical congresses. Given where we are in the review process, we expect FDA approval and launch in the second half of this year. Turing to Japan, the review process is proceeding rapidly. Following recent discussions with PMDA, we now expect that Strensiq will be approved near mid-year rather than our previous expectation of year-end.","As we prepare for our 2015 global launch of Strensiq, recent clinical data continue to reflect the devastating nature of HPP and the potentially transformative impact of asfotase alfa. Building on the strong survival data in infants, which showed a five-year survival rate of 89% with asfotase alfa compared to 27% in untreated historical control, we also recently presented data showing the devastating impact HPP has on juveniles and the transformative benefits of asfotase alfa for these patients. ","In early March, data from First Natural History Study in Juveniles with HPP represented in a late breaking session at the Endocrine Society Meeting. In this study, children with juvenile onset HPP experienced significant impairments in walking, debilitating muscle weakness, severe pain, skeletal deformities and frequent fractures. These data underscored the urgent need for a transformative treatment for these patients.","New data from the ongoing asfotase alfa Phase II studies in which patients were treated for at least three years provide long-term efficacy data, showing sustained significant improvement in pain, strength, agility and growth as well as normalization of physical function in children with HPP. To further strengthen and broaden the clinical data in HPP over time, we are also finalizing the protocol for a clinical study of asfotase alfa in adults with HPP, which will commence later this year. ","Beyond asfotase alfa, we continue to make meaningful progress with our late-stage pipeline, including three multi-national registration studies with eculizumab in other severe and rare complement-mediated disorders, which last approved are effective therapies.","Starting with Neurology, enrollment and dosing are ongoing in the REGAIN study, our registration trial in refractory myasthenia gravis or MG. Despite best supportive care, patients who suffer from refractory MG experienced a wide range of debilitating symptoms, including severe and generalized weakness in the muscles of head, spinal cord and respiratory system causing blurred vision, slurred speech, weakness of the arms and legs and difficulty breathing. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial by the end of the year. ","Enrollment and dosing are ongoing in the PREVENT study, our registration trial in relapsing neuromyelitis optica or NMO. Despite best supportive care, patients continue to experience disabling or life-threatening attacks. Each new relapse or attack brings the risk of a devastating outcome, including blindness, paralysis, respiratory failure or premature death. We are working diligently with investigators globally to complete enrollment in this study next year. ","In kidney transplant, we continue to enroll patients in the PROTECT study, our registration trial in delayed graft function or DGF. This is a debilitating condition in which a transplanted organ does not initially function properly, which can result in rejection or early graft loss. In addition, due to the poor outcomes associated with DGF, 15% to 20% of donor kidneys are discarded each year, reducing the already limited supply of donor organs. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial by the end of the year. ","As the global leader in complement biology, we continue to focus on innovative approaches to best serve patients with devastating complement-mediated diseases. In Q1, we strengthened and broadened our portfolio of complement inhibitors to now include seven molecules across diverse platforms. Three of these molecules are already in clinical development.","ALXN1210, a longer acting anti-C5 antibody, suitable for monthly dosing, and ALXN5500, the first of our next-generation Soliris molecules, we are advancing Phase I study of these first molecules and will progress at least one into our Phase II PNH trial this year with additional indications likely to follow. We are targeting approval of at least one of these molecules in 2018.","We are also developing ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody to c5a, which is an attractive target given its specific role in a number of complement-mediated disorders. We are currently conducting Phase II studies with ALXN1007 in patients with too severe and potentially life-threatening auto-immune diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome or APS and graft versus host disease involving the gastrointestinal tract or GI-GVHD. ","Severe GI-GVHD is an obstacle to successful hematopoietic stem cell transplants with significant mortality within the first 100 days post-transplant. We continue to expect to have interim data in the GI-GVHD study later in 2015. ","Beyond these clinical programs, we are using our in-depth scientific knowledge and experience in complement biology to progress in additional four pre-clinical programs, two of which we added through strategic investments in Q1. ","In our metabolic disease area, we continue to advance our cPMP Replacement Therapy, a small molecule approach to the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type A, a rapidly progressing lethal disease afflicting new-borns. The synthetic cPMP bridging study in patients with MoCD is ongoing and we expect to complete enrollment in 2015. ","We are also continuing our retrospective data collection and natural history study. Beyond our current clinical programs, we are also keenly focused on our expanding pipeline driven by both internal and acquired pre-clinical programs. As such, we are advancing our portfolio of 17 programs, including those resulting from our collaboration with Moderna, where in the first year, we have initiated pre-clinical development in seven mRNA rare disease programs and are targeting our first to enter the clinic in 2016.","In Q1, we continued to collaborate with Vanderbilt University to build on the preclinical data showing the potential of asfotase alfa as a treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1 or NF1, a devastating disease in which excess PPi may play a role as it does in HPP. While the existing research in this area is at a very early stage, we look forward to further exploring this potential second use of asfotase alfa and are planning to enter the clinic in 2016.","As we look to build upon a robust pipeline, we completed a transaction with Blueprint Medicines to discover, develop and commercialize novel drug candidates for an activated kinase target that is a cause of a rare genetic disease. This is a very promising approach as they already have molecules with impressive selectivity toward the target kinase.","We are continuing to evaluate a number of research collaborations, licenses and acquisitions across modalities and therapeutic areas. We look forward to providing more updates on all of our programs as the year proceeds.","I will now turn the call back to David. David?","David Hallal","Thanks, Martin. Our performance in Q1 reflects the strength of our underlying business as well as the build-out of our metabolic franchise, the advancement of our development opportunities and the broadening of our pipeline. Specifically, Soliris in PNH and aHUS continues to grow steadily across our 50-country operating platform. ","We are now ready for the global launch of Strensiq this year. We are working diligently to fully enrol our three ongoing registration trials with eculizumab, while advancing four additional highly innovative molecules in our rare disease pipeline.","The strengthening of our leadership and complement biology with a growing portfolio of novel complement inhibitors and beyond complement, we continue to broaden our growing pipeline to focus on what we know well and do well, serving patients suffering from rare and devastating diseases. And we look forward to updating you throughout the year as we progress our ambitious commercial and pipeline initiatives.","Thank you. Operator, now, let\u2019s open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now turn to the question-and-answer portion of our call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on another solid quarter. Maybe for David or for Martin on Strensiq and the US approval process, are you expecting a panel and if you're submitting additional data, I assume that's for some purpose, is there some claim that you're hoping to get on the label, including maybe survival that's generating this length of your timeline?","David Hallal","Yeah. No. Thanks, Eric. I\u2019ll start and then certainly Martin can add. So from our perspective, having completed the rolling BLA submission in December and then of course being granted priority review just last month, what we take a look at is we\u2019re having ongoing and very productive dialog with FDA. Now, as we've submitted data over time, we have patients that have been on treatment now for up to five years and we've updated the clinical data for all of those patients.","As I think you know quite well, our expectation is a very strong label. Breakthrough therapy designation covers perinatal, infantile and juvenile onset patients, which is very important for us. And in terms of the panel, the FDA has made it known to us that they do not anticipate an FDA panel in anyway. Martin, anything to add?","Martin Mackay","Thanks, David. Very little to add. I think you articulated very well, no expectation of a panel and in terms of the additional data from our extension studies, really part of the normal process as we go through this with the regulators.","David Hallal","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Anupam Rama with JP Morgan.","Anupam Rama","Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. In your comments as well as the press release, you highlighted two additional preclinical complement inhibitors, how should we be thinking about the potential levers for differentiation relative to Soliris, your next-generation Soliris molecules, one of which is a longer acting and the broader complement-competitive landscape.","David Hallal ","Yeah, I will start and then let Martin to jump in as well, but on our promise, we made it really clear, when we look at our leadership in complement biology as an organization, Soliris is a highly innovative product. You can see from the strength of our core business and of course the fact that 100% of patients in our PNH and aHUS trials had 100% objective response rate to Soliris, it\u2019s really a very, very strong franchise that we are building on. ","At the same time, we highlighted last quarter, our expectation is to serve patients with complement-mediated diseases through the end of this decade and through the end of next and we continue to focus with the Eculizumab late-stage programs. As Martin highlighted, with three ongoing registration trials, we also now with 1007 targeting C5a, we think there is other complement-mediated diseases that may be particularly well suited for that approach. And at the same time, when we think about many different patients treated by many different specialties across a wide range of complement-mediated disorders, we want to provide optionality to physicians and patients across our 50-country platform. And so that\u2019s the way to think about it as we continue to address the needs of patients that we see suffering from these diseases.","Martin Mackay","Pretty good, David. My only add is in terms of thinking about both in terms of as David articulated different treatment options around C5 and also new diseases to work on. I think we are having seven molecules, now three in the clinics, four pre-clinical. We are building this portfolio to do both.","Anupam Rama","Great. Thanks for taking our questions.","David Hallal ","Thanks, Anupam.","Operator","And we will continue on to Salveen Richter with SunTrust.","Salveen Richter","Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering, with regard to Strensiq, if you could remind us of the diagnostic initiative you have in place and your footprint here ahead of the launch and any early access programs or other programs that you might have in place for current use of the drug?","David Hallal","Sure. No, thank you very much, Salveen. So as I indicated on the last call, we expect 2015 to really be a story about launching in the US, Germany, the first country in Europe of course, and Japan. And the teams are fully in place and ready to go. And the disease and diagnostic initiatives that we are running is really through educating physicians about patients who may be diagnosed with another disorder, another metabolic bone disorder or other symptoms that may be also overlap with HPP. And really through that education and the use of a simple alk phos test which is available to physicians to better understand how to identify these patients, it\u2019s helping physicians to better appreciate which patients in their practice may have HPP. At the same time, as we\u2019ve indicated, our 1010 trials continues to be open and enroll children with HPP and that has enabled us to help patients in need prior to approval to access treatment. ","Operator","Thank you. And we will continue on to Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much and congratulations on the quarter and David welcome to your first follow-on call. ","David Hallal","Thanks, Geoff.","Geoffrey Porges","I suppose I\u2019ll have to test to you out. I will ask my favorite question. So could you give us a sense -- your comments about PNH suggest that, on a global basis, more patients are still unidentified and untreated than treated? Could you give us an update on where you \u2013 the implication that in the US now you have more patients identified and on treatment than unidentified. And then related to that, in the US, you are 14 quarters into the aHUS launch. What do you estimate is the proportion of the real incidence that you are actually capturing and converting to treatment with Soliris? Thanks.","David Hallal","Yeah, it\u2019s a great question. I\u2019d say in the US of course, the first county in which we launched Soliris for PNH back in April of \u201907, is that today we see ourselves starting to approach sort of that point where we think we are getting to identifying about half of the patients that may have the disease and around the world globally slightly less than that as we launched later in those other territories. ","I\u2019d say, Geoff, one of the things that we\u2019re benefiting from, of course, is that we see that Soliris helps to change the natural history of disease. We\u2019re aided by the fact that there is an incidence rate albeit not as high as aHUS, but there is an incidence rate for PNH. So, that means new patients are coming into the system every year and the symptoms associated with PNH still continue to resemble symptoms of more common bone morrow failure syndromes or clotting disorders and based upon that, physicians just miss these patients and we want to get there fast with the 35% death rate at five years.","And so, we think all of that combined puts us in a really good position and we see, as we presented previously, a continued steady identification of new patients across our 50 country platform in 2015, same study contribution of new patients on a quarterly basis as we did in the earlier stages of the launch.","In terms of PNH versus aHUS, as I indicated, 14 quarters out now following the FDA approval, there are more patients actively on treatment with Soliris for aHUS. And we think the success of the diagnostic programs combined with the higher incidence and of course, these patients with aHUS are presenting urgently a high degree of medical severity, including renal impairment or renal failure and that is actually helping us to diagnose patients faster, but we still think there is a number of patients we miss, that we think there is great upside in the US and around the world to reach more physicians with those disease and diagnostic initiatives to get to those patients sooner.","Geoffrey Porges","Great, thanks very much, I appreciate it.","David Hallal","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now hear from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Look, I got one for Vikas and then one for David. So, Vikas, this quarter, pretty big FX hit, does that prompt you to change your synthetic hedging strategy or how you allocate capital overseas and may be a bigger picture question for David, with an established US tax structure and obviously a commercial infrastructure across the globe, with the cash that you have on the books and what you\u2019re generating, do you guys think more frequently about sort of an external M&A, not for Phase I or platform technologies, but more for marketed product? Does that make sense to expect that going forward? Thank you.","David Hallal","Thanks, Geoff. Vikas, start.","Vikas Sinha","Geoff, I just understand your question, if you\u2019re talking about big FX impact and whether we will be changing our hedging strategy, the answer is no, we\u2019ll keep our hedging strategy as it is to keep 50% of our major currencies hedged and this -- the thing is, when the currency moves, overtime, you will get impacted and we will take the impact very slowly over several years and what that also means is, yes, we\u2019re trying to give more color on what that impact would be quarter-by-quarter, so you get a better appreciation with constant currency volume growth. You can calculate that. If I look at the growth rate this quarter, it was 25%, but adjusting the FX on a constant currency basis, the fundamental business is very strong at 31% and we expect that strength continuing for the rest of the year.","David Hallal","Thanks, Vikas. And Geoff, our focus is really on what we know well and do well. We feel like we have a high level of skill at characterizing and understanding devastating and rare diseases and identifying molecules that can have a transformative impact and then leveraging as you state our global platform to help reach more patients as quickly as we can. And I would just say, to kind of cap off the answer to your question, I think it\u2019s important to state that we remain agnostic to therapeutic area or therapeutic modality. We\u2019re really looking at really devastating rare diseases where products can have a transformative impact.","Geoff Meacham","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Roden with UBS.","Matt Roden","David, can you hear me?","David Hallal","Yeah, Matt.","Matt Roden","Okay, great. Thanks so much. Thanks for taking the question. So David you pointed out in your prepared remarks, the label updates that describe recurrences of TMAs and aHUS patients had discontinued therapy. It seems like this can be a nice opportunity for you guys to further improve the benefit that you are delivering to patients. ","So can you talk about what proportion of patients, aHUS patients are currently discontinuing from therapy and to what extent you think this updated label can improve the persistency on therapy? Thanks.","David Hallal","Yeah, thanks very much, Matt. You know, as we have indicated on past calls, we observed that the persistency for patients with the confirmed diagnosis of aHUS is good, but less than that of the historically observed, very, very, very high rate in PNH. And I think the thing I characterized in the past is, given that aHUS is a thrombotic microangiopathy, and there were a few other thrombotic microangiopathies that are viewed as more of a short-term intermittent disease, one key part of our educational program over time has been that aHUS is a genetic lifelong disease as opposed to, say for example, stack aHUS. ","And so over time, we think physicians are gaining a better appreciation. As you know, we started out with our US and European labels with only six months of efficacy data that has now moved to two years and beyond. And we believe that this update, which also provides specific clinical evidence of patients that were discontinued and monitored closely over time still had a very bad devastating outcome, including specifically a patient progressing to ESRD. ","And so we think both the longer term efficacy data showing that more patients have a clinically meaningful improvement on Soliris treatment combined with also the protection from the risk of severe devastating thrombotic microangiopathy is going to continue to support our efforts with physicians around the world.","Matt Roden","Because, it sounds like you would expect some sort of impact to utilization from these label updates?","David Hallal","Yeah, we would expect -- as I mentioned and I don\u2019t really want to walk past PNH, I mean, I think it was very meaningful in Europe that for the first time since our approval in June 2007 now the European Commission points to the group of PNH patients that have no history of blood transfusions and really helps physicians now understand that those patients with hemolysis and with symptoms of PNH can also benefit from Soliris treatment. ","So that\u2019s a new group of patients that physicians are managing in Europe that will be very helpful. So I think that should certainly provide us some benefit over time, and I would feel the same way about aHUS, over time, we would think that the trends would improve. ","Matt Roden","Great. Thanks, and congrats on the solid growth there. ","David Hallal","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.","Chris Raymond","Hey, thanks. Just a question on the follow-on molecules, you have been fairly descriptive of the ALXN1210, but not 5500 molecule. I am just wondering, is there a trigger for when you would use them and exactly what that is, is it timing, is it data, any color would be appreciated? Thanks.","Martin Mackay","Yeah, Chris, really both timing and data, and you\u2019re correct. You know, we speak about 1210, once daily dosing and looking to move into patients by year-end with one of those molecules. In specific answer to your question, it really comes to data and timing with 5500. ","Chris Raymond","Thank you.","Operator","Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley has our next question.","Matthew Palmer","Good morning, this is Matthew Palmer in for Matthew Harrison. Thanks for taking the questions. David, now that you are in the CEO seat, any updated thoughts on capital deployment including the potential for accretive M&A or for commercial products?","David Hallal","Yeah, you know, Matt, I just as I mentioned, we are going to continue to focus on what we know well and do well. I think as Vikas and Martin, and I highlighted, in Q1, there were three strategic license agreements, which we entered into, they helped to bolster both our complement biology and leadership position in general to strengthen that portfolio as well as we think a really neat approach with Blueprint Medicines. I think as an organization, what we know well and do well is characterizing really bad rare diseases and understanding, you know what therapies, can't just have a modest or incremental impact but something that's truly transformative and that's the approach that we like to take that's what we think we are building with Soliris and asfotase alfa, and the other highly innovative molecules and programs that we have in the pipeline. And as I mentioned, they will also continue to be acoustic to therapeutic area and modality because of the strength and leverage that we have with our 50 country operating platforms.","Matthew Palmer","Thank you.","David Hallal","Thanks.","Operator","And Ying Huang, with BofA, please go ahead.","Ying Huang","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my questions. First one is, can you give us a little bit color in terms of the average dose for the aHUS patients is on Soliris and also whether you're making more progress in terms of getting patients outside of the hospital settings for aHUS. And then, also my second question has to do with the FDA approval for asfotase alfa? So can you give us a little bit color around the questions you're getting from FDA and EMA and is there any difference in the topic of discussion or not? Thank you.","David Hallal","Ying, I got to give you credit for getting like three, four questions into one always, I guess, this time, it just wasn\u2019t a question for everybody, but why don't I take them. A way to think about aHUS as we've always said, obviously the disease is devastating to both children and adults, but when you look at the mix of patients, the way to think about our aHUS franchise is, the average per patient dose across the population, think about it as, it fits right into PNH, right, when you balance out the children and the adult.","In terms of patients in or out of the hospital setting, we think about patients two ways, the patients with active progressing TMA, they are the ones I'm referring to that are presenting urgently, usually to a hospital because their platelets are plummeting, their LDH is rising, they have you know symptoms of hemolysis, and of course their kidneys are greatly impaired or failing. ","And so, we see the majority of the patients that we identify and starting on treatment are at that level, but at the same time, there are patients that have perhaps absorbed a history of thrombotic microangiopathy that might be out in the clinics with nephrologists and hematologists, and again, that's part of the leverage that we have with our field team that also focuses on PNH, where most of the PNH patients are actually identified in the hematology clinics. So that leverage actually allows us to both capture the opportunity to serve patients in the hospital as well as out in the clinics.","And then I think, your last question and Martin can certainly add to this. The questions that we\u2019re getting from regulators, I think as Eric pointed out, would just be kind of straight forward questions that we would expect in the normal course of the process but with us standing by the transformative impact, you've seen the data at medical congresses with patients treated for three to five years and really standing by that submission to make sure that we can serve the highest number of patients possible.","Ying Huang","Thank you.","Operator","I will now go to Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe it\u2019s one question and one clarification. First, I think you guys mentioned for the first time that you expect possibly the trend to widen between PNH and aHUS, on a time [ph] match basis, just wondering, what are factors that you're seeing at this point that are contributing to that statement.","And then the clarification with respect to the $24.4 million tied to the single manufacturing campaign for asfotase, just wondering if you can clarify what exactly that's driving that, is that inventory build or something else? Thank you.","David Hallal","Yeah sure, thanks Terence. So, what's contributing, we tried to refer to it in the call is, what's contributing, first of all, PNH continues to grow very, very nicely as I indicated, we see the majority of our opportunities go in front of us with PNH, and in fact we are adding a similar number of patients on a quarterly basis globally today as we did in the earlier stages of our global launch, so the durability and strength of that franchise and the opportunity to serve patients is tremendous. ","When you look at it on a time adjusted basis, 14 quarters in on the US, the fact that we are actively treating more patients with aHUS than PNH combined with a higher incidence, right, so we didn't get there through pent-up demand, we've gotten there through serving patients who are newly presenting with TMA overtime. So the higher incidence, the success of our diagnostic programs and the confidence and the longer-term opportunity, we would expect that this is a trend that could perhaps widen on a time adjusted basis.","As it relates to the 24.4 million, Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","The 24.4 million, the manufacturing stuff, we don't expect that to be repeating in the second half of the, rest of the year also, because this was one of the im-quarter thing, normally, because of the accounting way that we look at it, we would have normally taken this into R&D, but we have a policy that after the filing, we have started capitalizing the inventory. So the launch inventories are already in place. This is just one of the instance where we found the problem early on, we started the campaign and we took the write-off.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Robyn Karnauskas","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So just could I ask you about 1007, C5A inhibitor, I know a lot of anti-inflammatory drugs don't work in GBI, HT and APS, can you help me understand what we know about the science complement in these disorders?","David Hallal","Martin?","Martin Mackay","Yeah. Thank you, Robyn. I think it's fair to say we are developing our knowledge around C5A in those disorders, but there is clearly some preclinical evidence that would suggest the role for C5A and clearly with 1007 having already started at both proof of concept trials and having results in one of them this year, this will give us really good evidence for the role that C5A can play and specifically 1007 in both gastrointestinal GVHD and also antiphospholipid syndrome. That will also, I believe, allow us to look at other potential diseases. I think it\u2019s quite clear that C5A and the C5A receptor are important therapeutic targets in the complement pathway and that will give us a chance to really look at other indications for this molecule.","Robyn Karnauskas","And if you allow me as a follow-up, can you help me understand a little bit more about C5A, like in Soliris, why you need a more broad C5A inhibitor for PNH and aHUS and what it might offer?","Martin Mackay","Well, we firmly believe that C5 is the best target for those particular diseases, PNH and atypical HUS, but as you also know, the other components with the associated pathway and obviously C5A is one of them, could also be important therapeutic targets. In terms of C5 with PNH and atypical HUS, we are very confident that that is the best target in those indications.","David Hallal","Yes, Robyn and it\u2019s, when you only block C5A, you are not blocking terminal complement and that's really the important piece on why Eculizumab or Soliris is really the ideal complement inhibitor for those diseases.","Robyn Karnauskas","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now hear from Stephen Willey with Stifel.","Stephen Willey","Yeah. Thanks and congrats. Vikas, I guess it sounds like the impact from pricing was relatively negligible in Q1, maybe just wondering kind of what if any kind of pricing headwinds baked into \u201815 guidance at this point? Thanks.","Vikas Sinha","Yeah. Steve, in Q1, we had a positive 1% pricing impact and it was a very small number, so that was mainly driven from US price increase, negated by some -- one impact in UK.","Stephen Willey","And in terms of just what is baked into \u201815 guidance at this point on the pricing side?","Vikas Sinha","Pricing side for the full year, it's incorporated in our guidance and we normally take 2% to 3% decline year-on-year.","Stephen Willey","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And our final question will come as a follow-up from Geoffrey Porges.","Geoffrey Porges","Thanks very much. Let me jump in. Vikas, could you talk a little bit about your balance sheet? You have close to $2 billion in cash, effectively no debt and many of your peers have started to look to leverage to pursue business development opportunities and more aggressively buyback stock. Could you talk about how you see that playing out over the next 12 or 18 months for Alexion and potentially being more aggressive given the interest rate environment? Thanks.","Vikas Sinha","First of all, as David had laid out earlier, our first and foremost objective is to strengthen our pipeline and look at licensing and acquisitions as one first opportunity, right. So we would \u2013 the cash balance as well as our borrowing capacity, we would like to hold for that. And the second objective of cash balance would be to keep the dilution in check at this stage and we will not go too aggressively on buying back a large amount of shares by just borrowing, but rather hold it for our growth and supporting our growth. David?","David Hallal","Yeah, and I would just again repeat, Geoff, that our focus as an organization is on what we know well and do well, characterizing and understanding devastating and rare diseases and identifying molecules that can have a transformative impact, really independent of therapeutic area or modality. And so that\u2019s kind of been our approach in the past. I see that being our approach as we move forward and certainly as Vikas indicated, we have a balance sheet that supports that.","Geoffrey Porges","Okay. Thanks very much.","David Hallal","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that was our last question. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. "],"1091":["Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Please proceed, sir.","Lenny Bell","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call to discuss Alexion\u2019s performance for the second quarter of 2012.","With me on the call this morning are members of Alexion management: Steve Squinto, Executive Vice President and Head of R&D; Vikas Sinha, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; David Hallal, Senior Vice President, Global Commercial Operations; and Tom Dubin, Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. We also welcome our entire Alexion team working around the world.","Vikas, David and Steve will join me on today\u2019s call to report on our progress in the second quarter, and to provide an update on our outlook for the second half of this year.","Before we begin, Tom will apprise you of our potential to make forward-looking statements. Tom?","Tom Dubin","Thanks, Lenny. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, such as expected financial results, medical benefits, regulatory milestones and commercial potential of Soliris, asfotase alfa and our other product candidates globally; plans for development and clinical trials of Soliris, asfotase alfa and our other product candidates; and operations reimbursement, price approval and funding processes in different countries.","Forward-looking statements are subject to factors that may cause our results and plans to differ from those expected, including decisions of regulatory authorities regarding approval or limitations on the marketing of Soliris and our product candidates for various indications; the possibility that results of clinical trials are not predictive of the safety and efficacy of Soliris or our product candidates from broader patient populations in the disease studied or in other diseases; the risk that third parties won\u2019t agree to license any necessary intellectual property to us on reasonable terms or at all; the possibility that initial results of commercialization are not predictive of future results; the risk that third party payers will not or will not continue to reimburse for the use of Soliris at acceptable rates or at all; and a variety of other risks set forth from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including our 10-Q for the three months March 31, 2012.","We do not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements after this call, except when the duty arises under law.","I\u2019d like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP numbers conform to US GAAP except in three respects. First, our non-GAAP numbers exclude share-based compensation. Second, we adjust for tax items associated with utilization of our US net operating losses and the Q2 tax expense related to acquisition structuring. And third, we also exclude costs associated with acquisitions. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the press release we issued this morning.","Thank you. Lenny?","Lenny Bell","Thank you very much, Tom. During the second quarter, we made steady progress across our strategic objectives for the year, as we continue to expand our initiatives to develop and deliver life-transforming therapies for patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders.","Our development and commercial teams performed solidly in three key areas during the quarter. First, we again provided Soliris to a substantial number of new patients with PNH. Second, we are very pleased with the ongoing launch in aHUS as we continue to serve an increasing number of patients with Soliris. And finally, we continue to advance our eight lead development programs, comprising the most robust pipeline in our company\u2019s history.","I\u2019d like to start with a review of our operations in the United States. With regard to aHUS during Q2, we made significant progress in serving an increasing number of patients. Our field team continued to expand our aHUS disease education programs to both hematologists and nephrologists, resulting in a meaningful increase in the number of aHUS patients who initiated treatment with Soliris.","Although we expect the uptake of Soliris in aHUS to continue to be limited by the relatively low prevalence to the disease, we are nonetheless encouraged by the progress that we are making as we identify and serve an increasing number children and adults with this severe and life-threatening disorder.","Turning to PNH. Our expanded presence among hematologists again resulted in a growing positive impact on patient care. We continued to observe that as more patients are being tested, those who are diagnosed with PNH are also starting on Soliris rapidly, reflecting their physician\u2019s understanding of the life-threatening severity of PNH and the role of Soliris to transform their patient\u2019s lives. In our PNH operations beyond the United States, our quarter-on-quarter growth reflects the addition of a steady number of new Soliris patients with PNH in our core country Southern Europe, as well as in Japan.","Looking beyond these core territories, and as noted in previous calls, we have been building our operations in two additional major countries, Turkey and Brazil. As a result of initial deployment of our field teams, during Q2 Soliris treatment was initiated in a significant number of previously diagnosed PNH patients who had been awaiting therapy with a subsequent one-time positive impact on our results.","In line with our experience in other countries, we now expect that following the one-time addition of these initial groups of patients, our ongoing diagnostic initiatives in Turkey and Brazil will result in a more modest rate of patient identification and treatment initiation.","In our aHUS operations outside the United States, in Germany, we are at the very earliest stages of disease education, with treatment commencing in the anticipated modest number of initial patients. More broadly, we are continuing our disease education initiatives to prepare for our aHUS launches across the larger EU countries when reimbursement processes are completed late this year and in 2013. David will provide more detail on our commercial initiatives later in the call.","Turning to our development pipeline. Our selection of pipeline candidates and disease settings is guided by our focus on developing highly innovative treatments for patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders. Within this filter, we further note that each of our eight lead development programs involve the highly innovative therapy with strong potential to provide a life-transforming impact to patients.","For example, in published data from investigational trials, asfotase alfa has demonstrated dramatic clinical benefits in study patients with hypophosphatasia or HPP. Separately, interim data presented from a large investigational trial show that Soliris was associated with substantial clinical improvements in study patients suffering from STEC-HUS.","And in another of our lead programs, we look forward to the expected presentation of data from the NMO clinical trial later this year. Steve will provide an update on our eight lead development programs involving Soliris, and our four other highly innovative therapeutic candidates.","Importantly, given their various stages of development, our lead pipeline programs have the potential to make important contributions to our organization well into the next decade. Our expected launch dates in new indications are also well aligned with the build-out of our global operations platform.","During Q2, and as a direct result of the growth we have achieved through serving patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders, Alexion was added to the S&P 500 Index of leading companies. In conjunction with this addition, we structure an equity offering in line with our conservative approach to corporate finance. The offering achieved its goal of strengthening our balance sheet, which we believe is particularly prudent in light of the overall macroeconomic environment.","Turning to our financial performance. Revenues in Q2 were $274.7 million, an increase of 48% compared to Q2 2011. Q2 2012 results included recognition of approximately $3.3 million in revenues related to shipments of Soliris from an earlier period in 2011. By serving an increasing number of patients while maintaining rigorous financial control, we achieved Q2 2012 non-GAAP net income of $0.47 per share or $94.1 million, a 66% increase year-over-year.","Looking forward, we recognize the ongoing macroeconomic risks in many of the countries in which we operate, including increased weakness in the euro. We anticipate that the weaker euro will negatively impact our revenues through at least the remainder of this year.","However, over the longer term, we expect that these risks will be mitigated by four factors: first and most importantly, our continued focus on serving more patients suffering from severe and ultra-rare disorders; second, the growing contributions from an increasingly diverse group of countries; third, our ongoing initiatives to manage both currency and collections; and finally, we expect that these risks will also be mitigated by the natural hedge we obtained through our euro-denominated expenses.","I will now turn to our revised 2012 forecast. Following our performance in Q2, we announced this morning that we are raising our 2012 revenue guidance from the previous range of $1.65 billion to $1.85 billion now to the higher range of $1.110 billion to $1.125 billion. Along with this increased revenue forecast we are further increasing our investment in our global operations as we look to serve greater numbers of patients in 2013 and beyond.","As noted in this morning\u2019s press release, are revising our non-GAAP SG&A guidance from the previous range of $345 million to $355 million now to the higher range of $360 million to $370 million. Finally, we are raising our forecast for 2012 non-GAAP EPS from the previous range of $1.65 to $1.75 now to the higher range of $1.78 to $1.88.","We are pleased with the start to our aHUS launch, our ongoing performance in serving patients with PNH and our progress in advancing a wide range of clinical pipeline programs. In the second half of 2012 and beyond, the global Alexion team will drive forward in each of its opportunities to serve current and future patients.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Vikas for a more detailed look at our financial results. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Lenny. The second quarter of 2012 was a period of strong financial performance by Alexion with growth in revenues and increasing profitability. Cash flow continued at a robust level, and all expenses were held within our forecasted ranges.","Net product sales of Soliris were $274.7 million in Q2, an increase of 48% compared to the year-ago quarter. Our Q2 results include recognition of approximately $3.3 million in revenues related to shipments from an earlier period in 2011. As in prior quarters, revenue performance in Q2 was supported by continued steady growth in our core territories of the US, Western Europe and Japan, further augmented by a one-time increase in new PNS patients in Turkey and Brazil. In addition, our Q2 results reflect the growing contribution from our aHUS launch in the US and the start of a gradual uptake of Soliris in Germany.","As we continue to execute strongly on our patient-centered initiatives, we likewise remain focused on controlling our expenses. As a result, we achieved a 66% increase in non-GAAP net income year-over-year to $94.1 million or $0.47 per share in Q2 2012. Our Q2 non-GAAP results exclude the $21.8 million of tax expense relating to acquisition structuring. As a reminder, this was within the range we guided for tax expense in our Q1 call.","Turning to our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents at the end of Q2 were $806 million compared to $359 million at the end of Q1. Our cash balance reflects positive cash flow from operations, and approximately $462 million from the proceeds of our stock offering in conjunction with our inclusion into the S&P 500 Index. We reduced our total debt from $355 million at the end of Q1 to $228 million at the end of Q2.","Looking forward, we recognize that there are significant ongoing macroeconomic risks in many of the countries in which we operate. These risks can manifest in several ways, including the continuing weakness in many currencies and the now increased weakness of the euro, which we expect will have a negative impact on our revenues through at least the remainder of this year.","These macroeconomic risks also includes sovereign risk, and we expect that these risks will be mitigated by four factors: first, our continued focus on patient-centered programs; second, the growing contributions from an increasing diverse group of countries; third, our ongoing initiatives to manage currency and collections; and finally, the natural hedge we obtain through our euro-denominated expenses.","I will now turn to our revised 2012 forecast. Following our performance in Q2, we announced this morning that we are raising our 2012 revenue guidance upward from the previous range of $1.065 billion to $1.085 billion now to the higher range of $1.110 billion to $1.125 billion.","Along with our increased revenue forecast, we are increasing our global investment in our operations to serve a growing number of patients in 2013 and beyond. Our non-GAAP SG&A guidance is being revised from the previous range of $345 million to $355 million now to the higher range of $360 million to $370 million.","Our R&D guidance remains unchanged as we continue to drive our eight lead development programs forward. We are revising our forecast for 2012 non-GAAP EPS from the previous range of $1.65 to $1.75 now to the higher range of $1.78 to $1.88.","Finally, total shares outstanding in Q2 were approximately 198.5 million shares. Looking ahead and largely due to the recent share issuance, shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 203 million in Q3 and approximately 204 million in Q4.","Overall, we are pleased with our financial performance in the first half of 2012. We will continue to maintain the financial discipline with which we are expanding our commercial platform and our development programs.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David, who will provide an update of our global commercial operations. David?","David Hallal","Thanks, Vikas. In the second quarter of 2012, global revenues from our Soliris operations increased by 48% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Q2 revenue growth was driven by the strong addition of new PNH patients starting on Soliris, combined with a solid start to our aHUS launch in the US.","In the US, our efforts with an expanded Soliris field team are having a positive impact. We are reaching more hematologists for both PNH and aHUS, while also reaching adult and pediatric nephrologists for aHUS. In PNH, our increased presence among hematologists is resulting in improved diagnostics, leading to consistent identification of new patients.","Importantly, and as in previous quarters, we again observed that the majority of PNH patients newly starting on Soliris were also newly diagnosed. This further demonstrates that broad education about PNH, as well as PNH diagnostics, positively influences the entire cycle of care from a patient newly diagnosed with PNH to a patient newly starting on appropriate treatment.","In aHUS, we are very pleased with the start of our US launch as our field team continues to present our disease education programs to more hematologists and nephrologists, resulting in an increase in the number of aHUS patients who are initiating treatment with Soliris.","Although the uptake of Soliris in aHUs is limited by the relatively low prevalence of the disease, we are encouraged by the progress that we are making to identify and serve an increasing number of children and adults with this severe and life-threatening disorder. Based on our early performance, we are confident that we will continue to serve an increasing number of aHUS patients over time.","Turning now to our PNH operations outside the US. We continue to expand our disease awareness programs and diagnostic initiatives. During Q2, we again achieved steady growth in Western Europe and Japan, as patients with a higher likelihood of having PNH were tested, identified and rapidly started on treatment. As in the US, we recognize that the majority of patients with PNH in these core territories have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone appropriate treatment.","Looking beyond our core territories, and as noted in previous calls, we have been building our operations in two additional major countries, Turkey and Brazil. As a result of initial deployment of our field teams, during Q2, Soliris treatment was initiated and a significant number of previously diagnosed PNH patients who have been awaiting therapy with a subsequent one-time positive intact on our results. In line with our experience in other countries, we now expect that following the one-time addition of these initial patients, our ongoing diagnostic initiatives in Turkey and Brazil will result in a more modest rate of patient identification and treatment initiation.","In our aHUS operations outside the US, in Germany, we are at the very earliest stages of disease education with treatment commencing in an anticipated modest number of initial patients. More broadly, we are continuing our disease education initiatives to prepare for our aHUS launches across the larger EU countries when reimbursement processes are completed late this year and in 2013.","In both the US and Europe, we observed several dynamics that continue to guide our launch in aHUS. For example, patients with aHUS who were receiving Soliris represent a broad range of ages and clinical profiles, including those with long-term disease and chronic kidney damage, as well as those for being identified during their first clinical presentation of TMA. Many of these first-time patients present urgently with this life-threatening condition, pointing to the importance of the rapid delivery supply chain we have established to provide Soliris to patients.","In all countries, our efforts in both PNH and aHUS are supported by the growing body of clinical data regarding the natural history and devastating clinical consequences of each disorder, and the life-transforming effect that Soliris can provide to these patients.","Recently, this included new data on PNH and aHUS that were presented in June at the annual meeting of the European Hematology Association or EHA. In PNH, researchers presented further clinical evidence regarding PNH diagnosis. The new clinical data further supported the need to test patients at high risk for PNH, including that patients in high-risk populations should be consistently tested and monitored based on the ICCS recommendations to ensure accurate diagnosis and early intervention.","Turning to aHUS presentations of EHA, a retrospective analysis of 30 pediatric and adult patients with aHUS showed that the majority of patients experienced severe complications of the disease across multiple organs despite use of plasma exchange or plasma infusion. These complications span the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and neurological systems, and were similarly reported in aHUS patients with or without identified genetic complement mutations, and even in the absence of substantial renal impairment.","Beyond aHUS, another opportunity for our nephrology therapeutic area is STEC-HUS. In planning for a possible STEC-HUS launch in late 2013 or early 2014, our team is beginning to better understand disease and diagnostic patterns in the US and Europe.","Looking ahead to commercial opportunities beyond hematology and nephrology, we are adding metabolic disease specialists to our operations as we plan for a launch of asfotase alfa and hypophosphatasia or HPP based on our goal of a pediatric filing in 2014. We are beginning to identify the needs of the HPP community, mindful that diagnosis can be missed and the natural history of the disease may be misunderstood, given the rarity of the disorder and the wide range of its clinical signs.","As such, we are deploying our first MSLs in the US, and are now preparing to deploy a small medical affairs team in Europe to provide disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives as we prepare for the potential introduction of asfotase alfa. We are pleased with the early progress of our aHUS launch and the continued growth in our global PNH operations.","In the third and fourth quarters, we will focus on selective additions to our global commercial operations as we prepare to serve more patients in 2013 and beyond. Our team will continue to drive forward to transform the lives of more patients in more countries who are diagnosed with severe and life-threatening ultra-rare disorders.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve, who will review our expanding pipeline initiatives. Steve?","Steve Squinto","Thanks, David. In the second quarter of 2012, we continued to progress our lead pipeline programs, which include five highly innovative compounds currently being investigated at various stages of development across eight severe and ultra-rare indications beyond PNH and aHUS.","I would first like to provide an update on our eculizumab development programs, starting with STEC-HUS. We are pleased to report that the European Commission has granted orphan designation for eculizumab as a treatment for patients with STEC-HUS, a severe ultra-rare and life-threatening inflammatory disorder.","In addition, we have shared top line data from the entire 198-patient trial with EU regulators, and have discussed a pathway to apply for marketing authorization for eculizumab for the treatment of STEC-HUS, which could be submitted near the end of this year or early next year.","In our kidney transplant program with eculizumab, we continued to enroll patients in our company-sponsored multinational living donor kidney transplant trial in patients at elevated risk of antibody-mediated rejection. Patients in this study are being dosed with eculizumab for nine weeks post-transplant, and then will be observed for 52 weeks following transplant. In addition, we have initiated a deceased donor kidney transplant study, and expect enrollment to begin later this year.","Turning now to our two neurology clinical development programs with eculizumab. One-year data from the investigator initiated Phase II clinical trial of eculizumab in severe refractory NMO is expected to be presented at a scientific meeting in the second half of 2012. As we prepare for anticipated meetings with regulators later this year, we are currently holding a series of discussions with investigators to design our next clinical study in NMO. Likewise with regard to myasthenia gravis, we are working with investigators to design our next clinical study, and expect to meet with regulators in late 2012 to discuss plans for a larger prospective controlled trial.","I would like to turn now to our other lead development programs with highly innovative therapeutic candidates beyond eculizumab and starting with asfotase alfa. We continued to accelerate the development of asfotase alfa as a treatment for a broad spectrum of HPP patients, focusing first on completing the clinical development program for children with HPP.","In Q2, we initiated the natural history study in infants to supplement the existing open label trials. We also expect to initiate a placebo-controlled study in juveniles with HPP later this year. We\u2019ll be discussing the registration process for pediatric patients with regulatory authorities with an eye toward a pediatric filing in 2014.","Importantly, we have already successfully implemented several steps to optimize the commercial-scale manufacturing process for asfotase alfa to ensure our ability to provide long-term support to the HPP community. We\u2019ll continue to update you on our asfotase alfa program on future calls.","Beyond asfotase alfa, we are also evaluating three additional highly innovative therapeutic candidates as treatment for patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders across a wide range of therapeutic areas. Looking briefly at these programs, first in our metabolic disease area, which includes asfotase alfa, we are also accelerating the development of our cPMP replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A, a severe ultra-rare and genetic metabolic disorder that is fatal in newborns.","Following successful completion of the initial cPMP manufacturing runs at the end of last year, pre-IND toxicology studies are now underway. We are currently increasing our cPMP manufacturing to provide sufficient supplies to commence clinical studies in normal volunteers in early 2013, as well as to treat the current MoCD patients receiving earlier supplies of cPMP.","Second, we continued to enroll patients in a Phase I study to characterize the mechanism of action and develop initial safety data for ALXN1102, an IV formulation of the novel alternative pathway complement inhibitor known as TT30. I would note that as a part of the same Phase I study, we have also initiated dosing of a subcutaneous formulation of TT30 now known as ALXN1103. Once we have the data from these studies we can better evaluate the overall therapeutic potential of ALXN1102 and ALXN1103 for various disease targets.","And third, we continued to enroll subjects in a Phase I clinical study of ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, which is a product of our antibody discovery technologies. This Phase I study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this compound in healthy volunteers.","In closing, I am pleased with the progress that Alexion\u2019s R&D team made in the second quarter of 2012. We continue to drive our R&D programs forward with urgency to help patients and families suffering with severe and ultra-rare disorders. I look forward to updating you on our progress on future conference calls.","I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?","Lenny Bell","Thanks, Steve. We are pleased to serve an increasing number of patients with PNH and now also patients with aHUS. We will continue accelerating our development programs with a goal of rapidly bringing life transforming innovations to more patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders.","And as always, we thank all of those who make our work possible, our employees, researchers and physicians around the world, and of course, patients and their families who are always at the forefront of what we do.","Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham of JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I joined the call a little late, so anything remarkable about the findings from Brazil and Turkey, the PNH discovery, whether it\u2019s specifically from diagnostics or promotion or awareness and do you feel like you can leverage this potentially into other countries? And I have one follow-up.","Lenny Bell","Yeah. So this is part A. Thanks very much, Geoff. This is Lenny. I think as we commonly see that as we\u2019re able to expand into new countries, we are in each country able to find patients who have been previously diagnosed, and we find this very commonly. This was the case initially in the United States five or so years ago, and certainly was the case in other European countries.","We find that the same \u2013 we anticipate the same prevalence of PNH to be the case in Brazil and Turkey as we do in other countries, as well in the West. And we certainly expect then the diagnostic initiatives that physicians are increasingly implementing say for example in Brazil and Turkey, as they have in the United States and England and Germany and elsewhere, to result in a relatively steady from here increase in number of patients being diagnosed and with physicians seeking treatment with Soliris.","Dave, any further color to that?","David Hallal","Yeah. Just to reiterate, Geoff, that it\u2019s you deploy a field team to educate on PNH. They identify patients who were previously diagnosed by physicians. And what we observed in the quarter is this initial group of patients in these two countries with that deployment move to treatment.","And now it\u2019s \u2013 so we actually see Brazil and Turkey following very much the pattern that we\u2019ve seen around the world, which now will move into our diagnostic initiatives to help them diagnose new patients with PNH.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Just to follow up, the cost I think you said in the past that you see emerging markets as maybe a third of the ultimate Soliris potential, and I guess less about sort of the bullish revenues that you\u2019re seeing and more about as you see what\u2019s going on in Turkey and Brazil, and you look towards other Latin American countries that will be coming online, do you think that emerging markets can make up more than a third of your business over time? Or I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re willing to talk about the percentage of the business, like where you are today and kind of how much growth potential there is? Thanks.","Vikas Sinha","Thanks for the question, Rachel. This is Vikas here. If you look at our breakdown of revenue by countries in what we did in 10-K in 2011, US and Europe approximately was around 75%, 76% and the rest of the world was 23%, 24%. And that we expect to grow, as David and Lenny were mentioning just now about adding Brazil, Turkey, that block over time is going to grow and we do believe that it will at some point get to a one-third level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Good morning, everyone. In terms of the characterization of the aHUS launch, I think you\u2019ve moved from gradual to steady to now very pleased. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve heard Lenny ever be very pleased with anything in the past. But I guess the question is what exactly are you seeing specifically in the marketplace or in terms of the progress you\u2019ve made that\u2019s led to this change and probably very carefully chosen adjectives?","Lenny Bell","Thank you very much for such a comment regarding how I look at my life. But no, thanks, Eric. Anyhow, I think what we continue to see is that as we learn more out in the medical community now here particularly in the United States and with these learnings, of course, anticipate to spread across Europe and over time Latin America, Asia and so forth is that by educating physicians we can get to patients earlier and help them with the sort of demonstrated effect of Soliris and the package insert here in the United States.","It literally is just following the path that we\u2019ve laid out. It\u2019s helping physicians understand and be aware of the disease severity and the importance of an earlier intervention, coupled with a tremendous effort to be able to provide drug faster all around the country.","Dave can provide a lot more color, though.","David Hallal","Well, Eric, I\u2019d say one thing that we\u2019re pleased about is just the diversity of the early observations. Treaters or prescribers being both hematologists and nephrologists looking at the patient, seeing patients with, as I mentioned, presenting with their first clinical presentation of the disease and some patients that have had the disease for quite some time and are suffering from chronic kidney damage.","Seeing a nice mix of younger patients, as I mentioned, as well as those with adults. So really the diversity of the early observations gives us confidence that there\u2019s an opportunity to serve increasing numbers of patients over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Friedman. Please proceed.","Lenny Bell","Operator, also before the question\u2019s asked, I think we can go back to our regular routine of allowing the ABCs from the previous questioners as well.","Operator","No problem.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for taking the question. Could you maybe just lay out the other countries that you\u2019re looking to try and enter over the next six to 12 months? And for these countries that you\u2019re entering now, are you trying to enter with a label and a plan for both PNH and aHUS? Or is it still leading with PNH and then following up with aHUS over some period of time? Thanks.","David Hallal","Yeah. So, David, it\u2019s David. Clearly, we\u2019re leading with PNH as we enter new countries and we are looking obviously in Latin America beyond Brazil to a next group of countries; also looking at some other countries in Europe, Middle East and potentially to a lesser extent out in Asia.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And so what\u2019s the \u2013 sorry, just as a quick follow-up, what\u2019s the time delay between introducing aHUS \u2013 PNH and then aHUS? Is it something that\u2019s happening relatively quickly? Or is there like a 12-month delay to get everything set up and running?","David Hallal","It\u2019s really country specific, David. So in some countries you lead, as you were suggesting, with a registration and an approval and other countries if there\u2019s an opportunity say with name patient sales, that time point may actually be shortened between PNH and aHUS.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","David Hallal","Yup.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Shane \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi. This is Shane calling in for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. Thinking about the upcoming data on neuromyelitis optica, could you speak about the similarities and differences between myasthenia gravis and NMO? I may be thinking about this a little too simplistically, but the basis of the two disease seem similar where auto antibodies attacking a well-defined host target and the complement system causing the cell damage. And so my question is whether there\u2019s any evidence that you\u2019ve gathered from your myasthenia gravis that is or based on your understanding of the path of physiology of myasthenia gravis and NMO that could be applicable to NMO and perhaps give you some confidence that it could also work in NMO?","Steve Squinto","Well, I think as you started with your opening lines of your question, I think the most important learning I believe that we\u2019ve taken from both trials is focusing on patients that clearly have antibody and complement mediated disease, I think, is really the key point. I would not say that that would be common place to all patients with NMO or MG, but I think the fact that our trial focused on that patient population, and also focused on patients with more severe disease has been really informative.","And when we think about now the design of the next trials and are currently meeting with investigators really around the world to design those trials, I think we will be focusing in on looking to evaluate eculizumab in probably the most severe forms of both of those diseases. But I think the antibody complement mediated piece of it is the common ground.","Shane \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from Geoff Meacham of JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan","Great. Thanks for the follow-up. So I knew you guys were talking earlier about the diversity of aHUS patients. And I\u2019m just curious, based on the broad range of patients that you\u2019re seeing if there\u2019s a chance that reimbursement across Europe would try to segment the populations, for example by age or disease severity, kidney pathology? Thanks.","Lenny Bell","Yeah. Thanks very much, and again, we apologize for not getting your follow-up question earlier. But I think generally certainly aHUS, as you know, summary product characteristics in Europe is very broad actually and without any limitation that\u2019s meaningful, frankly, with very strong endorsement based upon the clinical data that the CHMP reviewed and finished the document.","So we don\u2019t actually expect in aHUS there to be significant limitations of patients who present clinically with disease as represented the summary product characteristics. Obviously, there\u2019s a series of discussions that will occur over time with different governments, but I think we consider that to be unlikely.","Geoff Meacham \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. Thanks.","Lenny Bell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter of Canaccord. Please proceed.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord","Taking my question. Just following up on aHUS, have you learned anything from your initial educational initiative that would cause you or have caused you to change your messaging or physician targeting? And how are the educational efforts at the critical care setting taking fruit?","David Hallal","Yes, Salveen. So the one thing that I think we\u2019ve had pretty close to right at launch but clearly we adjust and modify our plans is just looking at the broad range of patients that I indicated earlier in the call is really what\u2019s the plan? How do you line up the breadth of clinical data that we have from our submissions to the regulatory agencies, lining that up really for each one of those segments so that physicians are aware of this is a very high risk for the patients at first clinical presentation of TMA, but also even with later disease what the long-term benefits of treatment could be.","So it\u2019s really just been a focus on tightening that down. I think subsequently one key learning on top of that has been really the equal interest in hematologists in being well educated on this disease as much as nephrologists. And depending, as I mentioned I think on a previous call, depending on the consult that is made in a hospital either at first dose to a nephrologist or a hematologist that what we typically see is then the hematologist may move forward and manage those patients. So that\u2019s been a significant observation.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord","Great. And then just following up on an earlier point, can you mention maybe which new countries you\u2019re going to be entering with PNH next and the timeframe there?","David Hallal","Yeah. So in Latin America, we\u2019re looking at Argentina, Colombia and potentially out further than that, Venezuela. Clearly, one of the things that we have spoken about over the last few quarters is not just Brazil and Turkey, but of course Russia.","And Russia\u2019s something that we think we have an opportunity for that to come on line some time mid 2013. So we\u2019re obviously very excited in looking to deploy operations in that important country. And we look in the Scandinavian countries in Europe, as well as Israel and other Middle East opportunities are at forefront for us.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks also for taking my follow-up. It\u2019s also with regard to aHUS and sort of the diversity of practice that\u2019s out there. Have you noticed any diversity in terms of discontinuation rates upon physicians? Are some inclined to stop therapy after initial flare versus chronic therapy? And how have your efforts been to educate the market in that respect?","Steve Squinto","Yeah. So it\u2019s a great question, Eric, and clearly we \u2013 part of our disease educational platform is obviously educating on the chronicity of the disease due to a genetic mutation. As we had anticipated really, compliance is generally good in patients diagnosed with aHUS, and it appears similar to that of the levels that we\u2019ve come to expect with PNH.","Importantly, the US package insert makes clear that patients with aHUS that miss a dose or discontinue Soliris are very high risk for severe TMA complications, and then the label in Europe specifically states Soliris treatment is recommended to continue for a patient\u2019s lifetime. And so our efforts are really to educate not only on the disease, but the recommendations from the US and European authorities. We haven\u2019t necessarily detected patterns in terms of who is more likely to stop treatment at this point.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Please proceed.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Bernstein","Thanks very much for letting me jump in here. A couple questions. First, Vikas, just a little bit on the tax rate just moving away from revenue for a second. You\u2019ve had a very low tax rate this quarter, but you\u2019ve maintained your guidance for the year and it seems to imply that your tax rate\u2019s going to be around 10% in the back half of the year. Is that what we should be using going forward? Or are there are some sort of one-time factors that are causing it to bounce around and it should stay at the range that we\u2019ve seen the first half of the year? And I just want to have a follow-up on asfotase manufacturing. Thanks.","Vikas Sinha","Okay. Geoff, in terms of the tax rate, we didn\u2019t change the guidance for second half because it just feel a little bit more on the lower end of that 8% to 10% range. And the second quarter, definitely we had a lot of entries going in and out because of the structuring of the Enobia transaction and several other factors that came in.","You saw that on the GAAP side too, which led to higher income on the US side in Q2, which led a higher absorption of the NOLs in Q2. So we\u2019ll look at it once again in Q3, but at this point I think we look at as second half moving into second half and as we grow into global infrastructure grows and our sales grow into countries outside of US too, we will see that impact towards the lower end of the 8% to 10% guidance. So that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t change the guidance.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Bernstein","Okay. And then just on asfotase, you highlighted steps to optimize manufacturing. I\u2019m wondering if you could tell us what those steps are and what kind of capacity you have, but most importantly, do you think you can bring asfotase to sort of a ballpark of the cost per patient that you\u2019ve managed to achieve for Soliris over time? Thanks.","Steve Squinto","Yes. So, Geoff, I think just very simply, and any time you step into a new product and a new process it takes a little while to get used to that process and learn that process. The good news is because the product as an Fc domain it\u2019s much like an antibody, so it\u2019s pretty much right in our sweet spot and our comfort zone.","So our manufacturing group has gotten very familiar with the process that was established by Enobia, and I think has made a good progress in terms of perfecting that to a certain degree. And really what I mean by that is we have much more reproducible lot-to-lot preparations of the drug at this point.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Bernstein","Do you think you can get the cost to a reasonable range?","Steve Squinto","I think it\u2019s, again, because the protein got an Fc domain and it\u2019s much like an antibody in terms of the recovery process that will be put in place, I think we\u2019ll probably be in a similar range.","Geoffrey Porges \u2013 Bernstein","Terrific. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Rachel McMinn of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thanks very much. I guess I also wanted to about asfotase alfa and just really a clarification. I think, Steve, you mentioned something about that you were going to be discussing plans with regulators with an eye towards a 2014 filing. And that just \u2013 it sounded a little bit different than the way you talked about it before and I just wanted to understand if there was something else besides the natural history study that you really needed to discuss with regulators. I guess I wasn\u2019t aware that there were any other outside issue. Thanks.","Steve Squinto","Really the only thing that was meant by that is, of course, Enobia had their own discussions with regulators. Now that we\u2019ve become much more familiar with the program and the product and the trials and the data. I think as we would always do, it\u2019s just prudent on our part to have our own discussions with regulators and be clear on the path forward that we\u2019re going to take.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","So there\u2019s actually a pathway for you to do that just by sheer nature of you being a new sponsor, there\u2019s a regulatory pathway for you to request any...","Steve Squinto","There are number of avenues that one can take to have meetings with regulators. It\u2019s not just simply as the new sponsor. There are a number of venues, a number of avenues that one can take to engage with regulators on the programs.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","I see. And are there I guess any particular issue you want to highlight or can you give us timing of when you plan to meet with regulator?","Steve Squinto","Well, mostly what we want to do is update the regulators on where we are with the manufacturing process so that we\u2019re in agreement and understanding on the production of the program \u2013 the product for the program, and also just to layout our intent to do the placebo-controlled juvenile trial. The natural history trial is something we believe the regulators wanted from earlier discussion they had with Enobia.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Gotcha. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey. It\u2019s Navdeep substituting in for Robyn, and congrats on the solid quarter. Just trying to better understand SG&A, what caused you to increase SG&A guidance? And is it due to increased sales infrastructure investment for PNH or aHUS? And then I have a follow-up.","David Hallal","Yeah. So as I mentioned, we\u2019re looking to selectively invest and expand our operations to serve more patients. So one of the things obviously that we\u2019re looking to do on a country-by-country basis is assess what is needed to reach all of the hematologists, adult and pediatric nephrologists to support both PNH and aHUS. So we made the decision ahead of the aHUS launch to move forward with one single sales team that would focus on both specialties.","So that is one of the investments that clearly we\u2019re evaluating on a country-by-country basis, now moving to Europe as we expanded in the US. And then as I mentioned, some of the new countries that we\u2019re looking just in general through meeting the needs of more patients in more countries, we\u2019re investing in countries like Russia so that we can be in a position to serve those patients into 2013.","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks. And now that Soliris has been approved for aHUS for I think two full quarters now, any notable differences in the EU versus the US launch and maybe the portion of adults versus children? Thanks.","David Hallal","Yeah. So I\u2019ll just \u2013 first as we mentioned during the call, we\u2019re just at the very, very earliest stages in Europe with really just the initial patients beginning or commencing treatment in Germany. For really the majority of Europe it\u2019s a really later this year and into 2013 as we move forward with country-by-country reimbursement processes. What we\u2019re focused on in those countries either with our commercial staff or our medical teams is obviously disease awareness and education and diagnostic initiatives in advance of those reimbursement discussions. So it\u2019s really too hard to tell if Europe differs in any way from that of the US. The subsequent question you had?","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Deutsche Bank","It was just on the portion of adults versus children and did it differ from what you had originally expected?","David Hallal","No, we\u2019re really currently serving both pediatric and adult patients, and frankly, we\u2019re not surprised and we don\u2019t necessarily intend to provide specific breakdowns in the future.","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Barclays. Please proceed.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays","Hey. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Two questions; number one, now you have launched in Germany already, can you give us a little bit more color in terms of the pricing per milligram base compared to what you had in PNH? And if it\u2019s the same, should we expect that across the other countries in Europe as well? And then secondly, for the NMO data we should see in the second half of the year, I know the primary outcome was the relapse frequency here. Do you think that\u2019s the main approval endpoint by the regulatory agency? Thank you.","Lenny Bell","Yeah. Thanks very much. It\u2019s Lenny. I\u2019ll take the first half. I mean the vials in Germany for aHUS are the same vials as in Germany for PNH, and so there\u2019s no change, nor would there have been anticipated any change for the second indication for our already approved drug. And in regard to NMO, Steve?","Steve Squinto","Yeah. I think exacerbation rate is a very important clinically, a very meaningful and very important endpoint as the number of relapses does seem to correlate very well with disease severity. In terms of whether that\u2019s approvable or not, as I said on the call, we intend to meet with regulators later this year, and those are the types of discussions we\u2019ll have with regulators.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks and congratulations on a good quarter. A couple of questions. first on the NMO data that\u2019s expected later this year, the last couple of times you\u2019ve spoken to \u2013 meeting with the regulatory agencies or speaking with investigators regarding the next set of trials, prior to the data release the data has been positive. Is that something that we should expect when the data is eventually released? So that\u2019s question number one.","Steve Squinto","We\u2019ll, I\u2019m not really sure I understood the question. I mean I can tell you where we are now is we are meeting with various numbers of investigators really worldwide to talk about what that next trial design should look like, and we\u2019re doing that so that we can have a very productive meeting with regulators later in the year. I\u2019m not really sure what you\u2019re asking.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","I guess the question I\u2019m asking is are you sufficiently confident in the ongoing study that will support moving into the next line of clinical trials?","Lenny Bell","Well, we certainly anticipate there\u2019ll be additional clinical trials. Obviously, the purpose of meeting with investigators sequentially and then with regulators is to determine subsequent to those next clinical trials. And I think that we are encouraged obviously, and when we have some clarity there with regulators, importantly we\u2019ll certainly look to provide that.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay. And the other question I had was just longer-term planning. Obviously, you\u2019ve increased SG&A spending this year, just given the opportunity that you foresee. Can we just talk a little bit more about the additional indications that you\u2019re pursuing and what that would mean in terms of sales force size and structure?","Lenny Bell","Well, I mean I\u2019ll just take the two that I actually addressed. One is STEC-HUS and then one is asfotase out a few years. STEC-HUS, as I mentioned, our nephrology therapeutic area is in the early stages of really trying to best understand characteristics of the disease and diagnostic patterns in the US and Europe. And I think one of the things we\u2019re pretty gratified by is that it looks like it\u2019s going to plug right into the HUS strategy.","It is literally the same physicians that would identify, diagnose and treat a patient with aHUS are those physicians that would do the same with STEC-HUS, which as we indicated, would likely be that next indication. So based upon that, we think by rightsizing the country-by-country sales teams for PNH and aHUS puts us in a very nice position to be ready for STEC-HUS.","Vikas Sinha","And yeah, with regards to when we look at SG&A as a percentage of sales, we are very consciously \u2013 we consciously watch that to bring it down to our long-term range of 28% to 30% that we have guided at times. We have currently even after the increase in the expenses that we are talking about, our objective was to get this \u2013 get to 23% this year. We will be somewhere between 22%, 23%, even this year. So we have been very conscious on that front.","Lenny Bell","And then just commercially, we would slowly, as I indicated, build a focus with a therapeutic area around metabolic disorders to support hypophosphotasia and asfotase alfa. And then that\u2019s something that we would, as I\u2019ve indicated in a previous couple of calls, start to do now and subsequent quarters.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great. Is it possible for you to just give us some measure of what that sales force could look like inside, relative to the one you have today?","Vikas Sinha","It\u2019d be bigger probably.","Lenny Bell","Thanks very much.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thank you much.","Lenny Bell","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Roden of UBS. Please proceed.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks for taking the question. David, I was intrigued by your comments on STEC-HUS. As you approach the work that you\u2019ve done in preparing for that potential launch late 2013\/2014, can you talk about your initial findings at all in terms of the disease and diagnosis patterns? And maybe if there any sort of key points that we should be thinking about as we think about modeling that indication out?","David Hallal","Yeah. It\u2019s really too early to tell. We\u2019re trying to understand what percentage of STEC-HUS say is derived from outbreaks versus just patient-by-patient. I do think that the one key thing that the nephrology team is focused on obviously is the difference between the two diseases, STEC-HUS and aHUS. aHUS is a genetic lifelong disease. STEC-HUS presents some in similar ways to that, but that is something that is not a lifelong disease. And I think that that\u2019s something that we are acutely aware of as we prepare commercially really to support both of those indications.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Liang of Leerink Swann. Please proceed.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","Thanks very much. First question is on \u2013 well, of the $30 million sequential growth, quarter-over-quarter sequential growth for Soliris, can you give us some color on what is the contribution of US versus ex-US and if you can, aHUS versus PNH?","Lenny Bell","Yeah. Thanks very much, Howard. It\u2019s Lenny. I\u2019d say \u2013 the first thing I\u2019d say obviously that there was a $3.3 million obviously that was from prior period in 2011 that was recorded. So if we look \u2013 delete that from it organically and focus on in-quarter growth, I\u2019d say the most important contributor was continued growth in PNH in our core territories really spread nicely across US, Europe and Japan.","Number two, I would actually look at the contribution of the aHUS launch in its early stages now in United States certainly much more so than we\u2019ll be in the even earlier stage in Europe. And then finally, obviously I would look at the one-time increase in new patients really coming from Turkey and Brazil as we had been expanding over the last several quarters our organization there. So that\u2019s how I\u2019d rank order the contributors.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","Okay. And in the past, you\u2019ve talked about a synergy between aHUS marketing and PNH. Are you continuing to see that?","Steve Squinto","Yeah. Howard, I think as I mentioned with our observation now two or three quarters with aHUS in the US is that a substantial proportion of patients are being manage by hematologists, and we feel like over the last five, six years we\u2019ve really developed a sweet spot there commercially in terms of building relationships, educating and serving hematologists and their patients. So that obviously is helping us not only create true marketing synergy, but even that obviously with the one sales force that we\u2019ve deployed in a expanded way.","Howard Liang \u2013 Leerink Swann","Thanks and congrats.","Lenny Bell","Thanks, Howard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond of Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Chris Raymond \u2013 Robert Baird","Okay. Thanks. Just to maybe follow up to one of your answers to Howard\u2019s, one of Howard\u2019s questions. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to be willing to give much color on this, but you talked about how there\u2019s a substantial portion of aHUS prescribing by hems. Can you maybe give us any color in terms of the dynamic there and the split between hematologists and nephrologists? Are you seeing any trends where perhaps you\u2019re seeing a larger proportion of prescriptions written by nephs or is that static? That would be great. Thanks.","Steve Squinto","Yeah. And I\u2019ve said this in the past, but it\u2019s actually similar. There\u2019s a similar proportion of patients with aHUS being treated with Soliris from hematologists as there are with the combination of adult and pediatric nephrologists. And so it\u2019s \u2013 that kind of gives us a flavor and is a bit of a surprise for us. And as I mentioned, having significant leverage in the hematology space has been something that we\u2019re very pleased with.","Chris Raymond \u2013 Robert Baird","Great. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Dr. Bell for closing. Please proceed, sir.","Lenny Bell","Thank you very much, operator, and thank you, all, for joining us on our Q2 2012 call, and I look forward to speaking to you over the near term. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Irving Adler, Executive Director of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Irving Adler","Thank you operator. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the third quarter 2013 and our outlook for the remainder of this year. Today's call will be led by Dr. Leonard Bell, our Chief Executive Officer. Lenny will be joined by members of Alexion management; Vikas Sinha, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; David Hallal, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Martin MacKay, Executive Vice President and Global Head of R&D; Steve Squinto, Executive Vice President and Chief Global Operations Officer; and Saqib Islam, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy and Portfolio Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements apply only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after this call.","I'd also like to remind you that our reported non-GAAP operating results are adjusted from our U.S. GAAP operating results for certain items that we described in our press release issued this morning. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the release.","Thank you. Lenny?","Leonard Bell","Thank you, Irving. In the third quarter of 2013, Alexion's global organization continues o execute strongly on our mission to develop and deliver life-transforming therapies to patients with severe and life-threatening disorders that are also ultra rare. During the quarter, our Commercial operations teams provided Soliris to an increasing number of patients with PNH and aHUS worldwide. And our R&D team advanced our 10 lead development programs toward our anticipated 6 product approvals, starting in 2014.","Looking first at our commercial operations in PNH in Q3, we again continue to demonstrate a strong uptake of Soliris therapy in our core territories. This reflects the progress we have made in helping physicians to continue to diagnose patients with PNH, either from a significant prevalent population or the national incidence of new cases PNH that have developed each year. We are confident that we have a significant opportunity o serve even more patients with PNH in both our most established markets as well as in new countries. Our continued PNH growth in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan was, again, augmented by our progress in Turkey, Brazil and Russia, together with the growing contribution from Latin America.","Turning to our aHUS launch, we continue to be pleased with a steady addition of new patients in the United States during Q3, and with our initial progress in key European countries. In particular, we're pleased that in mid-September NHS England nationally commissioned Soliris for aHUS, under a broad policy which we expect will form the basis of ongoing access to Soliris through the anticipated NICE decision in 2014. Beyond the United States and Europe, an important milestone was reached when Soliris was approved for aHUS in Japan late in Q3. With initial aHUS patients commencing therapy in Q4, we are pleased that we will enter 2014 with our aHUS operations fully in place in Japan, as we increase our momentum to serve more patients around the world.","In Q3, we continue to experience the positive impact of our selective country sale team expansion on our individual country performance. Enabling us to more rapidly identify both PNH and aHUS patients. Looking forward, we are increasingly confident in our ability to continue to strongly grow the number of patients we serve with both of these severe and life-threatening disorders. Additionally, the ongoing strength of the global aHUS launch, continues to reaffirm our view that our opportunity to serve these patients is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH, and perhaps larger. For example, in the United States, there are now more patients receiving Soliris for aHUS than there were patients receiving Soliris at a similar time following PNH approval.","Turning to R&D. Q3 was another noteworthy quarter across the breadth of our development pipeline. I would like to note 5 items in particular. First, in July, regulators in both the United States and Europe granted orphan drug status to Soliris for NMO. Second, in September, researchers presented positive preliminary data from the eculizumab deceased-donor AMR kidney transplant study. Third, researchers presented strongly positive asfotase alfa data in a broader population of infants and young children with HPP. These data are consistent with earlier results as we continue to drive toward our worldwide regulatory filings in pediatric onset HPP in 2014. Fourth, we have recently had positive discussions with the FDA regarding our program in DGF. And as a consequence, we are now planning a single multinational registration study, which we anticipate commencing in 2014. And finally, this morning we announced that our cPMP replacement therapy has been designated as a breakthrough therapy by the FDA as a potential treatment for patients with MoCD Type A.","During Q3, we also continued to make steady progress in the global expansion of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. We continue to implement improvements in our Rhode Island manufacturing and quality operations, and look forward to the FDA reinspection of this facility in the first half of 2014.","I'm pleased also to note that, following the EU approval in Q2, the FDA has now also approved the Singapore contract facility as a new and additional source for the manufacture of Soliris. And finally, we continue the rapid rollout of our technical and quality operations in Dublin, Ireland, an important element in the expansion of our global supply platform.","As we have discussed previously, and based only on what we currently have in the pipeline at this point, we anticipate a series of 6 potential major product approvals between 2014 and 2018, starting with our second product asfotase alfa in late 2014, and then followed by Soliris in the deceased- and living-donor kidney transplant settings; Soliris in delayed graft function; Soliris in one or more neurology indications; our third product, cPMP, for infants with MoCD Type A; and we expect to launch one or more of our next-generation follow-on products to Soliris within the same 2014 to 2018 period.","As we advance towards these 6 potential product approvals, we expect more than 10 key development milestones in 2014 alone. As Martin will describe further, these include, with regard to asfotase alfa, our U.S., EU and Japan filings for marketing approval.","In AMR, the completion of enrollment and dosing in both our ongoing living-donor AMR study and our newly expanded deceased-donor study, as well as the availability of additional clinical data. For each of DGF, NMO and MG, significant advances in enrollment of the single registration study in each of these indications.","For cPMP, acceleration of our program with completion of the retrospective data collection study, completion of enrollment in the natural history study and initiation of the synthetic cPMP bridging study in patients with MoCD Type A.","For ALXN1007, the initiation of 2 different Phase II proof-of-concept clinical studies in patients with severe and ultra-rare disorders.","And finally, turning to our next generation Soliris candidates, we expect to initiate clinical studies with our first 2 molecules in 2014.","Turning briefly to our financial performance. Our Q3 results reflected 36% growth in revenues and 39% growth in non-GAAP net income year-on-year. This continued strong performance has enabled us to increase our 2013 guidance for both revenues and net income for the third time this year.","At this point I'll turn the call over to Vikas for a closer look at our third quarter financial performance and our expectations for the remainder of 2013. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","Thanks, Lenny. As we reported in this morning's press release, Q3 2013 was another period of strong financial performance for the company. We, again, achieved steady growth in revenues and profits from our PNH and aHUS operations, as well as robust cash flow.","I would like to highlight a few points regarding our Q3 results, and then point to some key considerations regarding the final quarter of 2013.","Soliris sales in Q3 were $400.4 million, a 36% increase compared to Q3 2012. Our PNH operations continued to grow strongly in all our territories. In aHUS, we are gratified by the steady uptake of Soliris in the U.S. and by our continued reimbursement progress in Western Europe during Q3.","Our strong sales performance Q3 was combined with ongoing control of both SG&A and R&D expenses, resulting in a 39% increase in non-GAAP net income, to $168 million, compared to Q3 2012 or $0.83 per share in the second quarter.","Looking at our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents at quarter-end grew by $184 million to $1.3 billion. This reflects continued strong positive cash flow from our business during the quarter.","Our Q3 GAAP results also reflected expenses totaling $20.7 million associated with two matters: a license payment under new drug discovery collaboration, as well as the settlement and dismissal of the Novartis IP litigation. These amounts are excluded from our non-GAAP results.","Turning to our guidance. We are now raising our 2013 revenue guidance to the higher and narrower range of $1,535,000,000 to $1,540,000,000. This improved revenue performance, coupled with continued discipline in our operating and manufacturing expenses, is enabling us to meaningfully improve our 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance to the higher and narrower range of $3.02 to $3.04.","I also note, that we are narrowing our R&D guidance to the range of $2.80 million to $2.85 million. SG&A is also being narrowed to the range of $440 million to $445 million.","Other items of our 2013 guidance are being reiterated. We expect that R&D expenses will increase in the fourth quarter as we continue to advance our lead development programs. As in the past, we expect that SG&A in Q4 will reflect the impact of major medical conferences and our expanded healthcare provider programs.","We are pleased with our progress in the third quarter of the year and our plans for the future. At this point, I'll turn the call over to David. David?","David L. Hallal","Thanks Vikas. In the third quarter of 2013, global revenues from our Soliris operations increased by a robust 36% compared to the same period last year. We continue to grow our PNH operations by achieving deeper penetration in the nearly 50 countries in which we serve patients. And in aHUS, we served an increasing number of patients in the U.S. and Western Europe. In addition, we received our aHUS approval in Japan in mid-September, and we are now beginning to serve initial patients with aHUS there.","During Q3, we observed the steady and continuing impact of our PNH disease awareness and diagnostic initiatives in our core territories, with the significant addition of new patients with PNH starting treatment with Soliris. In Q3, as in prior quarters, the majority of patients newly starting on Soliris were also newly diagnosed with PNH. We are gratified that our ongoing educational efforts are leading to higher rates of accurate diagnoses of PNH. We are confident that we have a significant opportunity to serve even more patients with PNH, in both our most established markets, as well as in new countries. Beyond our core territories, we continue to expand our PNH operations in additional major countries during Q3. We observed a steady rate of new patient identification and Soliris treatment initiation in Turkey, Brazil and Russia. We expect consistent growth in these countries over time, and we're increasingly confident that the aggregate of these 3 markets provides us with an opportunity to serve patients that is similar in size to the U.S. market.","Initial patients are now starting receive Soliris in South Korea, the next major country in our global PNH rollout. In addition, in Latin America, an increasing number of PNH patients are starting on Soliris, notably in Argentina and Colombia.","I would note that the aHUS launch continues to benefit our PNH operations. Sales team expansions on a country-by-country basis enable us to more rapidly identify PNH and aHUS patients. Looking forward, we are increasingly confident in our ability to continue to strongly grow the number of patients we serve with these severe and life-threatening disorders.","Turning now to aHUS. In Q3, our efforts again resulted in a steady increase in the number of new patients, in the U.S., commencing Soliris therapy, with the majority of patients starting on Soliris often presenting urgently with the life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy or TMA.","I am also pleased to report significant progress with the reimbursement processes in key European countries during the quarter. Starting with England, during Q3, NHS England nationally commissioned Soliris for the treatment of children and adults with aHUS. We expect that this new and very brought aHUS policy will form the basis of ongoing access to Soliris. The NICE decision is anticipated in 2014.","In Spain, near the end of the quarter, we obtained an agreement with the federal government regarding the use of Soliris for patients with aHUS. This now enables us to begin the reimbursement processes in individual provinces.","In Germany, in Q3, we continue to see an increasing number of aHUS patients diagnosed and treated by hospital-based nephrologists and hematologists.","In France, we continue to advance reimbursement discussions with the government and we will progress these discussions through the remainder of the year.","In Italy, during Q3, the government continued to provide Solaris through an early access program, as we advance through the reimbursement process to cover all patients with aHUS.","In Belgium, as previously discussed, funding for aHUS commenced in July. In Europe, with our significant progress year-to-date, we look forward to completing the reimbursement processes and transitioning to broader access policies in 2014.","Elsewhere, in our EMEA region, we continue to serve initial aHUS patients in Turkey in Q3. Beyond the U.S. and Europe, we were pleased that Soliris was also approved for aHUS in Japan late in Q3. As in the U.S., we have expanded our sales team in Japan to launch aHUS to hematologists and nephrologists, while the team continues to support our PNH initiatives in our smaller territories. Initial aHUS patients in Japan will begin therapy in Q4 as we obtain the necessary listings on hospital formularies.","The ongoing strength of the global aHUS launch continues to reaffirm our view that our opportunity to serve these patients is at least as large as our opportunity to serve patients with PNH and perhaps larger. For example, as one key measure, looking at the U.S. today, now 2 years post approval for aHUS, there are more patients receiving Soliris for aHUS than there were patients receiving Soliris 2 years following the PNH approval. Our view is that the incidence of aHUS is likely higher than the incidence of PNH.","While we are pleased with these aHUS results to date, we believe greater opportunities exist to work with physicians. In particular, our experience shows that high physician conviction in the diagnosis of aHUS, combined with the clear understanding of the chronic life-threatening nature of the disease and the necessity of sustained compliment blockade, maximizes optimal long-term patient outcomes and minimizes patient risk from life-threatening complications of TMA.","To support the aHUS community, we are developing enhanced disease awareness programs, further underscored by the very positive 3-year chronic Soliris treatment data being presented at ASN. As a result, we expect that physicians will increasingly appreciate the genetic and lifelong nature of aHUS and the optimal outcomes achieved with chronic Soliris treatment.","We look forward to serving more patients with PNH and aHUS in more countries in the remainder of 2013 and with a strong start to 2014. Beyond our current commercial operations, we anticipate a series of 6 potential major product approvals between 2014 and 2018, starting with our second product asfotase alfa in late 2014.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Martin for a look at our development programs. Martin?","Martin MacKay","Thanks, David. I am pleased to provide an update on key milestones in our 10 lead development programs as well as a wider view of how we are continuing to build the momentum of our global R&D organization to support an expanding yet highly-focused portfolio of clinical initiatives across multiple therapeutic areas.","To begin, I would like to discuss the progress of our development programs with eculizumab, starting with antibody-mediated rejection or AMR in kidney transplant.","I am pleased to report that during the quarter, we presented positive preliminary data at the European Society for Organ Transplantation meeting from our eculizumab multinational deceased-donor AMR trial. These data indicate that eculizumab may be an effective prophylaxis against acute AMR in highly-sensitized deceased-donor kidney recipients. In this study, the composite primary endpoint was a 9-week occurrence of post-transplantation treatment failure, which occurred in 10.6% of the 47 patients reported, including a 6.4% rate of AMR compared to an expected 30% rate of AMR in this highly-sensitized population of kidney transplant recipients.","Given the increasingly strong physician demand for eculizumab in the deceased-donor AMR setting, the positive preliminary data and the anticipated regulatory value of strengthening the data set with greater patient numbers, we have decided to now expand the study by enrolling more patients. Looking ahead into 2014, we anticipate the completion of enrollment and dosing in both our ongoing living-donor AMR study and our newly expanded deceased-donor study, and the availability of additional primary endpoint data from the deceased-donor study. We will also explore the potential to provide initial primary endpoint data from the living-donor study during 2014, prior to the anticipated 12 month follow-up data.","In our delayed graft function, or DGF program, we have now met with the FDA to discuss plans for a company-sponsored multinational study with eculizumab, and we expect to meet with the EMEA next month. Based on these discussions to date, we are now planning a single multinational DGF registration study, which we anticipate commencing in 2014.","Turning, now, to our neurology program, in neuromyelitis optica or NMO, we are on track to conduct a single registration trial with eculizumab in relapsing NMO. Based on new clinical information that recently became available, we have further strengthened the study designing to include a broader population of patients that continue to have relapses despite best available therapy. This will lead to more rapid enrollment of the study, which we now expect to commence in the first quarter of 2014.","In refractory myasthenia gravis or MG, we have also finalized the protocol for a single registration trial in, and plan to commence a study by the end of this year. Further, with regard to the lifecycle management of Soliris, well through the 2020s, we expect to advance 2 or more next-generation molecules into the clinic during 2014.","Finally, with regard to STEC-HUS, we have met with key investigators in Germany to discuss the longer-term clinical outcomes, from patients treated with best supportive care during the 2011 E. coli crisis as a potential control population. In light of the broad consensus that the most severely ill patients during the German crisis preferentially received Soliris as opposed to supportive care only, we recognize the increasing difficulty of identifying a suitable control population. Nonetheless, we and the investigators continue to analyze additional data, which we expect to continue through the end of the year.","I will now turn to our lead development programs with our second highly individual product candidate asfotase alfa. We were very pleased this quarter to announce new and strongly positive data in infant and young children with hypophosphatasia or HPP. Interim results were presented from an ongoing multinational phase II open-label study that enrolled 15 infants and children with HPP, representing a range of HPP characteristics. This study met its primary endpoint. Infants and young children with HPP treated with asfotase alfa had significant improvement in skeletal mineralization from baseline, as assessed radiographically, after 24 weeks of treatment. This response was observed as early as 12 weeks and improvement continued at 48 weeks. At 48 weeks, 100% of evaluable patients were clinically significant responders. 93% of the patients survived the first 48 weeks of treatment, with 80% of patients having improved respiratory status or requiring no respiratory support at the final analysis. Following the publication of positive infant data in the New England Journal of Medicine last year, we are excited about the current results, as they provide us with data in a broader patient population of infants and children.","We also continue to collect additional data as we work towards completing our registration program. We are pleased the our initial analysis, of infant natural history study, is strongly supportive of our anticipated filing. Following regulatory discussions, we have also determined that we will not now need to conduct a pre-approval placebo-controlled study in juveniles, and will instead conduct a natural history study in juveniles with HPP.","We expect to file for marketing authorization for pediatric onset HPP in the U.S. and Europe in 2014, and we also expect to file for approval in Japan in 2014.","Beyond asfotase alfa, we're evaluating additional highly innovative therapeutic candidates as treatment for patients with severe and life-threatening disorders that are also ultra-rare.","In our metabolic disease area, we continue to accelerate development of our cPMP Replacement Therapy, which has just received breakthrough designation for the treatment of patients with Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A, an ultra-rare genetic metabolic disorder that causes catastrophic neurologic damage in newborns.","We are moving this program to forward on 3 levels. First, we're continuing with a retrospective data collection from the small number of individual newborns with MoCD, who have been being treated with the earlier from of cPMP. Second, I am pleased to report that now we have initiated a natural history study in MoCD patients. And third, having completed doing with our synthetic cPMP, and a study of healthy volunteers, we expect to initiate a synthetic cPMP bridging study in 2014.","With regard to ALXN1007, our novel anti-inflammatory antibody, I am now pleased to report that the PK\/PD, and safety results from the single-dose study, allowed us to progress to a multi-dose Phase I clinical study in healthy volunteers. In addition, I am also pleased to announce that we have recently met with regulators to discuss the initiation of a Phase II proof-of-concept study in patients, which we expect to commence in early 2014. As we discussed, we are exploring parallel development of ALXN1007 in additional severe life-threatening and ultra-rare conditions. And finally, enrollment continues in a Phase I study of ALXN1102, ALXN1103 our novel alternative pathway complement inhibitor.","As we improved the effectiveness of our R&D organization to accelerate our in-house lead programs, we remain keenly focused on targeting our disciplined financial investment to programs with the potential to provide dramatic breakthrough medical value to patients with devastating and ultra-rare disorders.","In addition, our broader capabilities in translational medicine, clinical operations, medical sciences and regulatory affairs, position us to further expand our research and development pipeline by accessing a range of promising new technologies and assets. We will do this through disciplined research collaborations, licensing and acquisitions. Where, as with our in-house programs, our focus remains on therapeutic candidates with life-transforming potential.","In summary, we look forward to achieving more than 10 key development milestones in 2014, including our U.S., EU and Japan filings for marketing approval for asfotase alfa. In AMR, the completion of enrollment, and dosing in both our ongoing living-donor AMR study and our newly expanded deceased-donor study, as well as data presentations. For DGS, NMO and MG, significant advances enrollment of our single registration studies.","For cPMP, the acceleration of our development program, with completion of the retrospective data collection study, completion of enrollment in the natural history study and initiation of the bridging study in patients with MoCD Type A.","For ALXN1007, the initiation of 2 Phase II proof-of-concept clinical studies. And for our next-generation Soliris candidates, initiation of the first clinical study with 2 candidates. I look forward to updating you on these programs on future calls. I will now turn the call back to Lenny. Lenny?.","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Martin. In the third quarter of 2013, we accomplished a significant number of important clinical and commercial milestones while continuing to build our global organization to serve more patients worldwide in 2014 and future years.","As always, we thank everyone who makes our work possible, including employees, researchers, physicians, shareholders and, especially, patients and their families. Working together we can expect to reach many additional milestones in the years ahead. Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess I'll just ask one, but I wanted to talk about the -- you guys have talked about the aHUS opportunity in Japan. Are there any subtleties in practice or in patient identification that you can point to when you compare to the U.S. or Europe? I just want to get a sense for the ramp potential.","David L. Hallal","Yes. Just thinking back to the aHUS launch, Q4 2011, as we described with aHUS, different from PNH, there isn't necessarily as a large prevalent pool of patients, given the high levels of mortality and patients that progress to ESRD with aHUS. And so, just as we saw in the U.S., we would expect that there'll be a combination of patients from a smaller prevalent pool, not necessarily a lot of pent-up demand, but that our team would be in place to begin to help initial patients who are newly presenting with TMA. So we would expect that same type of pattern, as we've expanded our sales team in Japan, that we saw in the U.S.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","There is no -- just related to that, there's no registry or patient identification that was done ahead of time?","David L. Hallal","From an Alexion perspective, like in the U.S., what we try to do for our expanded sales team is provide them some information on where the nephrologists and hematologists are, that are more likely to have had experience with TMA and see those types of patients.","Irving Adler","And, you know, Geoff also had plenty, [ph] But we'd certainly would expect that, as David described, the vast majority of patients commencing Soliris treatment are patients who are presenting with rapidly progressive TMA. So in essence, long-term identification, quarters or years in advance, unfortunately, wouldn't serve those patients best.","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen Investments.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Probably another question for David on aHUS. It sounds like you think you can do a little bit better with persistency of dosing. Could you tell us what percent of patients you think might be getting the drug in a more acute versus chronic setting? And then, maybe you could provide a little bit of insight into any pricing concessions that you're being required to take in Europe to get approved reimbursement?","Leonard Bell","Yes. So first, on the compliance side, as I have noted in past calls, we have observed that compliance in aHUS is generally good, but less than what we have historically seen with the very high levels for PNH. We have observed, and I did allude to this in the call, that when there is very strong physician conviction for the diagnosis of aHUS, and a very good understanding of the chronic, lifelong genetic nature of the disease, that we are seeing very, very successful opportunities to serve patients over the long run. As you know, from our clinical trials, not every patient, for example, is going to be identified with a genetic mutation. And that was a myth that we were addressing with our disease awareness program, at launch, is that anywhere from 30% to 50% of patients will not have an identifiable mutation. That's an example of, with further education, helping physicians have a greater conviction for making that diagnosis. And when that's in place, there is, generally, a much better understanding as to the need of Soliris, chronically. And then, as I mentioned at ASN, we're looking forward to the presentation of our three-year data, where Soliris was provided chronically with those patients, where we have seen, over time, improved and sustained patient outcomes, as it relates to hematologic and, also, renal outcomes. The second part of your question regarding pricing, what we have generally seen when we look at most products in most European countries, there is typically an annual price revision. I think it's important that I note the following: PNH and aHUS are each life-threatening disorders in which Soliris has a life-transforming impact; PNH and aHUS are ultra-rare, such that both diseases, in aggregate, still fall well within the parameters of being considered ultra-rare, or an ultra-orphan drug. aHUS disproportionately is affecting young children and is associated with the even higher rates of severe morbidities and mortality of PNH. And I think, in light of the efficacy of Soliris for the patients with both PNH and aHUS, which is confirmed by the label, we're anticipating that governments will recognize the value for Soliris with aHUS, and we would anticipate smaller and less frequent price revisions than are typically seen with other products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn with Bank of America.","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If I can squeeze in part A and a part B. For part A, can you just clarify your filing timelines for asfotase alfa and, I guess, I'm trying to understand just your view, has that changed for adults, potentially, in the label? And then, just as a part B, I'm curious if there's been any change in your view on going into dry AMD following the Roche data?","Leonard Bell","Thanks, Rachel. In terms of our HPP filing plans, clearly, the breakthrough designation that we got, earlier in the year, was very positive, and that's really allowed us to have more frequent discussions with the regulators and, clearly, the fact that we will not have to do this pre-approval, placebo-controlled trial is encouraging. We will, though, have to do a natural history study. So in terms of the timelines, I don't think they're going to affected in that respect, this won't accelerate. And maybe to punctuate those timelines, we're really looking at midyear 2014. We continue to have discussions with regulators in the United States, Europe and, of course, Japan, now. But that's the timeline that we're looking at.","Vikas Sinha","And Rachel, regarding Part B, subpart 1, little i double a, we actually, as you know, have a...","Rachel L. McMinn - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I can add some more, yes.","Leonard Bell","That's why... now, give me the nomenclature so we keep track of them. I thought, otherwise, other people would get lost in the call. So I think that we have a -- we believe, confidently, that we have a portfolio, actually, a pretty broad portfolio, as it turns out, of novel, highly innovative asset focused on targeting competent multiple different steps in the cascade. Virtually, all of which are applicable, frankly, should we look to go forward in the multitude of different eye disorders. And it's something that we're constantly focused on and, frankly, our focus has increased somewhat. I think that was Part F, though.","Operator","And our next question from Salveen Richter with Canaccord.","Salveen J. Richter - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division",".","And just with regard to asfotase alfa, just trying to understand when you look at the onset of disease per age group, how do you think of the proportion of those who show signs and symptoms as peds versus older? And how should we think about the severity of these cases as they progress?","Leonard Bell","Yes. So, Salveen, we're in the very early stages, as I've indicated in previous calls, as we've established a metabolic therapeutic area to prepare for, a launch late in 2014. We're still accessing it, as with any ultra-rare disease, it's just really hard to tell and the literature, in general, points you in different directions, depending on when the incidence and prevalence studies were done. What our hope is, is that, over time, we'll have a much better feel for the proportion of patients, one, that have HPT, two, when their onset of symptoms were, and three, how old they are at that time in which we identify them. And I think that those are the key factors that will give us a better understanding in the future.","Salveen J. Richter - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Great. And then, just for the timelines again, so you're expecting to file by midyear, but then, have drug the approved by year end, in U.S. So you're expecting kind of a short turnaround time there?","Leonard Bell","That's our current expectation.","Operator","And next, we go to David Friedman with Morgan Stanley.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the delayed-graft function Phase III program? I guess is there anything you can share around what type of data you shared with the regulators and anything around the trial design at all?","Martin MacKay","Thank you, David. I'll speak to both parts of your questions. Clearly, we've had data from previous studies and from our deceased-donor study. And of course, with the expanding of that latter study, we'll expect to gain more DGF data into 2014. Our discussions with the regulators were very much around that data and, most importantly, have allowed us to plan for the single, multicenter registration study in DGF, which we feel very positive about and will start in 2014. So clearly, it was a combination of those data -- more data to come and also the positive discussions with the regulators.","Operator","And next we go to Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just one point of clarification on asfotase alfa. I was wondering if the juvenile natural history trial, is a gating factor to filing or if that's just kind of a post-approval commitment? And then, separately, any thoughts on patient registry for asfotase alfa or for HPP?","Martin MacKay","Yes. Two parts of your question there, thank you. We see it as actually being pre-approval. In saying that, we are continuing to have discussions with the regulators because of the infantile data, as you know, both from the New England paper that we published last year and also the natural history study, which we are beginning to look at results from that, so both positive. But we would see, as our preapproval commitment. And then, in terms of the second part of your question, could you just remind me?","Terence C. Flynn - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. Just a patient registry for HPP, is there any thing currently in place, or is that something you guys are working on?","Martin MacKay","Yes, indeed, we are working on it. And it really relates to David's answer which was exactly right. As we understand this disease more, both in terms of the heterogeneity of the disease, the spread about -- across ages, and also the onset at different age. The registry I believe will provide us with some really very helpful data as we continue with this program.","Operator","And next we will go two Matthew Roden with UBS.","Matthew Roden - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. I was just wondering if you can help me better understand what you mean by the cPMP bridging study? Is this about getting at the synthetic form into patients managed on the prior form of the drug? Or is that something else? And then, bigger picture, what types of clinical studies do you think you're going to need ultimately to gain approval in this indication?","Martin MacKay","Yes, you've really answered the question, it's exactly that. It's using this synthetic form of the product in patients that had previously used the recombinant form. Clearly, going forward, beyond that, we will use the synthetic form. In terms of the clinical studies, it's a really very good question. And again, as we begin to understand the pathophysiology of this disease, the risk of stating the obvious, what we would like are patients to be treated as early as possible and, of course, that commands some quite [ph] Study, some greater understanding of the disease and also working with physicians that are knowledgeable in this area. But the bottom line is, the earlier that we treat, we believe the cPMP replacement therapy will be the most effective.","Operator","And next we go to Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo.","Brian Corey Abrahams - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question on NMO. I know you've always looked at the balance between finding the broadest population that could benefit with preserving Soliris' value proposition. So I am curious as to what specific data led you to expand into this broader population and how that might influence the potential label and its place in the NMO treatment paradigm down the line.","Martin MacKay","Brian, I actually won't go into the specific data. It's new data, clinically, derived working with key collaborators and what was clear and why we amended the protocol is that by understanding those data, we could have access to a broader population of patients. This will allow us to enroll better and faster. Although, as you may imagine, with the amendment we take a slight delay in start, but most importantly, to really identify the patients that will most benefit from eculizumab.","Operator","And next we go to Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.","Christopher J. Raymond - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a question on MoCD. So I think, looking back at what you guys have said in the past about it, it's -- there's not a ton of information about the patient population and it's obviously the market size. It seems like you guys -- if you move the ball a bit here in terms of -- with the FDA. And so you're getting a little closer. Can you maybe give us -- how should we thinking about this opportunity? And what efforts, I guess, do you guys have in terms of understanding exactly where this market could be in terms of size?","David L. Hallal","The short answer is, we are not sure. And it's largely because the disease is rare and it's generally it's lethal. And as a result without really any therapy, that can help patients with this horrible disease, it's very difficult to understand, truly, what that opportunity is. I will say that the team that we are establishing to better understand our opportunity in HPP, they're also going to be looking, the metabolic team, also, at MoCD Type A. And over time, we would anticipate having a better feel for that. But this is one of the more challenging diseases for us, and they all have been, being ultra-rare diseases, but this one, particularly, because of the lethal nature of it.","Leonard Bell","And as David described, the urgency for us to move rapidly here, given as David described, that it's virtually always lethal, and of course, that's starting very shortly after birth. So I think we're very well focused on refining our approaches. Even more so than we have done with aHUS, even more so than we plan to do with HPP, but the move, too, really, is just very, very early as time point for intervention, to give these babies and their families the very best possible outcome. We would anticipate, with a therapeutic that looks very encouraging and as the breakthrough therapy designation identifies and validates, to some extent, by the regulatory agents here in the United States, that we're all urged to move very quickly here. And the numbers will follow but we're urged to move quickly.","Operator","And next we will go to Yaron Werber with Citi.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I also had just a follow up. And just sorry that I'm trying to understanding better. NMO, could be an exciting market, and it sounds like you're going to a broader population now. So we're just trying to understand better, so the broader population, these are patients who are still relapsing despite current therapy, on Rituxin or on other therapies? Or do they have to be refractory to those therapies, and then get randomized, and what would be the control arm?","Martin MacKay","I'll answer your question in reverse, actually. The control arm is standard of care in saying that those are patients that have, specifically, mentioned in a Rituxin, who have stopped Rituxin treatment sometime before the beginning of our study. In terms of your question, you really hit the nail on the head with understanding the relapse rates and the severity in that population. And as I mentioned really working closely with key collaborators in this area to understand those data and understand the clinical reality for those patients have helped us create what I think is a very powerful protocol going into 2014.","Yaron Werber - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So the key differences is, what? Is it the rate of relapse or it's what therapies they've had previously?","Leonard Bell","We will talk more about the protocol when we initiate the study, Yaron. But we will look at a number of things in that patient population.","David L. Hallal","Yaron, the key, as Martin's describing, is to obtain as much data as possible to carefully study, and compartmentalize and know specific event rates in patients that isn't published, allow us to design a sort of a powerful trial that will be able to take in a significant number of patients rapidly, who all have high event rate expectations.","Operator","And next we go to Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.","Mohit Bansel","This is Mohit Bansel for Robyn. My question is on expenses. Looking at your R&D expenses, it appears that the growth in expenses has been in line with the revenue growth for the last few years. So how do you see these expenses going forward with respect to the revenue? And do you have any sense on what kind of percentage -- percent of expenses you're looking for R&D, as percentage of revenue?","Vikas Sinha","This is Vikas. Regarding the expenses percentages, we have been tracking very well in R&D at around 18% to 19% ranges right now. And as we look into the future, we will -- we continue to maintain the same levels. As we look at executing on the 10 lead programs that Martin was talking about, as we enter 2014.","Operator","And next we will go to Howard Liang with Leerink Swann.","Howard Liang - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Can you expand -- give more color on the expansion of the deceased-donor trial for -- in the transplant setting? And would the filing timeline for this indication be 2014 or '15, after both trials have completed?","Leonard Bell","Happy to see that. I think I mentioned this during the call, it was -- there was a real -- a very positive drive from the investigators in the study to continue with the study and, in fact, keep it such that we enrolled more patients. Clearly, we've had discussions with regulatory bodies as well, along with similar vein, and we all agreed how positive this was. In terms of our timing, what I would say is, we will start the study in 2014 and then run it accordingly. I won't commit to an end at this stage until we're dropped and running, and just seeing how recruitment continues.","Operator","And next we go to Eun Yang with Barclays.","Irving Adler","Operator, hold on a second, please, before we take that. We will be able to stay a few minutes after the hour, thank you, all, for limiting yourselves in questions. Also, we're having a little trouble hearing some of you over this sound system. If folks could talk up a bit, thanks.","Eun K. Yang - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So maybe for Lenny, a general thought on pricing, because it's great you guys are expanding indications for Soliris from PNH, aHUS, and now onto NMO, myasthenia gravis and AMR. Some investors I discussed with, I mean, they always have some concerns. Once you become a much bigger product, in terms of the sales, what's your thought on pricing there? And then, next, on HPP. So in terms of the FDA breakthrough designation, obviously, it's much broader than what we thought, what's the fraction of patients that are, maybe, older, with early onset?","Leonard Bell","I'll take the first part of your question and then, if we still have time, we'll take the second part of your question. The first part of the question, I think, is a great question. Thank you very much for asking, of course. We are keenly focused on restricting what we do to identifying those patients with the most severe and devastating disorders that happen to be quite rare. And at the same time, only going forward, to provide to them and to deliver them therapies that will transform their lives. So in that context, that applies to Soliris in PNH, it applies to Soliris in aHUS, it applies to Soliris in NMO and myasthenia, for short. It also applies equally to asfotase alfa, cPMP and certainly, it'll apply to ALXN1007, additionally. And so I think that the focus here, actually, is not to detour from where we are and, actually, to stay strictly focused, particularly with Soliris, on those patients with the devastating disorders. And to only go forward in the event that we can provide them a complete transformation in their lives with Soliris therapy. So our focus, I think, is distinct. We make our disciplined financial investments in R&D, based entirely on that assumption. We make our plans for how we go forward around the world, serving patients in over 50 countries, entirely based on that assumption. And that describes to you, pretty clearly our focus. Your second question, though, had to do something with adult versus pediatric onset? David, you want to...","David L. Hallal","Yes, sure. So we're out and we're getting to know the HPP community and I think the FDA designation focusing on onset rather than actual age is an important one. We have -- we've spoken to patients who have infantile onset disease, who are adults, who have really bad disease and they're looking for a transformative therapy. So to your question, we're going to better assess the numbers that exist there, but we think that it provides us an opportunity to better serve patients who are in need across the spectrum of patients with HPP. Martin, anything else?","Martin MacKay","Well, I think, you're spot on, in terms of the numbers, David, that really is building a very strong knowledge base across this eye disease which, I believe, we're very well placed to do with work. You also mentioned breakthrough designation and it's been a very positive experience for us in working with the FDA and being able to have more regular meetings [indiscernible]. And I'll just also say that with the breakthrough designation that we received yesterday for MoCD Type A, that's another terrific achievement and will allow us to have those similar discussions in this devastating disorder.","Operator","And next we will go to Bret Holley with Guggenheim Securities.","Bret Holley - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Actually a follow to your immediate comments just before Martin. I'm wondering, with the breakthrough designations that you've had some experience now with asfotase, how is that ultimately going to impact timelines? Because it really hasn't significantly changed the timeline for asfotase, and I'm wondering how it impacts the timeline on cPMP?","Martin MacKay","I think it's -- we're learning as we go along here, Bret. But there's no question that the more frequent interactions we see is very positive. Particularly in those ultra-rare and devastating diseases that we are working, where generally the patient numbers are small and identification takes good knowledge. But we see a similar process with MoCD, we will have more frequent discussions, we will be able to show and discuss our data, and I think Lenny articulated this really well. We are all very much focused on moving this quickly, so that the patients that badly need this therapy, can get it as quickly as possible.","Irving Adler","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Geoff Porges with Bernstein.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just one follow-up on asfotase alfa, could you talk a little bit more about the economics of that opportunity for the company, specifically, given the sort of variety of different patient populations with different manifestations of disease? Should we be assuming that the value proposition is going to be comparable to Soliris in aHUS? And secondly, should we assume that the step up in expenses required to identify the patients and interact with all the physician communities involved will be similar to the step up required for aHUS?","Leonard Bell","Yes. Thanks, Geoff. So again, as I mentioned, we're going to look at our country-by-country opportunities to serve patients with HPP. And our expectation would be that we would establish small teams focused on metabolics. First, would be asfotase alfa with HPP. That same team would also focus on cPMP replacement therapy for the patients with MoCD Type A. But as we did with aHUS, I think, we'll be judicious with the level of discipline to understand exactly what the opportunity is and what level of investment it will take to put in place, from a sales, marketing and medical perspective, the right amount of talent there to better understand, pre-launch, what the opportunity is, and then immediately look to serve patients at approval. Vikas?","Vikas Sinha","I think you've got it.","Leonard Bell","Thanks everyone for joining us today.","Operator","And that was our last question. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"1402":["Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALXN) Q1 2017 Earnings Call April 27, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Elena H.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to now turn the call over to Ms. Elena Ridloff, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Augusta. Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the first quarter 2017. Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Dave Anderson, our Chief Financial Officer; Carsten Thiel, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Martin MacKay, our Global Head of R&D.","You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website.","Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements, and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today, and we undertake no duty to update any of these statements after the call.","I would also like to remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, our GAAP results. Thank you. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Elena, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to be on board and very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I will start this morning by sharing a few thoughts about Alexion and some initial impressions from my first 30 days. I'd also like to give you a sense of my initial areas of focus moving forward as I put together a strategic plan to deliver long-term growth and increased value for our shareholders. I will then turn the call over to Dave to review the quarter, followed by comments from Carsten on our commercial performance, and Martin will provide an R&D update. We'll then open up the call for questions.","So, let's get started, turning to slide 5. As you know, I've been here for about a month now. I have spent much of my time with our teams getting a clear sense of the strength of our business as well as evaluating the potential for additional opportunities for the future. First, I want to commend our employees for an impressive quarter and thank them for their unwavering focus and performance through this time of change.","It is clear to me that Alexion has strong business fundamentals and continued momentum to build upon. I believe we have the right people and assets to create greater value for our shareholders. Building on Alexion's commitment to patients, leadership in rare diseases, and global operating platform, I'm confident that we can achieve this objective. My initial observations have only been reinforced to decide to join Alexion. Our sustainable and growing business is driven by three transformative therapies, and we're all well positioned to continue to deliver double-digit growth. Furthermore, we have opportunities to extend our leadership with additional indications for Soliris such as MG and ALXN1210, our next-generation C5 inhibitor.","Importantly, I have also been impressed by Alexion's high-performing employees. They are ambitious, driven, and take great pride in serving patients. Alexion's patient-centric focus aligns with my passions, having led Baxalta and Baxter BioScience. I'm confident we have a strong and growing foundation in place. In addition, I've heard your feedback and take it seriously. I'm closely evaluating all aspects of our business to see where we can deliver better performance. My highest priority is to significantly increase shareholder value by developing and implementing a strategic business plan that will further leverage our strength. You can expect to hear more on my strategy on the second quarter earnings call in July.","Turning to slide 6, let me now spend a few minutes on the four imperatives that are guiding my strategic plan. First, growing our rare disease business. We're committed to continuing Alexion's legacy of delivering sustainable double-digit revenue growth. Key to that is growing and defending our leadership in complements.","We have a near-term opportunity to extend the indication for Soliris to patients suffering from refractory MG. I'm also highly focused on ALXN1210 and see this program as a critical component to our core growth strategy. While Soliris is an exceptional product that has changed the outlook for patients with PNH and HUS, ALXN1210 has the potential to raise the bar by addressing important patient needs. We're working with urgency to complete the enrollment in the Phase 3 trials and are rapidly progressing the development of the ALXN1210 subcu program. Martin will provide more detail later in the call.","In metabolics, I'm pleased with our continued identification of patients with HPP and see Strensiq as a key driver of growth in 2017 and beyond. On the other hand, we're not satisfied with our Kanuma performance. Therefore, one of my top priorities will be to fully assess our Kanuma strategy.","Second, improved R&D productivity and pursue disciplined business developments. We're investing a lot in R&D, and we need to do a better job with our R&D productivity. My goal here is twofold: leverage our core R&D competencies to deliver enhanced productivity; and simultaneously execute on a disciplined business development strategy. Our BD focus is to reinvigorate our clinical pipeline by identifying assets with a strong strategic fit in our rare disease portfolio.","Third, I'm focused on driving operational efficiencies to improve margins. We have an opportunity to make considerable improvements that will enhance Alexion's profitability. As we deliver double-digit revenue growth, it is also my intent to expand operating margins and accelerate EPS growth. I will be taking a detailed look at our margin drivers and their alignment with our strategic focus, including our SG&A spend.","And fourth, place a strong emphasis on compliance and culture. Throughout Alexion's 25-year history, our employees have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to patients with rare diseases. And we are very proud of our patient-centric culture. As a result of Alexion's tremendous growth, certain systems and processes did not keep up pace. To support our commitment to compliance, I have established a new global corporate compliance committee who will be ensuring we have the right programs, resources, and policies in place. Hand in hand with this goal is to continue to build a culture where high-performing teams embrace quality, responsibility, integrity, and ethical behavior.","Before I turn the call over to Dave, let me comment briefly on the quarter. As you read in this morning's press release and as shown on slide 7, Alexion's financial results for the first quarter are impressive. We're off to a strong start in 2017 with a total revenue up 24% to $870 million. This includes the benefit of $29 million due to a change in revenue recognition. Excluding these benefits, revenue was $841 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year driven by 22% volume growth.","I'm pleased with our strong commercial execution for Soliris across geographies as well as with the strength of Strensiq. Our performance in Q1 positions us nicely for continued success in 2017. Our key priorities for the year are on track including our late-stage complement programs, and the team and I are energized and excited to build on this progress in the quarters ahead.","Now, Dave will provide a closer look at our financial performance. Dave?","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Ludwig. Good morning and thank you for participating in this morning's call. I'd like to start with a few comments on the business, focusing on slide 9 before going into further details. To start as Ludwig said, we're obviously pleased with the strong start to the year based on this performance in the first quarter and our expectation for lower tax rate for the remainder of the year, and I'll talk more about that in just a moment. We're reaffirming our full-year revenue guidance, and we're also raising our EPS guidance for 2017.","Second, it was another impressive quarter for Soliris. Carsten is going to give you a little more color on that later. We had continued growth across geographies. We also saw strength with Strensiq as we continued to identify and serve new patients. And third, as we indicated last quarter, we made a change in revenue recognition in certain non-U.S. markets. The change benefited the quarter by $29 million and EPS by approximately $0.10 a share. So, if you exclude the benefit, total revenues were $841 million, and they performed ahead of our expectations. And again, I'll explain more about RevRec in a few minutes.","Fourth, as you know, in the first quarter, we initiated a restructuring to align our investments with our corporate priorities and further position the company for sustainable, long-term growth. While we did not see the benefit of the restructuring in the first quarter, it was anticipated in our 2017 non-GAAP outlook and will be reflected in our numbers as we go forward.","And lastly, tying Ludwig's opening remarks to our financial expectations, we continue to focus on delivering long-term double-digit revenue growth, expanding operating margin, and accelerating our EPS growth to deliver shareholder return.","Let's go to slide 10. I want to walk you through the revenue recognition change in certain non-U.S. markets, given the significance in the quarter. In the past, we deferred revenue sold through some distributors until the product was received by an end customer. Starting this quarter, we're recording revenue shipped to certain distributors earlier as we have sufficient sales data to estimate returns. So, the total recorded, total revenue of $870 million in the first quarter included a revenue recognition benefit of $29 million composed of approximately $21 million from bulk orders in Latin America and the remaining $8 million from deferred sales in other non-U.S. markets.","Now importantly, if you exclude the benefit, total revenue of $841 million was 20% over the year-ago quarter, driven by a 22% increase in volume. And as we discussed previously, we expect continued variability quarter to quarter from this revenue recognition change. And importantly, this overage in the first quarter does not change our full-year revenue guidance. It's just a shift in the period of revenue recognition within the year, and again, I'll talk more about that later when I talk about the revenue guidance for the full year.","Moving to slide 11, our product sales were driven by growth across geographies with particular strong performance in the U.S. and strong Rest of World performance, although the Rest of World performance was obviously partially due to revenue recognition change we just discussed. If you look at the right-hand side of this slide, slide 11, you can see we delivered a 26% increase in volume, partially offset by currency headwinds of 2% compared to the same period last year. And as far as that foreign currency, that's consistent, you recall with our guide, with our expectations.","Turning to slide 12, Soliris revenue was $783 million. Year-over-year volume for Soliris grew 19%. If you exclude the $29 million revenue recognition benefit, Soliris revenue was $754 million in the quarter, reflecting volume growth of 15%, again driven by growth across geographies in both PNH and aHUS.","As a reminder for 2017, we continue to expect that enrollment in the ALXN1210 and other clinical trials will impact Soliris revenue. And importantly, that impact in the first quarter was pretty de minimis due to the timing of patient enrollment. This is expected to ramp more in the second quarter and particularly in the second half of this year.","We reported Strensiq revenue of $74 million, benefiting from strong patient additions as we continue to add a consistent number of new patients. However, Strensiq revenue growth did moderate in Q1, which was consistent with our expectations. It was partially due to a very strong performance and particularly the finish in 2016, which benefited from patients who had been identified prior to approval but also, as anticipated, a decline in revenue per patient.","Looking at Kanuma, we achieved revenues of $12 million. Will be upfront here, we're disappointed with this performance of revenue in the quarter. Carsten is going to provide his perspective in a little more color on this later in the call.","During the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 44%, which benefited from the change in revenue recognition. If you exclude that revenue recognition benefit, operating margin was approximately 43%, still a nice increase over 2016 first quarter. Non-GAAP R&D was $194 million with increased spend largely due to investments in ALXN1210, again, as expected and as guided.","Non-GAAP SG&A in the quarter was $226 million, and here the year-over-year increase was largely attributable to infrastructure spend, which includes legal, compliance, and IT expenses that you've heard us talk about before. The non-EPS GAAP (sic) [non-GAAP EPS] of $1.38 per diluted share grew 39% over 2016 or approximately 29% when you exclude the benefit from the change in revenue recognition. EPS growth in the quarter reflected volume growth but also benefited from the favorable net interest expense and a lower tax rate.","In addition, we ended the quarter with strong cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet. We generated over $230 million of free cash flow, and this is another important reminder of the strength of this company. During the first quarter, we also repurchased approximately 550,000 shares.","So now, let's go to 13 and talk about the revenue outlook for the full year. Again, we're reaffirming our 2017 revenue guidance following the strong start in the first quarter. And importantly, our revenue forecast is at the midpoint of the guidance range. So, let's go through a few specifics, starting with the summary. We continue to expect total revenues to be in the $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion range. At the midpoint, 12% total growth year-over-year and includes $50 million to $60 million of currency headwinds or call it around 2% at the round negative impact from currency.","It also includes our expectations for the impact of ALXN1210 and other trials on Soliris. If you exclude these headwinds, revenue growth would be approximately 17%. Now for Soliris, our revenue guide remains $3.025 billion to $3.1 billion. It assumes we're going to continue to identify a steady number of new patients in PNH as well as aHUS globally. We expect that patient recruitment for our ongoing and planned ALXN1210 trials as well those other studies will have a $70 million to $110 million impact, so a headwind on the Soliris revenue during the year.","We expect its impact to increase in the second quarter and through the year. And importantly, this guidance is a framework for the year, and we'll expect some, again, variability in quarter-to-quarter revenue due to the timing of bulk orders in certain non-U.S. markets.","Turning to metabolics, we're reiterating our guidance of $375 million to $400 million for the full year. As we indicated last quarter, we anticipate Strensiq revenue per patient to be less than 2016 as a result of both pricing assumptions and younger patients initiating treatment compared to our first year of launch where we saw more adult patients.","We also expect sequential growth to increase over the course of the year, particularly beginning in the second quarter. And if you look at the second half of the year, we expect the quarter-over-quarter revenue growth to return to a level similar to what we saw in the second half of 2016, driven by our continued patient identification in existing markets and also the expansion into additional countries.","With regards to Kanuma, we continue to believe the patient opportunity is meaningful. We're incorporating improved sequential growth in our forecast, although the overall projected growth for the year is modest. On Kanuma, again, Carsten will provide more color in his remarks.","Turning now to slide number 14, we're reiterating our non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 43% to 44%. We're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance from the previous range of $5 to $5.25 to now $5.10 to $5.30 per share. The increase in EPS guidance represents approximately 13% growth at the midpoint of the new range, and it reflects our positive performance we saw in the quarter, the continued confidence we have in our full-year revenue outlook as well as our revised expectation for a lower effective tax rate.","Let me just give you a little color on the tax rate. We now expect that rate to be approximately 13.5% to 14.5% for the full year versus our previous guidance and expectation of 15.5% to 16.5%. So, midpoint, let's call it 14% now in terms of our expectation versus 16%, our previous guide.","Moving to slide 15, we want to give you some additional color on our expectations for framing the second quarter and the second half of the year. For the second quarter, we're forecasting total revenue to be down sequentially due to our current expectations for Soliris bulk orders in certain non-U.S. markets.","In addition, Soliris revenue will be impacted by ALXN1210 clinical trial enrollment to a greater degree than in the first quarter. As a result, we anticipate operating margin for the second quarter to be slightly below our full-year guidance, driven by the lower sequential revenue. As a result, we expect high single-digit year-over-year EPS growth in the second quarter.","For the second half and again to provide you with a framework here, we expect revenue in proportion to our full-year guidance in the second half with a greater impact again to Soliris from ALXN1210 enrollment and other studies. We anticipate second half operating margin and EPS to be in line with our full-year guidance.","So, with that, let me say again that we're very pleased with the start to the year. We're obviously excited to have Ludwig onboard. We've got a true CEO at the helm. We've got a leadership team that's highly motivated and focused on delivering another solid year of double-digit revenue growth.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carsten.","Carsten Thiel - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter of 2017, our global commercial operations continued to serve more patients with devastating ultra-rare diseases as we delivered 22% volume growth over the first quarter of 2016, which excludes the change in revenue recognition that Dave described.","Let me start with Soliris and PNH on slide 17. In Q1, we continued to identify and serve a steady number of new patients even in the markets where we have been operating the longest and despite the ongoing delays in new patient starts and treatment interruptions in Latin America. Additionally, we're still seeing that the majority of patients starting on Soliris are also newly diagnosed. This affirms our view that globally, the majority of patients with PNH have yet to receive an accurate diagnosis, let alone initiate treatment.","Now, turning to atypical HUS on slide 18. We're seeing a growing number of new patients starting on Soliris. Some of this new patient growth is driven by physicians, identifying patients that received a shorter duration of Soliris therapy. Still, on a net basis, the number of atypical HUS patient additions is higher than PNH. Due to this strong momentum, even though atypical HUS was approved four years after PNH, the number of patients being treated in leading markets like the U.S. as well as other markets such as Spain and Turkey has now surpassed PNH. This strengthens our view that the opportunity to serve patients with atypical HUS is larger than that of PNH.","In summary, we are pleased with our Soliris performance in the first quarter of 2017 and expect continued growth ahead of us in both PNH and atypical HUS even as we are simultaneously enrolling patients into our ALXN1210 trials.","Turning now to Soliris in refractory MG on slide 19. If approved, Soliris would be the first and only therapy to treat patients with refractory MG by uniquely inhibiting complement-driven chronic destruction of a neuromuscular junction. As a reminder, the refractory segment of MG represents about 10% of the total MG population or a few thousand patients in the U.S.","In contrast to PNH and atypical HUS, the majority of patients with refractory MG have been diagnosed and tend to be seen by a subset of neurologists, including neuromuscular specialists. We look forward to the potential opportunity to serve patients with refractory MG who continue to suffer from the debilitating symptoms of this devastating disease and have exhausted conventional therapies.","As stated on slide 20, we have great conviction in our leadership in complement and see the majority of growth ahead of us as we continue to penetrate existing markets with Soliris in PNH and aHUS, expand Soliris to new indications, drive continued innovation with ALXN1210, and expand our patent position. Importantly, we expect additional patents for Soliris to be issued over the next 12 to 18 months and have a composition of matter patent for ALXN1210 in the U.S. and EU through the year 2035.","Now, let me turn to our metabolic portfolio starting with Kanuma on slide 21. The Kanuma launch continues in the U.S., Germany and Japan. Our commercial team is focused on reaching more physicians with our LAL-D disease awareness and diagnostic education programs to increase testing rates. We're not yet satisfied with the pace of diagnosis of patients and are assessing how we can drive an increase in testing, which should lead to a steady improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of children with LAL-D.","Moving now to Strensiq on slide 22. In Q1, we continue to identify a consistent number of new patients with HPP who started on Strensiq therapy. As we discussed last quarter, we are seeing a shift in the mix of patients we are serving with more of the newly identified patients being younger children with HPP compared to the first year of launch where many of the patients were juvenile or adult patients with pediatric-onset HPP who had suffered the devastating consequences of their disease for many years. We expect this trend to continue going forward and see Strensiq to be a strong additional driver of growth for the remainder of 2017 and beyond.","For both Strensiq and Kanuma, we're continuing to progress the in-country funding processes for additional European countries in 2017 and are committed to securing funding for patients with pediatric-onset HPP and LAL-D.","In the UK, we have made significant progress with NICE and NHS England towards a funding agreement for Strensiq and look forward to concluding the evaluation process so that patients with HPP in England have access to the life-transforming benefits of Strensiq.","In closing and moving to slide 23, I'm pleased with our strong results in Q1, which were driven by continued growth of Soliris across geographies and the uptake of Strensiq. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, our team is highly motivated to deliver continued strong growth as we serve more patients with PNH, aHUS, HPP, and LAL-D, and we're excited about the potential opportunity to serve patients with refractory MG.","Now, I will turn the call over to Martin who will discuss our R&D programs. Martin?","Martin MacKay - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Carsten. In the first quarter of 2017, the R&D team advanced our lead rare disease programs. Starting with our late-stage complement programs on slide 26, we are very pleased to have submitted applications in the U.S., Europe, and Japan to extend the indication of Soliris as a treatment for patients with refractory generalized myasthenia gravis who are acetylcholine receptor antibody positive.","Today, there is an urgent need for this ultra-rare segment of the total MG population that has no effective treatment options. Despite existing therapies, these patients continue to face disabling limitations in their daily lives, including difficulty walking, talking, swallowing and breathing normally. Exacerbations of their disease may be life threatening and require hospitalization and intensive care. The FDA has accepted our sBLA filing and set a PDUFA date of October 23. We also expect the decision from the EMEA later this year, followed by Japan in early 2018.","We look forward to working with regulators. Also in urology, the multinational Phase 3 PREVENT study of eculizumab and relapsing Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder is progressing. We expect to complete enrollment in 2017 and to report data in 2018.","Moving beyond eculizumab in slide 27, our goal is to drive continued innovation to provide more options for patients. ALXN1210, our innovative next-generation C5 antibody, not like eculizumab, leverages the only proven modality for immediate, complete, and sustained C5 inhibition. Alexion continues to be the leader in conducting clinical trials in patients with complement-mediated diseases. In total, we will have five clinical studies running this year, supporting the development of ALXN1210.","Starting with PNH on slide 28, patients in 12 countries are being dosed in a multinational Phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALXN1210 dosed intravenously every eight weeks compared to Soliris in complement inhibitor treatment-na\u00efve patients. An eight-week dosing schedule would reduce the number of infusions from approximately 26 per year with Soliris, down to only six per year with ALXN1210. This trial is enrolling faster than we expected, with more than 40% of the 214 patients enrolled to-date. For context, this is more than the total number of patients enrolled in the pivotal trial study that supported the global registration for Soliris. We are on track to complete enrollment in the ALXN1210 study by the end of the year. Also in PNH, we are on track to initiate a Phase 3 switch study in Q2, which will evaluate ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients with PNH currently treated with Soliris.","We plan to enroll approximately 200 patients in the switch study with a treatment duration of 26 weeks. This study will provide additional supportive data to demonstrate that existing Soliris patients can safely and effectively transition from Soliris to ALXN1210. And we'll also evaluate the added benefit of an eight-week infusion schedule. We expect to complete enrollment in the PNH switch study in 2017.","Turning to slide 29, patients are being dosed in the ALXN1210 Phase 3 trial in complement inhibitor treatment-na\u00efve adolescent and adult patients with atypical HUS. We also expect to complete enrollment in this trial by the end of the year. In addition, we are on track to initiate a Phase 3 trial of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with atypical HUS in the second quarter. We continue to target an approval of ALXN1210 in either late 2018 or early 2019.","Lastly, as shown on slide 30, we are pleased that PKN tolerability data from our Phase 1 study evaluating a higher concentration formulation of ALXN1210 delivered subcutaneously in 42 healthy volunteers is supportive of progressing development. Bioavailability of this higher concentration formulation is approximately 60%, which allows us to explore multiple dosing intervals ranging from once daily to once monthly. As you may recall, the terminal half-life of ALXN1210 is 42 days. We are encouraged by these results and plan to meet with regulators to discuss a streamlined path forward for the registration program of ALXN1210 delivered subcutaneously. I look forward to providing further update from this program later in the year.","As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, slide 31, we will continue investing in our highest priority programs, which include eculizumab for the treatment of patients with refractory gMG and relapsing NMO as well as advancing the ALXN1210 clinical development programs with urgency. We will also continue to invest in new discovery targets and early-stage research programs.","I will now turn the call back to Ludwig. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, thank you, Martin. And as demonstrated by our performance, I think it's fair to say that we've entered 2017 with a strong momentum and like to thank our employees for their dedication to our mission. Our team is focused on taking the right steps to immediately drive enhanced performance and execution while we develop our strategic plan to deliver sustainable long-term growth.","As we continue to grow our business, we'll be anchored by a culture of compliance and driven by passion and dedication to our patients. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead for Alexion and believe there is significant potential to expand our leadership position in developing breakthrough therapies for patients with rare and devastating diseases and drive substantial value for our shareholders. I look forward to updating you on my strategy on the second quarter earnings call in July.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Congrats on the solid start. Welcome to Ludwig and best of luck in the new role. I guess my question is on Soliris sales trends for Carsten. Obviously, we've seen a pretty good quarter here, probably the best quarter in several. And it looks like you highlighted aHUS new patient starts as an area of particular strength. Are you seeing a new trend there that might be something that moves forward as well or is this more of a one-off? And maybe you could just comment on the situation in Latin America, whether that's changed as well. Thanks.","Carsten Thiel - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Eric. Thanks for the question. Indeed, we are very pleased with what we have seen in the first quarter, both consistently in PNH and in aHUS. Normally, Q1 tends to be seasonally a rather lower quarter. In addition, we knew in Q1 that our R&D organization would execute flawlessly in recruiting patients in the ALXN1210 study. And we, of course, saw a significant leadership change bringing uncertainty in our organization. So, we said we need to keep an eye on the ball and drive operational excellence in Q1.","So, it's not really one big item that drove Q1 performance but the sum of many. Field days, patient identification, conversion to treatment, these metrics scored very high and across the globe. The one region that continues to be a challenge for us is Latin America as we have stated earlier, and we expect that this will continue in 2017.","So, as I look to Q2, Q3, as Dave has earlier mentioned, the timing of bulk orders, the access challenges in Latin America as well as the impact of the ALXN1210 study recruitment and potential competitor recruitment will impact the Q2 and Q3 results. So, clearly, strong performance in Q1, but as you saw, we're keeping our previous revenue guidance for the year.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ying Huang with Bank of America.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. A couple of quick ones. Number one for Dave maybe, can you talk about the future variability coming from this new revenue recognition? Is it going to be similar in magnitude close to, let's say, $29 million from quarter to quarter? And then secondly, I have a question for Martin on the subcu formulation of ALXN1210. So, based on this curve, do you believe the subcu formulation can also be dosed at two 8-week regimen every two months? Thank you.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. So, let me take that. This is Dave. I'll take that first part, Ying. I think it's a very good question, and the answer really in short term is that there is really \u2013 it's going to be difficult for us to predict. And I can't tell you that it's going to be less than or greater than the $29 million. I can tell you it's going to something. We're going to give you our best judgment which is what we've done for the framework, if you will, that we've provided for the second quarter where we expect sequential growth to be down, and that, in fact, could change. We could have a bulk order phenomena, and we could see, in fact, an increase. Our best judgment is what we provided you at this point. So, I think it's just one of those things that we're going to have to give you as much as we can where we have an anomalous situation. We're going to give our best, very best judgment for the successive periods, but we're going to have to also caveat that to tell you that it is a judgment. Martin?","Martin MacKay - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Ying. On your ALXN1210 question, clearly, we're very pleased with the results that we obtained from the Phase 1 study in 42 patients with our higher concentration formulation of ALXN1210 and with the bioavailability of 60% and a half-life of 42 days. What we've said is we're now looking at from daily subcutaneous to monthly and others in between.","I'd like you to think about it this way though, Ying, and it reminds me of the thinking that went into the ALXN1210 IV doses. If you think about empiric data that we have with our Phase 1 study now, we obviously have our ALXN1210 IV Phase 2 data. We've got a lot of experience with eculizumab. We will apply modeling as always in PK and PD, and crucially, we will sit with regulators now to really find out what the next steps will be for subcutaneous ALXN1210.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Clearly, our expertise is in complement biology, and as Martin was saying, we have a wealth of data on PK\/PD. And with the information that we just got from the Phase 1 study, it means that we will have flexibility. And so, we'll work with the regulators, and we'll see how far we can stretch it, but I think it's good from a patient perspective to have different treatment options, and that's a situation that we're in, so well done.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I had a follow-up question on the subcu formulation for ALXN1210. So, I guess, two questions, how important is the Cmax or the peak penetration that you achieved with the IV versus it looks like a lower peak with the subcu versus sort of AUC. And then the second question just related to that, when should we expect to see the next update or how long do you think these discussions around deciding dose and frequency, et cetera will take? Thanks.","Martin MacKay - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, Matt. Well, clearly, all of those things are important as you put together the development plan for subcutaneous eculizumab. We'll now armed with \u2013 as Ludwig articulated, armed with positive Phase 1 data, also based on what we know about our IV from the Phase 2 trial, they will all go into the mix in terms of working out that plan. AUC, Cmax, half-life, bioavailability, all comes part of it. And again, based on our years of experience with eculizumab and ALXN1210 now, we have developed really a quite sophisticated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, and that will also come to bear in the discussions with our regulators. In terms of the next update, we'll really work through now. We intend to update as the year goes on based on internal discussions and those discussions with regulators. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, I would add to that, that understanding on PK\/PD is that the Cmax that we got 20 IV might be less relevant than the AUC in the trough levels. When you bridge it with C5 inhibition and breakthrough hemolysis, it's from that perspective that the subcu that the team is developing has a very attractive profile so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink Partners.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for our question and congratulations on keeping all the operations moving with all the transitions. So, Ludwig, first question on MG. Could you just give us an explanation for why no priority review around the world given what appears to be a pretty devastating disease? Just wondering what kind of company's view on that is?","And then related to that, Ludwig, as you think about the offering, you've talked several times about complement leadership, understanding of complement biology. But as you know, there are hosts of other targets in the complement pathway, and many companies are pursuing those targets, either to address patients who have breakthrough hemolysis on Soliris or to address other diseases. And Alexion doesn't have any other offerings in the complement pathway and just wondering what your thoughts are about that. Thanks.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. So, thanks for the question. With respect to MG, Martin and I had a lot of discussions. I also looked at all the regulatory documents, the clinical research report. Overall, I feel like this is a clinically relevant effect that we see with Soliris treatment. I've worked with the FDA for I think 25 years now. As a matter of fact, with therapeutic area I had to turn, I used to go to the FDA all the time. And sometimes, it is a enigma, whether or not you get a priority review, but I think my message is, it is clinically relevant, it is impactful, and patients need it. These are refractory patients without any treatment options. So, I feel good about our submission.","And then on complement leadership, I'm excited about Soliris. I'm excited about life cycle management of Soliris, MG, NMO, and our highest priority within R&D is ALXN1210. And ALXN1210 has an option to raise the bar, different patient attributes that we will be looking at to see what we can do to raise the bar there. So, that's our number one focus.","And Q2 is a quarter where we will be reviewing, as I said, our R&D productivity, which includes our highest priorities, how we can streamline ALXN1210 towards fast-track development and registration, but we will be asking other questions on all of the other products. Martin?","Martin MacKay - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Geoff, just very briefly, a couple of picks. I think it's very well articulated by Ludwig. Just to remind, the MG submissions were based on positive in-person meetings with the FDA and EMA. And if you remember also, of the 22 pre-specified analysis, 18 of them had a P value of less than 0.05. Also in terms of the competition, which I know you and I have discussed before, I am never complacent, but eculizumab sets a really high hurdle, and that was always our mantra to outcompete ourselves, and that's where ALXN1210 came into play with the eight weekly dosing. And I'd also just make a point in terms of modality, the notion of safe, rapid, complete and sustained inhibition of C5 is critically important in the devastating diseases that we work in.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","It's fair to say it's a portfolio within a product. It's an incredible opportunity for us.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Right. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about myasthenia gravis. Do you guys expect to have a panel? And kind of based on your conversations and the positive conversations you've had, like what do you think you would be preparing to address in a panel for that indication? Thanks.","Martin MacKay - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hi, Alethia. It's Martin here. Yeah, it's still too early to know if the FDA will consider an advisory panel. We're going through the review process now as you know. And as you rightly say, we did have these positive in-person meetings with the regulators. We strongly believe in the data that we presented in refractory myasthenia gravis. And also, a reminder of those patients, our inclusion criteria were those refractory patients had failed at least two previous treatments. But of course, as we've discussed before that much greater than 50% of the patients had failed three or more treatments. So, they really are a refractory population badly in need of new treatment options.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, we will know normally three months in advance if you have an FDA AC, so we'll keep you posted on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Morning and thanks for taking the question. Carsten, for the first quarter, I looked at total U.S. sales. They grew 36% more than any other geography. Is there anything underlying this? Is it just Strensiq or something to do with the pace of identifying patients on Soliris? And then, Martin, I'll ask a ALXN1210 question another way. At this point, do you think a formal pivotal will be needed down the road for subcu or is it possible to do a simple bridging study with IV? Thank you.","Carsten Thiel - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, Geoff, just to address the U.S. performance, you're right. It is the Strensiq addition versus prior year and 2016. That is the major reason for the strong performance here.","Martin MacKay - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Geoff. And in terms of the ALXN1210 question, just a tad early to comment on that based on the Phase 1 data that we now have, showing this good bioavailability of 60%. And as mentioned previously and very briefly, a lot will go into discussions with regulators based on those Phase 1 data, based on the IV Phase 2 data, our experience with eculizumab and our modeling. So, all of those will come to bear. And I just said earlier, it's very reminiscent of how we decided on the plan for ALXN1210 IV. And these discussions with the regulators, I must say, I'm really looking forward to know.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Just to manage expectations, most likely, we will have a Phase 3 study. It is the same molecule, but we're not talking about bioequivalence between subcu and IV.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Mohit Bansal with Citi.","Mohit Bansal - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good quarter. I mean, maybe just a segue, I mean, we have heard a lot of talks about the Soliris pricing in the future. If you could help us understand if we should expect any significant change to your pricing strategy in near term or you have seen any incremental pressure from the payers? Thank you.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, it's safe to say that yes, there is increased pressure on pricing I think across geographies, but I believe our model is sustainable. And just to make a couple of points why I believe that. First of all, our products are very innovative. They are very valued, and they are truly transformative for patients, and that's being recognized by the payer. I would say number two is our therapies are unique, and they are not interchangeable. So, you've seen discussions on tenders, our bidding process and so on. That's not really something that would work for our products. And number three is we are growing our company through volumes, not through price increase. So, I do believe that this is a sustainable model for us for now, and I know that Dave wants to add a couple of things here.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, Mohit. Just very quickly, just to refresh and build on what Ludwig said, you recall in our initial 2017 guidance for Soliris, we got it to a down 1% to 2% in terms of price for the full year across all geographies in terms of the sum of the numbers, and that's the same assumption that we're using today, so that stays consistent.","Mohit Bansal - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe a quick one for Dave, on the guidance for the $70 million to $110 million for ALXN1210 impact, what does that assume for enrollment in core territories versus emerging markets and some of the maybe non-Soliris territories? And does the $70 million to $110 million account for future subcu development patient loss? Thanks.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, with respect to the geographies and that data, we haven't disclosed that. We're not providing that level of information.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","These are global. Sorry Dave. These are global studies.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Absolutely. And, Martin, maybe just you want to take the second part of that?","Martin MacKay - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. Anupam, just remind me of that.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's the insight of subcu.","Martin MacKay - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Oh, yes.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Subcu.","Martin MacKay - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","No, that hasn't been \u2013 yeah, I've got it Anupam. Thank you. Yeah. That hasn't been taken into account.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","We will need a little bit of timing since \u2013 so Martin and the team are really doing a great job with the PNH enrollment. I'm really proud of what the team is doing there. For subcu, we just got this data. As we said, we're going to discuss this with the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and it's going to take a little bit of time. I want to make sure. Just referring to the question that we had before, is there an option for us to streamline, do we need a Phase 3, these are the type of questions that we need to address with the authorities. So, my message to you is that the impact of subcu on commercial or on new patients is going to be limited, very limited.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks so much for taking our question.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Raymond with Raymond James.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Just on the tax rate guidance, so I think, Dave, you talked about a 200 basis point lowering of the tax rate this year, and that's I think a pretty remarkable step-down. Can you just talk a little bit about the puts and takes that are driving that? Is it geographic mix or is there some other driver there? Thanks.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","You had it, Chris. It's really the geographic mix that's causing it. And we just got some really, really bright folks, and they just continue to do very well and just continue to execute very effectively on that front.","Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, you're welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Let me just offer my congrats to Ludwig as well. Maybe any thoughts on longer-term operating margins. I know you touched on that during your opening remarks, but just maybe remind us of some of the potential drivers there. And then who do you guys view as your peer group when you think about operating margins?","And then my follow-up was just on Soliris sales for aHUS. Are those now actually above PNH in U.S., for example? I know you didn't talk about patients, but when you think about sales specifically, are those also above? Thanks.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. So, as I said, we're going to work with the management team on our strategic plan in Q2. So, I will be able to give you a better answer during our second quarter earnings call. But overall, I think we're starting from a position of strength here. Our fundamentals are right. You saw our first quarter results, and I'm really proud of what the team did here. So, that's where we start, but we have an opportunity to drive operational efficiencies, to drive margins, and I know that Dave and the team already looked at this in the first quarter. And we should see impact from that in Q2 and Q3. But what we will do is once we define our strategy forward, we will align our structure, our capabilities with our strategic direction forward, and that answer will be provided in our second quarter earnings call.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And as you would suspect, it's analytics that we're doing and have been doing here internally. And to your point, in terms of peer group, it's looking at the other mid and large cap, particularly in the mid cap biopharma and really looking at comparatively what could make sense. They're very, very individual and specific items for each company, but clearly, Ludwig and I absolutely are committed to and believe that there is margin upside here. That's part of the path forward, and we can do that, we believe, while also providing sustained attractive growth outlook for the company. So, there really is a lot of opportunity. We look forward to providing that additional color.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, we have time for two more questions.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","There was a second...","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","There was one more there I think, Elena.","Martin MacKay - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So, Terence, let me just close the loop on your question regarding atypical HUS in the United States. The momentum that we have in terms of new patients quarter-over-quarter is stronger than PNH, but it's also true for revenue. And the U.S. was the first leading market in which we have seen that total number of patients as well as revenue is higher for HUS than PNH, so across all the effect that was followed by Turkey and Spain, and quite frankly, I expect that other leading markets will follow because we're seeing this trend of atypical HUS across the globe.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Operator, we have time for two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Martin Auster with UBS.","Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on Strensiq, as the new patient starts focus shifts over to the younger infantile HPP patients. Could you comment on anything you're seeing in terms of incidence rates relative to kind of where you guys were at at launch? And then just on the older patients, the juvenile onset, if you could comment just on the ability to keep patients on drug long term and discontinuation rates, any comment there will be helpful. Thanks.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Carsten, do you want to take that question?","Carsten Thiel - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. So, in terms of the incidence rates for HPP, we've seen no surprises. There are moderate variations from region to region, but overall, what we are seeing so far is really in line with our initial expectations at launch. The second question was about the continuation rate \u2013 the discontinuation in the adults. We are extremely pleased with the work that's happening with Strensiq and specifically the high compliance rate, and that's across age groups. And I think this mirrors the fact that HPP is seen as a disease that requires chronic treatment, and we have taken significant efforts to work with healthcare providers to drive this high compliance rate, and at this time, we're seeing that this will continue, and it's something that we're seeing across our markets.","Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Our last question will come from Yatin Suneja with SunTrust.","Yatin Suneja - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question for Dave. Dave, could you maybe help us sort out the deferred revenue that you still have on the book? So, I think you had about $37 million. Is the $29 million that you recognized part of that? And then the remaining $60 million that's on the book, what is that related to? How and when will that be recognized? Thank you.","David John Anderson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, the majority of what we saw in terms of the revenue recognition had to do with bulk orders in the quarter, and $8 million then came from, if you will, sell-through to distributors or the deferred revenue. So, what we have in our forward guidance would include, Yatin, would include, if you will, the recognition of the remaining of that deferred revenue. I hope that helps. Thank you.","Yatin Suneja - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","That was our last question and this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Susan Altschuller, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Susan Altschuller - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you very much. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the first quarter of 2018. Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer; John Orloff, our Global Head of R&D; and Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial Officer.","You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website. Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional details. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today and we undertake no duty to update any of the statements after the call, except as required by law.","I'd also like to remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide us useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for our GAAP results. Thank you. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Susan, and thanks for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with the strong start to the year and the progress we have made to deliver on our key objectives to drive sustainable, long-term growth.","First, we continued to grow our in-line business from a complement and metabolic portfolios, delivering strong revenue growth, including year-over-year revenue growth of 7% and volume growth of 7%. Second, our Soliris launch for patients with gMG is off to a strong start, particularly in the U.S. and we're on track to meet our ambition of gMG being the best Soliris launch.","Third, today we announced positive data from the 1210 PNH Switch study. Once again, 1210 met a high bar set by Soliris in a second large Phase 3 study. We now have robust data showing that patients with PNH can effectively and safely transition from Soliris to 1210. Based on the totality and consistency of the data from the Phase 3 Na\u00efve and Switch studies in a broad patient population, we believe we have a strong, differentiated profile for 1210 and plan to move rapidly through regulatory submissions in the U.S. and EU in mid-2018, followed by Japan later in the year. John will provide detailed study results later in the call.","Fourth, we executed on our disciplined business development plan by announcing the tender offer to acquire Wilson Therapeutics which marks an important first step in rebuilding our clinical pipeline. And, fifth, we delivered very strong financial performance and have updated our guidance to reflect the strength of the underlying business and the announced tender offer of Wilson Therapeutics.","Moving to slide six, we're pleased with the differentiated profile of 1210 and believe it has the potential to become the new standard of care for patients with PNH. The robust efficacy data from two Phase 3 trials show numeric results in favor of 1210 across all primary and key secondary endpoints. This, along with an every eight-week dosing schedule, optimized weight-based dosing, and potential economic and quality-of-life impacts could impart meaningful benefits to patients, physicians and payers. If approved by global regulators, we will leverage over a decade of real-world experience to enable rapid conversion of patients to 1210. Brian will provide more details on our plans for 1210.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss the first quarter financial results and our updated guidance for this year. Paul?","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Ludwig. Starting with slide 8; in the first quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 7%, driven by volume growth of 7%. We delivered non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 22%. Continued momentum on the top-line, coupled with expense control, led to an approximate 600 basis point expansion in non-GAAP operating margin. We're updating guidance to reflect the strength of the core business as well as the preliminary financial impact of the announced tender offer for Wilson Therapeutics.","Turning to slide 9, net product sales in the first quarter were $930 million. Net product sales were driven by volume growth of 7% and FX tailwind of 2%, partially offset by a price headwind of 2%. Net product sales were driven by growth in the U.S., EU and Asia Pacific, offset by decreased sales in Latin America. The softness in Latin America sales related to the timing of ordering patterns in 2018 as well as comparison to the first quarter of 2017.","Turning to slide 10, Soliris revenue in the first quarter was $800 million, and year-over-year volume growth was 2%. Recall that the first quarter 2017 revenues included a benefit of roughly $49 million from both the recognition of deferred revenue and timing of orders from certain non-U.S. tender markets. In addition, Q1 headwinds to Soliris from 1210 and other clinical trial enrollments were approximately $42 million.","As expected, this was an increase from the approximately $37 million in Q4 due to the ramp-up of enrollment. When adjusting for all these items, the underlying PNH and aHUS volume growth in the first quarter was in the low double-digits. In its first full quarter, the gMG launch is off to a very strong start and is a growing contributor to Soliris revenues. It's an exciting launch for us and Brian will provide greater context.","As shown in slide 11, Strensiq remains a key driver of growth. We reported revenues of $111 million in Q1, representing 50% revenue growth and 58% volume growth year-over-year. In the first quarter, we realized a $7 million benefit due to a change in a distributor arrangement in the United States.","Looking at Kanuma, we achieved Q1 revenues of $20 million, representing 63% revenue growth and 58% volume growth year-over-year. Sequential quarterly growth was impacted by the timing of orders in tender markets and previously deferred revenues that benefited Q4 by approximately $5 million.","Turning to the P&L on slide 12, during the quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 50%, driven by revenue growth and operating expense leverage. Non-GAAP R&D was $162 million or 17% of revenue, and non-GAAP SG&A was $220 million or 24% of revenue.","R&D expense was unusually low in Q1 owing to the restructuring efforts in 2017 and lower than expected transition expenses. We expect R&D expense to ramp higher, especially in the second half of 2018, driven by the ongoing R&D expense from anticipated rebuilding of the pipeline. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 15.3%. We reported Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.78, which grew 22% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per share was $1.11.","During the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $233 million and ended Q1 with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. We utilized a portion cash flow to repurchase 700,000 shares for approximately $85 million. We anticipate approximately half of our cash and marketable securities will be used to finance the recently announced tender offer for Wilson Therapeutics. Following the anticipated tender offer and regulatory approval, we expect the deal to close in the second quarter. The acquisition fits well with our approach to capital allocation, and our goal is to continue to build the pipeline.","Let's turn to slide 13, which outlines our updated financial guidance. We're now guiding to total revenue of $3.925 billion to $3.985 billion, which represents an 11% growth year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. This guidance includes our expectations for the impact of 1210 and other trials on Soliris as well as our assumptions for price and foreign currency.","For Soliris, our revenue guidance is $3.38 billion to $3.42 billion, an increase over the prior guidance due to our steady underlying growth in PNH and aHUS as well as the growing contribution from gMG. Our planning assumption for PNH and aHUS, when adjusting for 1210 and other trials, is for volume growth in the high single-digits, which we believe is a prudent planning assumption.","Turning to metabolics, our revenue guidance is $545 million to $565 million, reflected continued momentum in particular for Strensiq. Our revenue guidance for 2018 assumes a foreign currency tailwind of $45 million to $55 million or approximately 1% benefit. In addition, we estimate price will be a 3% headwind in 2018, two-thirds attributable to Soliris and one-third to metabolics.","GAAP-operating margin is expected to be 8% to 11%. This is inclusive of our estimate of the announced Wilson Therapeutics tender offer, as well as restructuring and related expenses. As you recall, from an accounting perspective, the acquisition will be treated as a purchase of an asset. And following the closing, the acquisition cost will be expensed immediately to R&D on the GAAP P&L.","Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 48% to 49%, representing approximately 300 basis points to 400 basis points expansion year-over-year. This is inclusive of expected ongoing expenses for WTX101 and additional expenses related to rebuilding the pipeline. At the midpoint of this guidance, non-GAAP operating profit growth is expected to be 20%. We're guiding now to a 2018 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 15% to 16%.","GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $1.35 to $1.75 inclusive of the impact of Wilson Therapeutics. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $6.75 to $6.90 per share. At the midpoint of this range, this represents approximately 16% growth.","Q1 was an excellent start to the year. We plan to continue to execute on our 2018 objectives, including delivering on the core business and investing in building our pipeline.","I'll turn the call over to John now.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Paul. I'm really happy to report that the 1210 Phase 3 PNH Switch study was a success. We now have a complete picture of the differentiated profile of 1210 based on strong efficacy and safety data from two large Phase 3 studies. And I'm pleased to share these data with you today.","I will start with a review of the Switch study design on slide 15. This is a Phase 3 open-label, randomized, active-controlled global non-inferiority study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1210 versus Soliris in adult patients with PNH who were clinically stable after having been treated with Soliris for at least the past six months. The purpose of this study is to show that patients currently receiving Soliris can effectively and safely transition to 1210.","The study enrolled 195 patients who were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1210 or Soliris. It consists of a four-week screening period, a 26-week randomized treatment period and an ongoing extension period in which patients are receiving 1210 for up to two years or until regulatory approval is obtained.","Patients in the 1210 arm were treated in three weight-based dosing cohorts every eight weeks beginning on day 15 following a single loading dose on day 1. Patients in the Soliris arm were treated every two weeks in accordance with the label dosing regimen for Soliris in PNH.","Turning now to the core study data at 26 weeks, I would like to orient you to the forest plot on slide 16. The lines represent the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence intervals and the difference in the treatment effect estimates. They were assessed relative to the respective pre-defined non-inferiority margin represented by the red triangle. For the primary endpoint, a percent change in LDH levels, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is less than 1%, which far exceeds the predefined non-inferiority margin of 15%.","You also see that the mean percent change from baseline was -0.82% for the 1210 arm, a slight reduction in LDH values which were already in the normal range at baseline compared to a mean increase of 8.39% in LDH levels for the Soliris arm. Additionally, the point estimate falls to the right side of no difference, indicating that numeric results favored 1210 versus Soliris.","We had a similar plot for the key secondary endpoints. As you see, all four met non-inferiority, as the lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals are substantially greater than the predefined non-inferiority margins. In addition, the point estimates favor 1210 over Soliris for all four key secondary endpoints.","Since we achieved non-inferiority on the primary and all four key secondary endpoints, our Statistical Analysis Plan allowed us to test for superiority. The hierarchical testing order pre-specified percent change in LDH as the first endpoint tested. The difference in the percentage change in LDH between the 1210 and Soliris arms was 9.21% with a lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of -0.42% which came close but did not quite reach statistical superiority with a P value of 0.0583.","Therefore, no further testing for superiority was conducted. However, it is notable that in this patient population, no patients receiving 1210 experienced breakthrough hemolysis compared to five patients in the Soliris arm, including one patient who experienced three breakthroughs and withdrew from the study due to lack of efficacy.","Turning to slide 17, you see that in the Switch study, 1210 had a safety profile consistent with that seen for Soliris. 1210 was generally well-tolerated and there were no reported cases of meningococcal infections in either arm of the study. No patient withdrew from the study due to adverse events. Treatment compliance was 100% for both the 1210 and Soliris treatment arms. No treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody was observed for 1210 and one was observed for Soliris. No neutralizing antibodies were observed in either arm.","On slide 18, you see on one side the results consistently favoring 1210 across all primary and key secondary endpoints in both the Na\u00efve and Switch studies. We are particularly pleased with the low rates of breakthrough hemolysis for 1210 compared to Soliris across the Phase 3 program. Importantly, patients receiving 1210 also improved their quality of life as measured by the FACIT-Fatigue scale.","In summary, we are confident that we've established the benefits of 1210 based on the totality of the Phase 3 data in more than 440 patients with PNH around the world. In two complementary studies, 1210 dosed every eight weeks achieved non-inferiority to Soliris and substantially exceeded each non-inferiority margin with numeric results favoring 1210 for every primary and key secondary endpoint. We are now preparing regulatory submissions to the FDA and European Commission which we intend to file midyear followed by our submission to the PMDA in Japan later in the year.","Turning now to business development activity on slide 20. This month, we announced the tender offer to acquire Wilson Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company based in Stockholm, Sweden that is developing WTX101, a Phase 3 asset for patients with Wilson disease. This is a rare genetic and chronic disorder in which copper accumulates in vital organs, especially the liver and the brain. It is estimated that roughly 10,000 Wilson disease patients are diagnosed and treated in the United States and the EU5.","WTX101 is a first-in-class high affinity copper binding agent that addresses the underlying cause of the disease, namely, the accumulation of toxic copper in the liver, serum in central nervous system, which can have devastating consequences for patients. WTX101 has a unique mechanism of action that addresses the limitations of current treatments and has the potential to become the standard of care for patients with Wilson disease. We look forward to applying our clinical development and regulatory expertise to our developing the innovative treatment.","Looking at slide 21, our objective is to build a pipeline through both internal research and disciplined business development deals that leverages our fundamental strength in complement biology and focuses on our core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders.","Let me provide brief updates on our other pipeline programs. In addition to the 1210 PNH studies I've already talked about, we continue to enroll patients in the 1210 Phase 3 atypical HUS study in complement inhibitor, treatment-na\u00efve adult and adolescent patients and in our pediatric studies in patients with PNH and atypical HUS. We also continue to make progress in our programs to develop a higher concentration formulation of 1210 delivered subcutaneously.","Moving onto Soliris in relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD, we have completed enrollment in the PREVENT study, a single, multinational placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial. We now expect to report data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a reminder, this is an event-driven study and we are waiting on final events to close the study and analyze the results. I look forward to providing updates on our R&D programs throughout the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the commercial highlights for the quarter and the team's plans for 1210. Brian?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, John. I'll start with our in-line business and then discuss the expansion of our complement franchise, including some color on the potential 1210 launch. Starting with Soliris on slide 23, in the first quarter of 2018, we grew the treated population of patients with PNH and aHUS. We continue to identify new patients with PNH and still believe that the majority of patients with PNH have yet to initiate treatment.","This is especially encouraging, given that we're now in our 11th year of the Soliris PNH launch. In aHUS, we're still seeing a growing number of new patients starting on Soliris and continue to believe that the opportunity with aHUS is even greater than that of PNH. This continued momentum provides a strong platform as we prepare for the launch of 1210 and I'll provide a bit more color on our efforts in a moment.","Moving to gMG, which is on track to become the best Soliris launch, on slide 24, you see the trajectory in the U.S., where we're increasing the number of treated patients each month. I'm very pleased to report that as of the end of March, there were 400 patients enrolled in OneSource, including 194 patients on therapy. These patients are generally aligned with the REGAIN study population. As a reminder, these are patients with AchR antibody-positive gMG, who had inadequate response to appropriate immunosuppressive therapy and continue to suffer from significant unresolved disease symptoms, which represent approximately 5% to 10% of the total MG population.","As we've discussed in the past and unlike our experience in PNH and aHUS, patients with gMG are already diagnosed. However, there is low awareness about the role of complement mediated destruction of the neuromuscular junction in gMG. Our specialized and dedicated field team is actively educating neurologists, including neuromuscular specialists, on the role of complement in this devastating disease and the benefits of complement in addition with Soliris.","Turning to our metabolic franchise on slide 25, starting with Strensiq, I'm very pleased to report that the first quarter 2018 revenue has surpassed $100 million. Continued execution has enabled us to identify new patients with HPP in the U.S., Germany, and Japan and we're also now treating initial patients in the UK, France, Canada and Israel following the completion of funding agreements in these countries. We expect additional geographic expansion, so patients in other countries can have access to the transformative benefits of Strensiq, and we see significant growth opportunities ahead.","Looking at Kanuma, we continue to expand lab testing target an enriched patient population that are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D, such as those with NASH, NAFLD and familial hypercholesterolemia, who have elevated ALT and LDL levels. In addition, we expect to serve more patients as we secure funding agreements in additional countries.","Turning back to our complement franchise on slide 26, you can see that Alexion has a proven track record of being the global leader in complement inhibition. We believe there is meaningful growth ahead for both Soliris and 1210, if approved. We continue to strive to raise the bar for patients and provide them with numerous life-changing therapeutic options, the first of which could be 1210 delivered IV every eight weeks for patients with PNH.","If approved by regulators, our strategy will be to establish 1210 as the new standard of care for PNH. As shown on slide 27, there are a number of factors that we believe position us well to enable rapid conversion to 1210. First, 1210 has a compelling differentiated profile. Second, our 11 years of experience in PNH has given us a deep understanding of the disease and the needs of the patients. During this time, we've also established strong relationships and trust with the physicians who are treating these patients.","Third, and similar to our ongoing experience in launching Soliris in gMG, if approved, we will be launching 1210 into a market of identified PNH patients who are already on treatment. In addition, the safety and efficacy profile of 1210, coupled with the less frequent dosing schedule, creates opportunity for newly diagnosed, as well is currently untreated patients to initiate treatment with 1210.","Fourth, we're developing a compelling value proposition for 1210 based on its differentiated profile, including the direct and indirect costs relating to the benefits of every eight week dosing, low levels of breakthrough hemolysis and transfusion avoidance, as well as impacts on productivity and quality of life.","Fifth, the rapid enrollment into the PNH trials and high enrollment in the extension studies, as well as feedback from both patients and physicians, indicate a strong interest in the attributes of 1210. And, finally, initial patient and physician market research suggests that they favor the profile of 1210 over current treatment options. So, all of this together gives us confidence in our ability to rapidly deliver on 1210 becoming the new standard of care for patients with PNH.","I'll now turn the call back to Ludwig. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. Let me conclude today's call by saying I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and with what we have delivered over the past 12 months to position Alexion for the future. We've established a strong foundation that enabled us to get off to a great start. This positions us very well to deliver on our 2018 objectives that will drive sustainable growth and create long-term shareholder value. As always, I would like to thank our global employees for their dedication to our mission.","We will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now turn to the question-and-answer portion of our call. In order to accommodate as many people as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Our first question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you very much for taking the question and for all the progress. A couple of quick ones. First, could you clarify all the moving parts in the change in the revenue from rest of world markets year-over-year from $175 million to $128 million, just so we understand what's going on and what if any of that change is from Brazil? And then a second question if I may, if we could just talk a little bit about you were sort of perilously close to superiority on certain endpoints in both of the trials. Now you have the profile for 1210. What other studies are you contemplating either in the existing indications or in other indications? Thanks.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Geoff, this is Paul. I'll start with the first part of your question. Thank you for the question because it's actually important to clarify. It was probably the softness on Soliris kind of that sticks out from a geographic perspective. Couple points. One is that we're comparing to a time period in first quarter of 2017 where the $175 million was unusually high. And that was both the revenue deferral change in the first quarter of 2017, as well as some benefits from timing of tender orders a year ago.","On the flip side, in the first quarter of 2018, we had an unusually lower number of tender orders, particularly in Latin America. We're going to have a lot of inconsistency on those tender orders. So I think one was an unusually high and one was an unusually low time period for the rest of world. When you strip it apart, we were actually incredibly pleased, particularly also with the 1210 headwind. We're incredibly pleased with the Soliris performance.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And, Geoff, this is John. Regarding your question about superiority, I think, if you take a step back and look at the totality of the data, two Phase 3 studies that were as successful, I think, is remarkable. All of the results numerically favoring 1210 versus Soliris, which I think is a testament to the team's careful optimization of the dose and dosing regimen that they took into the Phase 3 program that provides better coverage through a dosing interval despite the fact we're going from two weeks to eight weeks and reducing infusions from 26 to six.","We think that provides a very differentiated profile and a compelling value proposition. And at this point, we feel the data stands on its own and we'll be proceeding to regulatory filings in the middle of this year in the U.S. and EU and Japan later this year based on those two pivotal studies which is the largest program that's ever been conducted in PNH. As we said before, we also plan to proceed later this year with a gMG study and other potential studies.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","We have a differentiated profile with 1210. I don't think anybody will dispute that. And, for sure, we're going to try to get the best label. And we believe that the data that we have will be reflected in the clinical trial section. The way I look at it, we don't need the superiority claim to be successful for a fast conversion. We have a strong, differentiated clinical profile, a robust data package. As Brian was talking about, we have a decade of experience in PNH. I feel we have all the ingredients to be successful in a fast conversion. We'll take the next question.","Operator","We will take our next question from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company","Thanks for the question and congrats on all the progress. Maybe, Ludwig, just following up on your latest comment there on a successful conversion and having all the components needed to achieve that successful conversion for 1210. Could you give us some kind of a benchmark on what type of conversion you were thinking of? Would you hope to convert the majority of patients within two or three years' time, great majority? Even a percentage would be amazingly helpful if you're willing to give that out and potentially compare this launch or this conversion to other conversions we've seen. Thanks very much.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. So thanks for the question and Brian will give us a little bit more detail. But the way to think about this, we're not going to talk about a forced conversion. We will have both Soliris as well as 1210 on the market. As I said, we have all the ingredients to be successful and our objective is to be best-in-class within a segment of non-forced conversion to be best-in-class and Brian is going to talk about that.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Eric. It's Brian. Just building on that, as Ludwig had noted, we feel commercially that we have the profile that we wanted. We now have two distinct studies that have very complementary and consistent results. And that's what we were after. And so, as I noted in my prepared comments, as we've done primary market research with payers and physicians as well as looking back at what kind of enrollment path John and his team were able to achieve, we think that's a good proxy for how differentiated the profile really is.","And I think at this stage as we're formalizing and intensifying all the prelaunch commercialization plans, it's fair to anchor on the ambition which is that we want to make 1210 the new standard of care in PNH. There's no perfect analog for that. But with the 10-plus years of commercialization experience we have with Soliris in PNH, with the fact that it's a known patient population where we don't have to go through identification, we think we're really well-positioned for that.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company","If I can just follow up, we recently saw conversion with COPAXONE, a non-forced conversion where the more convenient formulation was able to get up to about 75% share within a couple years' time. Is that a reasonable estimate?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I think the COPAXONE conversion might be a little bit different than the situation that we're in here. But our objective is for 1210 to become the market leader within a short period of time with the PNH indication.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Chris Raymond with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Just another question I guess on 1210. The prior management team used to talk at length about how this drug, 1210, given its profile could actually serve to sort of increase utilization and therefore is more than just playing defense, is really a market expander. I guess the question here is with all the market research work you've done, is there any chance you could maybe put some brackets around what that expansion could be, at least in terms of increasing compliance, patients that normally wouldn't get the drug, et cetera?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Chris. It's Brian again. It's a good question. And it's tough to put precision on the brackets, as you say, but we are fully aware that there are patients who are identified \u2013 if we talk about in the U.S., they are identified but not yet on treatment and, for lack of a better term, have waited on the sidelines for one reason or another, some of which may be that the burden of treatment is just not optimal for them. And so that's in PNH as an example. And the same opportunity we think could be true as we build up with aHUS as a future indication.","So, as you noted, the rapid conversion that we've just talked about is really focused on PNH with a known patient population, but we do expect that there is a growth opportunity as well as some of those currently untreated patients come into the fold, so to speak, with 1210 given the profile it offers.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. As Brian says, it's a conversion strategy but it's also a growth strategy, a conversion strategy that will start with PNH. We still have a lot of opportunity there, aHUS. We talked about also MG. We just embarked on the launch for MG. In 1210, as you know, we will also start a program later this year with MG. The subcu option will also play a critical role here. Some patients prefer an infusion. They like the every eight weeks infusion, but we will see most likely some patients that prefer a subcu and then the other potential indications. So I think my message and Brian's message is it's a conversion strategy but it's also a growth strategy.","Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go on to our next question from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess if I can just ask two updates. So one, can you just update us on the situation with European patents for 1210 and what's happening there? And then second, you gave us some nice patient numbers on gMG, any help in terms of thinking about what that translated to in terms of revenue? And also, I mean, it looks like you're tracking at sort of 50% of the patients heading into OneSource come out the other side. Do you feel good about that conversion rate right now and how should we think about that in the future?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So I'll take the IP situation in Europe. So I'll take a step back just to make sure that everybody understands that we've got three new patents that were issued last year in the U.S., so composition of matter patent, the manner of use as well as formulation patent. You'll also know that in 2017 we've got a new patent in Japan covering the three topics I just discussed.","With respect to Europe, nothing has changed since the last update on the Q1 call. We do feel good about the strength of the applications that are pending. We're using a very similar approach as we did in the U.S. and Japan. As a reminder for everybody, the EU process is different in a way that there is back and forth between the innovator and the patent office. And so the inventors commonly engage in multiple rounds discussing with patent offices prior to having the patents allowed. So that's important to understand. But at this point nothing new to report since our last earnings call. And then with respect to MG?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Matthew. It's Brian. With respect to MG, as I noted, and I'm happy to say several times, we're really pleased with the excellent uptake that we're seeing, particularly in the U.S., with MG. And we are on track to make this the best of our Soliris launches which we feel really good about.","We gave pretty specific numbers in terms of the patient uptake. So in terms of that for Q1, which I'll note is the first full quarter of launch in the U.S., you can probably update your models fairly precisely in terms of how we're tracking. And what is important to note as well is that the majority of both the patients, as well as the neurologists, the neuromuscular specialists that are prescribing, are not REGAIN patients and they're not really clinical trial investigators. So one of the elements we feel good about in terms of continued uptake is the breadth of prescribing that we're seeing.","With respect to your question about OneSource enrollment, just as much as we're pleased with the progress of patients on treatment, the so-called pipeline of open cases behind that treatment through OneSource is also tracking quite well. And it's too early to give real precision in what exactly the throughput is, how long it takes to move through. What I will say is both sides of the equation are strong, the open cases as well as patients on treatment, and we're learning how to continue to refine that throughput model to make it easier for patients to move through to Soliris treatment.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And just to add to complete the picture on the IP question, with respect to 1210, we have patents issued in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. The expiry is 2035 and these are composition of matter patents, so we feel good about our patent situation with 1210.","Operator","We will now move on to our next question.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe a quick one from me on Strensiq and market dynamics that you're seeing there. Are there any trends worth noting on HPP patient subtypes that are initiating therapy relative to 12 to 18 months ago or any trends in age of initiation of therapy worth noting? Thank you so much.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Anupam. It's Brian. With respect to Strensiq, the growth you've seen is strong and continues to track well. I'll take the opportunity to say I'm really proud of the team that is working in the metabolics area on Strensiq. These are folks who have to have, I would call it, disproportionate stamina, because a lot of the equation on Strensiq is about identification of patients. And sometimes it's difficult to know exactly what specialty they need to go to, to find those folks, but they're becoming efficient. They're really growing in terms of their efficiency in finding the patients.","And then, more importantly, the doctors becoming convinced to translate identification over to therapy with Strensiq and part of that is due to improved genetic testing that some of the clinicians are adopting. And we expect that in the U.S. that trend will continue. And, again, we see it as a growth driver. And then, ex-U.S., of course, most of the journey there is around continued global access and making sure that patients who could benefit \u2013 who have HPV who could benefit from the transformative potential of Strensiq have the right funding behind in their country to get that access.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking our questions.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just two from me. I was wondering given the 1210 data if you guys can comment on the subcu program, what's gating to getting that underway, and then any changes that you might make there based on what you've seen in the prior two Phase 3 trials. And then, maybe just one for Paul on the tax rate change for the quarter. Can you just comment on what drove that and if you think that's sustainable longer-term? Thanks.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Terence, this is John. So subcu program is on track. As we've previously discussed, we'll be planning to initiate a single PK-based bridging study to the IV formulation in the fourth quarter. We're also doing drug and device compatibility testing, performance testing, and human factor testing. That is what's gaining us to initiating that trial in the fourth quarter. We also have a next-generation subcu formulation that we're working together with Halozyme that will potentially get us a Q2-week, Q4-week formulation delivery. And that's also on track to be in the clinic in healthy volunteers in the second half of 2018.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Terence, thanks for the question on tax rate. So I think the best way to think about it is if you recall the conversations that we had coming into this year around what's the impact on U.S. tax reform, we had thought about it as 200 basis points or 300 basis points upward pressure, not from last year because we had some discrete benefits, but from what we had \u2013 kind of where we probably would've landed excluding U.S. tax reform. We're now tracking towards the lower end of that. And so I think there might be a little bit of a upward pressure, but probably closer to 100 basis points as we go into 2019 and 2020. So, obviously, everyone's interpreting and that's subject to change as the interpretations of U.S. tax reform evolve, but that's our current thinking.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","We'll hear now from Josh Schimmer with Evercore ISI.","Josh Schimmer - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking the question. As we consider biosimilar label extrapolation from one disease to others, would this apply to Soliris? Or does the separate doses used for PNH versus aHUS in myasthenia gravis and the disease pathogenesis necessitate separate non-inferiority trials for full labels? Do you have any views on that? Thanks.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So this is John. I'll take a stab at that. It really is dependent, I think, on the circumstances of the product and the disease. In this case, I mean, typically, what's been required is conducting clinical studies in most sensitive population and allowing for some extrapolation to the other indications, but not always the case. And that may require additional studies. And it's, I think, premature for us to comment on exactly what the development program would be for biosimilar actually to come to market given the data we have with Soliris and now with 1210.","Operator","Thank you. And now we'll move on to our next question...","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","...from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. Just had a couple. If you look at the reasons why patients discontinue Soliris or become refractory or have to raise the dose to a super high level, what can you read into the data as to how that could change with 1210 clinically? And the second question on the BD front, the Wilson deal obviously expands the Phase 3 pipeline, but what's the capacity for a few more bolt-on deals? And I wanted to see if there's a bias towards more product-based deals that have, let's say, more of a near-term impact versus a tech platform which is longer-term like a gene therapy, cell therapy platform? Thank you.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","So this is John. I'll take the first question. I think one thing to highlight from our Phase 3 program with 1210 is that as we cover the dosing interval in a better way and have sustained, continuous reduction of free C5 levels, and we'll have more to share later this year in terms of the PK\/PD effects, we're seeing less breakthrough hemolysis. And our analysis of the data suggest that we're not getting any PK-based breakthrough with 1210, unlike what is seen in some patients with Soliris. And so we think that there is an opportunity there to cover patients that would otherwise have to be titrated up with 1210 \u2013 I'm sorry, with Soliris.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Geoff, this is Paul. I think you had kind of two parts on that. One was capacity, one was our bias. So on capacity, I think, I'd frame it up as in the prepared remarks we talked about we have $1.6 billion of cash. We expect to use a bit more than half of that for the Wilson transaction. We have cash generation throughout the year and that's the financial ambitions that we've laid out, all part and parcel to create some strategic flexibility. We also have access to an undrawn revolver of about $500 million. And our debt-to-EBITDA levels are manageable at this point.","So I think our capital allocation strategic priority is disciplined business development. I mean, no doubt about it, it's to rebuild the pipeline. I would characterize the bias towards products, not towards platforms. Never say never, but this is rare disease. Wilson represents a good example of our bias. Rare disease, devastating diseases, a potential product to transform the disease, and we're building up our ability to do that inside the company. We still firmly believe we have capabilities to bear against that and that the opportunity set \u2013 you've got to look pretty hard, but the opportunity set is pretty rich.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Robyn Karnauskas with Citi.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong launch. So I guess a couple questions. So you'd mentioned before it takes time to get a patient on drug just because they have to get injected with vaccine. What is the minimal amount of time it takes for a patient to go on Soliris? I'm just thinking about this from the MG perspective. I thought it was a couple months but maybe you can clarify that.","And then the second question is you kind of have always spoken about how spread out these patients are amongst physicians. In the patients that you've seen go on OneSource, have they been at the more concentrated doctors? Or how are you seeing MG uptake amongst, given the breadth of doctors that are treating these patients?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Good morning, Robyn. It's Brian. Thanks a lot for the question. With respect to the time for patients who are being treated with gMG with Soliris, it still is evolving for one, because as I noted, we're in our first \u2013 we're reporting out now on our first full quarter of launch in the U.S. But if I were to use sort of general averages, it's generally about a month is what we're seeing for a patient to go all the way from the identification and the vaccination process to an open case with OneSource, verification of their funding and then getting onto therapy. And there's puts and takes around that obviously depending on the challenges that they have actually getting in sync to get the vaccination as well as the coverage determination.","One area where we feel like we've made a lot of progress has been on the commercial side. Now more than 80% of the commercial policies are defined and largely those plans are in line with or better than the REGAIN criteria. So that helps, in some regard, to speed of that process. But that's, in general terms, what we're seeing. And then...","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Brian, for one month would be the best-case scenario...","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. And that's where I was headed next, is that, again, there are puts and takes and we're still in the early days. And you saw in my prepared comments that there is a queue still of patients who are open cases who have not yet been converted to therapy. And it is taking longer for some of those patients and that can also be on the back-end where it's coordination of the infusion itself, as an example.","And with respect to, as you called it, the sort of spread of clinicians, what we're seeing for the most part is that in general most of the initial prescriptions are coming from community neurologists and neuromuscular specialists. They do though tend to be concentrated in the treatment centers where we target and that's in the range of a few hundred across the U.S. So it is somewhat more concentrated than just any community neurologist.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And can I follow up with that question? Would you expect then some slow \u2013 because you're hitting all the most concentrated centers, should we sort of expect that as you get out into broader areas this year that we could see slowing? And then the other question was can you give us one example of someone who went into OneSource and then just opted not to have therapy or is it really more of a time element to get someone on drug? So is there another element of people not opting in to go to therapy?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, sure. And we have had cases like that where somebody has become a case, they've opted in, they got maybe cold feet, decided now is not the right time. We've also had cases where they've done that, they've opted out and then opted back in and went on therapy. So it still is very much in the early days of that launch progress.","With respect to your question about a slowing or a kind of leveling off, we haven't seen it yet and we're really pleased with the continued uptake. We do expect that with our ambition, at some point we will continue to move from these out of option patients on the more severe side of the equation towards earlier therapy. That's definitely our plan.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","But just to add to that, our structure and investment will reflect the broader prescriber base that we have, since it's broader than just academic centers. It's also community-based prescribers. We have a long way to go from where we are now, 400, to we talked about 60,000 to 80,000 MG taking a refractory 3,000 to 8,000. So we still have a long way to go. So we don't expect that our numbers are going to slow down soon.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for the question. Maybe I was hoping you can give us a little bit clarity on the Brazil patent situation. What's next and what's the timeline for resolution of that? And could this potentially spread to other geographies or not? Secondly, do you have any specific plan to start a trial for Alexion 1210 in non-responders to Soliris?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. With respect to Brazil, so the media reports that we saw last week were incorrect. I think the short answer is for us, the situation in Brazil is business as usual. And so what happened was the Superior Court of Justice reaffirmed their prior determination on how to calculate the term of mailbox patents and 20 years from filing versus 10 years from issuing. But I think the message is no, nothing new, business as usual.","This is Brazil only. This does not have any impact on ex-Brazil countries. As you know, Brazil is about 3% of our total revenue. And so what we're doing is, yeah, we're listening to what they have to say and we're exploring our options to respond to what we saw last week. But I think the message is business as usual. This is an ongoing dispute. We're not the only one, the only company that's pushing back on the way they're looking at patents, and no impact on ex-Brazil.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Then, Ying, with regard to additional clinical studies, again, just the reminder that this is the largest clinical program conducted by far to-date in PNH with about 200 patients in one study and 250 in another. We studied a broad patient population that really covers the ground for PNH patients. We have na\u00efve patients. We have Soliris-experienced patients. We have patients who are transfusion dependent and independent. And we've conducted subgroup analyses for both studies that show consistent effect and favorability for 1210 versus Soliris.","So with regard to your question, the Na\u00efve study enrolled all comers, and presumably there would be patients in there that might be considered non-responders to Soliris. And as I said, we had very favorable results there with no PK-based evidence of a breakthrough. So we're very confident that we've got the right dose and dosing regimen to cover the extended dosing interval out to eight weeks and provide patients with that benefit of going from 26 to six infusions per year.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. We'll take two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Martin Auster with Credit Suisse.","Martin Auster - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on a comment made earlier about some of the internal market research you've conducted on 1210 on the IV versus a subcu and the relative clinical appeal for patients and docs. Just curious if you could add more color on if there's \u2013 were you aware if there's certain indications that kind of skew more towards preference for subcu or if there's certain geographies that have different views on IV versus subcu? Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Most of our research so far, Martin, has related to the IV formulation. That really has been our focus as we prepare for the prelaunch planning and commercialization. And, in general, what we're pleased about is that we knew that it would be quite impressive to patients to consider moving from 26 infusions a year to six. What we wanted to start exploring is some of these other benefits that we begin to see in the data now with two different studies consistently where things like breakthrough hemolysis have numerically played out quite well for 1210, transfusion avoidance, some of those other elements. The clinicians, in particular, are finding the profile appealing. And what we think is important about 1210 and the positioning is that it's not just viewed as a convenience kind of thing moving from 26 to six infusions. It really is about the totality of benefits that it offers in that overall profile that John described.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","As we have now the final profile from the Phase 3 studies, of course, there's going to be more market research. And as we continue to talk over the months and quarters to come, we will update you on the additional insights that we get, but I think everything is lined up for us to make this a successful launch. So we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our last question from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets.","Slanix Alex - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Slanix Alex on for Kennen. Congrats on the quarter and the Phase 3 results and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to briefly touch on the Wilson Phase 3 trial. I was just wondering if you could provide some additional color on the rationale as well as level of confidence in designing the Phase 3 to aim for superiority. Thank you.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. So thank you. It's John. Yeah. Right now, we obviously haven't closed the deal. We've had a chance to evaluate and through due diligence the currently designed Wilson Phase 3 program, which is enrolling. And we'll carefully take a look at the opportunity to optimize the development program in order to provide a differentiated profile for WTX101, which we're convinced is going to be a transformative therapy for Wilson patients with a 10,000-fold greater affinity for copper, the ability to de-copper, deliver, and reduce the risk of worsening neurological symptoms, and will be something that really addresses the underlying disease in Wilson patients. So, more to come on that after we've had a chance to consummate the deal and talk to investigators, as well as regulators about how we might alter or enhance the development program as it currently exists.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. So that's the end of the call. So I want to thank all of you for dialing in. We're really, really pleased with our first quarter and so we'll continue our dialog. So thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call to discuss Alexion's performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 and our plan for 2018. Today's call will be led by Ludwig Hantson, our CEO. Ludwig will be joined by Paul Clancy, our Chief Financial Officer; Brian Goff, our Chief Commercial Officer; and John Orloff, our Global Head of R&D. You can access the webcast slides that will be presented on this call by going to the Events section of our Investor Relations page on our website.","Before we begin, I would like to point out that we will be making forward-looking statements and these statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please take a look at the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings for additional detail. These forward-looking statements apply only as of today and we undertake no duty to update any of the statements after the call.","I'd also like to remind you that we will be using non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for the understanding of our ongoing business performance. Reconciliations of our financial results and financial guidance are included in our press release. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to but not a substitute for our GAAP results.","Thank you. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Elena, and thanks for joining us this morning. We're pleased to report today on our 2017 performance and outlook for 2018. 2017 was a year for rapid transformation for Alexion as we advanced our leadership position in rare diseases and made important changes to position Alexion for the future. I'm proud of what the team has accomplished. I want to thank our employees for their passion and dedication, and I'm grateful to the patients and their families for their contributions to our mission. I joined Alexion about 10 months ago and saw significant opportunity to build and position the company for continued success and increase value creation.","Looking at slide 5, I want to take a moment to review the actions we've taken to deliver on our long-term growth objectives. First, we strengthened the leadership team, adding seven new highly qualified, talented and experienced executives. We also appointed four new independent directors with deep biopharma experience to our board.","Second, we announced a refocused and disciplined corporate strategy based on a comprehensive review of our business, and we established financial ambitions to deliver long-term shareholder value. We also aligned the organization with our strategy through a restructuring program that will generate approximately $250 million in annualized savings by 2019.","Third, we drove business growth through strong execution. We achieved double-digit revenue and volume growth in 2017, obtained regulatory approvals for Soliris in gMG in the U.S., Europe and Japan, and received new patents for Soliris in the U.S. and Japan that extend patent protection into 2027.","Fourth, we prioritized our pipeline to ensure that we are leveraging our leadership in complement and rare diseases, and expanded our focus from ultra-rare to rare, which we believe will have a meaningful impact on building the business in the long-term. We also advanced our R&D programs by completing involvement in the ALXN1210 Phase 3 PNH trials and the Soliris NMOSD trial, as well as advanced the ALXN1210 subcu development program.","Turning briefly to our financial performance on slide 6, as I mentioned, we continued to deliver double-digit growth in 2017, including year-over-year revenue growth of 15%, volume growth of 17% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 27%.","Now, I would like to highlight the five key initiatives for 2018, as shown on slide 7, to drive sustainable long-term growth. First, our in-line business continues to have revenue and volume growth momentum. This includes increasing the diagnosis and treatment of patients with PNH and aHUS, who can benefit from Soliris; serving more patients with HPP and LAL-D; and reaching additional funding agreements for Strensiq and Kanuma to expand access to new markets.","Second, we are very excited about our new opportunity to serve patients with gMG and are highly focused on executing a successful first year of launch in the U.S., Germany and Japan. A third priority for us in 2018 is extending our leadership in complement, where we are the global leader with more than 20 years of scientific expertise.","ALXN1210 is our crown jewel and our goal is to raise the standard of care for patients with PNH and aHUS. 2018 will be a pivotal year, with several important milestones for ALXN1210, including data from the Phase 3 PNH Na\u00efve and Switch IV studies in the second quarter and, if positive, we will plan to file in the U.S., EU and Japan in the second half of 2018.","In addition to ALXN1210, we will be focused on advancing and rebuilding our pipeline, including executing on disciplined business development to build the leading rare disease pipeline that is diversified in terms of development stage and risk.","Finally, we are in a good position to progress on the path to achieve the financial ambition targets we laid out last July, including double-digit revenue growth, 2019 operating margin of 50% and EPS growth greater than revenue growth.","I will now turn it over to Paul to discuss the 2017 financial results and our guidance for 2018. Paul?","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Ludwig. Turning to slide 9, we delivered revenue growth of 15%, volume growth of 17% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 27% for full year 2017. We saw continued momentum in serving more patients, as shown by the double-digit volume growth across all our products. This coupled with our focus on expense control led to an approximate 200 basis point expansion in non-GAAP operating margin.","Now, turning to slide 10, net product sales in the fourth quarter were $909 million and grew 9.5% year-over-year. The quarter did benefit by approximately $20 million from favorable orders for Soliris and Kanuma in certain tender markets outside the U.S. compared to our prior forecast. In addition, the headwind on Soliris revenue from ALXN1210 and other clinical trial enrollment was approximately $37 million in Q4. As expected, this was an increase from the approximately $30 million in Q3 and $20 million for the first half of the year due to the ramp of enrollment. This is a welcome headwind as we continue to advance the program.","Our product sales were driven by growth in the U.S., EU and Asia Pacific whereas growth in the Rest of World was impacted by continued softness in Latin America. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see we delivered a 10% increase in volume in Q4.","Turning to slide 11, Soliris revenue was $792 million and year-over-year volume growth was 6%. The fourth quarter benefited by approximately $17 million in favorable orders in certain tender markets compared to our prior forecast. ALXN1210 and other study enrollment in PNH and aHUS was a $37 million or approximate 5% headwind to year-over-year volume growth in the quarter.","When adjusting for ALXN1210 in ordering patterns, Q4 volume growth was in the low-double digits and consistent with what we've seen in the last five to six quarters. In Q4, the revenue contribution from gMG was minimal given the timing of the launch. It's a very exciting launch for us and Brian will provide greater context.","As shown in slide 12, we reported Strensiq revenue of $96 million, representing 36% revenue growth and 43% volume growth year-over-year. Looking at Kanuma, we achieved revenues of $22 million, which benefited by $3 million from favorable orders in tender markets compared to our prior forecast and $2 million in previously deferred revenue that was recognized in the quarter as we reached funding agreements in certain European markets.","Turning to the P&L in slide 13, during the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 44% driven by the revenue growth and operating expense leverage. Non-GAAP R&D was $189 million or 21% of revenue and non-GAAP SG&A was $245 million, 27% of revenue. The non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 12%.","We reported Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.48 per diluted share, which grew 17% year-over-year. GAAP EPS was $0.13 per diluted share. This included $95 million in restructuring and related expenses, $40 million of upfront fee for the Halozyme licensing agreement, as well as the $46 million charge related to tax reform. The charge from tax reform includes a transition tax expense of $178 million and deferred tax expense related to the new GILTI minimum tax for $165 million. This was partially offset by a $297 million benefit from revaluation of balance sheet taxes to the new 21% rate.","Turning to the full year on slide 14, net product sales increased $3.5 billion (sic) [increased to $3.5 billion] in 2017, driven by growth across the geographic regions. Revenue was driven by volume growth of 17%, partially offset by pricing headwind of 1% and FX headwind of 1%.","Full year Soliris growth was driven by volume growth of 11% despite a 3% headwind from enrollment in the Phase 3 ALXN1210 and other clinical studies. Strensiq revenue grew 62% and Kanuma revenue increased 125% in 2017, as both products benefited from continued patient additions.","On slide 15, for the full year 2017, non-GAAP operating margin increased to 45% from 43% in 2016, driven by strong revenue growth and the restructuring actions benefiting operating expenses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $5.86, increased 27% year-over-year, benefiting from the margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate. The tax rate includes the benefit from the conclusion of a routine IRS audit for 2013 and 2014, which we had noted in the third quarter. GAAP EPS was $1.97 per share compared to $1.76 in 2016. In 2017, we generated free cash flow of $758 million and ended the year with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. We utilized a portion of the cash flow to repurchase 4 million shares for approximately $460 million.","So, let's now turn to slide 16 for the 2018 guidance. We're guiding to total revenue of between $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion, which represents 10% growth year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. This guidance includes our expectations for the impact of ALXN1210 and other trials on Soliris, as well as our assumptions for price and foreign currency. Excluding these pushes and pulls, revenue growth would be in the mid-teens. For Soliris, our revenue guidance is $3.325 billion to $3.4 billion. This assumes launching gMG in the U.S., Germany and Japan. It also assumes a year-over-year impact on Soliris revenue from ongoing ALXN1210 trials as well as other studies of between $90 million to $110 million on top of the estimated $87 million headwind in 2017. Included in this estimate is the impact from our plan to initiate a Phase 3 subcu study in late 2018 for ALXN1210.","Our planning assumption for PNH and aHUS when adjusting for ALXN1210 and other trials is for volume growth in the high-single digits as compared to low-double digit adjusted volume growth in the last five to six quarters. We believe this is simply a prudent planning assumption.","Turning to metabolics, our revenue guidance is $525 million to $550 million, reflecting continued patient additions. Our revenue guidance for 2018 assumes a foreign currency tailwind of $45 million to $55 million or approximately 1% benefit. In addition, we estimate price will be a 3% headwind in 2018 with two-thirds attributable to Soliris and one-third attributable to metabolics.","GAAP operating margin is expected to be 31% to 34% inclusive of restructuring and related expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 48% to 49%, representing approximately 300 to 400 basis points expansion year-over-year. This is inclusive of earmarking over $100 million for business development in the new ALXN1210 studies in gMG and IgAN. At the midpoint of this guidance, non-GAAP operating profit growth is expected to be 18%.","We're guiding to a 2018 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16% to 18%, which includes our provisional assessment of the impact of U.S. tax reform. This range represents an approximately 300 basis point increase from the 13% to 15% we had referenced during Q3 earnings in October prior to U.S. tax reform.","GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $4.35 to $4.75, which includes the impact of restructuring and related expenses. Non-GAAP EPS guidance is $6.60 to $6.80 per share and at the midpoint of this range, this represents approximately 14% growth.","Moving to slide 17, we've highlighted some of the dynamics in the P&L to be mindful of on a comparison basis in 2018. These dynamics are due to quarterly lumpiness in 2017 from a change in revenue recognition, favorable orders in ex-U.S. markets compared to our prior forecast, and the pace of enrollment of ALXN1210 studies, particularly through 2017. This makes year-over-year comparisons in the first half of 2018 challenging. However, we expect more normalized comparisons in the second half of the year. More specifically, our expectation is that these comparisons as well as a continued ramp in revenue from gMG will result in low-single-digit revenue growth in the first half of this year and high-teens revenue growth in the second half.","To close, on slide 18, our financial objectives position us to achieve longer-term financial ambitions including double-digit revenue growth, operating margin growing to 50% in 2019 and leverage from the top line to the bottom line, leading to greater non-GAAP earnings per share growth. We anticipate delivering on these objectives whilst simultaneously investing in our pipeline including through business development.","I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Paul. I'm pleased to report on our commercial performance in 2017, starting with Soliris on slide 20. Our global commercial operations continue to serve more patients with PNH and aHUS with Soliris despite rapid enrollment in the ALXN1210 trials. In PNH, our long-standing focus on disease education enables us to continue to identify new patients, and we still believe that the majority of patients with PNH have yet to initiate treatment.","IN aHUS, we're seeing a growing number of new patients starting on Soliris and continue to believe that the opportunity with aHUS is even greater than that of PNH. We're very pleased that the underlying growth in PNH and aHUS in 2017 was driven by our continued excellence in disease expertise, as well as commercial execution. While we expect continued headwinds from ALXN1210 and other trial recruitment in 2018, we expect continued growth ahead of us for Soliris in both PNH and aHUS.","Moving now to generalized myasthenia gravis on slide 21, we're extremely grateful for the opportunity to serve patients with this chronic and debilitating neuromuscular disorder who have been waiting for a long time for new treatments. Soliris is a first-in-class complement based therapy approved for these patients. We're pleased with the approved labels and are already serving patients in the U.S., Germany and Japan.","Our focus is on the study population in the Phase 3 REGAIN trial. These are patients with AchR antibody-positive gMG who had inadequate response to appropriate immunosuppressive therapy and continue to suffer from significant unresolved disease symptoms, which represent approximately 5% to 10% of the total MG population. More specifically, we estimate our target population in the U.S. to be about 3,000 to 8,000 patients and approximately 1,000 patients in each, Germany and Japan.","I'd now like to spend a little time talking about some of the launch dynamics we're seeing in the U.S. Similar to the PNH and aHUS launches, physicians treating patients with gMG have limited knowledge of complement, which is a gap that we're actively filling with our breadth and our depth of complement expertise. Our specialized and dedicated field team is trained and actively educating neurologists, including neuromuscular specialists on the critical role of complement-mediated destruction of the neuromuscular junction, as well as the benefits of complement inhibition with Soliris. In addition, we've made very good progress with payers and have approximately 60% of commercial lives in the U.S. now with policy coverage.","Moving now to slide 22, following the FDA approval in late October, I'm pleased to report that in the U.S., we now have over 240 patients enrolled in OneSource, which includes more than 90 patients on Soliris. Of the open cases in OneSource, investigators from the REGAIN study only represent a small number of the overall prescribers, which suggest an early adoption by community and general neurologists. As a reminder, once enrolled in OneSource, our Nurse Case Managers assist patients, as well as they're treating physicians through benefits verification, vaccination options, treatment site selection, and finally, initiating Soliris treatment. We have significant experience with this process in PNH and aHUS. We're very excited about our opportunity to serve patients with gMG, and our ambition is for the gMG launch to be the best of our Soliris launches, at or above PNH and aHUS launch revenues.","Turning to our metabolic therapies and starting with Strensiq, a continued growth driver for us. As you see on slide 23, in 2017, we continued to identify new patients with HPP in the U.S., Germany and Japan and made progress with geographic expansion. We were pleased to have secured funding agreements in the UK, France and Israel in 2017, and just recently reached a funding agreement in Canada. We expect additional geographic expansion in 2018, so patients in other countries can have access to the transformative benefits of Strensiq. We're still early in Strensiq's launch trajectory, and we see significant growth ahead.","Looking at Kanuma on slide 24, we continue to expand lab testing to target an enriched patient population that are at higher likelihood for having LAL-D, such as those with NASH, NAFLD, and familial hypercholesterolemia who have elevated ALT and LDL levels.","We're also establishing additional lab partnerships to drive an increase in testing. In addition, outside of the U.S., we reached funding agreements in Italy, Spain, Israel and the Netherlands in 2017 and expect additional geographic expansion in 2018. I'm very pleased with the commercial team's performance in 2017 and believe we are well positioned to deliver continued growth in 2018.","I'll now turn the call over to John for an overview of the R&D highlights from the quarter. John?","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. I'm happy to report today on the significant progress the R&D organization made in 2017 to advance our rare disease pipeline. Before I discuss our R&D programs, I wanted to share that we filed for regulatory approval for Soliris in patients with refractory gMG in Canada and look forward to working with regulators as they review our application, which is under priority review.","Turning now to ALXN1210 on slide 26, our innovative next-generation C5 inhibitor that has the potential to address important patient needs. In 2017, we rapidly enrolled both the Phase 3 PNH Na\u00efve and Switch studies which both administer ALXN1210 intravenously every eight weeks. We expect data from these non-inferiority studies in the second quarter. And if positive, we will file for regulatory approval in the U.S., EU and Japan in the second half of 2018.","On slide 27, we also continue to enroll patients in the Phase 3 atypical HUS study in complement inhibitor treatment-na\u00efve adolescent and adult patients. This study is about two-thirds enrolled. We expect to complete enrollment in the second quarter and announce the results in the fourth quarter of this year. Enrollment is also ongoing in a Phase 3 study in complement inhibitor treatment-na\u00efve children with atypical HUS.","Turning to the ALXN1210 development timeline on slide 28, I'm very pleased with the progress and execution of our teams who have moved the ALXN1210 IV program from Phase 1 initiation in early 2016 to targeting filings in the second half of 2018. We anticipate an approval on PNH in the first half of 2019. This is just two-and-a-half years from Phase 1 initiation to filing for registration. We now have over 500 patients enrolled in the ALXN1210 development program and over 200 patient years of exposure. Our ambition is to establish ALXN1210 as the new standard of care for patients with PNH and atypical HUS.","We've also made significant progress in our program to develop a higher concentration formulation of ALXN1210 delivered subcutaneously. We expect to initiate a single PK-based Phase 3 bridging study in the fourth quarter of 2018 to support registration in both PNH and atypical HUS, evaluating a weekly subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210 utilizing a commercially available device.","In addition, in December, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Halozyme for their ENHANZE drug delivery technology in the development of subcutaneous formulations of our portfolio of products. Included in this agreement is a next-generation subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210 to potentially further extend the dosing interval to once every two weeks or once per month. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 single-ascending dose PK trial later this year to support our dosing decision.","Turning now to slide 29, we expect to report data from the PREVENT study, a single multinational placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial of Soliris in patients with relapsing neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder or NMOSD in mid-2018. As a reminder, this is an event-driven study that is based on results from a small investigator-initiated Phase 2 trial in 14 patients that showed a reduced frequency of attacks in patients with severe relapsing NMO.","To close, our objective is to build a pipeline that leverages our fundamental strength in complement biology and focuses on our core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders. As shown on slide 30, in addition to advancing our late-stage pipeline, we are also preparing to initiate two studies in additional indications with ALXN1210 in 2018: a registration study in myasthenia gravis and a second proof-of-concept study in a devastating kidney disease called IgA nephropathy. We also have additional innovative complement inhibitors with novel mechanisms in preclinical development and are focused on executing disciplined business development deals to build a leading rare disease pipeline that is diversified by development stage and risk. I look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the year.","I'll now turn the call back to Ludwig. Ludwig?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, thank you, John. Let me conclude today's call by saying I'm very pleased with our 2017 accomplishments and performance. We have many significant opportunities and milestone in 2018, including growing our in-line business, successfully launching Soliris in gMG, raising the standard of care and extending our leadership in complement with ALXN1210, advancing and rebuilding a leading rare disease pipeline, and delivering on our financial ambitions. By focusing on these areas, I'm confident that we can achieve sustainable growth and create long-term shareholder value.","We will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Morning, guys. Congrats on the execution. Paul, lots of questions this morning on the top line guidance for 2018. Maybe if I can just pick a little bit at your assumption for PNH and aHUS volumes coming down to the high-single digits from low-double-digit range over the last few quarters. Is that based on anything you're seeing at all, or is it really just being conservative?","And then maybe a second question on pricing. Is that also a prudent assumption that we're going to see more pricing declines, 3% in 2018 versus what we've seen historically? Thank you.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thanks, Eric. This is Paul. So, as usual great questions, getting right to the nub of the issue. What we identified and I talked about in the prepared remarks is what we saw in the fourth quarter with respect to volume growth for PNH and aHUS when adjusted for ALXN1210 in other competitive trials is essentially what we've seen for the last five or six quarters, so kind of low-double digits. So, it's not anything we're seeing as we go into 2018.","I think it was \u2013 in the assumption going into 2018 against those same indications, same way to measure it is simply moving to top line \u2013 to high-single-digit volume growth. I mean, it's a little bit a function of the businesses just getting bigger, and lot of bigger numbers, that's a small part of it. And I think it's just a prudent planning assumption. So, nothing meaningful in terms of what we're seeing.","With respect to pricing, the second part of your question, as we pointed out, we think overall for the company, it's about a 3% headwind which is a little bit more than we've seen in the past. Recall this is \u2013 Alexion has always been a volume-driven company. We kind of effectively have in the United States, the thinking is underneath CPI in terms of pricing. So, the headwind is one-third driven by metabolics, which is largely the annualization of what we talked about in the second and third quarter around Strensiq, as well as getting into some countries where the price points are a little bit lower.","And then on Soliris, it's a little bit more than half of that is in Rest of World markets with \u2013 a good example of this of what the dynamic is, price registration in Brazil that happened in late 2017. So, the annualization of that impact, and then other countries kind of in Europe as well as some other Rest of World markets. Brian, any other color to give?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Well, I mean, the only thing I would add is back to your first question, Eric, about the underlying growth, I mean, obviously this is a \u2013 it's a team right to our front lines. They've navigated through a lot of change in 2017, and you've seen the results now for the fourth quarter. You saw the results for the third quarter. So, it's a group that we're especially proud of. They've navigated the change as well, and as Paul said, when you just net out the puts and takes, we see continued growth ahead. We've talked many times now about the fact that PNH has more opportunity ahead than even behind us. And when we look at aHUS, the net is that's a bigger opportunity than even PNH, and you pile on top of gMG, that's a very exciting opportunity, and as I noted in the prepared comments, we're encouraged by the momentum that we have.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for the color.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. The underlying volume growth of Soliris remains double-digit when you include MG and then you adjust for ALXN1210.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Welcome.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning. I wanted to ask a ALXN1210 question, and I was hoping you could just put into context for us a couple of things that investors are focused on heading into the PNH read-out. So, one of the things which you've discussed previously is the meningitis risk, if you could just put into context how you view that for Soliris right now and how you would encourage us to look at that when we see the ALXN1210 data for PNH?","And then separately, you're using a co-primary endpoint in the Na\u00efve study, maybe just talk about that versus some of the historical data for Soliris. Thanks very much.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. This is John Orloff. Thanks for the question. With regard to the second question, I think, that the study is designed as a non-inferiority trial with co-primary endpoints for LDH normalization and transfusion avoidance. For LDH levels, we'll be analyzing those every two weeks from day 29 through the end of the core study week 26. And we'll be calculating a mixed model for repeated measures that leads to an odds ratio comparing ALXN1210 to eculizumab and then a non-inferiority margin based on that.","For transfusion avoidance, we'll be looking at the percentage differences between the two groups. Also, with non-inferiority margin that's based on traditional approaches and based on our extensive assessment of Soliris data historically.","With regard to meningitis risk, what we're seeing so far, we have three cases from our Phase 1\/2 program, and we have over 200 patient years of exposure. The rate calculated is consistent with what we've seen previously in our clinical development program for Soliris. And based on what we know about the risk related to C5 knockdown and meningococcal infection based on work that Ray Burrow out of the UK has done and he's probably one of the world's experts in this area. We believe that you need about 40% to 50% of the C5 activity actually to defend against meningococcal infection. So, we don't think there will be any material differences in the risk between Soliris and ALXN1210 or any other targets for C5 inhibition.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robyn Karnauskas with Citigroup.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think \u2013 I'm still a little confused by the guidance, and I appreciate all the color that you've given. But it still feels like \u2013 I just don't understand why the growth is maybe a few hundred million dollars when you grew much more \u2013 you grew more last year, and you also had a clinical trial impact. So, I mean, I just wanted to confirm that you're still seeing in PNH and aHUS, I think you said this, but just help me understand it better, you're still seeing the same number of patients being identified, there isn't a slowing in either of those indications?","And then on MG, I mean, how did you decide to, like, include \u2013 what to include for MG in your guidance? And just \u2013 it seems just super conservative, and I'm just trying to figure out if I'm missing something. And I'm sorry to ask the question again.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hey, Robyn. It's Brian. So, I'll go first and then see if Paul wants to add anything. I mean, I don't think you're missing anything, the communication on \u2013 that we've just talked about, is that we do see continued underlying growth. Admittedly, there is a lot of puts and takes and \u2013 I mean to get to that growth, we have to net out the trials, both our own, the competitive trials where, obviously for us, that's an estimate. From the demand generation that we have in the field, we continue to see growth in PNH, and it's more or less the same themes of, many times, doctors who are prescribing for PNH, it's their first experience with the product. That continues to track along. And in the case of aHUS, it's really the same dynamic. So, that's on the base business, and as Paul said, that's \u2013 our best view ahead is that that growth will continue.","And with MG, it's early days and we are encouraged. We gave an update about a month ago, and you can look at where the numbers were there, where they are now with our over 240 cases, and now of those over 90 patients that have been converted to Soliris therapy with MG and that will be a big focus for us. It's an exciting opportunity. We have dedicated neurology teams, as you know, and we believe that that will be a contributor to now a broader set of Soliris business looking ahead.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. If I can just ask a quick follow-up. So, a lot of investors are asking even though for non-inferiority is what the primary endpoint is, whether or not you think that patient uptake will be influenced by a numerical difference in ALXN1210 data. What's your thoughts on whether patients or doctors would be influenced by a numerical difference in the data even though it's a non-inferiority trial?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Sure. Thanks for the question. I mean, ALXN1210 is a significant opportunity for patients first and foremost and as well, of course, for Alexion to step back from ALXN1210 for a moment, we think it's really important to continue to emphasize that Soliris already sets a high bar for PNH, and that's important for patients, of course. It's important for us as a business when we look at the surround sound of competition that are looking to enter into the space, and to have the standard is quite an advantage. So, the mission with ALXN1210, our objective will be to make ALXN1210 the standard of care for PNH, call it, the new standard of care. And what's important is the design from John and his team for non-inferiority takes into account the fact that moving from a once every two week treatment cycle to once every eight weeks is really significant for patients. And if we achieve non-inferiority and we have that shift in interval of treatment, that's a significant win. And that's, in essence, what we're counting on and what we're excited to see the readout from the data, Robyn.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Robyn, I want to come back to discussion that all of us had about a month ago in San Francisco with respect to what's the definition of success with the ALXN1210. And for us, achieving non-inferiority versus Soliris is success. And it means, first of all, regulatory success, you know that LDH normalization and transfusion avoidance as co-primary endpoints that was agreed on with the regulatory authorities. It is also a clinical success because those endpoints are clinically relevant. And as Brian was saying, Soliris has set the high bar and we're moving here, as you know, as one example from LDH reduction to LDH normalization. So, we're raising the bar on what response efficacy looks like.","And then on patient success, Brian talked about instead of spending 26 days in the hospital, which is almost like a month, and understanding those patient journeys, what they go through, the days before going into the hospital, the day off \u2013 being in the hospital and so on to six, it's a big deal. The patient insights are strong. On top of that, ALXN1210 hopefully will allow us to have a subcu formulation once a week or even longer than that. So, we believe that with non-inferiority we have, we will be in a great position to have a facilitated conversion from Soliris to ALXN1210 for PNH and aHUS and raise the bar. So, we're really looking forward. And as we discussed, the timelines are still on track for a second quarter readout.","Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks very much for the question. Paul, a quick one for you actually. Could you give us a sense of where you see free cash flow going in 2018? You have about $758 million in 2017. And then, I just want to understand, if the profile of ALXN1210 is consistent with the non-inferiority design, do you see an opportunity to increase the penetration in the addressable patient populations of PNH or aHUS or is it primarily a switch opportunity? Thanks. Appreciate it.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Let me \u2013 Geoff, thanks for the question. Paul. Let me start with the first part of the question. I don't have spot numbers for you on the free cash flow, but let me characterize it. From an organic perspective, we ended the year as I said with $1.5 billion. We no longer have to talk about is it U.S. or ex-U.S., which is great news. Organically, so and I'd say underscore that saying excluding deployment of things above and beyond our base plan and that would be deployment for business development and deployment if we wanted to return cash for shareholders, it should move to some place in the $2.4 million, $2.5 million range. Now, I think that we actually hope to deploy it but that implies a leverage from the bottom line earnings per share and even the operating profit margin to the free cash flow.","So, said another way, free cash flow growth should expand in 2018 much more. And one of the biggest drivers of that is we actually are coming off of a high-water mark, we think, in 2017 with respect to capital expenditures. The biggest part of that is the investment that we have been making for the right reasons over the last couple years in Dublin for a large-scale manufacturing plant. We're coming towards a kind of a lower point of that. And if I open it up kind of into 2019 and 2020 and just like without giving exact numbers, if we achieve the financial objectives that we've laid out and ideally 2019 is also a high-water mark with respect to this headwind on ALXN1210 potentially moves to a tailwind. And as we go into 2019, ideally we continue to expand margins, and in fact, we get completely past the big capital expenditures, and free cash flow can expand even more going into 2019 and 2020. Turn it over to...","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah, the ALXN1210 is a conversion and a growth opportunity for us. So, it's both, but Brian will add some color to it.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. I'll just add. I mean, I like the question because that's how we look at it as well, that ALXN1210 is a significant opportunity. And maybe the best way to respond is we look at the speed of enrollment from John's group in both the Switch trial as well as the Na\u00efve trial as a proxy for what the potential of the product could be. And the fact that you have in the Na\u00efve patient population, the speed of enrollment that we saw suggests that there are potentially patients who have remained on the sidelines, so to speak, and that might be a further penetration opportunity for PNH. But all that said, of course, we want to wait and see what the data looks like.","Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up for Paul just with respect to BD, maybe you could give us an update on the team structure and hiring, where you guys stand, how we should think about timing of deploying some of that capital. And then post tax reform, are you guys thinking differently about your manufacturing or intellectual property footprint here, just given some of the changes? Thank you.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Terence, thanks for the question. Second part of the question is actually pretty complex, and I don't have really a great answer for you yet. I think we're going to use the better part of this year to kind of sort that out. No different plans with respect to our manufacturing footprint. We think that it's still fine even in the new regime, if you will.","With respect to business development, we've hired leader of the team. We're beginning to build out the team. We're beginning, as we talked about over the last month or so, to really get a flow of, if you will, the internal look of potential transactions. It is truly, though, with all that said, extremely hard to predict. It just is like hard to \u2013 we definitely want to rebuild the pipeline, but we will continue also, of course, be disciplined, and it's just hard to predict exactly when that will result in a program coming into the pipeline.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Discipline is the word (47:09); discipline on strategy, on financials as well as diversified opportunities. So we'll take the next question.","Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Chris Raymond with Piper Jaffray.","Christopher J. Raymond - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. So, just on the MG patient dynamics, just looking at your update versus a month ago, I think, when you last updated us on the OneSource program and the patients that are actually on paying drug. It looks like you added 80 patients, I think, to the OneSource program and 45 incrementally on the drug. I wonder if you could maybe provide any sort of color as to the success rate, I guess, in terms of getting \u2013 converting these OneSource patients actually to becoming a paying patient? I guess, maybe asked another way, how many dropouts should we expect and what are the sort of biggest reasons, if you're seeing any? Thanks.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Chris. It's Brian. So, I'll take them in two parts, and the first one maybe to give a little characterization around the types of patients, then I'll come back to the dropouts, which really is \u2013 we just have to remind ourselves where we are at the point of launch relative to the REGAIN study findings that we had. But starting with the patients, I mean so far, with the progress that we've made and I believe you characterized the numbers well from the last update to now, most of the patients that we're seeing come through the OneSource system as well as conversion to treatment are, call it, top-of-mind, out-of-option patients. In fact, they're probably on the more severe side of the REGAIN patient population that we studied. And that's been a kind of steady, continuous movement into the system, also somewhat accelerating, as we reported we would've expected once we crossed over into the new year. So, we've been encouraged that that's continued to progress.","The other point I would note is that the majority of those patients are not from the REGAIN study. So, most of these patients are in essence new to Soliris. That's really the first major point.","And then in terms of the dropouts, we're still in early days of launch and when you reflect on the REGAIN study, it was about a 60% response rate at the 12-week mark. And then from the clinical trial design, you can get into that 40% non-responder population. We're still early enough where most of the patients are inside of that window and, so far, the dropouts have been very small.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","We'll take the next question.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Levi, the next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ying Huang.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Can you hear me?","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes. We can.","Elena H. Ridloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yes.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Go ahead.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking the questions. So, I have a couple on the ALXN1210 Phase 3 trial. First of all, maybe you can confirm that for the normalization of LDH, it's actually through the baseline to week 26, not at the end of 26 week period. And then secondly, do you expect the rate of hemolysis to be higher in this trial, or similar to what you saw from the original Phase 3 in Soliris? Thank you.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Thank you, Ying. This is John Orloff. The evaluation of LDH actually, because it does take a few weeks for the normalization to take place with Na\u00efve patients, so it begins at day 29 and goes to the end of the core study which is month 6 or week 26. We will be looking at repeated measures, so it won't be just the end of the month six. We'll be incorporating all the measurements every two weeks into a model to calculate an odds ratio for ALXN1210 versus Soliris. So, it's a very robust way of looking at it.","And then the second question was...","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Hemolysis...","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","The rate of...","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. Hemolysis, yeah. So, historically, we've \u2013 nobody's ever looked at this in a prospective way with carefully defined criteria. Anecdotally, clinicians have reported rates of 20% to 25%. We anticipate that rate to be substantially lower than that based on the criteria we're using in the clinical trial which requires an elevation of LDH once they've brought it down to less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal; if they go back up to 2 times upper limit of normal and they have a concomitant a sign or symptom that would satisfy criteria for breakthrough hemolysis. So, it is more rigorous than the anecdotal clinical reports and we anticipate the rate to be lower than the 20% that's been reported.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Okay. Next question.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I just had a few. Paul, for the ALXN1210 headwind to Soliris, I'm assuming your guidance reflects that all PNH patients stay on ALXN1210 when you complete the Phase 3 or can patients return to commercial Soliris obviously prior to approval? And then on the NMO study, have there been any updates from the Phase 2? I just want to see how durable the effect is in NMO and what would you say the biggest risk in this study really is? Is it the volatility of events as they occur? To me, it seems like that's it, but I wanted obviously to get your guys' view.","Paul J. Clancy - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Geoff, I'll start, this is Paul. Thanks for the question there. It's a good point of clarification, but it's exact \u2013 it's very much as you said, the trial calls for patients staying in extension trial extending out effectively until registration. So, our current plans, assuming it's successful, is that we would file in the second half of the year and that they would stay on clinical drug into 2019, and so that's a big driver of why it continues to be a headwind in 2018.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And those extension studies are both from a Phase 1, 2 and Phase 3 programs. And then, John on the second.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. On the NMO, I mean, you're right to point out that there is some variability in relapses and how we define that. Our study now is incorporating a central adjudication committee that carefully looks at relapses and defines them as a relapse, and it's an event-driven trial. When you look back at the Phase 2 study, all of those patients had events prior to going in with a dramatic reduction going from a median of three attacks per year down to zero during the course of the 12-month study. There was a 12 months of follow-up. There were some relapses there but not as frequent as prior to entering the trial.","Based on the mechanism of action, we do not anticipate a durable effect after drug wears off over time. But again, we'll see, it's a Phase 2 study. It's really a sample size. It was 14 patients and it's hard to really extrapolate. So, we're looking forward to the results in mid-2018.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","As we discussed this is a double blind study. We don't have any insights into the conduct. And we also talked about the fact, this is higher risk than what we've done with MG since the pathophysiology of NMO is not as much understood. So, we're looking forward to get the data and really hope that we will bring a treatment option to those patients. I want to make sure that we stay focused on our risk profile on this program here.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Anupam Rama with JPMorgan.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I could just follow up on NMOS question here. But on slide 18, I'm thinking about the 2019 financial ambition, what's assumed in there for Soliris NMO, and how could these assumptions shift dependent on the success or failure of PREVENT? Thank you so much.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","When you think about the timing of the NMO, John talked about the fact that we're still in the midst of the conduct of the study having the data mid of this year. It will take some time for us to submit with the regulatory, the PDUFA dates sometime in the second half of 2019 depending on how fast we go and how fast the regulators go. So, the impact on 2019 revenue is very limited. And that's part of our financial ambition, double-digit revenue guidance that we gave you.","Anupam Rama - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Peters with Deutsche Bank.","Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A question on IP actually. So, you highlighted last year the new Soliris patents granted in the U.S. and Japan. I just wanted to see if you can update us on the status in Europe. And then related, on the biosimilar front, as you see companies progress, potential biosimilars to Soliris, how and when do you plan to defend kind of the new Soliris patent portfolio that you've been granted in the U.S.? Thank you.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. With respect to our IP in Europe, the process is ongoing. As you know, we were successful in the U.S. as well as Japan. So, we're taking a very similar approach. We're in dialog with the patent office over there and you should hear from us, as we said before, sometime in 2018 what the outcome is. We believe that we are in a strong position. Christopher","With respect to biosimilars, I think the best defense is offense here and to go back to what this team was talking about, our objective is to raise the bar in PNH and HUS, and we define success of our ALXN1210 program. And that's what we're focusing on, is to have a \u2013 hopefully, a better product with more treatment options for patients and that it becomes the preferred treatment option. And that is always the best defense. So, making ALXN1210 successful and protecting our flanks through IP, that is our strategy to ensure sustainability of our complement franchise. Next question?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christopher Marai with Nomura Instinet.","Christopher N. Marai - Nomura Instinet","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could help me think perhaps a little bit about how many patients are currently being inadequately treated with Soliris. Just thinking about compliance rates or otherwise, really around that frequency of treatment. You know, to give us a sense of just perhaps how much benefit, or how many patients may benefit from ALXN1210 profile.","And then secondarily, on MG, a recent survey highlighted physician interest in using several pipeline sort of candidates or candidates in development. How should we think about your ability to protect the franchise in out years given presumably high price? Is there any way to look at subcutaneous formulation, get creative there on price? And maybe walk us through your thoughts on that. Thank you.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","The first question is with respect to the \u2013 maybe the clinical profile of ALXN1210 and how we can differentiate versus Soliris.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. What I would say is that we've optimized the dosing regimen based on our Phase 1\/2 data to make sure that we have adequate coverage throughout the dosing interval, even extending it to eight weeks. So, the model defined trough concentration that would allow for all patients to achieve maximal C5 inhibition even at the end of the dosing interval for ALXN1210. Such an analysis was never really conducted with Soliris. So, we hope that the data, as it comes out in the second quarter, will support a more optimal coverage of patients. And at least, since we said numerical trends for LDH and normalization in LDH reduction and potentially breakthrough hemolysis.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","But it's fair to say that our clinical development plan is enriched, is \u2013 we have the optimal dosing and we've been talking about this for the last couple of months because we have a very strong PK\/PD model that helped us to define the dosing. The trial design, we're raising the bar in LDH normalization, which is I think also the right endpoint for us and the fact that we can do repeated measures as you were talking about, John, which is a big deal for those patients when you listen to the patient journeys. They go through their troughs, could be every two weeks or so on. So I feel that the design and the dosing and how we are assessing those patients is optimized for what we're trying to achieve.","John J. Orloff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","I would just add that to the extent that there are PK-based breakthroughs in patients at the end of the dosing interval in Soliris, which we've heard of anecdotally, we will address that with the ALXN1210 program.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","And yeah, Chris, this is Brian.","Christopher N. Marai - Nomura Instinet","Right and then I guess...","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Oh, sorry.","Christopher N. Marai - Nomura Instinet","Yeah. There were still...","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","We have...","Christopher N. Marai - Nomura Instinet","I was...","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Go ahead, go ahead.","Christopher N. Marai - Nomura Instinet","I was hoping to actually address perhaps number of patients currently on Soliris that maybe aren't following up with that regular every two week visit, if you could provide color on that? And that \u2013 sorry, that's how I meant to refer to the inadequately treated patient.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. This is Brian, I mean...","Christopher N. Marai - Nomura Instinet","I mean, on compliance there, yeah, and how that might improve? Thank you.","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. I'll touch on that. I mean, I think the key point is not so much about non-compliance. It's that the differences, Ludwig had referred to before, of going from living in cycles of life of every two weeks to the potential with ALXN1210 of once every eight weeks, that's the part that we hear frequently from patients that will be a meaningful benefit if we get there when we see the data play out. And that's why we believe that ALXN1210 has such an opportunity to raise the standard of care for PNH.","Ludwig N. Hantson - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","We'll take the next question.","Christopher N. Marai - Nomura Instinet","Okay, then on MG?","Brian Goff - Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Yeah. That was the last question. No? Yeah. Sorry, Chris, on MG, your question was about the competitive differentiation longer term, with many of us who have experience in rare diseases, the way to think about it is, and certainly the way we approach it is, it's a combination of aspects. One will be the clinical profile itself and our ambition is to make Soliris, of course, the standard for MG treatment. It is the first new FDA approved treatment for gMG in more than 60 years.","So, that alone is substantial, but there are other elements as well. The expertise of our dedicated neurology team, the expertise of the OneSource team, which is staffed by nurses, the Case Managers, those are all substantial benefits, too, and our goal will be to package all of that up together to make the journey for patients as well as for clinicians meaningful so that it becomes competitive as well.","Operator","That was our last question, and this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
