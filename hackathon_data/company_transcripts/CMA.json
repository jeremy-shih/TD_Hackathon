At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Darlene P. Persons","Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, and welcome to Comerica Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Vice Chairman of the Business Bank, Lars Anderson; and Chief Credit Officer, John Killian. A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC's website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. As we review our third quarter results, we will be referring to the slides, which provide additional details on our earnings.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause future results to vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release issued today, as well as Slide 2 of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our filings with the SEC. Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures and in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of the measures within this presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph, who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph W. Babb","Good morning. Today, we reported third quarter 2012 earnings per share of $0.61 or $117 million compared to $0.73 or $144 million for the second quarter and $0.51 or $98 million for the third quarter of 2011. Restructuring expenses related to the Sterling acquisition were $25 million or $0.08 per share in the third quarter compared to $8 million or $0.02 in the second quarter and $33 million or $0.11 in the third quarter of 2011.","Turning to Slide #4 and further highlights, our customer relationship focus supported loan and deposit growth in the third quarter despite a slow growing national economy. Average loans were up $369 million or 1% compared to the second quarter, primarily reflecting an increase of $717 million or 3% in commercial loans. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of average commercial loan growth resulting in more than a 20% year-over-year increase, including our acquisition of Sterling in July 2011. The increase in average commercial loans in the third quarter was primarily driven by increases in Mortgage Banker Finance, Technology & Life Sciences and Energy. Our focus on faster growing markets and areas of expertise is making a positive difference for us.","Strong non-interest-bearing deposit growth continued in the third quarter. We had record average deposits of $50 billion in the third quarter 2012 with an increase of $1 billion, primarily driven by the increase in non-interest-bearing deposits.","The FDIC's annual deposit survey as of June 30, 2012, recently made public, shows that we have increased our deposit market share in Texas, Michigan, California and Arizona. Net interest income declined slightly, reflecting the expected continued shift in loan portfolio mix and decline in accretion, as well as a decline in nonaccrual interest received and a leasing residual value adjustment. Lower loan and securities portfolio yields were partially offset by increased loan volume. Noninterest income decreased primarily due to a $10 million decrease in noncustomer-driven categories, including net securities gains of $6 million and a $5 million annual incentive bonus from a third-party credit card processor, both of which were received in the second quarter and not repeated in the third quarter. In addition, net income from principal investing and warrants declined $3 million.","We maintained our tight control of expenses in the third quarter. Excluding the $17 million increase in restructuring charges related to our Sterling acquisition, noninterest expenses were down $1 million. Restructuring expenses related to the Sterling acquisition are substantially complete and, in the third quarter, were mostly a result of real estate optimization.","Credit quality continued to be strong in the third quarter with 39 basis points of net charge-offs and watch list loans at 8.3% of the total loan portfolio, we are well within our historical normal range. Our capital position remains a source of strength to support our growth. We repurchased 2.9 million shares in the third quarter under our share repurchase program. Combined with our dividend and in accordance with the capital plan approved earlier this year, we returned $119 million to shareholders in the third quarter.","Our outlook for the full year 2012 is unchanged other than a slight increase in our expectation for average loan growth, which is now for an increase of 7% to 8% over full year 2011.","Turning to Slide 5 and some comments about our markets. Average loans in Texas grew 1%, including a 3% increase in commercial loans in the third quarter compared to the second and were up 19% from a year ago, including our acquisition of Sterling in the third quarter of last year. We saw loan growth in the third quarter in Energy, Technology & Life Sciences and Corporate. Average deposits in Texas declined from the second quarter as we expected due to runoff in certain non-relationship deposits and as we adjusted Sterling legacy deposit pricing. However, deposits in Texas are up 11% from a year ago.","The Texas economy continues to be a growth leader, consistently outperforming the national economy. Overall job creation in Texas remains well above the national average and is supported by an active energy industry and strong manufacturing conditions, both of which are supporting gains in the service sector.","Average loans in our Midwest market, which is primarily Michigan, decreased modestly compared to the second quarter. Deposits in the Midwest market increased 2% in the third quarter and were up 6% from a year ago with increases noted in Middle Market, Private Banking, Corporate and Small Business.","The economic recovery in Michigan is broadening, and the state economy continues to improve at a moderate pace, supported by strengthening auto sales. We are optimistic about the continued improvement in Michigan's economy.","In our Western market, which is primarily California, average loans are up more than 2% compared to the second quarter and were up 11% from a year ago. We saw loan growth in many areas in the third quarter, including Technology & Life Sciences, National Dealer Services, Private Banking and Corporate. Average deposits in the Western market are up approximately up 6% compared to the second quarter and are up 17% from a year ago.","The California economy is showing more momentum in 2012, particularly in Northern California. Job growth is improving and housing markets are looking firmer. State fiscal conditions remain challenging and some local governments are also under financial strain. We expect California's economy to continue to improve.","In closing, we feel confident that our footprint and relationship banking strategy will assist us in growing, even in this slowly improving national economy. Given all of the political and economic headlines, particularly about the looming fiscal cliff, we expect our customers to continue to be cautious. We are allocating resources to our faster growing markets and industries where we have considerable expertise. We have demonstrated throughout the cycle that we can carefully manage expenses, offsetting regulatory headwinds. And our capital position remains strong.","And now I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen L. Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. As Ralph mentioned, total average loan growth was 1% or $369 million quarter-over-quarter, as shown on the left-hand side of the slide. On the right-hand side, you can see commercial loans drove the increase, up 3% or $717 million, primarily due to growth in Mortgage Banker Finance, Technology & Life Sciences and Energy. Period-end loans increased $202 million, again, driven by the commercial loan growth of $445 million with increases noted in most lines of business. The green part of the bar shows Mortgage Banker average loan growing again this past quarter, driven by continued positive trends in the refinance market, as well as the market share gains we are making. As we have said in the past, Mortgage Banker outstanding can be volatile and should eventually decline as refinance volume slows.","While we continue to see growth in commercial loans, some of this growth has been offset by a decrease of $344 million or 3% in average commercial mortgage and real estate construction loans. The pace of decline is a reflection of property stabilizing and being refinanced in the end markets, as well as the expected runoff of former Sterling real estate loans that don't fit our strategy.","Total commitment increased for the fifth quarter in a row with $1.2 billion increase in the third quarter. We had commitment increases in every commercial business line, led by Middle Market and Mortgage Banker, resulting in a relatively stable utilization of 48.2%.","Also, our pipeline remains strong in the third quarter with approximately 2\/3 attributed to new business.","As shown on Slide 7, our deposits continue to grow and were at an all-time high. Our average non-interest-bearing deposits increased $1.3 billion or 6.7% over the second quarter. The growth was broad based with contributions from almost every business line. We were able to lower deposit pricing by another basis point, as shown by the yellow diamonds on the slide. While we continue to monitor and scrutinize deposit pricing, we don't expect to continue the trend of lowering the overall cost. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 88% at September 30.","Slide 8 provides details on our securities portfolio, which primarily consists of highly liquid, highly rated mortgage-backed securities. Interest earned on the MBS portfolio decreased $2 million from the second quarter due to lower reinvestment yields. There was only a small amount of accelerated premium amortization recognized in the quarter. While the current reinvestment rates for mortgage-backed securities are in the 1.5% range, we do try to invest as opportunistically as possible within our investment parameters to maximize the yield, minimize premium and maintain a short duration. In fact, we pre-purchase securities to replace fourth quarter runoff. Therefore, our MBS portfolio ended the quarter at about $10.1 billion.","In addition, with continued strong deposit growth during the quarter, we are managing the size of the portfolio in conjunction with our excess liquidity. At September 30, the remaining net unamortized premium was about $105 million, or just over 1% of the portfolio balance. The average duration on the portfolio remains low at 2.7 years. Prepayments were about $850 million in the third quarter, and we expect prepayments will be between $850 million to $950 million in the fourth quarter, a slight increase from our prior expectation in light of the impact of lower rates as a result of QE3, as well as the current size of the portfolio.","Turning to Slide 9, our net interest income declined $8 million in the third quarter. Absent the impact of accretion, it declined $5 million. We've summarized in the table on the right the major moving pieces in the quarter. I'll start with the first 2 items, which are highlighted. While we received some interest on nonaccrual loans every quarter, in the second quarter, it was unusually high, driving a decline of $4 million, which had a 3 basis point impact on the third quarter margin. Also, we had a $2 million adjustment to the residual value on 2 assets in our leasing portfolio, which reduced the margin by 2 basis points. Accretion for the purchased discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio declined $3 million in the quarter to $15 million, decreasing the margin by 2 basis points. As stated before, accretion should continue to trend downward, as we expect to recognize accretion of about $7 million to $9 million in the fourth quarter.","While we remain focused on holding spreads for new and renewed credit facilities, the continued shift in our portfolio had a $6 million or 3 basis point impact on the net interest margin, which I'll discuss further on the next slide. This impact was partially offset by the $3 million benefit from the increase in average loans in the quarter.","As I already mentioned, lower yields on the reinvestment of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a $2 million or 2 basis point negative impact. In addition to lower deposit costs, wholesale funding costs also declined as a result of maturities in the second quarter. Those 2 combined led to a decrease of $2 million and provided a 1 basis point increase to the margin.","One additional day in the quarter added $4 million. And finally, average excess liquidity increased $697 million, reducing the net interest margin by 3 basis points.","As we have stated before, our asset-sensitive balance sheet remains well positioned for rising rates. We believe a 200 basis point annual increase in rates, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result in over $170 million increase in net interest income.","Flipping to Slide 10. As shown in the top left, loan yields declined 13 basis points in total, including 9 basis points resulting from the decline in accretion, the decrease in nonaccrual interest received and the lease residual adjustment. The rest, 4 basis points of the decline, can be attributed to mix shift in the loan portfolio include our higher yielding Commercial Real Estate loan being replaced by lower yielding commercial loans, older fixed-rate loans maturing, some of which are refinanced at current yields, and positive credit migration.","The top right chart shows our proportion of fixed-rate loans has declined from 18% to 16% over the past year. While this does impact us, it is important to note that our fixed-rate loans, as a percentage of total loans, is the lowest among our peers, and 75% of our floating rate loans are LIBOR based, predominately 30-day LIBOR. Therefore, changes in LIBOR, up or down, particularly 30-day LIBOR, have an impact on our yields.","In the bottom left chart, positive credit migration is apparent in the declining proportion of the watch list loans and increasing proportion of higher quality loans. Higher quality credit loans comprise 92% of the portfolio compared to 88% a year ago. Generally, the lower the credit risk, the lower the yield on a loan.","Lastly, the portfolio mix shift of decreasing Commercial Real Estate loans being replaced by commercial loans is reflected in the bottom right chart. Commercial Real Estate loans tend to have higher yields than C&I loans, and C&I loans now make up 62% of our portfolio compared to 55% a year ago. It is important to note that we expected the impact on our yields from these mix shift factors will slow, as the repricing and replacement of fixed-rate loans bottom, Commercial Real Estate will turn at some point and we are well within our normal historical credit quality range.","Turning to the credit picture on Slide 11. Credit quality continued to be strong. Net charge-offs remain low at $43 million or 39 basis points of average loans. Our provision for credit losses was $22 million. This was a small increase from the second quarter and reflects the variability you'd expect, given the fact that our credit metrics are within normal historical ranges. As shown on the right, our watch list and nonperforming loans continue to trend downward. Watch list loans decreased $182 million to $3.7 billion, or 8.3% of total loans. Nonperforming loans decreased $55 million. We are now at the lowest level seen since 2008. The carrying value of our nonaccrual loans is currently about 60% of the contractual value. Foreclosed property also declined and remains very low at $63 million. Our allowance to NPLs was 94%.","Slide 12 outlines noninterest income, which decreased $14 million in the quarter, with $10 million due to decreases in certain noncustomer-related categories. As Ralph mentioned, in the second quarter, we recorded net securities gains and an incentive bonus received from our third-party credit card provider that were not repeated in the third quarter. Also, net income from principal investing and warrants, which varies quarter-to-quarter, declined $3 million. These declines were partially offset by a $5 million decrease in deferred compensation asset returns, which is completely offset in deferred compensation plan expense. In addition, customer-driven fees declined $4 million, including a $3 million decrease in customer derivative income. Almost all other customer fee income categories were relatively stable.","Turning to Slide 13, we continue to maintain good expense control. Excluding restructuring costs, expenses declined $1 million. We had $25 million in restructuring costs in the third quarter related to the acquisition of Sterling, which closed in July of 2011. We expect restructuring charges related to the Sterling acquisition will be complete with final restructuring expenses of $1 million to $4 million in the fourth quarter. We had a $3 million increase in salaries. The increase was primarily due to a decrease -- to a -- was primarily due to a $5 million increase in deferred compensation, which, as I mentioned, is completely offset in noninterest income. Absent the impact from deferred compensation, salaries expense would've been down, driven by a $3 million decrease in executive incentives. Our workforce was stable quarter-over-quarter and has decreased 7% over the past year, including the headcount related to Sterling as shown on the bottom chart on the slide. Other noninterest expense included a $5 million decrease in legal expenses.","Moving to Slide 14 and capital. As Ralph mentioned, we repurchased 2.9 million shares under our share repurchase program in the third quarter. And when combined with the shares repurchased in the first 2 quarters, we have completed $210 million of our $375 million capital plan put in place this past March. As far as Basel III, we continued to believe that under the proposed stricter capital and risk-weighted assets definition on a fully phased-in pro forma basis, Comerica is currently estimated to exceed the standards for well-capitalized banks. If calculated according to the proposed rules with the balance sheet as it stands today, our Tier 1 Capital ratio is estimated to be comfortably above the new 8.5% regulatory standard, which will be phased in over the next 7 years.","Finally, turning to Slide 15, our outlook for the full year 2012 compared to 2011 has not changed, other than a slight increase to our expectations for loan growth. We expect average loans to grow 7% to 8%. Our loan growth so far this year has been strong and broad based, and we have benefited from our expertise in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer Services and Energy. Going forward, we expect Commercial Real Estate loans to continue to decline and Mortgage Banker outstanding to eventually normalize, in line with refinanced activity. In addition, the current uncertain economic environment does bear on demand for new loans, and we intend to continue to exercise relationship pricing discipline. As stated earlier, on net interest income, we expect accretion to be $7 million to $9 million in the fourth quarter, down from $15 million in the third quarter, and to continue to decline, though at a slower pace, each quarter until the remaining balance of about $60 million is depleted. In addition to accretion, we expect that the impact from the continued mix shift of the loan portfolio will slow, as older fixed-rate loans mature and the decline in Commercial Real Estate ultimately turns.","On noninterest income and expense, we will continue to work to offset the regulatory headwinds by seeking full customer relationships and maintaining expense control.","In closing, we are pleased with our continued loan and deposit growth, solid customer fee income generation, tight expense management and strong credit performance. In the current environment, we remain keenly focused on the bottom line. Now we are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Curious, if we look at the list of items impacting the margin on Slide 9, is the right way to think about pressure on the margin that the pressure from loan portfolio dynamics I know, Karen, you said, that might abate a bit and the lower MBS yield, which sounds like they might pick up because you prepurchased securities? Should that combined continue to put roughly this amount of pressure on the margin each quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, as I said, you should think about the impact on the loan portfolio dynamics, Steve, as slowing over time because it's due to fixed-rate loans maturing, and those contractual maturities will slow over time. It's also due to the impact of the Commercial Real Estate and the improving credit quality. And again, both of those should slow. On the securities yield, that is obviously a factor of the overall rate environment. And we will think about tactically prepurchasing to try to, within our investment parameters, to try to minimize that impact.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Karen, could you just follow up and give us some color on the yield and duration that you're actually adding new securities today?","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure. The yield is very similar to the overall portfolio yield. As you can see, even with the actions that we took this quarter, the duration of the portfolio did not change, still at 2.7 years. And the yields under which we're purchasing today are around the 150 area.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Can I ask a follow-up question on that? Just to Ralph. Ralph, you communicated over the past couple of months, and again on this call, this expectation for loan growth to slow, talking about uncertainty in the business community and fiscal cliff. At this stage, is this still chatter among your clients? Or are you starting to actually see this play out?","Ralph W. Babb","I think, in answer to your question, customers are continuing to be cautious. And while we did see growth, it was slowing growth during the quarter. And I think that's what you would expect given that a lot of these issues are going to come to fruition here in the next several months. I mean, you'll have the election, you'll have the fiscal cliff, and people are waiting to see what they think will happen. Lars, you've seen anything different?","Lars C. Anderson","No, Ralph. I think that accurately kind of depicts what we're hearing from our customers. An interesting, I think, metric though that we've got to look at is our customers are clearly getting healthier. They're delevering, they're building liquidity. What, Steve, you may have picked up in the deck was we did see a very significant increase in commitments. In fact, those went up over $1.2 billion. So the interesting thing is we're seeing activity levels. And frankly, we're seeing a lot of activity level in just general Middle Market. They're just not borrowing. They're not making the investments. But frankly, we are very encouraged to see that level of commitment rise.","Ralph W. Babb","I think that's underlying, too, with the level of deposits we're seeing with the new record deposits, and that's coming in from many of our businesses.","Lars C. Anderson","That's right.","Ralph W. Babb","People are sitting on the liquidity, as Lars mentioned, and waiting to see what's going to happen here. The good news is, they're making good money and having good growth internally, but they're being very careful about investing for the future as my editorial comment.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just in terms of the loan growth commercial was strong once again, much of the growth was -- did come from the Mortgage Banker Finance, and Karen, I know you said the outlook is for a decline. But just given what the industry is seeing in refis, it's not surprising to me it's up as much as it is and you noted market share gains. But should we eventually see a decline, given -- I know you guys have used the MBA forecast? How are you thinking about normalization as we look into 4Q or even as we look into 2013? Can you give us a little bit of color in terms of how you're thinking about the normalization from here?","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure. Mortgage Banker, as we said before, can be very variable and is very difficult to predict. The Mortgage Banker Association forecast for the fourth quarter does show a decline in application volume. Given the low rate environment, it's hard to see if that will ultimately happen. But as we said before, it should decline at some point, it's just difficult to say exactly when.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And if I could ask one follow-up question. Just in terms of -- to follow up with Steve's question, in terms of securities portfolio, you're now at $9.4 billion on the MBS portfolio. You historically talked about $9 billion. Just given where reinvestment yields are right now at 1.5%, as you noted, should we expect to see that portfolio shrink over time and we could actually see the balance sheet shrink a little bit just given where loan yields currently are right now? Sorry, given where securities yields are right now?","Karen L. Parkhill","Ultimately, we do want loan growth, and we want to make sure that we are very positioned for loan growth. So ultimately, that portfolio shrinking is a good sign because it would be a result of loan growth. In the meantime, we are comfortable with our securities portfolio where it sits today. We look at it all the time, taking into account our forecast for where deposits are going to be going, where loan growth is going to be going and keeping in mind the fact that we want to be well positioned for loan growth.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. If I can just -- Sorry, Lars, go ahead.","Lars C. Anderson","No, I was just going to say that, that is -- the key is, Karen was saying with managing our excess liquidity.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. If I could just squeeze one quick last one in there. On the commercial loans, of the 14 basis points of yield compression you showed, can you break it down in terms of how much of that was from runoff of the accretion versus how much are you actually seeing core pricing pressure on the commercial side?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. I think it's important on the yield to know that 9 basis points of that 14 basis point decline was from accretion, the lease portfolio adjustment and the impact on the nonaccruals that we noted. The rest, the 4 basis point decline, was from those 3 portfolio impacts that we talked about on Slide 10.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide us some perspective on why your Midwest loan balances are still declining, especially because many of your larger Midwest competitors have grown in the last year. And I'm wondering if you can also highlight overall competition pricing and also, you can kind of cross why your optimistic earlier comments on Michigan haven't yet translated to loan growth yet.","Ralph W. Babb","Okay. Lars, would you like to comment on that?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, I'd be glad to. Yes, in linked quarter, you did see in the Midwest market a slight decline in the balances there. And it was pretty much in a number of different categories. But on the flip side of that, and I referenced this earlier, Craig, with -- in my comments to Steve, when we look at the commitment level in Michigan, they continue to increase. And in fact, they were one of largest contributors to the increase in overall commitment levels for that portfolio. So a lot of our Middle Market customers, and even our wealth customers that bank with us, are very connected, obviously, to the auto industry. The auto industry has come back very strong. There's a lot of liquidity delevering going on. Frankly, I'm very encouraged with the numbers of customers we have, the numbers of customers we continue to pick up. We can't control the usage under the facilities, but what we can focus on is the number of customers we're serving in Michigan, the number of customers we're serving in Middle Market banking, executing our relationship banking model. And I think we've seen, even in the local -- or the most recent market share gains in deposits, that we continue to stay very focused on this critical market for our franchise. Frankly, I'm very, very encouraged there. We're doing some things right now with Wealth Management with that team cross-selling those products into -- at a much deeper level our Middle Market banking book of business. And frankly, that is going extremely well. We've got some very experienced bankers. We got some long-term relationships, and I'm very encouraged about that marketplace.","Ralph W. Babb","Just to underline that, as we were visiting with customers recently, we heard from a number of those customers that they are doing what we were indicating earlier. They're building their cash and waiting and want to run with a higher level of liquidity than they have in the past as well.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, I think we, to that point, we see that in Michigan. We also see that across the rest of the franchise, frankly. There is a much more conservative perspective around maintaining liquidity levels for the customers that we bank and we target.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Lars, on the National Dealer business, which is mostly a Western business, not a Midwest business for you, do have an interest in making that more diverse? So growing the Midwest and Texas business there? And also, you're very diverse in terms of the guys you work with, the manufacturers. Would you want a larger U.S. weighting in there, too, from the U.S. manufacturers?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, well, first of all, if you look at our business today, 43% of the overall nameplates are the Japanese. We have somewhere, I think, just under 25% is the U.S. nameplates and then the balance is rounded out, hence others. Those have shifted over time as I think the market has shifted and consumer demand has changed. I think we're where we need to be right now to optimize our performance with our dealers. We're very focused on the dealers, maybe a little less so on the brand. We've got a number of dealers that we worked with for a very long period of time, deep relationships. And frankly, some of the nameplates that they carry have changed as we've come through the cycle. Now I would point out, when you look at the dealer portfolio, you will see a concentration on the West Coast in balances. That, you have to keep in mind, is where the dealers are headquartered, okay? We're very focused on local relationships, local decision making. It's very consistent with our relationship banking strategy. And frankly, the dealers on the West Coast have performed very, very well, especially the strongest, which, as you know, is what we focus on in our dealer business. But many of those dealers are doing business, frankly, throughout the country. So I think it's less about focusing on the West Coast, it's more about focusing on the very best in the industry, keeping the ones we have and frankly, keeping a very disciplined strategy and staying very focused on picking up new customers that fit in a long-term proven strategy.","Ralph W. Babb","You might mention, too, Lars, about our mega-dealer in underlining the...","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, yes, that's right, and I guess I took for granted a little bit our strategy that it's really clear, we do take a mega-dealer. We're very focused, in case you're less familiar on this, with really the larger dealers. These are dealers that, in many cases, have multiple, not just points of sale, but also have multiple brands, creates balance in their franchise, which we really appreciate. But we're really not focused on the moms and the pops, and of course, many of those got hurt more going through the most recent recession. We're focused on the best, the strongest, we think, in the business. And frankly, while we didn't have as much growth in just linked quarters, this has been a great long-term growth business for us. And frankly, I'm less concerned about the quarter-to-quarter growth in balances as I am about the numbers of dealers that we retain, we deepen our relationships with, and frankly, picking up just the best in the industry.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I guess this question is for Lars. Lars, just wondering what kind of competitive dynamics you're seeing in some of your Specialty commercial lines like Energy and Tech & Life Sciences where maybe we've seen some new entrants come in, in the last year. Are you guys -- feel like you're gaining market share in these areas? Or just can you give us some details there?","Lars C. Anderson","Right. Yes, in what I define as some of our Middle Market industry groups, it's all part of our Middle Market strategy. In some of those areas that have had very nice growth, obviously, in the U.S., the auto industry, Technology & Life Sciences and the Mortgage businesses have all benefited nicely. And while, with our unique industry expertise, we have been able to distinguish ourselves and clearly have some leadership positions in those areas, we expect to continue to grow those businesses. We have very tenured bankers. We have the right products. Frankly, we're in the right places. Now I would tell you that it is more competitive today almost across every line of business that we've got. But I've seen this throughout my career. You do see different institutions, banks will jump in and out of industries. We've stayed very consistent in our industry areas. And I think that our customers know that, the industries know that, we stayed very committed. And frankly, we get paid a premium for that. And we're going to continue to stay very focused on our relationship banking model, and we're going to stay very focused on getting paid a premium for that. Even, to point out, Jennifer, with the pricing pressures we have gotten in some of these Specialty areas, as well as Middle Market, Corporate, some of our others, we, as a company, have largely been able to hold our loan spreads now for 3 quarters in a row. I think that's pretty remarkable, and I think it's evidence of our successful relationship banking model.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Placet from Matt's team. Just as a follow-up on the topic of loan growth, looking at Slide 5, specifically as it relates to the Texas market. The chart seems to indicate the pace of growth is slowing a bit there the past few quarters. Just given how much of a focus Texas is for Comerica, curious if you can speak to some of the trends you're seeing down there. Is this just a function of continued uncertainty among customers or...","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, absolutely. I'd be glad to answer that. What you've seen, obviously, over a long period of time, Rob, is that the Texas market has been a source of excellent growth for our company. Quarter-to-quarter, you end up with some lumpiness in particular businesses and -- but I'm very, very encouraged. In fact, if you look at our overall commitments today as a company, we saw and continue to see excellent positioning in our Texas market. Utilization rates can kind of move around a little bit, but I feel very encouraged. In fact, I would point out in the Houston market, that continues to be, which happens to be a big part of the ex-Sterling Bank footprint, that's one of our highest productivity areas for commercial banking. But that includes Small Business Banking. In fact, we're seeing record levels of pipeline building in the Houston metropolitan market in Small Business. So we're very, very encouraged about what the Sterling franchise has done for us in Texas. Frankly, one of the things that distinguishes us, I think, in our business model is our local decision-making, local leadership. Downey Bridgwater, who was CEO of Sterling, is heading that up, bringing together all the resources of the bank there. And it's not just in Small Business, it's not just in Retail, it's not just in our commercial banking, but we're seeing at a noninterest income opportunities and list there, too. So I think we're very well positioned from the macroeconomics of the Texas market but also with the execution of our relationship banking model here.","Karen L. Parkhill","And what I would just add to that, Rob, going on in Texas is the purposeful decline of the some of the Commercial Real Estate loans that we acquired with Sterling. That's happening on the loan side. And even on the deposit side, as we reprice the deposits in that market, there is purposeful decline of some of the higher-rate CDs going on in that market.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then also just a follow-up on the decline in the loan yield this quarter. Should we take your comments to imply that you're actually not seeing any core pricing pressure, but rather it's just some of the onetime items this quarter, the impact from lower accretion and the loan mix shift?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Sure. Clearly, as Karen pointed out well before, we do have the continual runoff and refinancing of some of the higher-fixed-rate mortgage loans, kind of a remix of the business tilting towards C&I, less Commercial Real Estate and positive asset quality migration. Those all contribute to it. But if you put those aside and I look at just our core loan spreads, what we're doing with our new business, with our renewed business, overall, I'm not going to tell you it's not -- it's easy. It's a fistfight out there in terms of competitive pricing day to day. My team knows that in the footprint, the Retail Bank, the Wealth Management team. However, in spite of that, as I pointed out before, for 3 quarters in a row, our loan spreads have held. And frankly, I think that is the best evidence of our relationship banking model, our experienced bankers, frankly, our industry expertise.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies & Co.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is actually Bryan Batory calling from Ken's team. My question is on the excess liquidity position. So that obviously built a little bit this quarter, and it looks like you guys put some to work at the end of the quarter just buying the securities. But if loan demand remains weak, what is your appetite to further invest or further put that to work in the securities portfolio just given where rates are today?","Ralph W. Babb","Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","Thank you, Brian. As I mentioned, we are very focused on loan growth. That said, we do manage our overall portfolio with a continual eye looking to the future on where we think deposits will go and where we think loans will go. When we think about the securities portfolio, one of the things that we are very mindful of is the fact that we want to be well positioned for loan growth, and as rates rise, the securities portfolio will be marked and will have an extension risk on it. And as it's marked-to-market, with the new proposed Basel III capital rule and the AOCI filter, that could have a significant impact on capital. So we are weighing all of these things, where we think deposits will go, where we think loans will go, excess liquidity, the longer-term impact of the securities portfolio, should we increase it, as we make these decisions. It is a fluid process. We continually monitor it.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's great. And my follow-up is just on expenses. So they've been pretty well contained over the past couple of quarters, and I think we're starting to see the efficiency plan that you guys announced earlier this year show. But given the low rate environment, are there any other levers you can pull on the expense side to offset some of the pressures that we could see on revenues?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, we are continually focused on expenses, and Comerica has been good for a long time at managing our expenses. But that said, as we continually focus on it and continually look at where we can be more efficient, there will be and are additional levers that we will pull to continually manage expenses flat to down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Penala","My question is on capital returns for next year. Clearly, this year, Ralph, you've returned a good amount of capital back to shareholders. But what I gather from this call is given the rate environment and the growth trajectory in the U.S., and you mentioned that corporates have tons of cash, the revenue outlook for the industry will remain challenging next year. I guess could you give us a sense of how aggressive well-capitalized institutions like Comerica can be next year in terms of the stress test? Additionally, what is your propensity to buy growth with that excess capital next year?","Ralph W. Babb","Well, I think just underlining what Karen was talking about earlier, this is not the time to stretch and go away from your basic model, which is relationship, as you heard Lars talk about on commercial lending, the same thing is true in Wealth Management and Retail. And what's going to happen is we're going to have to see what the rules are as well. We have not seen yet the final rules from a liquidity standpoint and other things that need to come out. And therefore, as we have historically, we've been aggressive at returning capital, as you've just mentioned, and we will look at that as well. But a lot will depend on where we think everything is moving at that point in time and where the rules stand as well. Karen, do you want to add anything to that?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, I would just say, Erika, in particular on the stress test, we hope to receive the scenarios from the fed in early November, so it's too early, honestly, to say anything about the stress test. We will be running it this year. We will be submitting again in January. And we do recognize that we come at this from a position of strength.","Erika Penala","Got it. And I guess is it fair to assume, if the parameters are similar to last year, that given that you're entering this year, to your point, in a position of even greater capital strength, we could assume that the capital return trajectory for Comerica can continue to keep building?","Karen L. Parkhill","I think it's too early to assume anything because it's a new process each year and a new scenario each year.","Ralph W. Babb","We'll have to work our way through it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin with Citigroup.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I want to ask more on the NIM. When you were sort of signaling -- I just want to get -- understand, you finished the quarter 2.96% for NIM. We should think going forward that there is going to be some more compression in the current environment, although the rate of compression will abate. Is that the right way to think about things?","Karen L. Parkhill","As you know, we focus more on the net interest income on the dollar side than on the rate side. But what I will say is that you will see some continued decrease in accretion, as we've talked about. We expect the next quarter accretion to be $7 million to $9 million versus the $15 million that we had this quarter. And going forward, accretion should continue to slow as we have about $60 million left of accretion over the 4-year life of the rest of the loans. So that will come in over time, but slow each quarter. As you think about the rest of net interest income, the loan portfolio dynamics that we talked about on Slide 10 should slow over time, but they do exist still. And on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio, while we continue to manage that as best we can, that is impacted by the current rate environment.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And Ralph and Lars, you talked about some of your clients being reticent right now to actually go ahead and invest in their businesses. Do they just need some kind of certainty? Do they just need to know the outcome of the elections and it doesn't really sort of matter who wins, they'll go ahead and invest in it? Or is it going to sort of matter who wins the election? I mean, how should we think about it? They just need certainty, or do they actually need to know what path we're going down?","Ralph W. Babb","I think it's certainty because I think as you look back over history, people can deal with certainty if they know what the rules are and what the expectations are moving forward, and that's kind of what we're hearing is more of the uncertainty. And it's a little different for each customer, depending on the businesses they're in and how they're impacted. But as was mentioned earlier, everyone is being very cautious here and waiting to get that certainty but also strengthening their balance sheets, which, longer term, will be a positive from that standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello with UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to follow up on the deliberate mix shift in the loan portfolio. Just kind of curious, maybe Lars could provide some color with this, I'm just curious, given that the yields are holding up much better on the CRE side than on the C&I side, I'm just curious what's going to make the risk-reward a little bit more attractive, where you don't just see maybe the slowing of the runoff but maybe you see some attractive opportunities on that side of the portfolio.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, and you're speaking, Steve, particularly to the Commercial Real Estate side of the portfolio, correct?","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Exactly.","Lars C. Anderson","So first of all, we've shared before our strategy and continues to be our Commercial Real Estate strategy is very much of an in-footprint urban market kind of oriented focus. What we are seeing is primarily multifamily activities. Now just because the portfolio has seen some declines and, as Karen pointed out, a portion of that is runoff of nonstrategic kind of assets, opportunities that we've got in the portfolio, that will eventually subside. We have had, over the last number of quarters, though, a lot of volume. We have closed a lot of multifamily. We continue to see a few other asset classes where we've been very deliberate and conservative in our approach. But for example, an office in the Northern California market, which, frankly, is red-hot, industrial in Southern Cal, which is very, very strong. I think we're very well positioned. We've got the right model. We've got the right bankers. We've got a lot of experience, but we're going to be very deliberate. We're going to be very focused, and frankly, we're going to make sure that we execute our relationship banking model. This is not just about project finance. This is really more about working with developers that we've known for a very, very long period of time. And by the way, an increasing amount of them are doing their wealth business with us, which is great to see, frankly because we stood by them going through this past cycle and I think we have deeper relationships. So I do think we're going to continue to see opportunities there. I do think that a lot of the construction loans that we've closed and, as we see, fundings are going to start to impact, on a positive way, that portfolio. And clearly, we are getting better spreads in that portfolio than you would in a typical middle market C&I opportunity. I see it as source -- as an opportunity for growth. It's just we got to get out, I think, a little bit further into next year.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. That's great color. And then my second question kind of relates to that Michigan market and a lot of the positive momentum that you're seeing up there. I'm just kind of curious how you think the recent acquisition of Citizens Republic there, does that create some more potential opportunities for you to take market share, or how do you think about that?","Ralph W. Babb","We've been in that market, as I think everybody knows, well over 160 years. We're well known. We've got a great team there, and as things move forward, as Lars was talking about earlier, the economy will provide increasing opportunities. I don't think that any one situation will change that to any degree.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Sterne Agee.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask -- I have in my notes that the Mortgage Bankers portfolio is about 85% refi. Can you give any color around if that's sort of the case for the third quarter and generally speaking, if there's any concerted effort to move that more towards purchase-type model?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, we have seen a bit of a shift. If you look at the third quarter, our refi volume was about 75%. So we did see some increase in the activity of purchase volumes in the third quarter for volumes. Are we positioned to capture more of the purchase market? Absolutely. The key for us is that we're working with the right mortgage companies. And there's been a lot of change and shift in how mortgages are originated in this industry, and frankly, I think that we're very well positioned. The mortgage companies that we're working with typically are the larger, stronger independent ones, and frankly, they're capturing a lot of volume, and they're doing very well. So I continue to see this as a long-term business for us. It's going to have some variation in the balances, but I pointed this out before, for me, the key is to have a deep relationship with them, to be one of the preferred lenders. Our treasury management cross-sell, which I use as a nice bellwether for deepening our relationships, is over 90% with the mortgage companies we work with.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you just talk about National Dealer just for a second? Have you seen the falloff in average balances this quarter? And I'm asking because I'm trying to get a sense of what is going into your 7% to 8% loan growth assumptions for the year.","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Okay, speaking more specifically just about the dealer portfolio, first of all, because we do have, obviously, a couple of businesses, including mortgage banking finance, with variability, if you looked back before this year over the last decade, we really only saw one fall period where we did not see a seasonal decline in inventories as our dealers cleared the lots, really position themselves for new year models. This year, we have not seen it happen. And I would tell you the primary reason that we have not seen the declines in those balances is the Japanese nameplates, frankly, have been rebuilding their market share in the U.S., and you see that showing up in the average days on hand of inventory. That is the days that a car sits on the lot has actually increased in the industry. But that's really driven by the Asian brands. So we've just seen less variation in that particular business. The mortgage banking finance, we'll just have to see, to Karen's point, how that impacts our outstandings on a go-forward basis.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that helps. And then just quickly on the interest on nonaccruals, obviously, you made a point saying the second quarter is very high, third quarter is not nearly as high. When you look at your, I guess, troubled -- or your credit -- troubled credit portfolio, how much room left is there potentially to get additional increases in the interest on nonaccruals as those cure themselves? Or are we more likely to see a sustainable level at these lower levels of additional interest income?","Ralph W. Babb","John?","John M. Killian","Every quarter, we see, as Karen alluded to before, kind of a steady state level of interest that we do earn on nonaccrual loans. It was just a particular event in the second quarter. One credit in particular plus a small part of another that we had a very fortunate event, where they were able to refinance and pay us off in full, and that spiked the nonaccrual interest in that quarter. On a going-run rate basis, that's really hard to predict that companies can do that, so I would say that Q2 was definitely an aberration. And I point you to the kind of the steady run rate for prior quarters as a way to look at it going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Oppenheimer.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","All the income statement and balance sheet questions taken care of. I guess just one question for Ralph. As you look at the revenue pressure across the industry and the potential for negative earnings growth next year at Comerica, if I just look at consensus and where it could go, does that change your appetite at all to do deals as a way to maybe fill in that earnings hole in this challenging revenue environment?","Ralph W. Babb","As we've said before, we feel very comfortable today with where our footprint is. We have a lot of opportunity, especially given the growth we've had here in Texas, with the Sterling acquisition that Lars was talking about earlier and our position in California, 2 of the largest markets in the country and now, as I mentioned earlier as well, with Michigan's economy picking up. I think we're very well positioned to take advantage of growth in these markets. And the acquisitions, while we always look to see those, today, it would have to be a very strategic opportunity, and there wouldn\u2019t be many of those from that standpoint.","Karen L. Parkhill","And Terry, I would just add that while the environment is not so rosy right now for banks, we are very focused on the bottom line and growing that by controlling what we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I just have one follow-up. Just in terms of, Lars, your comments on the Commercial Real Estate runoff, could you talk about kind of how much more planned runoff there would be from the Sterling portfolio?","Lars C. Anderson","Very difficult to tell. When you look at that, you got to keep in mind there's a couple of different dynamics going on there, and frankly, one is the interest rate environment. The opportunity for some of those customers to refinance at another institution will certainly have some impact on it. Frankly, I think that we continue to find some opportunities in that portfolio, too, where it's investor-owned. We're finding some good Private Banking, Wealth Management opportunities. So we're just going to kind of execute. We're going to continue to work through that portfolio. But I'll tell you it'd be very difficult to give you a projection on exactly what kind of runoff we're going to see quarter to quarter on the portfolio. But I do think that we will see continued declines.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And if we look at the commercial mortgage portfolio overall, is it fair to say that the end market appetite has been maybe a little greater than expected and that has attributed to the ongoing runoff at the pace it's been?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, I think that that's the single biggest driver. I think that as we continue to have stabilization of projects and they become permanent market-ready as the permanent market rates continue to hit very attractive levels, our customers are accessing and benefiting from that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is actually Thomas on behalf of Paul. You touched a bit on, I guess, businesses and customers sort of in a wait-and-see approach, but you seem pretty positive on the economic environment. We're just trying to get a better sense of whether the loan growth you were experiencing kind of contributed -- whether you contribute that to market share gains or sort of an improving economic environment overall in your markets.","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Well, I would say it is not an improving economic environment that has driven, for the most part, our growth. If you look at our commercial loan growth, in particular, just as one segment, that's increased over 20% over the last year. That is market share gains. That is clearly some of the industry groups that we talked about earlier, where I think we're well positioned with the right bankers, industry kind of expertise. I think Texas has made a real difference in that. Obviously, in the Texas market alone, the economic environment has helped. But keeping in mind the fact that a lot of our customers continue to de-lever in order to get growth, you do have to move some market share. And frankly, I think with our balance of businesses and in the markets that we serve, frankly, the market has well received our relationship banking model, and I think we've been very well positioned to operate in a very challenging market. Frankly, I think those are the key drivers for us.","Ralph W. Babb","I would underline what Lars just said on the economies, though, that both Texas and, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, Michigan is coming back because of the auto industry turn and auto sales now at about 14.9 million, that has provided a good economic turnaround. We're seeing some in California as well, as I mentioned, and I would underline the specific industries that we're in like Technology & Life Sciences, which has been strong through the downturn as well. So it is a business diversity as well as being in the right markets at the right time.","Lars C. Anderson","And I may just underscore the California issue because I think that we've begun to see, and this is really on a go-forward basis, that that market appears to be strengthening. We did get some growth in the past in Northern Cal kind of general middle market. And we are seeing maybe the beginnings of firming up in the economy in the Southern Cal market, some promising signs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Your loan growth outlook, that still implies flat end-of-period balances for next quarter. I just want to confirm that that's fair or -- and that's consistent with your expectation for the fourth quarter. And then also, is that likely to be the case for the first half of '13?","Karen L. Parkhill","I think what's important in our outlook is that we do expect to continue to see some decline in Commercial Real Estate as we're growing our other businesses, so that is reflected in our new outlook of 7% to 8%, plus the fact that we can't predict with great certainty where Mortgage Banker will go.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the first half of '13, can you give us a little bit of color on how you think about loan trends there?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, on 2013, we will provide our outlook, as we always do, on the fourth quarter earnings call. But you should think about loan growth from the perspective of where we sit today, where we continue to see some decline in Commercial Real Estate, some variability in Mortgage Banker Finance while we're growing all of our other businesses.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the middle market side, I mean, I know that can really move the needle for you guys, and you indicated that loan growth there has been still somewhat sluggish as some of your borrowers are reluctant. Are you looking at opportunities to get more price-competitive there to really drive growth since you command such a big presence in that space?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. No, we are not focused on being more competitive. I think we're fair today in our pricing. One of the things that we're very focused on is continuing to leverage our relationship banking model. I view us as a premium service provider. We're big enough. We have the products, the expertise, the experience of the bankers that we can go in and really compete well in all of our markets in that general middle market space. But frankly, I think we also have the advantages of being nimble enough at our size, local decision-making through the way that we're organized to be more responsive, reliable and flexible. So while I know pricing is very important, to me, that is just one piece of our strategy. It's an important piece, but what we're very really focused on spending more time in the markets developing relationships with customers. To your point about middle market, maybe not having the general middle market, some of the growth in there, you have to keep in mind that there's a lot of manufacturing in there. A lot of those companies have de-levered. But we've seen a nice pickup in commitment levels there, as I mentioned earlier, and we saw increases in general middle market commitments in California, Michigan and in Texas, and I think that bodes well for us.","Ralph W. Babb","The thing I would add to that, too, is I think today, relationships mean more than they did at the height of the economy because of an institution that has been there for our customers through the downturn.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Mazur with Harvest Capital.","Daniel W. Mazur - Harvest Capital Strategies LLC","Just a few quick ones on excess liquidity in securities portfolio. I think the average deposits at the fed was over $4 billion in the quarter, so I think that was up around 20% quarter-over-quarter and I think that represents about 7% of earning assets now, and I think that\u2019s probably earning about 25 basis points. So I think that's one of the higher percentages of the banks that I've looked at, and it's a pretty large drag on NIM. And so I just wanted to, on the context of your liquidity position, which I think looks pretty solid and I think that would express next year should drive some incremental deposit growth, so number one question in that context, can you explain the targeting of fixed size for the securities portfolio that you kind of target in that $9 billion to $10 billion range? And number two, with Q3 driving mortgage securities basically, arguably artificially low, are there other securities or other asset classes you may consider investing in, in that portfolio?","Karen L. Parkhill","This is something that we manage fluently -- fluidly Dan. What I would say on the excess liquidity is yes, it did reach over $4 billion at one point, but today, it's around $3 billion due to some of the purchases that we've made as well as loan growth. It is something, as I've said, that we manage looking forward with where we think deposits will go, where we think loan balances will go. We do want to make sure that we are well positioned for loan growth. As we think about potential other asset classes, we have -- we continually look at potential other asset classes, but they have to fit our strategy of highly-liquid, highly-rated portfolio. And the reality is within our strategy, there aren't a lot of other options than mortgage-backed securities. You've seen us -- as we purchased mortgage-backed securities this past quarter, we have purchased more CMOs than 15-year pass-throughs because CMOs are giving us a little bit better yield today with that short duration that we're looking for. I don't know if I can answer your question any more, Dan.","Daniel W. Mazur - Harvest Capital Strategies LLC","No. This is all we've got. So it's something you -- so have you changed the $9 billion to $10 billion -- the $9 billion target? Has that now risen given the yields have declined?","Karen L. Parkhill","We like our securities portfolio where it is today when we think of forward-looking. That $9 billion target that we've talked about in the past is something that we said we will continually manage, and you've seen us do that this quarter. It's hard to predict where the target will be going forward because, again, this is something fluid and something that we manage based on the deposit growth, based on loan growth, et cetera. But we are very comfortable with where our portfolio is today given all the parameters that I've talked about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Harbes with Wells Fargo.","Jason Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So a question on the efficiency ratio. I know longer term, you guys are targeting to get that down below 60%, but it ticked a bit higher this quarter. I mean, is it fair to assume that you're really going to need some help on the rates to get there? Or are there other avenues that you're considering to drive that lower over time?","Ralph W. Babb","Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, we have set an efficiency ratio target to take our ratio below 60% over time. If you look at us from a year-to-date perspective, we have moved that ratio in the right direction, where we ended 2011 at 72% and year-to-date, we are at 70%. So our focus is to continue to move it in the right direction by controlling what we can control and growing revenues faster than we're growing expenses. As we've said in the past, in order to meet our target, we will need a little bit of a rate environment pickup, but clearly, not rates back to normal to get there.","Jason Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then it looks like the tax rate was a little lower, at least, than we were looking for. I think in the past, you suggested a way to try to calculate that by netting out about, I think, $60 million or so of tax credits. Is that still a fair way to think about it, or would you provide any sort of updated guidance on the tax side?","Karen L. Parkhill","That is still a fair way to think about it. We did have the benefit this quarter in taxes of having a refund on interest paid to the IRS, and so that was helping us this quarter.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call over to Mr. Ralph Babb, the Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks.","Ralph W. Babb","I would just like to thank everybody for taking the time this morning to be on the call and your interest in Comerica, and I hope everybody has a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Persons, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. Good morning and welcome to Comerica's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Vice Chairman of the Business Bank, Lars Anderson; Vice Chairman of the Retail Bank and Wealth Management, Curt Farmer; and Chief Credit Officer, John Killian.","A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC's website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. As we review our third quarter results, we will be referring to the slides which provide additional details on our earnings.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause future results to vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statements contained in this release issued today, as well as Slide 2 of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our filings with the SEC. Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures and in that regard, I will re-direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph who will begin on Slide 3","Ralph Babb","Good morning. Today we reported third quarter 2014 net income of $154 million or $0.82 per share compared to $151 million or $0.80 per share in the second quarter and $147 million or $0.78 per share in the third quarter 2013. The third quarter reflected broad based average loan and deposit growth, solid credit quality and expenses that continued to be well controlled. The quarter also included a $32 million gain from the early redemption of debt as well as $15 million and charges related to efficiency incentives, initiatives and a contribution to our charitable foundation of $9 million all of which we consider to be non-core. All together, these actions provided an after tax benefit to our third quarter results of $5 million or $0.03 per share.","Turning to Slide 4 and highlights for the quarter, average total loans were up $3 billion or 7% on a year-over-year basis and were up $434 million or 1% compared to the second quarter. Loan growth was led by Mortgage Banker Finance which increased $276 million in line with the summer home selling season. Notable loan growth was also seen in technology and life sciences, energy and commercial real-estate. As expected, this was partly offset by $178 million decline in auto dealer floor plan loans as our customers worked down their inventory in preparation of receiving new models. And with reduced line utilization general middle market loans declined $142 million.","Overall the pace of loan growth declined relative to the second quarter due to the typical summer slowdown as well as moderating GDP growth. We believe our customers are becoming stronger and more confident, however they remain somewhat cautious and continued to build liquidity. We grew deposits in the third quarter in almost every business line with the bulk in non-interest bearing deposits.","Accounts; average total deposits increased $3.3 billion or 6% year-over-year to $55.2 billion. Relative to the second quarter, deposits grew $1.8 billion or 3% with almost half coming from general middle market. In further comparing our third quarter results to the second quarter, net interest income decreased $2 million to $414 million primarily due to the decline in accretion of $7 million as expected partially offset by the benefit from loan growth. Credit quality continued to be strong as the provision for credit losses and net charge-offs remain at low levels as we have seen for the last several quarters.","Non-interest income declined $5 million to $215 million driven by a $3 million decline in customer-driven fees primarily foreign exchange income and a $2 million decline in non customer income. Excluding the $8 million net benefit or $5 million after tax from the non-core actions we took in the third quarter that I mentioned earlier, non-interest expenses remained stable.","Finally, we continue to execute our capital plan. We repurchased 1.2 million shares in the third quarter under our share repurchase program. Combined with dividends we returned $95 million or 62% of third quarter net income to shareholders.","Turning to Slide 5 and a look at our three primary markets. Texas has been enjoying a remarkable period of economic expansion. The ensuing population growth has supported even more job growth in the construction trades and in the service sector. Our third quarter average loans in Texas were up 12% compared to a year ago and average deposits increased about 3%. California is showing above average economic growth as labor market conditions are improving quickly.","In August, California created more jobs than any other state coming in right ahead of Florida and Texas. Our California average loans have grown 11% over the past year and average deposit growth has also been strong posting a 12% increase. The Michigan economy is benefiting from strong auto sales and gains in other durable goods manufacturing. Overall our customer\u2019s financial performance has been strong and they continued to delever and build cash. This is reflected in the stable average loans and solid deposit growth.","Before turning it over to Karen, I wanted to mention a couple of other items. As you may know Comerica is the pre-card, prepaid card issuer for the U.S. Treasury Direct Express Program. The Treasury has recently selected us as the financial agent for the Direct Express Program for an additional five years. Separately, we recently announced that we entered into an agreement with Vantiv to provide payment processing solutions for our merchant services customers. Comerica\u2019s merchant services enable businesses to enjoy the convenience of accepting card payments with a focus on providing those businesses with the means to improve efficiency as well as adapt to the latest technology and payment solutions.","The Direct Express Program, our new merchant services platform as well as our trust alliance business, which we discussed at an investor conference in September, are all great examples of how we leverage partnerships to provide a wide array of growing products and services for our customers.","In closing, we are focused on the long term and building enduring relationships. We offer our customers a value proposition by providing them products and services that meet their needs which enables us to hold our pricing parameters while not varying from underwriting standards that have served us well through many cycles. We continue to face rising regulatory and technology demands as well the possibility of higher pension expense next year if long term rates remain at their current level.","We have taken some actions this quarter intended to assist us in partially mitigating these headwinds. We remain focused on controlling the things we can control and are well positioned to benefit as the economy improves and rates ultimately rise.","And now, I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6, quarter-over-quarter total average loans increased 1% or $434 million. Commercial loans were the major driver, increasing $298 million or 1%. Commitment growth of over $850 million outpaced loan growth, resulting in a decline in utilization rate to 48.3% down from 49.3% at the end of the second quarter. Importantly, our pipeline remained robust and increased during the quarter.","Similar to the commercial loan trend we\u2019ve seen in the H.8 data reported by the Fed, our pace of loan growth slowed in the third quarter relative to the first half of the year. As Ralph mentioned, we believe this is in line with the typical summer slowdown including seasonality and our national dealer business along with moderating GDP growth. While the pace slowed, the growth we had in the third quarter was broad based. The larger increases in average loans compared to the second quarter were noted in mortgage banker with $276 million, technology and life sciences $110 million, energy $95 million and commercial real estate $88 million.","Two businesses declined National Dealer Services by $178 million due to model year changeover and general Middle Market by $142 million due to lower line utilization with the summer slowdown.","Period-end loans declined $174 million to $47.7 billion, yet remained well above the third quarter average. This decline included decreases in National Dealer Services of $356 million and general middle market of $246 million for the same reasons I just described, as well as the decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance of $102 million reflecting the beginning of the decline of the summer peak. Increases in almost all other business lines partially offset the decline. Remember that our loans typically spike at quarter end, so the average for the quarter is a better indicator of trend.","Finally loan yields shown in the yellow diamond decreased 9 basis points in the quarter of which 6 basis points can be attributed to lower accretion and one basis points each attributed to lower interest collected on non-accrual loans and negative residual value adjustment to assets and our leasing portfolio, and a decline in loan yields resulting from loan portfolio dynamics such as a mix change in customer usage.","Turning to deposit on Slide 7, our total average deposit increased $1.8 billion or 3% to $55.2 billion, consisting of a 5% increase in non-interest bearing deposit and a 2% increase in interest bearing deposits. Almost every business line posted growth with the most significant increase in general middle market, which increased 6% and accounted for almost half of the increase in our total average deposit. We believe general middle markets increase in deposits and decrease in loans go hand-in-hand as customers increase their cash and have less need to borrow against their line.","Period-end deposits grew $3.4 billion to $57.6 billion and like our loans tend to spike at quarter end. Infact our deposits increased $1.5 billion in the last two weeks of the quarter. For that reason, remember that average balances are what drives our net interest income. Deposit pricing remains low at 15 basis points as shown by the yellow diamonds on the slide.","Slide 8 provides details on our securities portfolio, which primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities that averaged $9 billion for the quarter. The estimated duration of our portfolio still sits at four years, and the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it slightly to 4.7 years. The yield on the mortgage backed securities book declined 6 basis points as the second quarter included a $1 million retrospective adjustment to the premium amortization and there were no adjustment recorded in the third quarter.","Our goal is to reinvest prepaid at or above the current portfolio yield. However, the yields on the securities that are prepaying are typically above the average portfolio yield and therefore if rates remain at current levels, we anticipate continued slight pressure on the average yield.","Based on the current rate expectations, we believe that the pace of prepays will be about $350 million to $450 million in the fourth quarter, inline with what we have experienced the past couple of years. In light of the fact that Fannie and Freddie-backed securities are subject to a haircut and a cap under the liquidity coverage ratio or LCR, we continue to reinvest the prepays in Ginnie Mae securities.","As far as the LCR, the final rule was issued last month. Banks our size will now need to [phase] and compliance beginning in 2016 and will be subject to a monthly calculation. While we are still in the process of accessing the final rule and will continue to do so while we work to clarify the detail and analyze our customer data, we estimate as of quarter end our LCR ratio stand at about 80%. We continue to feel comfortable that we will meet the phase and threshold within the required timeframe, which is now 90% by January 2016. We will need to add high-quality liquid assets or HQLA over the next year to meet the 90% plus above or to withstand normal volatility. Exactly how much in liquid assets we add will depend on our loan and deposit growth over the next 15 months and the resulting change to our access deposits as I said which count as HQLA.","We had said before that adding securities should not have a significant impact to our earnings and the impact to rate sensitivity will depend on a fixed or floating nature of both the funding and the investment side. As we make decisions on fixed versus floating we will remain mindful of the current rate environment with a focus on not pre maturely altering our overall upside to rising rates.","Turning to Slide 9, net interest income decreased $2 million primarily due to a decline in accretion as expected of $7 million. Loan growth and one additional day in the quarter each added $4 million to net interest income. This was partially offset by a $2 million negative residual value adjustment to asset in our leasing portfolio. $2 million impact from portfolio dynamics such as the mix in customer usage as well as the $1 million decline in interest collected on non accrual loans. Other than these effects from the loan portfolio a decline in our debt interest cost, reflective of the net impact of recent maturities, redemptions and issuances provided a $2 million benefit, and interest earned on investment securities decreased $1 million as I discussed on the prior slide.","Finally the $1.1 billion increase in average deposits as I said added $1 million. The net interest margin decreased 11 basis point with the decline in accretion having a 5 basis point impact and the increase in liquidity as I said having a 4 basis point impact.","Loan portfolio dynamics and the lease residual value adjustments had a combined two basis point impact. Movements related to lower securities yield and interest on our wholesale debt netted to zero. Just to note, we expect accretion in the fourth quarter to be about $5 million for a total of approximately $30 million for the full year. There is only about $20 million in total accretion yet to be realized which we expect to recognize in small increments each quarter over the next couple of years. We believe our balance sheet remains well positioned for a rise in short term rates.","As of September 30, our standard asset liability case which calculates the dynamic balance sheet assuming historical relationship shows that a 200 basis points increase in rates over a one year period equivalent to 100 basis points on average would result in a benefit to net interest income of about $225 million.","Turning to Slide 9, net interest income increased $6 million and net interest margin increased 1 basis point. Strong loan growth added $12 million and one additional day in the quarter added $4 million. These positive effects were partially offset by a $3 million impact from lower loan yield due to the portfolio dynamics I discussed a moment ago, a decrease of $2 million in interest collected on our non accrual loans from an elevated first quarter amount and lower accretion of $2 million. And as discussed on the prior slide, interest earned on investment securities decreased $2 million. All of these decreases combined negatively impacted the margin by 5 basis points and were more than offset by a decline in excess liquidity, which added 6 basis points to the margin.","In past investor conferences, we have shared alternative assumptions to our standard case, including the pace of deposit, loan and rate changes and in all cases we remain well positioned for rising rates.","Turning to the credit picture on Slide 10, net charge-offs decreased to $3 million or 3 basis points of average loans and included $21 million in recoveries. Our criticized loans decreased and nonperforming loans and the allowance coverage ratio were both stable. Our allowance covers our trailing 12-month net charge-offs 16 times. Our solid credit metrics and strong recoveries combined with loan and commitment growth resulted in a decrease in the provision to $5 million and a small reserve build.","Slide 11 outlines non-interest income, which declined $5 million. Customer-driven fee income decreased $3 million, including a $3 million decrease in foreign exchange income from our high second quarter level and a $2 million decrease in investment banking fees. This was partially offset by a $3 million increase in commercial lending fees. Non-customer-driven income decreased $2 million.","Turning to Slide 12, non-interest expenses included a net benefit of $8 million from non core actions taken in the third quarter. Aside from these actions expenses were stable increasing just $1 million as the impact from one additional day of salaries expense and small increases in occupancy and several other categories were partially offset by lower litigation related expenses.","The non core net benefit of $8 million included the early redemption of debt, a contribution to our charitable foundation, as well as changes related to our continual drive for efficiency. As far as the debt, I mentioned last quarter that we had called $150 million in subordinated notes effective July 15th. These notes had a carrying value of $182 million which resulted in a $32 million gain in the third quarter.","We also made a $9 million contribution to Comerica\u2019s charitable foundation, which support non-profit organizations in the communities we serve. As you know we are continually focused on efficiency. We did take actions in the third quarter amounting to $15 million and non core charges on a number of small projects, intended to assist us and partially offsetting the headwinds we are facing for rising regulatory and technology demand in addition to the possibility of higher pension expense next year.","For example we continuously review our real estate requirements to ensure we are optimizing our square footage. As a result, we are consolidating space and taking a charge as we exit a handful of properties. We anticipate taking a further charge of approximately $5 million to $7 million in the fourth quarter primarily related to real estate optimization as we complete the remaining items identified.","While the implementation of the project is ongoing, we estimate that by the end of next year we should achieve run rate savings of about $12 to $14 million. Related to rising technology and regulatory demand, we will need to continue to invest in technology projects related to evolving cyber security and compliance including the liquidity coverage ratio and changes required by the card industry.","Related to pension expense there are several factors that determine our annual pension expense, such as the discount rate which is set at year end. If long term rates remain at the current level which is lower than where they were at year end 2013, the discount rate on liability could be lower driving an increase in our annual pension expense.","In our 10-K we disclosed that for every 25 basis point change in the discount rate the impact is about $8 million. In addition a new draft mortality table was released earlier this year and it is possible that the new mortality assumptions could also drive the extent higher.","Moving to Slide 13 and capital management, as Ralph mentioned, we repurchased 1.2 million shares this quarter under our share repurchase program. Combing shares repurchase with the dividends paid we returned 62% of net income to our shareholders in the third quarter and year-to-date we have returned 67% of earnings. Our capital position remains strong with a tangible common equity ratio of 9.9% and an estimated Basel III tier one common capital ratio of 10.4% at September 30th on a fully on a fully phased in basis excluding the impact of AOCI.","Turning to our final slide 14, our outlook for full year 2014 compared to full year 2013 has not changed from what we outlined on our call in July. We have however narrowed our year-over-year expectations for average loan growth to be about 5%. It was previously 4% to 6%. And we now expect accretion to be about $30 million at the upper end of the $25 million to $30 million we had provided.","Turning to our expectations for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter as outlined on the slide. We expect average loans to grow slightly, assuming continued moderate economic growth. We believe we will see a rebound in our floor plan loans as auto dealers receive their 2015 model inventory. And we expect mortgage banker outstandings to decline as home sales are typically lower in the fourth quarter.","For the rest of the loan portfolio we expect a small increase. Keep in mind that competition is stiff across all of our businesses and we fully intend to maintain our loan pricing and credit discipline. We expect our net interest income to grow slightly with a small increase in accretion to about $5 million from the $3 million in the third quarter. The positive effect from loan growth in our portfolio should approximately offset the continued pressure from the low rate environment.","With continued strong credit quality we expect net charge-off and provision to remain low, similar to what we saw in the first two quarters of the year. Overall we expect non-interest income to be relatively stable with customer driven income similar to the third quarter. While we expect these to be modestly higher in several areas we have seen lumpiness in certain categories such as indication fees which were elevated in the third quarter.","Non-customer-driven income contains items such as warrant income, preferred comp and securities gains and losses, all of which are difficult to predict but overall we expect them to decline. Non interest expenses are expected to be higher, remember that our third quarter included a net benefit of $8 million from non core items. And as I mentioned we expect additional non core charges in the fourth quarter of about $5 million to $7 million primarily focused on real estate optimization. Furthermore, we expect a modest increase in core expenses related to higher technology in consulting expenses as well as a seasonal increase in benefits expense.","In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter broad based average loan and deposit growth and strong credit quality. We continued to demonstrate our expense discipline and took actions in the third quarter intended to help offset some of the expense headwinds arising from increasing regulatory and technology demand. We will continue to focus on the things we can control, and we believe our relationship banking strategy combined with our geographic footprint will serve us well as the economy improves.","Now we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Terry McEvoy with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Terry.","Terry McEvoy - Sterne, Agee","Hi, good morning. I guess just start with a question for you, Ralph. As you look at the energy portfolio what\u2019s your outlook going forward, any concerns given the drop in prices? And then specifically the servicing piece of energy is that something that we need to focus on going forward?","Ralph Babb","Okay, John you want to answer that?","John Killian","Sure. Good morning, Terry. The short answer is no, we are not concerned at this time. We\u2019ve been in this business for 30 years so we have seen lots of ups and downs; in fact the price was in the low 80s in 2012, 2010 and 2009 as well. And we have about $3.4 billion in outstandings at the end of the quarter which is about 7% of the portfolio approximately 95% of our portfolio is secured. Most of our customers are well hedged on average 50% are hedged for two full years and many are for longer periods.","At current prices drilling activity probably will plateau, but production is going to be fine. So, overall I\u2019m very comfortable at this time. To address your services issues, that\u2019s about 17% of the total energy portfolio right now.","Terry McEvoy - Sterne, Agee","And then, what do you expect to spend this year -- question for Karen on technology and regulatory issues, just trying to establish your base and to build off next year. And then on the expenses, if things were to stand today at the end of the year what would the pension cost look like in 2015?","Karen Parkhill","Sure, I\u2019ll take those in pieces. In technology, we typically have an investment spend, an annual investment spend between $75 million and a $100 million and an annual expense between $30 million and $40 million. As I mentioned we do expect that spend and expense to increase because of the increase in technology demands related to the regulatory environment, related to card industry compliance and related to cyber security.","On regulatory issues and matters we have said before that year-to-date or in 2014 we have added about 85 people amounting to a little bit more than 25 million an annual run rate expense. Much of that or the vast majority of that already build into our run rate. And we do expect that to increase as we continue to have new regulatory requirement.","On the pension expense, that expense is set at the end of every year, based on key assumptions made particularly the discount rate on our liability. That rate is set based on our long term AA corporate bond index which matches the liability, matches the duration of our pension liability.","Last year that discount rate was 5.17% and we\u2019ll see what the discount rate is at the end of this year, but given the current rate environment if this sticks the pension expense related to the discount of the liability could increase. And if new mortality tables are introduced this year by the Society of Actuaries, our potential expense related to mortality assumptions could increase as well. Our pension expense this year is about $39 million. You may recall last year it\u2019s about $86 million.","Terry McEvoy - Sterne, Agee","Okay. Thank you, Karen.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Good morning everyone. Maybe for John Killian, I\u2019m curious at what price does oil need to fall for you to become concerned over the portfolio?","Ralph Babb","Okay. John.","John Killian","Sure, hi, Steve. You know it depends of course on every individual borrower\u2019s specific set of facts and their set of costs, but remembering that generally speaking we\u2019re pretty comfortable at the 80s as I mentioned earlier. If we go into the 70s activity will slow more. If we go into the 60s on oil, you\u2019ll see it slow a lot, and you\u2019ll probably see some credit issues begin to arise if we go in the 60s and stay there for a prolong period of time, because as I said a lot of our customers now are well hedged. That\u2019s completely different than prior ups and downs in the oil business. So that\u2019s going to give us some runway here to get through a temporary period of lower prices. But if it goes into the 60s and stays there for let\u2019s call it two or three years you\u2019ll begin to see some credit issues.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Karen \u2013 thanks John. And Karen for the pension expense given the discount rate that you just highlighted, why wouldn\u2019t this go back up to $86 million or higher based on \u2013 I assume that you\u2019re trying to telegraph that this expense is going up meaningfully in 2015?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. It could go up meaningfully in 2015, Steve. But again, the discount rate is set at the end of the year and we don\u2019t have a crystal ball on what long-term rates will be at the end of the year. So, and we don\u2019t know what the mortality tables that could be introduced between now and the end of the year would say, so, difficult for us to give you any specifics.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Right. Karen, do you a sense though let\u2019s just say rates stayed where they were today and the mortality tables didn\u2019t changed, where that level goes to next year?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. In our 10-K Steve we do disclose that for every 25 basis point change in the discount rate that would equate to about $8 million impact on the pension expense.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Okay. And then, maybe one final one regarding the guidance calling for the seasonal decline in mortgage warehouse following up that rates are lower, any signs of the pickup in mortgage warehouse given where rates have moved down to here in the quarter and maybe what was the mix in 3Q or purchase and refi? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Lars, you want to take that.","Lars Anderson","Yeah, absolutely, so looking at the third quarter, we did see the seasonal decline as Karen pointed out to you of $276 million increase over the prior quarter. But if you look at the period end we were down $102 million. One point I\u2019d like to make is that the decline in linked-quarter averages was down substantially less than we saw in the prior year, which I think positions us well on a go forward basis. To maybe to frame that a little bit for you, we actually increased our averages by 21% and that was against an industry. It had an increase of about 3% in mortgage volume.","But we would expect to see softness in the fourth quarter, exactly where that land is going to be very difficult to tell. But I think we have all heard with the U.S. Treasury, 10-year Treasury where it is, mortgage activity has picked up in the most recent few days I think across the industry.","I think we\u2019re very comfortable with our position in the industry. We continue to capture more and more customers with each quarter. We have very deep cross-sell within the highest treasury management cross-sell across the entire company and so we see this is a growth business working with some of the best mortgage companies in America.","Ralph Babb","Lars, how about the mix on current\u2026?","Lars Anderson","Thank you, Ralph. So the mix for us, as I mentioned in previous earnings conference calls, we have really taken an active position to pick up more of the purchase volume. We\u2019re up to 80%, the industry is at 58%. I think that that\u2019s part of what helped us in this last quarter linked-quarter as outperforming the industry.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Ken.","Joshua Cohen - Jefferies","Hey, this is actually Josh in for Ken.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Josh.","Joshua Cohen - Jefferies","Hey, good morning. So you noted the expenses this quarter were helped by a lower litigation. How should we think about the trends for this expense item going forward?","Ralph Babb","Karen.","Karen Parkhill","Yes. I would say our litigation related expenses compared to larger banks in the industry are low. They can be lumpy and are difficult to predict. But at this stage we feel very comfortable with the reserves that we\u2019ve got on our balance sheet.","Joshua Cohen - Jefferies","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then, to what extend do you expect the efficiency savings to offset the increases that you\u2019re expecting in compliance and technology?","Karen Parkhill","Yeah. We are right now in the details of working through our 2015 budgeting process. And as we typically do we\u2019ll give an outlook on 2015 in the fourth quarter earnings call in January. But we have said that we expect these run rate savings from the actions taken both this quarter and expected next quarter resulting in $12 million to $14 million run rate savings, are intended to help partially offset some of the rising demands and increases that we see.","Joshua Cohen - Jefferies","Okay. And then just one final question, FX volume was stronger generally across the industry and it declined a bit for you in the third quarter. Can you just provide color for that line item?","Ralph Babb","Lars.","Lars Anderson","Fixed volume -- you\u2019re talking about in the lending space.","Ralph Babb","FX.","Lars Anderson","I\u2019m Sorry, FX.","Ralph Babb","Foreign exchange.","Lars Anderson","Yeah, foreign exchange, we really had an anomalous quarter in the second quarter of this year. We had a several large transactions. So, I think we\u2019re back to really a normal run rate.","Joshua Cohen - Jefferies","Okay. Well, thanks for the color, guys.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Ken. How are you?","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Doing well. Thank you. Maybe little more specific question on expenses. Hope you can give us a magnitude here, because I guess in fourth quarter, we\u2019re going to add the $8 million plus the $5 million to $7 million, so it\u2019s roughly $14 million. When Karen mentioned the technology consulting benefits expense, are we talking about like another $14 million or what\u2019s kind of magnitude of that unknown piece?","Karen Parkhill","Yeah, of the rest of piece -- and you\u2019re right, Ken, you should add back the $8 million and then add back the additional $5 million to $7 million. And then top of that we expect a modest increased quarter-over-quarter related to as we said consulting, technology and a seasonal increase in healthcare benefit.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. So, maybe $5 million, $10 million is that modest in your view broadly?","Karen Parkhill","We don\u2019t give specific numbers.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Fine, okay. Then second I had just on slide seven, when you guys think about deposit run-off in a higher interest rate environment, you guys assume that sort of stable percentage of non-interest bearing deposits run-off, or does that percentage increased as deposits grow disproportionately to loan growth?","Karen Parkhill","In our standard interest rate scenario in the up 200 scenario, we do assume a modest decline in deposits and we do expect that over time as interest rates rise we\u2019ll continue to see a mix shift out of non-interest bearing into interest bearing. Is that your question?","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Well, I guess, let\u2019s take your $1.3 billion of non-interest bearing this quarter which phenomenal growth, do you just assume that you\u2019ll keep most of that, right, I mean, in the model that you use or do you assume that as we get further into the cycle as you just get a ton more of this non-interest bearing that it just increases the risk that a greater percentage actually starts to run-off in the different environment. I\u2019m just trying to think of how you\u2019re assessing that 200 basis point scenario?","Karen Parkhill","Yeah. Keep in mind that much of our non-interest bearing is related to commercial deposits and much of those commercial deposits are tied with an earnings credit rate to pay for operating services that our customers have with the bank. So they tend to be far more sticky than normal non-interest bearing deposits. And we do take that into account in our interest rate sensitivities that we expect some decline but we recognize that there is stickiness to those deposits.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. And then last question, are you replacing the debt that you redeemed this quarter with other long-term borrowings or changing your liability structure in anyway?","Karen Parkhill","Yeah. This year you\u2019ll note that we have \u2013 did have some debt maturities and we did issue $600 million in debt. We next year as we look forward to needing to add high quality liquid asset for the LCR ratio, we will need to be funding those and do expect to be in the debt market next year.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Great. All right. Thank you","Karen Parkhill","Yeah.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Lars Anderson","Hey, Ralph. If I could add maybe just one point to the question about the commercial DDA in particular that maybe helpful. As those continue to grow we\u2019re being very active in terms of bringing payments solutions, treasury management to these core relationships and encumbering these deposits.","And I think that that\u2019s one of the reasons that as Karen develops her forecast for the run-off, one of our obviously strategies is to ensure that we make those sticky as possible. And in addition, we are hearing from treasurers, CFOs of our customers that they are planning to run a higher liquidity levels than they did before the great recession. So I think that\u2019s speaks favorably to our liquidity position.","Ralph Babb","Good.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR","Yeah, good morning. I was hoping you could just touch on the build in the interest-bearing deposits held at banks, the liquidity buildup on the balance sheet. Is this in anticipation of investing some of that in high quality liquid assets or how should we think about that build?","Karen Parkhill","For us the high-quality liquid assets in the numerator of the LCR equation obviously do include the excess deposits at the Federal Reserve. And so, as we\u2019ve seen an increase in deposits this quarter that has increased the excess deposits that we have at the Federal Reserve and has \u2013 has helped in the LCR calculation. Does that answer your questions?","Bob Ramsey - FBR","I guess I\u2019m asking is the intent to keep it there as excess deposits and that is your high-quality liquid assets or would the thought be that you would invest that at some point in Ginnie Maes or something with a little bit more yield?","Karen Parkhill","Yeah. So, as we think about our liquidity position and how we should invest, but we do remain mindful of the current low interest rate environment. And the fact that locking in a lot more additional securities in this low rate environment is not that appealing, particularly when these securities will be mark-to-market and the numerator in the LCR equation is a mark-to-market numerator. So, we will be making decisions over the next year around the investment, but we will certainly keep the rate environment in mind.","Bob Ramsey - FBR","Okay. All right, that is helpful. And then, I think I get it, but I just wanted to touch on the purchase accounting accretion. Based on the $7 million decline you all describe this quarter, I think the total accretion was $3 million this quarter, is that a good number?","Karen Parkhill","That\u2019s correct. It was $3 million this quarter and we said that we expected to be about $5 million next quarter. At this stage, we believe the benefit from accretion will be small every quarter going forward because we only have about $20 million left in accretion to be realized.","Bob Ramsey - FBR","Okay. And then I guess after the fourth quarter that would be down to $15 and that is the expectation it just sort of diminishes from that $5 million level over time?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. It would diminish over time.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Yes. Good morning. If I could start with the other side of the efficient equation, Ralph you mentioned Direct Express payment processing and trust alliance in your prepared remarks, I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much in terms of revenue contribution incrementally those initiatives can add to 2015?","Ralph Babb","You know, I would like to ask Curt to talk about our alliance especially business, these are growing businesses some like of the alliance business we\u2019ve been in for a long time, and that\u2019s one that let me have Curt comment on that then I\u2019ll bounce back to the others.","Curtis Farmer","Erika, thank you for the questions, so on the alliance business is where we are providing third-party trust services to broker dealers and we\u2019ve got 13 relationships across the country with some of the larger broker dealers providing fiduciary services to the clients. It\u2019s been a growing business for us and we\u2019ve add an additional broker dealers to the network. In fact if you look at a year-over-year comparison third quarter 2014 and third quarter 2013 were up about $3 million in terms of revenue.","We\u2019ve got lots of opportunities to continue to cross-sell into these broker dealers and we also have some opportunities to add some additional broker dealers over the course in the next couple of years. So it\u2019s a nice sort of supplemental business for us, for our fiduciary business overall and sort of a distinguishing niche for us in the trust space.","Ralph Babb","Lars, you want to talk a little bit about merchant services, which has been a business again for us for a long time.","Lars Anderson","Yeah. And I think we\u2019re all are very excited about the new relationship with [Vantiv] is really positioning ourselves to as we mentioned earlier, expand the profit offering, the payment solutions, really have a cutting-edge technology payment platform available for customers. But I\u2019ll tell you in spite of that year to-date we\u2019re up 14% on a year-over-year basis. We\u2019re up 6% in just linked-quarter growth in merchant services.","Frankly I see this is one of our best opportunities for fee income growth on a percentage basis on a go forward basis. We\u2019re much better efficient today and we\u2019re seeing pipelines at levels that we have frankly never seen before in our company.","You also mentioned Direct Express. We\u2019re obviously excited about the fact that we were reselected to serve the U.S. Treasury as their financial agent and we\u2019re expecting that this problem will continue to grow. We have over 5 million cards outstanding and we continue to grow a very substantial deposit base over $800 million that continues to grow. You can see that in the \u2013 I think in slide number 24, the pricing deck -- that just continues to grow and we would expect that that trend would continue in the coming years.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Got it. Thank you. And my second question is, the regulatory and technology headwinds that you mentioned, I assumes that that\u2019s above and beyond, Karen, what you mentioned is your annual technology reinvest or investment spend? And I was wondering if you could help us get a little bit more color on what you\u2019re spending on in terms of the regulatory-related expense and the tech upgrade for next year? What that incremental expense spend would be related to those two issues? And how sticky is that in your deposit base as we think through what could carry over to 2016?","Karen Parkhill","Okay. So, on the regulatory and technology spend we do continue to invest in technology around cyber security, around our card industry compliance as you probably know in the credit space with PCI and EMV and things like that, it requires a technology investment. On the regulatory front we\u2019re continuing to invest in things, in trust testing, in the new liquidity coverage ratio, so hopefully that\u2019s gives some color.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Got it. And are you prepare to give us a sense in what the incremental dollar spend maybe for 2015 and how sticky that could be?","Karen Parkhill","Yeah. We are not prepare to give dollar amount, because we are working through our budgeting process right now and setting our priorities, but we will talk about it on the fourth quarter call.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Okay. And just last one for me. You have a significant amount of capital and your shareholders have been enjoying well about industry average in terms of your ability to return that back to them. If we\u2019re in scenario where we\u2019re lower for longer and that could induce some smaller banks to be more open to selling. I guess, would you be interested and maybe taking advantage of that opportunity given how much excess capital you have or would you rather be prepared for stronger balance sheet growth as the macro bounces back?","Ralph Babb","As we\u2019ve said before we\u2019re very comfortable with our footprint today and our geographic diversion \u2013 diversity which is one of the things that was a key strategy for us and especially when we add sterling into the Houston market here in Texas and California now has been filled out as well, through an acquisition about ten years ago. And we certainly have a good footprint in Michigan. We will look at opportunities as they come up. But the key is we now have that footprint that we can grow from an internal standpoint and it\u2019s not based on the need to have to do acquisitions. So it depends on what it is, where it is and the culture and fit into what our strategy is for internal growth.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Thank you. I appreciate the color.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning. My question is a follow-up on the previous questions on the energy price decline and their impact. Just hypothetically if oil prices were to stay in the low 80s, what would you expect the impact on just the general Texas economy to be, or if they were to drop down to the 60s?","Ralph Babb","Okay. John, you want to comment on that.","John Killian","Yeah. That\u2019s an excellent question, but it\u2019s also a very difficult one to estimate. When I look at the statistics about the Texas economy, the mining or energy business accounts for 10% to 12% of the Texas economy, so there would definitely, Jennifer, be an impact. How big it would be, would be tough to tell. The good news is given the economic expansion in Texas right now there\u2019s some leeway for things to slow down a little bit and still be in a growth environment.","Ralph Babb","Yeah, I would underline the diversity in the Texas market today versus what it has been a number of years ago. Energies are very important sector certainly in the contribution but as John mentioned it is a [lower] rate today of \u2013 what\u2019s the right word, fueling the economy, because of the diversity that\u2019s out there. So it won\u2019t have near the impact it did 20 years ago.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","Hi, good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","I guess on the kind of middle market trends you outlined, if I think through the cycle utilization rates are up. I think they bottomed to like 44 for you guys, but still haven\u2019t gotten back to the 50 to 55 where they were historically and we\u2019re pretty far into the recovery and yet the deposits just keep going up. So I know it\u2019s a qualitative question, but just when you talk to your customers and look at the data, how much of this feels like it is cyclically, there\u2019s these kind of two steps forward, one step back pattern to the economy and people get cautious versus how much of it do you think is secular i.e. your customers are just going to carry more liquidity and maybe use their lines less than they did 10 years ago?","Ralph Babb","I think is now as Lars comment on this too. I think its little bit of both. That people are being more conservative today as was mentioned earlier, but also as they look forward because of what we\u2019ve been through in the economic downturn I think customers will generally want stronger lines, larger lines and also more excess liquidity than they\u2019ve had in the past. To be prepared for it, Lars, do you agree with that?","Lars Anderson","No. I think Brian is right on the mark. I think its combination of two. But clearly the economy going sideways, the geopolitical environment, health issues, the healthcare cost are all contributing to equating a very cautious environment for our customers. But I do think that they\u2019re going to carry higher levels of liquidity on a go forward basis. I would point out that in middle market California we did see an increase in utilization rates this past quarter which I thought was a very good sign as the California market has been lagging in terms of the economy recovery until more recently and that is our largest loan portfolio.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","I guess another question on liquidity, more from your perspective, I guess reading to LCR documents you can see some of the penalties on commercial deposits have bigger outflows, the liquidity you have to hold against lines, I guess I\u2019m still struggle little bit with, you\u2019ve an 83% loan to deposit ratio, you have nearly $8 million of cash on the balance sheet and that kind of split out an 80% LCR ratio. When you go through the details of the calculation is it some pieces of the business that are getting disproportionate penalties or is this just the way the calculation if you kind of bread and butter middle market commercial bank, you need to have cash at 10% of balance sheet and you need to have a loan to deposit ratio on the 80s?","Karen Parkhill","Brian, you\u2019re absolutely right that the LCR ratio does treat commercial-oriented banks a little more punitively than retail-oriented banks, because the outflow required in the calculation on commercial deposits is much greater than the outflow on retail deposits. And in addition it does assume that several commercial facilities are drawn and so it just is a little bit more punitive to banks like us.","That said, with our LCR ratio currently estimated at about 80%. We feel very confident that we can easily comply starting in 2016 and it shouldn\u2019t have a significantly impact on us.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","Great. Thank you for taking my questions","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari - Evercore","Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Morning.","John Pancari - Evercore","Want to see if you can give us a little more color on your thoughts on the potential trend in the efficiency ratio through 2015? I mean, I am sorry to beat a dead horse here on expenses but just given all of the factors you have been citing, Karen, around the impacts to expenses here where you are spending, wanted to get a little bit of color on how we think about the efficiency ratio for the full year. Thanks.","Karen Parkhill","","Thank you, John. So as you know we have been focused on moving our efficiency ratio toward our target below 60% for the last several years. And over the last several years we have successfully been able to offset the headwinds that we have been facing from the low rate environment, from the decline in accretion and from increased regulatory expenses to be able to move that efficiency ratio down. We are not ready to give our outlook for 2015 mainly because we are still working through the detailed process, but we are being in honest in saying that we do have significant headwinds next year that we are facing and we are taking action this quarter to help partially offset it.","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay. All right. And then separately around loan pricing I wanted to see if you can give us a little more color on what you are seeing in terms of loan pricing competition. And if you could, if you could provide us with some details on new money loan yields by type, particularly C&I versus CRE, and maybe the energy portfolio as well? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Lars.","Lars Anderson","","Okay, so first of all just in general, I\u2019d say we are just continuing to see competitive environment out there across all of our lines of business. I\u2019d characterize California geographically is the most competitive market in our footprint. You know I should point out that if you look at the core yield on a line quarter basis, the yield was down one basis point on an overall basis which I thought was a real positive for us in terms of our you know the evidence of our discipline relationship pricing approach to the market, and also, the mix of our business. We are putting the resources in the right businesses and in the right markets where we can get the right kinds of growth.","In particular, you mentioned you know maybe some of the businesses specifically like energy business. We are seeing more competitors jump into the market place, both bank and non-bank and that\u2019s not putting just pricing pressure, I think in the segment it\u2019s also stretching credit structure. So we are sticking to our strategy and we are not stretching on either one of them, we\u2019ve being very selective in that, but it is a competitive market place out there.","But areas like technology and life sciences mortgage banking finance, commercial real estate those were all areas that we continue I think garner nice attractive yields and we deliver a great value proposition. We were really pleased to see small business begin to turn and begin to make contributions and that will certainly help us in our loan yields on a go-forward basis. So we are going to manage this very carefully. We got to manage it day to day, it\u2019s a very challenging environment but I think we are well suited to operate in this environment.","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay. Thank you.","Lars Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","","Your final question will come from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Morning.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","","Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. My first one was in terms of the recoveries that you had in your commercial mortgage portfolio in the quarter, they seem to be a little outsized at $12 million compared to what you had over the last few quarters. So if you could give us some perspective or insights into what led to the higher recovery that would be helpful?","Ralph Babb","Okay, John.","John Killian","","Yeah, thanks Sameer. Actually if you look at our recoveries over the last four or five quarters, they have been pretty consistent in that 18, 19, 21 range. So this quarter was frankly higher than we expected but not out of line with current trends. Sometimes it will fluctuate between C&I and CRE and this was a quarter where it did turn towards CRE. In particular, we had one large credit that was refinanced which resulted in bit of an outsized recovery for CRE. But the overall trends have been pretty consistent at a higher level than we would have expected at this point.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","","Okay. And then just switching gears in terms of your national dealer services business, I think in your prepared comments you referenced the fact that the sequential decline in balances both on an average and in the period basis were partly the result of seasonality. But given where we are at in the kind of auto lending cycle, you know I am curious as to what you are seeing in your discussions with dealers as far as their appetite for building inventories going into next year or are they being cautious?","There's been talk about auto lending bubbles, an oversupply of vehicles, some people seem to suggest, so is it your view, or when you talk to them what are they saying to you? Do they intend to keep inventory levels low going forward, or is this really this seasonality playing out?","Ralph Babb","Lars.","Lars Anderson","","Yeah, so frankly the point about keeping inventories low, we have heard that for years in the industry but as we are attempting to make sure that you got all of the new models on your lot and we continue to see that I would tell you that from a floor plan utilization perspective, we saw a 10% decline in the quarter to end the quarter. So our dealers, our customers are clearly operating consistent with the way that they have in prior quarters, they are drawing down, they have gone through the heavy sale season of the summer. They are drawing down their inventories; they are seeing a higher inventory turnover and the $17.5 million annualized sales unit is helping to contribute to that. So we would expect to see that new model builds which typically begin in November will help us grow our balances as we head towards the end of the quarter. But I don\u2019t see any real change in terms of the overall industry and in fact I see the confidence levels of the owners at maybe the highest levels that I\u2019ve ever seen, they are making a lot of money and generating a lot of liquidity.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","","So the corollary to that then we should assume that you haven't changed any of your lending parameters for floor plan ending either. In terms of LTVs or any other parameters you don't feel that you need to be more conservative there just because it seems like the environment still appears quite bullish from the standpoint of the dealers.","Lars Anderson","Yeah I that\u2019s right. We really haven\u2019t changed anything. I would tell you we are being more vigilant, more just about the regulatory environment but our customers are too and we deal with mega dealers that typically have you know robust compliance, consumer finance departments they are really staying on top of CFPB issues and are preparing themselves for the future, but we have not changed our strategy at all.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Lars Anderson","","Thank you.","Operator","","I would now turn the call over to Mr. Ralph Babb, Chairman and CEO for any closing remarks.","Ralph Babb","I would just like to thank everybody for their interest in Comerica and being on the call today.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. Good morning and welcome to Comerica's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our President and CEO, Curt Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, Muneera Carr; and Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile.","During this presentation, we will be referring to slides which provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC's website as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website comerica.com.","This conference call contains forward-looking statements and in that regard you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to materially vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement in today's release and Slide 2 which I incorporate into this call as well as our SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ.","Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures and in that regard I direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within the presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Curt who will begin on Slide 3.","Curtis Farmer","Good morning everyone. After the last earnings call, I was then CEO and Ralph Babb assumed the position of Executive Chairman. Since becoming CEO in 2002, Ralph has created a tremendous legacy at Comerica. He managed the company through an incredible amount of economic change and disruption in the industry that has positioned us well for the future. I will continue to work closely with Ralph as I transition into my new role.","Turning to Slide 3. Today, we reported second quarter earnings of $298 million or $1.94 per share. This resulted in an ROE of over 16% and an ROA of almost 1.7% for the quarter. Our loan growth is strong, reaching a record level and outpacing the industry H.8 data for the second consecutive quarter. Also, total commitments grew over $300 million and line utilization increased about 40 basis points to 53%.","Our pipeline remains solid, particularly in light of the loan growth we grow in the last two quarters. Overall, our customers are performing well and we\u2019re positioned to continue to support their growing working capital, CapEx or acquisition financing requirements. Fee income also increased in the quarter, including growth in fiduciary and card categories. Continued careful cost management resulted in a $9 million reduction in expenses. Altogether, this drove a $10 million increase in pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue, excluding the $8 million securities loss incurred in the first quarter.","The credit provision increased primarily due to loan growth as well as valuation impairments on select energy credits. Credit quality remains solid with net charge-offs of 26 basis points and nonperforming assets remain low at 45 basis points of total loans. We continue to return excess capital through our share buyback program, repurchasing 5.7 million shares. Combined with dividend, we returned $525 million to shareholders.","Relative to the second quarter of last year, our results reflect our ability to generate solid loans and fee income growth, while also reducing expenses as a result of the successful execution of our GEAR Up initiatives. Last year very strong credit quality, including net recoveries resulted in a reserve release and a negative provision. While this quarter our provisioning was more in line with our historical norm. Through active capital management, we\u2019ve reduced our share count by 12%. Altogether, our earnings per share increased 4% year-over-year.","And now I will turn the call over to Muneera, who will go through the quarter in more detail.","Muneera Carr","Thanks, Curt. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4. Second quarter average loans increased $1.3 billion or 3% compared to the first quarter. Mortgage banker increased over $700 million, reflecting a combination of seasonality and strong refi volume. We also drove an increase of over 2% in general middle market loans with growth across all three of our primary geographies. Loans to commercial real estate developers, primarily in Texas, also increased.","Growth in energy balances was primarily a result of higher line utilization by existing customers due in part to softer capital markets. Total period end loans increased $1.5 billion led by mortgage banker, general middle market, and equity fund services. Our loan yields decreased 7 basis points. This was a result of lower LIBOR combined with a residual value adjustment of two leases, a minor impact from hedging and a mix shift in the portfolio.","Slide 5 provides details on the progress. Average core balances were stable, which is in line with our normal seasonal pattern. Coincident with loan growth, noninterest bearing deposits have declined as customers are funding growth, acquisitions and capital expenditures from their cash balances. As expected, we also saw a mix shift into interest-bearing deposits. In addition, we added broker deposits which provide low cost flexible funding for our loan growth. Our deposit mix remain very favorable with noninterest bearing deposits comprising nearly 50% of the total.","In line with the guidance we provided, deposit costs were 94 basis points and reflected the standard pricing adjustments we made in March. We remain focused on our relationship approach to manage deposit pricing. For the second half of the year, deposit costs are expected to move up or down a few basis points, depending on mix shift, on funding requirement, short-term rate and the company landscape.","As you can see on Slide 6, the yield on the securities portfolio continued to trend up. While yields on MBS securities has been under pressure, we were able to make purchases at incrementally higher yields than the securities that have paid down. This benefit combined with the repositioning we completed at the end of the first quarter, contributed $10 million of net interest income.","The current rate environment has not had a significant impact on our duration or the relatively small unamortized premium of the portfolio. Assuming a flat rate environment, we expect securities yield to remain at the current level for the remainder of the year.","Turning to Slide 7. Noninterest income decreased $3 million and the net interest margin declined 12 basis points to 3.67%. Our loan portfolio added $14 million, specifically loan growth and one additional day in the quarter contributed $22 million. This was partly offset by lower loan yields, which I already discussed. Altogether, the loan portfolio had a 2 basis points negative impact to the margin. Higher yields on the securities book added $3 million and 1 basis points to the margin.","Deposit costs were higher with the increase in interest bearing deposits as well as higher pay rates, which combined has an impact of $15 million or 9 basis points. Higher wholesale funding needed to support loan growth and our share buyback program had a $5 million or 2 basis point impact to the margin.","In summary, the benefit from strong loan growth and one additional day in the quarter was more than offset by the net impact from rates combined with higher funding needs. Credit quality remained solid as shown on Slide 8. Our net charge-offs was $32 million or 26 basis points, which is at the lower end of our historical norm of 20 to 40 basis points. Excluding energy, net charge-offs for the remainder of the portfolio were only 6 basis points.","While total charge-offs were higher than recent quarters, we do not see this as a trend as the increase was due to the impairment of select energy loans, specifically the valuation on a few liquidating energy assets were impacted by volatile oil and gas prices and weak capital market. We have substantially completed our semi-annual redetermination process and believe our reserves are appropriate.","Total nonaccrual loans remained low at $224 million or 43 basis points of our total loans. Excluding a $51 million increase from energy, nonaccrual loans declined. There was a small increase in total criticized loans which represented less than 4% of total loans as of quarter end. Energy criticized loans declined $30 million. A combination of loan growth and the additional reserves for the energy loans I discussed, resulted in an $11 million increase in the reserve and a ratio of 1.27%.We expect that the provision for the remainder of the year will be approximately $25 million to $35 million per quarter.","Turning to noninterest income on Slide 9. Recall in the first quarter, we incurred an $8 million loss from the repositioning of the securities portfolio. Excluding this loss, noninterest income increased $4 million. Fiduciary income increased $3 million mainly due to annual tax service fees and higher market volumes. Our continued focus on growing card fees resulted in an $2 million increase. We also had a $2 million increase in bank owned life insurance and small increases in several other categories, including letters of credit.","Deferred comp asset returns, which were offset in noninterest expenses were less than $1 million, resulting in a $3 million decline from the first quarter. Expenses remain well controlled and our efficiency ratio dropped below 50% as shown in Slide 10. Salaries and benefits decreased $20 million following annual share-based compensation and higher payroll taxes in the first quarter as well as the decrease in the deferred comps that I mentioned. This was partly offset by annual merit raises and one additional day.","Advertising expenses increased $4 million from a seasonal low first quarter. Legal costs increased following a recovery in the first quarter of legal expenses previously incurred. Also, outside processing increased $2 million and was mostly tied to technology initiatives and revenue-generating activity.","Turning to Slide 11. In the second quarter, we repurchased 5.7 million shares under our share repurchase program which is nearly 4% of our total shares. On a year-over-year basis, our share count is down 12%. Together with dividends, we returned $525 million to shareholders in the second quarter. Our goal is to provide an attractive return for our shareholders by way of the buyback as well as a healthy dividend which currently have a yield of over 3.7%.","Turning to Slide 12 and the rate environment. While recent economic data has been mixed, the markets are expecting the Fed to cut rates later this month. Our standard model indicates a 25 basis point rate reduction will have an estimated $60 million impact to net interest income over the 12-month period. The pace at which we\u2019re able to adjust deposit pricing will depend on competition and our need for funding. Therefore, we\u2019ve provided a couple of scenarios with different deposit betas. Of course, the ultimate outcome for a net interest income depends on a variety of factors such as: the pace at which LIBOR moves, loan growth and balance sheet movement, as well as any interest rate hedges that we may add.","In March, we began hedging program. Over a 2.5 month period, we added $2.8 billion in interest rate swaps with an average tenor of 3.3 years and an average fixed rate of 223 basis points. Current rates for hedges and the corresponding downside protection provided are not attractive, therefore we have paused the program. Our strategy is to make steady progress in building our hedging program over time.","Turning to our outlook on Slide 13, which assumes a continuation of the current economic environment and interest rate as of June 30. Given the strong loan performance so far this year, we adjusted our expectation and now expect to drive 3% to 4% growth in full-year average loan relative to 2018. Recall, that seasonal factors can impact loan in the back half of the year. This includes declines in mortgage banker as the summer home buying season ends as well as dealer due to model year changeover. Also, middle-market typically experienced with a summer slowdown.","We expect average deposits to be stable for the remainder of the year, resulting in a decline of about 2% on a full year-over-year basis. Based on LIBOR as of June 30 and the higher funding costs, we now expect our 2019 net interest income to increase about 2% over 2018. The full-year benefit from our solid loan growth is expected to be partially offset by higher debt to help fund our share repurchase program and loan growth as well as the deposit mix shift and lower nonaccrual interest recoveries.","We have updated our forecast for the provision to be between 15 to 20 basis points for the full-year. We believe our overall portfolio will continue to perform well and we are adequately reserved for the issues that surfaced in the Energy book in the second quarter. There is no change in our outlook to noninterest income.","On a full-year basis, we continue to expect our expenses to remain stable excluding the restructuring charges we incurred last year. As far as the remainder of the year, we expect to see higher technology cost, primarily related to investments in our retail bank and higher outside processing expenses tied to revenue-generating activities as well as the impact from additional days.","In addition, we recently launched an advertising campaign related to brand awareness, which will be ramping up through the end of the year. Finally, with the possibility that the pickup in loan growth may be sustained, we are targeting a CET1 ratio of about 10% by the end of 2019. As we determine the pace of our share buyback, we will carefully consider our expected earnings generation, capital needs to fund loan growth and market condition.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt to provide some closing remarks.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you, Muneera. We believe this outlook which includes loan and fee income growth as well as prudent expense control from capital management will drive superior returns. Over the past few years, we are focused on transforming ourselves to be more efficient and drive revenue growth. We\u2019ve also maintained our underwriting discipline and reduced our excess capital. These actions have produced strong results, including and ROE of over 16% and better positioned us to weather changes in the economy or interest rate environment.","Next month our company will celebrate its 170th anniversary. Over our history, we\u2019ve managed through many different economic, credit and interest rate cycles. As I\u2019ve met with customers and colleagues across our geography over the past month or so, the tone is optimistic and sentiment remains relatively positive. Yet the economic backdrop remains uncertain and the market is currently pricing in rate curves.","As Muneera laid out, the impact from a possible reduction and short-term rates is manageable. And with our efficiency ratio in the low 50s, we remain focused on controlling the things we can control and maintaining strong performance metrics. While maintaining our expense discipline, we continue to invest in our future. For example, through our TechVision 2020 program, we've adapted our systems and IT talents for faster development and deployment of products and services for both colleagues and customers. In addition, this program is producing savings that can be reinvested.","In closing, we believe our key strengths will continue to produce superior returns. Our geographic footprint combined with our relationship banking strategy provides the foundation for our steadfast goal of driving profitable growth and enhancing long-term shareholder value.","Now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brett Rabatin","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Curtis Farmer","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Rabatin","Wanted to start off on the margin, and the pressure in 2Q was mostly a function on the funding side. And given the guidance for 2% NII growth for the year, sort of implies a 3.55 average for the margin in the back half if I\u2019m looking at the balances, right? Can you talk about your expectations for the margin in the back half of the year? And then just thinking about in the period DDA, which was better than the average for the quarter. Can you take any solace on that and expect maybe less pressure on funding costs, maybe just a little bit more color on how you\u2019re thinking about the margin?","Muneera Carr","Okay.","Curtis Farmer","Brett, let Muneera handle that.","Muneera Carr","Thank you. All right. Brett, so to give you a little bit more color on the back half for the margin, I will start by saying that our margin number of 3.67% is a pretty strong starting place for us. The biggest impact that I see to margin, clearly those come from rates. I mean, we are asset sensitive. And so we\u2019ve provided you a variety of scenarios on Slide 12 as to what a possible rate cut could mean to us. Be it across the spectrum, you can look at the 10% data, which is essentially a repricing of our market index deposits to a 25% data, which is essentially what will happen if there's some lag in deposit pricing as a result of the competitive environment as well as us continuing to use a relationship-based approach from a pricing standpoint to a 50% data, which essentially reflects our standard pricing adjustments that we will continue to make to the deposit base. So you can prorate those impacts that we provided. I think the move across the spectrum on that front, but beyond that just for the third quarter LIBOR has continued to decline through the month of July. We have a Slide on 15 -- Slide 15 shows our loan composition, about 75% of our loans are tied to LIBOR, so a 10 basis points decline essentially means loan yields will be coming down about 7.5 basis points and you can probably compute that adjustment as well. Our shift to funding since that was part of your focus, from our funding standpoint, when I think about current company liquidity, we had a debt maturity in May. We were looking to replenish that in the back half, but you can also see that we\u2019re closer to our target. And so I think that overall from a funding standpoint, I think that the impacts will be nominal in the back half. We will continue to use our funding from diverse sources, broker deposits, FHLB, to some extent the capital markets have continued to be efficient with our funding base. Hopefully that gives you some color.","Brett Rabatin","That\u2019s helpful, Muneera. The other thing I want to ask about was just energy. And we\u2019ve seen some stress in the energy space, even though oil prices aren't that bad. Can you talk about -- give us a little flavor for what\u2019s going on in the energy book and those credits that you\u2019ve saw to stress in, were they gas related? Which fields were they? Can you give us a little more color on those credits as well?","Curtis Farmer","Sure, Brett. First of all, our energy book remains in very good shape. We just got through our redetermination process and that went very well. We saw no meaningful migration in the portfolio at all. Borrowing bases were up modestly. Hedging was down just a tad. But overall, it was a good review. We feel very good about our book and where its situated right now. The issues in energy really had to do with about five credits, a couple of which were still leftovers from the downturn that we are going through a liquidation process. And what we\u2019ve found over the course of the quarter was a decreased appetite for energy assets are going through some kind of liquidation process, particularly ones that are damaged in some way. And that leads to description of these five credits. We felt the need to take some charges to move the book value on these assets down to where our new expectations are on the sale of those assets. And then we also increased our reserves to cover what we would consider it to be a reasonable worst-case scenario for the disposition of these five assets. So that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re seeing.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. Great. I appreciate all the color.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you, Brett.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Good morning.","Curtis Farmer","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Maybe a question for Muneera to start with. Just on Slide 13, you had the two issues I just want to try to reconcile. So the capital management your CET1 target of 10%, I believe you said you\u2019re -- that, that's the higher now than the 9.5% to 10% because of the potential for sustained faster loan growth. But at the same time the top bullet, the average loans is up 3% to 4%, they really reflect the very strong first half you had, but it implies a fairly weak seasonally lower second half loan growth. Can you just help reconcile that? Why are you holding more capital with the expectation that your loans are going to -- loan growth is going to slow in second half? Thanks.","Curtis Farmer","Muneera?","Muneera Carr","Good morning, Ken. So we are taking a longer-term view than just the back half. And if you look at the second quarter, you can see that the great loan growth that we had consumed about 25 basis points of capital. That just goes to show you how quickly capital can be impacted as a result of growth. And loan growth is the best use that we can put our capital too. So when we think about it that way, that\u2019s one of our consideration. And then, second, capital ratios are calculated at a single point in time in the quarter. It's usually done in the last day. And we typically do see a pretty ramp up in our loans as we are approaching quarter end and that just becomes yet another consideration for us as we triangulate how we approach the target and how we want to think about it.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. So if loan growth is little bit stronger than expected, is that -- sorry, if loan growth is weaker than expected, is it possible that you could accelerate buybacks versus what you\u2019re currently expecting?","Muneera Carr","I think you will see us continuing to manage around that 10% target that we\u2019ve mentioned. What I will share with you is, we continue to produce a strong bottom line number. And so as you think about going forward, some of those earnings will go to pay dividend, some of those earnings will go to help us capital accretion if necessary. But we do plan to plan to continue to return the rest to our shareholders and you will find that our payout will continue to be strong.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, got it. And then just one other question. In terms of the provision guidance, the 15 to 20 basis points, or actually specifically the $25 million to $35 million per quarter, it seems like that kind of implies a little bit higher provision than what your prior guidance was. I understand there's no issues in the energy beyond what you\u2019ve already taken, but are you trying to imply that maybe we're back to sort of more normal provision numbers or more normal charge-off rates versus kind of where we\u2019ve been at a very favorable period, or are you seeing any kind of deterioration that would suggest the higher provision as warranted?","Curtis Farmer","Pete?","Peter Guilfoile","Yes. So, Ken, the revision in our guidance is completely a function of second quarter results. And so we are not changing our outlook at all for the second half. That $25 million to $35 million per quarter would be more in line with normal. We\u2019ve been doing better than that over the last couple of years and we'd hope we could still beat that. We are not seeing any need to build reserves from here. We feel really good about our reserves and we feel really good about the loan portfolio, ex energy. As Muneera mentioned, net charge-offs of only 6 basis points. So don\u2019t see a lot of need to build reserves and this is -- this kind of reflects closer to what we will consider normal.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. Thank you very much.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you, Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Curtis Farmer","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Back to the outlook slide, just wanted to confirm, I know you say you\u2019re assuming the continuation of the current economic and rate environment. Does that mean that you're assuming no change in rates, or does that mean you\u2019re assuming the forward curve, which implies cuts?","Curtis Farmer","Muneera?","Muneera Carr","John, we are assuming rates as of 6.30, so LIBOR as an example on 6.40 was 2.40, we are not baking in the forward rate curve. This is consistent with what we did when rates were rising. It is our opinion that we should give you our outlook based on where things stand at quarter end and people can have differing opinions on whether or not rate cuts will come to pass or how many will come to pass. So we\u2019re separately giving you that impact on Slide 12. And you can make whatever adjustments you deem best to get to your expectation.","John Pancari","Okay. So based on that, if -- and I see that you gave the NII impact on those scenarios, so that\u2019s fine in terms of the margin in NII. Now if we do get cuts, how does that change your expense expectation? I know there's not always a clear tie-in to expenses when there is rate changes, but given that environment and given your asset sensitivity, how does that change how you\u2019re thinking about your expense growth outlook?","Curtis Farmer","John, this is Curt. I will make a couple of comments there. We\u2019ve done a lot of work out of the GEAR Up initiative around both improving our overall efficiency and expense base, but also helping us on the revenue capacity side as well. So we think we\u2019re well positioned coming out that worked in the last few years to be able to maintain attractive efficiency and return. Our performance metrics even in a declining rate environment. Having said that, we are always looking at in our DNA, in our culture expense opportunities and really thinking about how we continue to leverage technology more efficiently and adopt things like AI, artificial intelligence technology in many of our noncustomer facing areas. And thinking about things like real estate etcetera, so we\u2019re always thinking about ways that we can operate more efficiently from an expense standpoint. And if we retain or remained in a low interest rate environment over a longer period of time, then those are things we would lean into. I would also say though that just from the overall perspective, we\u2019re very focused on the top line loan growth and fee income growth. We do continue to have a very favorable funding platform and so as rates come down we'd at some point have the opportunity to reduce pricing on the funding side. And then lastly, I will just say that we have managed through lots of interest rate cycles over time in our 170 year history and we continue to take the long-term view. What we\u2019re not going to do is change our long-term strategy. We are not going to sacrifice pricing or structure or anything on the credit side or sacrifice our relationship focus. And so those are the things that we can control that we remained focused on.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Curtis Farmer","Hi, Steven.","Steven Alexopoulos","To follow-up on John's question, so if I look at Slide 12 and the scenarios you\u2019re providing, let's suppose that the 10% deposit beta scenario plays out and NII is worse than expected. What I think a lot of us are struggling with is, okay you had GEAR Up, is there any room left to cut expenses? Is there an appetite? Curt is the new CEO to cut expenses. Could earnings growth go negative? I think we're trying to piece these together to see your appetite to offset will looks like it's coming in the back half of the year.","Curtis Farmer","Steven, thank you for the question. And I would reemphasize a lot of things that we said previously. I do believe that the GEAR Up initiatives have positioned us better and the sensitivity and other analysis that we\u2019ve shown you is that we still can produce attractive efficiency ratios and return metrics even in a declining rate environment. And as I\u2019ve said earlier, we\u2019re willing to always look at expense initiatives, but not as sacrificing our long-term strategy and not to sacrifice revenue growth. And so we continue to think about other ways that we can be more efficient as an organization. I mentioned some of those to you previously. We are not announcing a big initiative or anything of that nature. This is more part of as we go. And some things we will be thinking about even if we were not in the declining rate environment.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. So it sounds like if the worst case scenario play out for NIM, we should brace for earnings to potentially decline, you\u2019re not willing to sacrifice the long-term just to cut into the company. That\u2019s what you\u2019re essentially saying, right?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, but I would also say to you that when you look at our full-year forecast, we are still calling for expenses to be flat year-over-year. And so we\u2019ve proven that we can drive growth in the balance sheet as we are showing with our loan growth and still maintain a flat expense environment. So those are obviously things that we would be focused on.","Steven Alexopoulos","Then separately for Muneera, if we look at the hedge program, it looks like you didn\u2019t add to it this quarter. Can you give us a sense of what the costs would be to reduce asset sensitivity at this stage?","Muneera Carr","Yes, that\u2019s fixed rate that we could lock in. Almost really doesn\u2019t matter whether it's 2, 3, 4 years out, it's all hovering around the 170 basis points range.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Muneera Carr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS.","Brocker Vandervliet","Hi. Good morning.","Curtis Farmer","Hello, Brock.","Brocker Vandervliet","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to add to that prior question in terms of the hedges that you have added the $2.8 billion, where do you see that by the end of the year and what\u2019s your target for hedging at this point?","Curtis Farmer","So what we\u2019ve said, Brock, and continues to be our strategy is, we view this as a long-term rebuilding of the hedging program. And if we could replay in the 2020 hindsight here, we'd have probably added more hedges in the latter half of last year. But at that point, there were still a forecast around potential rate increases, and so we were trying to protect the upside revenue of the company. And so as we go along here, we\u2019ve paused the program, but I would emphasize the word pause, it does not mean that we are softening at this point, but we need to be very firmly selective on a go-forward basis. And if there's an opportunity for us to continue to add hedges, we will do so. But over a longer period of time, you would expect us to build a larger hedging portfolio as we go through different interest rate changes over time. But right now, I do not foresee us adding hedges at this point. But again, it will depend on where we get from here and sort of in terms of the rate cycle.","Brocker Vandervliet","Okay. And I\u2019m just going back to slide 12. All eyes on this one slide. This is the first disclosure I\u2019ve seen where there is real scenario analysis is shown. Could you just kind of walk through the different betas in particular, and based on what you know of your deposit mix and how should we kind of think about those deposit betas?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, Muneera?","Muneera Carr","All right. Well, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, we are trying to be transparent on what a rate cut means to us. And I know that -- I expect that. Similar to what happened at the start of this rate cycle, where betas were a little bit slow as rates were moving up. That\u2019s similarly on -- if rates were to decline, you will essentially see a gradual progression in deposit betas and you will see us sort of move across the spectrum that we\u2019re reflecting on slide 12. And I tried to give a little bit of color. The 10% beta essentially reflects what we think would be more or less immediately pricing of our market index deposits that should come through fairly quickly. The 25% beta reflects a bit of a lag. We have to wait and see how the competitive environment is doing, make adjustments, use our relationship-based model to continue to make changes as we go down -- go through the cycle. And then the last that is what kind of pricing changes transpire. So I think that you will see as rates progress down that we will be moving along this path. I think we\u2019ve done a really good job of managing our loan and deposit pricing, and we\u2019ve been able to attract and retain customers, and you can expect the same if rates are to change.","Brocker Vandervliet","Okay. Thank you.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you, Brock.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Curtis Farmer","Hello, Peter.","Peter Winter","Good morning. I\u2019m just wondering, if I look at net interest income for 2020, just directionally, if we do get this three rate cuts, which is in the Fed fund futures, do you think you can grow net interest income in 2020?","Muneera Carr","We are asset sensitive and clearly rates do mean a lot to us. And as Curt said earlier, we will be focused on overall growing revenue, organically growing loans. We are in great markets. We have a lot of capacity, all of that will still continue. But no doubt, rates will carry the impact. What I will share with you, Peter, is even after three rate cuts and even after you consider the impact that\u2019s been laying out on slide 12, our margin will still be quite competitive in our peer group.","Peter Winter","Okay. And just if I look at expenses, in the second quarter, they came in lower than we\u2019re expecting and you maintain your expense guidance for the full-year, which would assume a pretty big jump up, I guess in expenses in the second half of the year. Is there any chance that maybe expenses -- expense growth could come in a little bit lower than guidance?","Curtis Farmer","Peter, the reason that the expenses -- primarily the reason they were lower in the second quarter is, in the first quarter we\u2019ve our normal stock and compensation benefits that we provide our employees and so the associated taxes that go along with that. And so you normally see, seasonally the expenses in the second quarter decline. And so the forecast we gave for full-year expenses to be flat year-over-year, but second half some of the items that we mentioned to you would still be there. And obviously, if there are opportunities for us to spend lower than that, we would be focused on it, but we are trying to give you sort of the full-year guidance that we are expecting some higher outside processing, some technology-related costs, some of the advertising that\u2019s sort of seasonal, especially, rest from our sponsorships in the second half of the year.","Peter Winter","Okay. Thanks, Curt.","Curtis Farmer","Thanks, Peter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with B. Riley FBR .","Steve Moss","Good morning.","Curtis Farmer","Good morning.","Steve Moss","On the capital front, just with the kind of like a move up in the CET1 target here, is 10% kind of the floor for capital going forward? Just even if you had better loan growth, you could still manage to like a 9.5% target, given you\u2019re profitably with three rate cuts?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. Steve, what I would say to you is that we are guiding you to the 10% number. We\u2019ve not set any longer-term targets. It's something we will be working on over the course of the second half of the year. But as Muneera alluded to earlier, even without a revision to that target, we still believe that we can, in a meaningful way, continue to return capital through our shareholders, both in terms of dividend and buyback.","Steve Moss","Okay. And then second thing just on the deposit funding costs. Have you seen any decline in deposit costs so far in the past month or two?","Curtis Farmer","We are seeing some competitors starting to pull back a little bit on deposit costs and we always remain very, very focused on taking care of our clients as part of our relationship strategy. And so we do believe, at some point, if interest rates do come down and competitive landscape continues to evolve, that we'd have a chance to revise our deposit pricing. But we\u2019re going to be careful in how we do that and make sure we\u2019re taking care of our customers along the way.","Steve Moss","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Curtis Farmer","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Good morning. I just had one follow-up question on the capital side. I think what more surprised investors was lopping off sort of the lower end of the capital target for the year. And I\u2019m wondering, is the question that we should ask, do you have a different capital binding constraint in CET1? Is there more bindings \u2026?","Curtis Farmer","Well, I\u2019m not more [indiscernible] Muneera?","Muneera Carr","Sure. Erika, the binding constraint for us would be Tier 1 capital.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.","Gary Tenner","Thanks. Good morning.","Curtis Farmer","Yes, Gary.","Gary Tenner","Hey, just wanted to ask the really positive trends on the general middle-market lending this quarter. I think that's really been talked about too much. But after several quarters, I think, a pretty minimal growth. If you go back to second quarter last year, you had nice little spike this year over this quarter. So was it -- what\u2019s your sense of kind of the sustainability of growth in demand in that space? Is this the result of pent-up, kind of planning on your customers' part in terms of investment, or how do you -- what do you attribute that growth there?","Curtis Farmer","Gary, I would say a couple things. We\u2019ve been very focused on trying to increase our activities in the middle-market space. We've had growth in the last several years in our -- many of our industry verticals in areas of specialization, but we\u2019ve not seen growth in middle-market. And so when you look at the last 12 months and really the last six months, many of the things that we\u2019ve worked on through GEAR Up and other initiatives, I believe are starting to come to pass. And so we had worked very hard on restructuring of our lending process to increase our [indiscernible] capacity, so then we have more time interfacing with customers and prospects. We deployed some new technology and some CRM applications, etcetera. They\u2019re helping from an enablement standpoint. And then we\u2019ve been very focused on new client acquisition, especially in middle-market at about 40% of our new originations, again this quarter were to what we call new transactions, new customers. And then I would say, more specifically as it relates to middle-market, I know there's some overall economic concerns out there. We think our customers remain relatively positive, and so we've had some good traditional working capital opportunities, some acquisition-related financing opportunities, that we\u2019ve been on the right side of, but we've also seen some CapEx. Eventually, if you put off building a new plant for a 10-year, you've eventually got to build something and so we had a few of those types of opportunities. S, we feel relatively constructive and optimistic about middle-market lending going forward, the pipeline remains pretty solid. Commitments were up and utilization were up in middle-market lending as well. And that really is not just a new phenomenon, but it's something that has been building for us. Last quarter, we saw growth in all three of our geographies also.","Gary Tenner","Right. Thanks for the detail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Curtis Farmer","Hello, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Hello. Good morning.","Curtis Farmer","Good morning.","Marty Mosby","Muneera, I want to ask a little about the NII. When you started talking about, moving at up 2% and then you start taking it down for the interest rate sensitivity that you mentioned, then you start looking at the current run rate. So, it's been running about $605 million in the first six months of the year. If you kind of back yourself down from your numbers, you\u2019re pretty flat to last year, which means or implies that the number has to move by the fourth quarter almost back to where it was in the first quarter of last year. What I\u2019m getting at is last year rates went up 100 basis points and now we are talking about one or two or three at the most, pullback in rates. But the sensitivity, it looks like it's racing a much bigger move on the upside on the backend. So, is there something else in funding costs or incremental balance sheet growth that\u2019s costing a little bit more that is more fundamental than just interest rates, because it seems like there's a little bit more sensitivity on the downside with what you are guiding to right now.","Muneera Carr","So I think, Marty, you are absolutely right in some of the comments that you made. Funding is a big difference between last year and this year. We\u2019ve done a lot on the capital front. And to be able to buy all those shares back, we've had to issue a lot of debt. And clearly, that just takes away from overall net interest income. So that\u2019s certainly by far the biggest element of it. And then beyond that, our balance sheet has continued to change over the last couple of years. Even though we have the highest proportion of noninterest bearing deposits in our peer group, clearly that's something, as rates have gone up, customers have put some of that money to use a little bit more effectively. And our asset sensitivity is a good kind of asset sensitivity that comes as a result of what\u2019s going on, on the liability side, i.e., the free funding that we had and that has shrunk a little bit over time. So those are a couple of things that I can give to you to consider on why things are different on the way down.","Marty Mosby","And then when we think about -- when you're talking about hedging, but also when you\u2019re thinking about your securities portfolio, you are sort of doing some restructuring last year, which was -- is very valuable at this point that you did what you did last year, but you probably could have done more of that as well. How much do we need? Let's say, that we had short-term rates go down and the economy does well and so eventually that begins to round up at the back-end of the curve slightly, how much of a round up would you need to be able to step in and be able to hedge the balance sheet more proactively to take away some of this downside risk and be able to begin to kind of bite at the apple again to restructure the portfolio? Is it 10 basis points, 20 basis points, 30 basis points, 40 basis points? How many basis points on the long end do we need to have a little bit better environment once we do see some loosening on the short end?","Muneera Carr","So there's a couple of things that you\u2019re mentioning in your question there. Part of it was about the securities portfolio and part of it was, what type of rate would cause us to move forward on the hedging front. On the securities portfolio, we've done -- we've been quite opportunistic. And you're absolutely right, we've taken a couple of opportunities to really help the yield of that portfolio along. As it gives us more fixed rate assets on our balance sheet, we like to make up there. It mutes [ph] our asset sensitivity. It gives us liquidity. So for all those reasons, I think what I would expect out of the securities portfolio is, for it to be essentially stable, we will continue to look for other opportunities as they come along. But as I said in my comments, I would expect that the yield there will remain stable. Beyond that and when you talk about what kind of a rate would cause us to move on the hedging front, that is a complicated question and one that is discussed a lot here at Comerica. Our opinion today is that, if the Fed is looking to essentially use rate cuts to sustain and prolong the economic expansions then -- and they\u2019re successful in achieving that objective, then future outcome is likely to be better than what the market has priced in. And so we\u2019re being patient. I don't really think that we\u2019re chasing a particular magic number. For us, it is -- we continue to monitor the economic developments. We continue to monitor market prices, and we will continue to adapt to the uncertainty that we see and adjust our balance sheet profile accordingly. So that's sort of our game plan now.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. And then just lastly, Curt, when you look at your provisioning and the guidance that you're giving, you've been running somewhere in the, just call it $15 million to $20 million range per quarter once we back out kind of noise in the last six quarters until this quarter and then you jumped up quite a bit. You were talking about certain loans, five loans that created this jump up, but then we are kind of dropping provisioning from where it's at this quarter, but not going back to really what was closer to a $15 million kind of run rates. We are almost doubling the run rate of provision from what we\u2019ve had over the last year and a half to what you're now expecting to have in the rest -- in the second half of the year. So, just want to make sure we are just focused on these five loans in this particular quarter and there's just some -- just conservatism baked into your guidance on the provision side going forward.","Curtis Farmer","I think there's always -- we always try to bake in some conservative view into provisions. By design there are things you know about and anticipate in the portfolio and then sometimes things happen that can be more surprising. And as Pete alluded to earlier, we do not know of anything out there right now that is of concern to us in the rest of the portfolio. While it continues to be a fairly benign credit environment, we\u2019re seeing loan growth and that facilitates or necessitates us in increasing some provision as we go just based on the accounting rules associated with that. But we're trying to give you a view that would say kind of a more normalized environment, what might that look like. And it's been such a benign and low charge-off environment for so long, it's hard to think about what a more normalized environment might look like longer term. But we\u2019re trying to be conservative in those estimates, but also trying to give you a sense of sort of -- at least what the profitability could be, if we see a change in the credit environment.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","Curtis Farmer","Hello, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. Good morning. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just back on the capital point. I know you just indicated that your binding constraint is Tier 1. So you're at 10.2% Tier 1, 8.5% is the regulatory minimum. What's your internal buffer? Is it about 1.5%?","Muneera Carr","Well, it tends to be in the range, John. Just recognize that we\u2019ve a lot of constituencies that we\u2019ve to cater to on that front. We\u2019ve to think about our regulators, rating agencies, our customers, depositors. And all of that is all part and parcel of the consideration and where we go on capital front. We -- for us, when we think about, as Curt said, the 2020 financial plan, at that point, we will also look at the capital plan and have some internal discussions and see what if anything we can update on that front.","John Pancari","Okay. And then -- go ahead.","Curtis Farmer","I would just say, John, we normally would give our forward guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call.","John Pancari","Got it. Got it. So then, I guess regarding that planning, I might as well ask about it now. So, why not issue preferreds then if CET -- if Tier 1 is your issue and then buy back common. And then separately, Ralph -- Curt, 'm curious on your take here, is M&A plans for the bank coming into play here? Thanks.","Curtis Farmer","John, preferred is something that we\u2019ve looked at periodically and we will continue to look at periodically. Certainly we are points along the way, but we did not think preferred was very attractive. And so it's something we will think about and make some assessments longer term there, but certainly on -- in these forms and others, we'd make you aware of that. And then on the M&A front, nothing has changed for us. We continue to focus on organic growth and we continue to be very patient around M&A transactions. I think we\u2019ve done two in the last four years, and both of those were transactions that made a lot of strategic sense for us. They really were good cultural fit and aligned with the businesses and geographies that we operate in today. Our appetite around M&A is -- continues to be limited to really primarily Texas and California and potential targets are relatively few. And so we\u2019re focused on growing our geographies and growing our lines of business in those primary markets, we still feel like we\u2019ve a lot of upward growth opportunity.","John Pancari","All right. Thanks, Curt. Appreciate it.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you, John.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Curt Farmer, President and Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks.","Curtis Farmer","We appreciate everyone's interest in Comerica.

My name is Carmen and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Carmen. Good morning. And welcome to Comerica\u2019s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curtis Farmer; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile; and Executive Vice President of the Business Bank, Pat Faubion.","A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC\u2019s website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. As we review our second quarter results, we will be referring to the slides which provide additional details on our earnings.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statements contained in this release issued today, as well as slide two of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our filings with the SEC for factors that could cause actual results to differ. Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures and in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ralph who will begin on slide three.","Ralph Babb","Good morning. Our second quarter results reflect the advantages of our diverse geographic footprint and industry expertise. Today, we reported second quarter 2015 net income of $135 million compared to $134 million for the first quarter and $151 million for the second quarter of 2014. Earnings per diluted share were $0.73 for both the second and first quarters of 2015 and $0.80 for the second quarter of 2014.","Turning to slide four and highlights from our second quarter results. Average loans were up $2.1 billion or 5% compared to a year ago. Average loans grew $682 million or 1% relative to the first quarter with increases in most markets and business lines. The largest contributor quarter over quarter was mortgage banker finance which grew $690 million as we continue to increase our market share and benefited from a pick-up in activity due to summer home sales. This was partially offset by $276 million decrease in average loans in our energy line of business as customers continued to adjust their cash flow needs and tap the capital markets.","Average deposits were up $4 billion or 8% compared to a year ago. Relative to the first quarter, average deposits increased $408 million or 1% with non-interest bearing deposits up $668 million. In further comparing our second quarter results to the first quarter, net interest income increased $8 million or 2% to $421 million, primarily due to an increase in loan volumes and one more day in the quarter.","Overall, credit quality remains solid. Net charge-offs continue to be well below normal levels at 15 basis points or $18 million. Net charge-offs related to our energy exposure were nominal. The provision for credit losses increased from a very low level due to an increase in criticized loans related to energy as well as uncertainty due to continued volatility and the sustained low oil and gas prices. Reserve to total loans ratio was increased to 1.24% and the reserve covers non-performing loans 1.7 times. The outcome of the recent shared national credit exam is incorporated into our results.","Non-interest income increased $6 million or 2% to $261 million, reflecting increases in card fees and smaller increases in several other fee categories. Non-interest expenses decreased $23 million to $436 million, primarily due to a $31 million reduction in litigation-related expenses and seasonally lower salary and benefit expenses, partially offset by higher outside processing fees related to increased revenue generating activities. The decline in litigation-related expenses reflected a reduction in legal reserves including a favorable court ruling which reversed a jury verdict against Comerica and sent the case back for a new trial.","Our capital position continues to be solid. Stock and warrant repurchases under our equity repurchase program combined with dividends returned $96 million to shareholders in the second quarter. As announced in April, we increased the quarterly dividend by 5% to $0.21 per share.","Turning to slide five and look at our primary markets. Our Texas Economic Index issued earlier this month and tracking data through April, shows that the Texas economy continued to ease from lower oil prices. However, job creation in Texas has bounced back and ranked third nationally for most jobs created in May. And for the last 12 months, Texas was the number two job generator, behind only California. The diversity of the Texas economy together with the geographic diversity of our footprint and the positive momentum of the national economy continues to serve us well. Average loans in Texas were down about 2% compared to the first quarter due the decline in our energy loans while average deposits were relatively stable.","Our California Economic Index has shown another month of growth. The California economy gained momentum after a soft first quarter. The state economy is large, diverse and resilient. Court [ph] activity is normalizing and the high-tech sector remains strong. Real estate markets in Northern California are tight and Southern California markets are tightening as well. Average loans in California were up 1.5% compared to the first quarter with technology and life sciences, national dealer services, private banking and small business are contributing to the growth. Average deposits were up 2.6%, led by technology and life sciences and general middle market.","Our Michigan economic index has shown another gain. Strong auto sales are supportive of Michigan\u2019s manufacturing sector and are buffering the negative impact of the strong dollar on export oriented manufacturing. Job creation is on an upward trend in Michigan and real estate markets continue to firm up. Average loans in Michigan were up by 0.5% compared to the first quarter, led by middle market banking while average deposits were stable.","Before turning it over to Karen, since our last earnings call in April, Curt Farmer was named Comerica\u2019s President; and earlier this week, we announced the change in leadership of our Business Bank, appointing Pat Faubion, a 31 year Comerica veteran to head our Business Bank. While Curt and Pat bring considerable experience and expertise, I look forward to working with both of them in their new roles.","In closing, we believe our balance sheet remains well positioned for rising rates. We remain focused on the long-term with the relationship banking strategy that continues to serve us well.","And now, I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph and good morning everyone.","Turning to slide six, quarter-over-quarter, total average loans increased $682 million or 1.4%. Mortgage banker was the largest contributor to average loan growth with $690 million increase over the first quarter due to new and expanded relationships as well as seasonality related to summer home sales.","In addition, average loans grew in the majority of our business lines, including general middle market, private banking, national dealer services, mall business, and technology and life sciences. As expected, average loans in our energy line of business did decline by $276 million and average loans in our corporate banking business also declined, as we continue to maintain our pricing and structure discipline in one of the most the competitive segments in the industry.","Based on the Fed\u2019s H8 data, our average total loan growth outpaced the large U.S. commercial banks, which grew 1.2% from April 1st to July 1st. Total loan commitments increased $582 million at quarter-end, with growth in nearly every business line, more than offsetting declines in energy and corporate banking. Utilization also increased to 51% from 50% at the end of the first quarter with usage increasing in almost every business line, other than energy and technology and life sciences, importantly our pipeline increased. Our loan yields increased 1 basis point in the second quarter as shown in the yellow diamond. We benefited from a 1 basis point increase in 30-day LIBOR.","Turning to deposits on slide seven. Average deposits increased $408 million in the second quarter, driven by a $668 million increase in non-interest bearing deposits. A seasonal tax related increase in retail balances was a major contributor. Period end total deposits increased $690 million to $58.3 billion. We continue to prudently manage deposit pricing which remained very low and decreased 1 basis point to 14 basis points as shown by the yellow diamonds on the slide.","Slide eight shows our securities portfolio increase as we continue to position ourselves for compliance with the new liquidity coverage ratio or LCR. While our average balances were stable from the first quarter at $9.9 billion, our period end balances reflect the purchase of additional treasury securities in June. The estimated duration of our total portfolio sits at 3.8 years and the expected duration under a 200 basis-point rate shock extends it modestly to 4.6 years. In the current rate environment, we expect continued minor pressure on the average security wheel as you can see in the yellow diamond on the slide. As far as LCR compliance, we still feel comfortable that we will meet the proposed phase in threshold by continuing to add high quality liquid assets or HQLA over the next year and half to meet the requirement plus the buffer to withstand normal volatility.","In early June, we issued $500 million in five-year senior bank debt and swap it to floating at six months LIBOR plus 75 basis points. We invested a portion of the proceeds 200 million in five year treasuries, yielding about 150 basis points. As long as interest rates remain low, we expect to continue to execute in this manner to minimize any impact to those earnings and our asset sensitive position. We have said before that the amount of additional HQLA needed is fluid and depends on loan and deposit growth as well as our continued assessment of both our own data and the rule. Based on our estimate of what we know today, we believe that by the end of 2016, we will need to add 1 billion to 3 billion in HQLA which we will fund by tapping a variety of sources in manageable increment. We estimate that based on our current assessment as of quarter-end, our LCR was in the mid 80s, up from about 80% at the end of the first quarter.","Turning to slide nine, net interest income grew $8 million in the second quarter. Loan growth, one additional day in the quarter, and higher loan yields together drove in an $11 million increase. This was partly offset by lower securities yield, lower average balances at the fed and an increase in interest expense on debt. Our net interest margin increased 1 basis point, primarily driven by higher loan yields which reflected 1 basis point increase in 30-day LIBOR. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, excluding the $8 million decline in accretion, net interest income increased $13 million, largely due to loan growth.","We continue to be well positioned to benefit when rates rise. Our standard asset liability case shows that a 200 basis-point increase in rates over a one year period equivalent to 100 basis points on average would result in an increase to net interest income of about $220 million. We also share in the appendix several alternative assumptions to our standard case, which changes to the pace of deposit decline, loan growth and rate rises. And in all cases, we remain well-positioned for rising rates.","Because we have continued to experience strong deposit growth in this persistently low rate environment, our standard model which has reflected only historical behavior now also reflects a further decrease in deposits as rates begin to rise. While it is difficult to predict how deposits may react when we move out of this unprecedented environment, the longer our deposits continue to increase, it becomes more likely in our view that customers will ultimately use funds in their businesses or other investments.","Turning to slide 10, our overall credit picture remains solid and fully reflects the results to the shared national credit exam completed in the second quarter. Net charge-offs were 15 basis points and while up from a very low level in the first quarter, they remain well below what is historically normal for us. The increase in net charge-offs can be attributed to corporate banking and technology and life sciences which tend to be lumpy. This is partially offset by net recoveries in private banking and commercial real estate.","Our criticized loans grew $294 million to $2.4 billion or less than 5% of total loans which is well below our historical experience. The increase was driven by $329 million increase in criticized loans related to energy. Inflows to non-accruals were $145 million of which $100 million were energy related. While non-accrual loans were up to $349 million, they are still only 70 basis points of total loans. As far as energy, we have essentially completed the spring redeterminations for our E&P customers which comprise 70% of our energy business line. On average, loan to values and advance rates remain stable from the prior redetermination. As of quarter end, commitments in our energy line of business have declined about 5% and outstandings are down 7% relative to the first quarter. Overall, our energy customers are taking the necessary actions to adjust their cash flow and reduce their bank debt such as cutting their expenses, disposing of assets and tapping the capital markets.","As of quarter end approximately 14% or $578 million of energy and energy related portfolio is classified as criticized, including non-accruals of $119 million and there were only $2 million of charge-offs. The $47 million provision for our total portfolio reflected higher reserves for energy loans as a result of an increase in criticized loans and the impact of continued volatility and sustained low energy prices. To a lesser extent corporate banking as well as technology and life sciences contributed to the increase in provision, largely as a result of charge-offs and variability. These increases were partially offset by credit quality improvements in the remainder of the portfolio which had a decline in non-accrual and criticized loans. It is important to note that while we have prudently increased the reserves for energy, we are very comfortable with our portfolio and continue to believe charge-offs will be manageable.","In summary, our consistent robust methodology resulted in a $28 million increase to the allowance for credit losses to $668 million and the coverage of our non-performing loans remains very strong at 1.7 times.","Slide 11 outlines non-interest income, which increased $6 million to $261 million, largely driven by a $5 million increase in card fees, due to higher revenue from merchant payment processing services and interchange. In addition, we have increases in service charges on deposit accounts, fiduciary income, and brokerage fees. This was partially offset by a $3 million decline in commercial lending fees, resulting from lower syndication fees and lower unused commitment fees from higher line utilization. As a reminder, in the third quarter, we made contractual changes to a card program that impacted the way we present both revenues and expenses, and is shown in the lighter shaded portion of the bars on the left chart.","Turning to slide 12, non-interest expenses decreased $23 million and included a $31 million decrease in litigation related expenses, including a reduction in reserves for a case that received a favorable ruling on appeal. Salaries and benefits decreased $2 million due to seasonal decline in payroll taxes and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in technology related contract labor, merit increases and one additional day in the second quarter. Finally, outside processing fees associated with revenue generating activities increased $8 million.","Moving to slide 13 and capital management. Our 2015 capital plan includes equity repurchases up to $393 million. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for $49 million and 500,000 warrants for $10 million under the equity repurchase program. When you combine this with the recent 5% increase in the dividend to $0.21 per share, we returned 71% of second quarter net income to shareholders. Despite the repurchases, diluted average shares remained flat at 182 million for the second quarter as the impact from the increase in Comerica\u2019s average stock price caused an increase in share dilution from options and warrants. As you might recall, the Federal Reserve scenario in the stress test included a gradual increase in rates over the forecasted period. Given that the pace of our equity repurchases is expected to move in line with our performance and a rise in interest rates.","Turning to slide 14 and our outlook for full year 2015, which assumes the continuation of the current economic and rate environment. As we have said before, average loans for the full year are expected to grow at about the same pace as 2014. We expect a typical third quarter seasonal decline in our dealer, mortgage banker, and general middle market business line followed by typical historical rebound in the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate the decline in energy outstandings should continue. We expect our net interest income for the full year to be relatively stable with last year, assuming no rise in interest rate with loan growth offsetting the decrease in purchase accounting accretion. And as far as credit measures in the second half of 2015, we expect net charge-off rates to be similar to the 15 basis points we had in the second quarter and criticized loans to remain below normal levels. Because the impact from volatility in oil and gas prices is difficult to predict, continued negative migration is possible and maybe partially offset by a reduction in loan balances.","As always, we remain focused on the emerging trends and have increased our reserve allocation the last three quarters, as a result. The remainder of the loan book is expected to continue to perform well. On a full year basis, we expect non-interest income to be relatively stable. Excluding the impact of the accounting presentation of a card program, which is offset in non-interest expense, we continue to expect lower letters of credit, derivatives and warrant income which should be mostly offset by growth in card and fiduciary fees. Non-interest expenses are expected to be higher in the second half of the year relative to the first half, primarily due to three more days and the full impact of merit increases as well as the ramp up in spending for technology projects and regulatory compliance. Also outside processing expenses are expected to continue to grow with increased card revenue. Finally, occupancy expenses are expected to increase from seasonal taxes and higher rent expense.","In closing, we are pleased with the continued loan and deposit growth as well as increased net interest and fee income. Credit quality for the bulk of our portfolio remains very strong and we continue to believe that energy charge-offs will be manageable. We remain focused on the long-term and we expect that as rates rise, our revenue picture look even brighter. As always we believe our relationship banking strategy combined with our diverse geographic footprint will continue to assist us in building long-term shareholder value.","Now we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neil.","Scott Siefers","I guess, maybe to start on the energy book. Pardon me. Given the volatility in the provision, can you give us sort of any sense for how much of that was kind of front end loaded whether it was because of the resulted redetermination or SNC Exam versus how much of that will be ongoing? I mean, I guess, my sense is a lot of it is -- was front end loaded and then you got a declining base of energy related loans that should release some pressure, but anything that you can offer to just kind of help scope that would be appreciated.","Ralph Babb","Pete?","Pete Guilfoile","Sure. So, we\u2019re about three quarters away through our risk ratings and so we have updated the portfolio largely for the decline in energy prices. So from that perspective, we\u2019re a good way of the way through it. We do expect though for there to be some continued migration in the portfolio as our borrowers continue to adjust to this lower price environment but we also expect that we\u2019re going to continue to see pay downs on our energy loans which is going -- have a offsetting effect to the additional migration that we expect to see in the coming quarters.","Scott Siefers","And I don\u2019t think you have, but can you remind me, have you guys disclosed what the energy reserve is in the past? And if so, what the number is as of the second quarter?","Karen Parkhill","We haven\u2019t disclosed the amount of reserve allocation for any industry, mainly because we view that the reserve is there to cover any and all losses. At the beginning of this downturn back in the fourth quarter, we did talk about the fact that we had increased our qualitative reserves against energy at that point in time. We also talked in the first quarter about the fact that we had increased our qualitative reserve modestly. And this quarter, our overall energy reserves have increased including maintaining a portion of qualitative reserves, given the fact that Pete talked about, that we expect continued potential negative migration in the portfolio.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Maybe to follow-up on Scott\u2019s question, some of your answers, so I can understand them. Of the $329 million increase in criticized loans tied to energy, how much of that was tied to the SNC Exam?","Pete Guilfoile","Steve, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for us to discuss results of the SNC Exam. What we can tell you is, is that we have incorporated all the risk rating changes that came out of the SNC Exam in our June 30th results.","Steven Alexopoulos","To drive that level of increase in criticized, was there anything else that happened in the quarter outside of the SNC Exam, because I think you are more than half way through the redetermination process, right, as of last quarter?","Pete Guilfoile","That\u2019s right. There is -- we\u2019re seeing continued migration in the energy portfolio and that\u2019s what we really expected, Steve. We\u2019re not seeing anything that we didn\u2019t expect to see in the first quarter. And I think we feel as good about the energy portfolio today as we did a quarter ago.","Steven Alexopoulos","And in terms of the provision, I think prior to this quarter, you would have established a provision based on your peak losses. The last time we saw a sharp decline in oil. Why has that not been enough so far?","Karen Parkhill","Steve, I would say that on the reserves, we did equate our qualitative reserve at the beginning of the downturn to be about equal to the peak net charge-offs in the last cycle. But what I would say is each cycle is different. And in the last cycle there was a lot of other things going on other than energy; it was back in 2008, 2009. And we have increased our reserves this cycle prudently.","Steven Alexopoulos","And maybe Karen, $50 oil today at the time fall reset that\u2019s upcoming, what percent of the portfolios [ph] be protected by hedges at that point? ","Pete Guilfoile","Steve, right now, I can tell you that 60% of our borrowers have more than 50% of their revenues hedged for a year or more and about third of them have 50% or more of their revenues hedged out two years or more. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change a great deal between now and the fall but it\u2019s difficult to model that. We have been encouraged by the fact that the amount of hedging really is not changed over the past couple quarters. And our borrowers continue to look for opportunities to layer in hedging when our opportunity is to do that. We expect that to continue.","Steven Alexopoulos","And maybe just a final one and changing director for a second for Ralph, obviously disappointing news on Lars departing the company. How do you think about and how should we think about any potential business impact from him leaving? And given that he\u2019s gone to a competitor, do you have a non-compete in place to protect against key employees, key customers getting poached? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Okay. What I would say is as we mentioned in my comments as well as in the announcement that Pat Faubion is moving up to take Lars\u2019s place. Pat\u2019s for this for over 31 years; understands the business banking environment very well. He also has been the Texas market president for a number of years. And so I think that transition will go very smoothly from that standpoint. As we have talked about in the past, Pat will report to Curt. And Curt as well has a good deal of experience in all of our markets and understands our approach to our customers. So, I feel very good about the transition and we wish Lars the best.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian ","Karen thanks very much for the outlook on expenses for the second half of the year. I guess how we should think about as we determine quarterly run rate about the litigation accrual reversal; does that come back to your run rate next quarter and that we should base our forecast off of?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, the litigation related expenses are not typical. And so those should not be included in the run rate.","Erika Najarian","So just to be clear, the base would actually be 466 as we think about the second half of the year?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. That\u2019s correct Erika.","Erika Najarian","And just, I wanted to make sure I understood the comments on buyback. So, are you hinting towards slower buyback activity? I just wanted to make sure I understood the message. You were saying that the pace of buyback could be relative to potential change interest rate. I just wanted to make sure I understood the message there.","Karen Parkhill","Yes. So, in the past, you probably have noted that our buybacks have been pretty evenly spread in the quarters. And our current five-quarter approval was against the scenario that the Fed has put out it\u2019s a public scenario that shows interest rates increasing, starting in the back half of this year and ramping up increasingly through the approval period. And as a result, that has a good impact on our performance; and our share repurchase would be in line with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Karen, just a follow-up on the expenses; analysts want to ask you to just walk through a couple of these lines. When we look at on slide 14, those, the three points about the increase in tech, increase in regulatory, increase pension; am I correct in reading that most of those three things are in the run rate?","Karen Parkhill","How you should read them is that we show our full year which is what we\u2019ve pointed to in prior outlook. For example, the technology increase is to 100 million for the full year but in the first half we booked $45 million which points to greater increase in the second half. That\u2019s how should you read it.","Ken Usdin","So the tech one of those three is the only one that really hasn\u2019t increased in the second half of those three?","Karen Parkhill","That\u2019s correct.","Ken Usdin","And then secondly then, can you just try to help us understand little bit more about the bottom point there about to the magnitude of increase over 467 starting point that you\u2019ll see from merit and those outside processing in occupancy costs?","Karen Parkhill","We typically see an impact in our salary and benefits line item obviously by three more days in the quarter. That is a typical. So, you can look back at prior years. Merit increase is also very typical where merit increases typically happen in the spring and then you\u2019ll see a fuller version of those as you hit the second half. And then higher outside processing fees would increase commensurate with revenue generating activity. And occupancy expenses as we talked about, increase because of taxes and rent increases in the back half.","Ken Usdin","So just in summary then, it\u2019s fair to say that the third and fourth quarters should be not just higher than the first-half but distinctly little bit higher than the second quarter; is that fair to say?","Karen Parkhill","That is fair to say.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank.","Dave Rochester","I just wanted to follow-up on a previous answer you guys gave on an energy question. You mentioned you were through the redetermination process but you were three quarters away through the risk rating process. I don\u2019t know if I heard that correctly, but if I did, I was just wondering why there is a difference there.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, sure Dave. I\u2019d be glad to clarify that. We\u2019re 97% through the redetermination process which means that we\u2019re 97% through re-risk rating our E&P -- the E&P segment of our portfolio. The 75% I referred to is the entire line of business which includes E&P, midstream and energy services.","Dave Rochester","So, the midstream and the energy services have not been revaluated as yet?","Pete Guilfoile","No, they have. We\u2019re about 70 some percent through the energy services piece; we\u2019re like E&P, we\u2019re seeing some migration; and we\u2019re about little over 50% through the midstream segment where we\u2019re seeing really no migration.","Dave Rochester","And could you guys give any color on your outlook for debt issuance in the second half, given your expected needs for HQLA growth that you\u2019re talking about?","Karen Parkhill","As I mentioned, we expect to raise wholesale funding for HQLA purposes, between 1 billion to 3 billion from now through the end of next year.","Dave Rochester","So, the 1 billion to 3 billion is -- sorry. Go ahead.","Karen Parkhill","Yes, the 1 billion to 3 billion is an 18-month period.","Dave Rochester","And you expect to fund all of that with wholesale funding or just a portion of that?","Karen Parkhill","Well, we expect to fund it with wholesale funding, but our definition of wholesale funding is not just debt in the capital markets. That would be one from of it; another form is we have plenty of capacity to draw down on our federal home loan bank line; and then we also consider broker deposits as a cheap form of wholesale funding. So, we have a variety of sources that we would tap in manageable increments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Eads with UBS.","David Eads","Maybe looking at the Texas portfolio outside of energy, I am curious if you have any kind of sense for the trajectory of loan balances there over the rest of the year? And I am curious if we saw any increases in the non-performers, our criticized loans in the non-energy part of the Texas portfolio?","Pat Faubion","The Texas portfolio as noted on the slides was down about 2% but that\u2019s entirely attributed to the energy book which is to be expected and the other lines of business net to about flat. Pete, do you want to address the credit issue there?","Pete Guilfoile","Sure. David, we\u2019re really not seeing a lot of migration in the Texas portfolio outside of energy with one exception, we have a small TLS book out of Houston. This book is largely pre-revenue venture back companies that are developing new technologies in the oil patch. And you can imagine that the business model for them has changed a great deal as oil has gone from 90 to 50. The good news in that portfolio is it\u2019s quite small; it\u2019s only about 85 million and 2% of our total energy and energy related. Other than that, we\u2019re seeing good experience in terms of the Texas portfolio including commercial real estate.","Karen Parkhill","And Dave, I would just mentioned that our loan outlook for the entire company does assume a continuation of the current economic environment, which includes a slowdown in activity in Texas.","David Eads","And then I am just kind of curious of how the energy kind of redetermination process works, just given the changes we\u2019ve had in the oil prices over the past quarter. Is it a function where the redetermination made on the oil price using as of the date it\u2019s done or assuming at certain price? I guess the bottom-line question is, how much is the drop of price is from 60 bucks to 50 bucks, how much of that is already baked into the current -- the 2Q level, how much could impact going forward?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes. I can tell you that for the 97% we have done redeterminations on all of those risk ratings, reflect current energy prices. The way the redeterminations work David, is we do -- we use the price deck that is approved at the time of redetermination. However, the price deck, if we go back all the way to January, our price decks which are very conservative are reflective at or below current prices. So, we\u2019re very comfortable that we have reflected current energy prices in the 97% of the portfolio that we have re-risk rated.","David Eads","And that\u2019s including, because I know you guys have discounts to prices. So basically you are saying that the price deck on a weighted average will be below where it is now and that gives you comfort that you\u2019re kind of -- reflecting the current price?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, because we don\u2019t necessary set the price deck at current prices. We set the price deck at we think is appropriate and then we sensitize off of that pretty significantly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. ","John Pancari","So, back to energy. Of the 300 million increase in criticized and energy criticize, how much of that was E&P versus midstream and oil service?","Ralph Babb","Of the 300 million E&P, let me put to you this way. Right now our E&P portfolio is -- 15% of that portfolio is criticized; energy services is about 16%, is criticized. The two combined are about 440 million.","John Pancari","Okay. So that -- just so I understand again that 15% for E&P?","Ralph Babb","Yes. The criticized, there is a percentage of the entire E&P portfolio right now is 15% criticized and the criticized portion of our energy services book is 16%.","John Pancari","Got it. So, the total energy -- the criticized ratio for the total energy portfolio is in that 16%-17% range?","Ralph Babb","It\u2019s actually 13% because midstream that we really don\u2019t have a much in the way of criticized loans in midstream. So, in total, it\u2019s 13% for the entire portfolio, entire line of business portfolio.","John Pancari","So, now where would that number last cycle, like where is that compared to your peak? Is that already above where you peaked before?","Ralph Babb","I don\u2019t have the number off-hand but I\u2019m quite sure, it was not. At the peak, I know our energy services book which was the worst part of it last downturn, I think we reached about 37% criticized there.","Karen Parkhill","And keep in mind that criticized loan does not necessarily become a charge-off. Last cycle our peak net charge-off was 69 basis points.","John Pancari","What you\u2019re providing, it looks like at higher level that you did last time, even though the peak criticized from last time or higher than where they\u2019re now. So I guess that points to just the regulatory environment around this type of portfolio; is that fair?","Karen Parkhill","There is increased scrutiny around this portfolio in the current environment.","John Pancari","And then lastly if I could just ask, around the reserve, I know Karen, you indicated, you didn\u2019t quantify that. But is it fair to assume just based upon the number you did give. I think it was two quarters ago, about the energy loan loss reserve ratio, I think it was around 1.5%, 1.6%. If we assume factoring the reserve editions for energy and also adjust for what we think were the charge-offs for the quarter, is it fair to assume that your energy loss reserve is in the ballpark of 270 basis points?","Karen Parkhill","I\u2019m not going to comment on the allocation for energy reserves, really because of what I said earlier that we believe that reserves are there to cover any and all losses. But I will say obviously that we\u2019ve increased the reserves against our energy portfolio for the last three quarters. And this quarter we have increased the overall allocation as well as it continues to maintain a qualitative portion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray.","Brett Rabatin","I guess just a question around the guidance on the provision and charge-offs, the updated numbers. I realize that criticized loans don\u2019t necessarily mean charge-offs, but I guess I was looking for some color around the guidance in the back half of the year for charge-offs to remain similar to 2Q, 15 basis points, despite the increase in criticized loans overall. Any thought on why you guys didn\u2019t change that to a higher number?","Karen Parkhill","So, on net charge-offs, again we expect net charge-offs to be well below what we redeem normal or through the cycle for us which is about 40 basis points. And we\u2019re trying to give color on the back half of the year that while charge-offs continue to bounce around along the bottom right now, they likely won\u2019t be as low in the back half of the year as they have been for quarters prior to this one. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re saying approximately equal to the second quarter. And overall provision is very difficult to predict and will depend on what happens in the energy space. If oil prices continue to remain low, we expect that to have additional impact on credit migration in our energy and energy related book but we do also expect that that could be offset by loan pay down.","Pete Guilfoile","If I could just add, a good portion of the increase in criticized of course in the E&P book. This is an asset-based book; it\u2019s very well secured. And even though we had to make loans in this segment substandard because they need the definition of impaired, they\u2019re still well secured.","Brett Rabatin","And I guess the other question was just a follow-up again on the energy stuff. Last quarter there was a bigger difference between criticized and E&P versus service which is I guess what I wasn\u2019t expecting. Any thoughts around the increase in criticized on E&P versus criticized this quarter?","Pete Guilfoile","I can tell you that we still feel very good about the E&P segment of the portfolio. These are large energy companies, the strong balance sheets. We have very few, only a handful of credits; Pat pointed to three. They have efficiencies at this point in time. So, we\u2019re in very strong position in terms of our collateral position clever position on the E&P portfolio.","Brett Rabatin","And then I guess just lastly if I can. The Texas being flat outside of energy kind of any thoughts around why Texas is flat aside from the energy with the things going on besides obvious energy implications?","Pat Faubion","The overall economy in Texas although it is more diverse than the last energy downturn, is in a slump and that\u2019s noted in our economic forecast provided by Robert Dye. The pipelines however are still strong and all of our lines of business are continuing to grow.","Ralph Babb","And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re seeing employment pick up again, so positive signs from that standpoint.","Pete Guilfoile","If I could also add, the middle market segment of portfolio which is energy related, what we\u2019re really seeing there is a good thing. We\u2019re seeing as these companies\u2019 revenues drop off that balance sheets are shrinking and they\u2019re using their cash to pay down debt. So that\u2019s actually been a positive thing. But it is the headwind in terms of loan numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital.","Bob Ramsey","I was just hoping you could maybe share a little color, in the scenario that you all have outlined where energy prices stay where they are today and you see some contraction in loan balances, in that scenario, how should we think about the provision expense in the back half of the year? Does the back half look like the first half; does it look more like the first quarter or just kind of curious in that scenario what it looks like? ","Karen Parkhill","Bob, it\u2019s very difficult to predict. But what I would say is that we\u2019ve given you a sense of where we think net charge-offs will be in the back half of the year. And then on the rest of the provision, that really does depend on negative credit migration that could be possible. But again, we point to the fact that that could be offset by the decline in balances. So, it is difficult to predict. I would also remind people that we do continue to have a qualitative reserve against what could be further migration.","Bob Ramsey","And could it be fully offset by the drop in balances or is it more of a partial offset?","Karen Parkhill","That is difficult to predict. So, we can\u2019t say.","Bob Ramsey","Help me think to how should we think about the amount of contraction we could see in the energy portfolios? Will it look similar to this quarter or do you have any sense of whether there could be acceleration?","Pat Faubion","Energy loans did peak for us in February and since then they\u2019ve been declining. As we expect, as companies adjust for cash flow and really operate within cash flow and also tapping the capital markets, we do expect to continue to see the decline over the course of the year as company continues to manage our cash flow, although we could see some temporary upticks of capital markets access type material. But we do expect lower CapEx, lower production and lower cash flow which translates to decreased loan demand.","Karen Parkhill","I would also add that in the appendix we do show the history of our energy portfolio and you can see how it reacted in the last downturn which can help us to guide.","Bob Ramsey","And then I guess shifting away from energy, but still talking about loan growth, obviously this was a really strong quarter for the mortgage banker finance portfolio. I know you guys have said seasonally in the back half of the year to expect that to come in a bit. Just curious of your comment on the strength this quarter and whether the seasonal decline really is more of a 4Q than 3Q event or how you\u2019re thinking about the trajectory there?","Curtis Farmer","I would say just a brawl as you\u2019ve already commented that we\u2019re seeing the normal seasonal buying period of spring and summer and we\u2019re not through the summer season. Yes, so it continues a little bit into the third quarter as well, but typically we would see to fall off in Q3 and Q4. We from overall perspective saw nice growth in mortgage banker finance. And the piece I think that has potential to fall off in the second half of the year is the refi activity as rates continue to increase. But home purchases as real estate values firm up across the country may be more stable versus refi.","Bob Ramsey","And how much of the current book is refi versus purchase?","Curtis Farmer","We\u2019re 70% on the purchase side which compares to the MBA [ph] data which would say the industry average is more than the 55% range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","I guess first question in terms of -- if you look at the price of oil over the last quarter, just had an upward bias in the ballpark and say at the end of the quarter roughly $60. Was your reserves based on the $60ish oil price because obviously it\u2019s come down a fair bit and about roughly $50 right now? I am just wondering if what you base to reserve on and is the drop from 60 to 50 actually the main driver of your additional reserve build that you\u2019re referring to.","Pete Guilfoile","The answer is, our price deck did not reflect $60 oil and it hasn\u2019t reflected that all year. Our price deck was set well below that level and it\u2019s been at that level for the entire year. So again, with all the redeterminations that we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve been doing them with prices that are at or below whatever the current oil price is, gas prices are.","Ralph Babb","And the price is also just to the amount direct borrowing.","Pete Guilfoile","It is typically around 65% of PDP.","Ken Zerbe","But the drops at $50 oil now, are you saying that you would not change your price deck based on where oil was today, you have not\u2026","Pete Guilfoile","That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s what I am saying. I am saying our price deck is appropriate given where prices are today. So we look at it all the time.","Ken Zerbe","And on the 75% that you\u2019ve reviewed, I think it was of the E&P and midstream. When you guys go through and build or put reserves on the stuff that you\u2019ve reviewed, do you also extrapolate to the other 25% you haven\u2019t done yet or is that something we could see deteriorate next quarter?","Ralph Babb","We actually do, do that. And we have an extrapolation and that\u2019s one of the factors we use in terms of determining what our qualitative reserve should be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell","One more on energy, maybe tying into to your comments about the capital markets. It sounds like your clients have been able to tap the capital markets over the past few months to be able to reduce your exposure. Can you maybe give us a qualitative measure of sort of their ability to do that; has that -- have the markets tightened for that over the past few months?","Pat Faubion","The capital markets have been very open to energy credits. And as you suggest our borrowers have been very adaptive tapping those capital markets. And today that we remain opened. My comment was if capital markets tightened, that could reduce the run-off that we see in our portfolio. I don\u2019t have a way to predict what the capital markets might do with regard to energy companies.","Matt Burnell","And then Ralph, maybe a question for you; you say on slide 13 that the pace of future buyback activity within the 393 million that you\u2019re targeting for the current capital planning cycle is somewhat dependent, I guess, on your financial performance. And if you end up getting a redetermination later this year that\u2019s tougher than you expect that increases your provisions. I guess the question is really at the end of the day, how committed are you to generating or to fulfilling that 393 million repurchase, within the context of also trying to grow tangible booked value?","Ralph Babb","We are always focused on the return to our shareholders as we\u2019ve talked about many times and we will continue to look and evaluate that. It depends what you gave an example, it depends what happens there and what the analysis is at that point in time and what we feel like as to the decision we would make. You can\u2019t predict that until you\u2019re there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James.","Michael Rose","Just a follow-up on other energy questions. Do you have a sense for kind of debt to EBITDA levels for your companies on average and how that change your energy companies on average, how that changed with the access to the capital markets? Obviously the lower that leverage goes the better it is for loss content. Thanks.","Pete Guilfoile","I don\u2019t have an aggregate statistic for you. Obviously the cash flow leverage of many borrowers as increases as cash flows have decreased but our focus really is on more on balance sheet leverage, because it\u2019s really capital and liquidity that are important in downturns and that\u2019s what really gets our borrowers through downturns. And so not that cash flow leverage isn\u2019t important; we look at that as well, but balance sheet leverage is probably our main focus.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens Incorporated.","Terry McEvoy","Just a question for Karen. The $130 million increase in tech and regulatory expenses this year, is that a good run rate, as we look out into 2016 or some of that kind of a build-up of investments that should tail off into next year?","Karen Parkhill","The increase in those expenses are mostly headcount related and so that is something that should stick for the run rate. Small amount of consulting expenses, which depending on what happens, may or may not stick in the run rate, but it\u2019s a very small piece of it. In terms of just technology in general, we do expect to have these increased technology expenses at least over the next few years.","Terry McEvoy","And then as a follow-up, sorry to go back to energy, but did any of the reserve build or increase in criticized loans come from that $725 million portfolio that you identified, I believe last quarter?","Pete Guilfoile","I believe, you\u2019re referring to our energy related portfolio.","Terry McEvoy","Correct, yes.","Pete Guilfoile","I would say, a relatively minor piece of it came from that. The energy related portfolio is really a very broad segment and one end of the spectrum you have those life sciences companies that I spoke about earlier and then the other end of the spectrum are really refineries, which had no impact. So, most of the negative migration has really been in that technology and life sciences segment. And I think I\u2019ve noted earlier, it was quite small, about 85 million in total loan balances.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Darst with Guggenheim Securities.","David Darst","When you look at your commercial lending fees, have a higher percentage of those been generated from energy loans or is that spread out among other commercial and commercial real estate credits?","Karen Parkhill","Our commercial lending fees are spread across all of our credits, David. They did decline a little bit this quarter, mainly due to a little bit lower syndication activity and because we saw an increase in our line utilization, we had lower commitment fees.","David Darst","Is historically more of your syndication activity has been done within energy funding?","Karen Parkhill","No. Typically where we lead syndications is more on the middle market space than in the energy space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Moran with Macquarie Capital. ","John Moran","Just one more on energy. The SNC as a percentage of the energy book, I\u2019m not mistaking, was about 75% or so last quarter; is that unchanged?","Pete Guilfoile","John, it\u2019s actually higher than that; about -- it\u2019s over 90% of our energy book -- line of business book are shared national credits. And another way of looking at it is 30% of our shared national credit book is energy, which is the largest segment. ","John Moran","And the regulatory exam on that happens now twice a year, so that gives another hard look in 4Q, if I\u2019m correct?","Pete Guilfoile","The actual increase in shared national credit reviews; this really sets up in 2016. There will be a pilot that is done later in this year but it\u2019s not schedule to step up until 2016. And just to make one other comment about that, I just wanted to follow-up with that 30%. Again, the rest of our shared national credit portfolio outside of energy continues to perform it really, really well.","John Moran","I think for Karen on the HQLA build and I just want to make sure that I got the numbers right. It sounds like 500 million in five-year senior swapped at six month LIBOR plus 75 and was deployed in the 200 million five-year U.S treasuries at one and half. Would you expect the kind of 1 to 3 billion in build between now and the end of \u201816 being similar sort of assets because I think there is some banks that are going a little bit longer and getting yields kind of in the twos on some of this.","Karen Parkhill","Our focus on the securities portfolio is to maintain highly liquid, highly rated short duration securities. And particularly in this low rate environment, we are very mindful of our asset sensitive position and not prematurely altering that upside. So, if the low rate environment continues, you can expect us to continue to execute our LCR strategy in a similar fashion to what we did this past quarter. Again, how we look at our securities book will be focused on not giving up our asset sensitivity upside to prematurely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point.","Kevin Barker","I was hoping you could expand on how much of your construction and development loans are within Houston MSA or other potential areas of MSA.","Curtis Farmer","From a CRE perspective overall the Houston, if you look at Texas, Texas is about 28% of total commercial real estate for us and the Houston market makes us about 40% of that number; the rest of it would be outside of the Houston market.","Ralph Babb","Pete, you might comment on the credit performance that we\u2019ve seen.","Pete Guilfoile","The commercial real estate portfolio in Houston continues to perform really well; it\u2019s largely apartment construction portfolio. We have about 20 projects; we have five that are fully complete and in lease up and all five of them are seeing rents at or above pro forma levels. So the portfolio is performing really well.","Ralph Babb","And we tend to focus on long time customers.","Pete Guilfoile","We do. We have very strong national developers in that Houston market. And typically we have 30% to 35% cash equity in these projects; our loan to values range from 50% to 60%. So even though we haven\u2019t seen any decrease in rents yet, we do expect there could be pressure on rents as this more supply comes on line in next 18 months. But if we do, we still think our projects would be in great shape because of the structures that we have.","Ralph Babb","And also almost no office exposure at all.","Curtis Farmer","We are seeing outside of the Houston market and there are some opportunities in the rest of Texas especially in the DFW area.","Ralph Babb","Continuing to see a lot of them.","Kevin Barker","And then what percentage of your commercial real estate specifically expenses [ph] are oil or hotel -- I mean office or hotel and not necessarily construction?","Pete Guilfoile","Hotels and office are not a segment that we are actively pursuing at all. So, the portion that would be hotel would be negligible and the portion that is office would be quite small.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Hymowitz with Philadelphia Financial.","Jordan Hymowitz","I was just wondering that small energy tax portfolio; is that included in the energy prospect you mention is that separate?","Ralph Babb","Yes, I think your question was, is our energy related piece included in the energy numbers in the deck?","Jordan Hymowitz","Yes.","Karen Parkhill ","What I would say is our energy technology or TLS business is part of what we\u2019ve included in the additional approximately $725 million loans which we\u2019re calling energy related. That is not part of our energy line of business; it\u2019s really driven from some middle market, small business, technology, life sciences companies outside of our energy line of business. But at $725 million; it\u2019s not a large number.","Jordan Hymowitz","My second question is syndicated flows; they\u2019re not up to review until next year. So if there is deterioration in the energy portion of that book; will that be included in the reserves you took this quarter or it only be related to the energy flows in your book than you currently control?","Ralph Babb","Yes, it\u2019s a whole book. We\u2019re looking at our risk ratings continuously throughout the year and irrespective of that is the shared national credit exam this fall or next frame; we\u2019re going to look at them the same way.","Jordan Hymowitz","So the answer is yes then and what includes the shared national credit this reserve?","Ralph Babb","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Montgomery.","Sameer Gokhale","You talked quite a bit about the provisioning for the energy portfolio, but there is just something I would like to just clarify in terms of the mechanics because Karen you referred to slide 19 because one of the drivers of your reserves and provisions clearly is the dollar amount of loans outstanding. And we can see that there has been a decline in the size of the energy portfolio and you can see the trend as you referred to during the last down cycle. So just to make sure, I am trying -- at least think of the basics of the mechanics correctly. If you assume that that portfolio, the energy portfolio should shrink on a quarterly basis by between $200 million to $250 million a quarter, then the question becomes on what pace do criticize loans increase as the offset potentially. So that\u2019s one thing. And then the other thing would probably be what level of energy prices, oil prices you factored in. And I think you talked about it and suggested that. In your assumptions you assume that energy -- that oil prices are actually below current level. So, if my thinking is right on the mechanics of that that suggests that again borrowing an increase in criticized loans that exceeds the decline in your average -- in your loan portfolio, unless that happens and your provisioning level should actually fall going forward compared to Q2 levels. I mean am I thinking of that correctly, specifically as far as it relates to this portfolio?","Pete Guilfoile","I think we expect to happen, we expect to see continued run-off in the energy portfolio and we expect that our criticized portion of the energy portfolio will also continue to run-off. We saw that in the past quarter and we expect to see it in future quarters. It\u2019s hard for us to figure out how much of that run-off is going to offset any additional migration that we expect in the portfolio over the next quarter or two but we think that it will be significant.","Karen Parkhill","And again, we purposely aren\u2019t giving a provision outlook for next quarter or the quarter after really because it is difficult to predict.","Sameer Gokhale","And then can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the loss severity again that you assumed in this energy portfolio in your book?","Pete Guilfoile","The loss severity in terms of the portfolio, is that what you\u2019re referring to Sameer?","Sameer Gokhale","In terms of the loans where you actually took reserve additional provisions for those specific loans that were criticized and you need to provide for those, what was the loss severity you\u2019d assumed on those loans?","Pete Guilfoile","So, we have to risk rate our portfolio based on definitions of impairment and definitions of -- there is different definitions that we have to follow and they don\u2019t necessarily relate to losses that we expect in the portfolio. Again, the vast majority of our energy book are really well-secured loans. And we don\u2019t think that it will necessarily translate into credit losses that might be normally associated with a typical substandard C&I credit.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tom Hennessy with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Actually it\u2019s Mike Mayo for Tom. Just some clarification to 90% of the energy book is shared national credit and of those what percent are you lead agent on and how is the line utilization change on those credits?","Ralph Babb","We don\u2019t disclose the number of deals. I don\u2019t believe that we agent. Again, I can tell you that we\u2019re not the agent on the vast majority of them. And it goes along with our energy strategy. We want to deal with a certain segment of the energy industry and it\u2019s the segment that we feel -- it has the least risk. And we can\u2019t use our own balance sheet in the vast majority of cases to agent those kinds of deals. So that\u2019s why we are more often than not, a participant and not the agent.","Karen Parkhill","And on line utilization Mike in the energy business, our line utilization did decrease to 48% from 50% last quarter, commitments also declined.","Mike Mayo","And is that because you\u2019re reducing the access to the companies or because the custodies are drawing down less?","Pat Faubion","I think it\u2019s because these companies are operating within your cash flow and they\u2019re paying down debt appropriately.","Mike Mayo","And the catalyst for the $300 million increase in criticized loans, was that an internal review; was that regulatory; it\u2019s a combination?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, it has to do with our risk ratings and we don\u2019t distinguish between how loans get risk rated at certain way. So, it\u2019s really a reflection of fact that we have risk rated the credits we think appropriately and those are the reserves that are associated with them.","Mike Mayo","And then lastly, the buybacks, at what point would you slow or stop buyback because what you\u2019re saying? You said, you are not indicating a provision outlook for the next couple of quarters. On the one handed, if times get tougher than you expect, maybe you want to conserve capital, on the other hand, I mean regulators and industry already stress test, you are pretty vigorously and you\u2019re buying back stock after summing that stress, maybe you should just keep buying back through even a tougher cycle. Kind of what\u2019s your thought on that? And what do you think the regulators\u2019 thoughts are on that?","Ralph Babb","That\u2019s one we have to look at like we were talking about earlier. It depends what\u2019s going on at the time and we will make a decision accordingly, like we have in the past when we\u2019ve seen smooth economies and things going the right way but also things have slowed down and we need to make a decision to be more cautious about returning capital. But I would underline that we always have looked at maximizing the amount of capital that we have returned that we can\u2019t use, to our shareholders.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ralph Babb, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks.","Ralph Babb","I would just thank you all for being here today and your interest in Comerica and hope everyone has a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you again for joining us today. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect."],"6603":["Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 16, 2013  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Darlene P.

My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Persons, please go ahead.","Darlene P. Persons","Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, and welcome to Comerica's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Vice Chairman of Business Bank, Lars Anderson; and Chief Credit Officer, John Killian.","A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC's website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. As we review our first quarter results, we will be referring to the slides, which provide additional details on our earnings.","I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements and, in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause future results to vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release issued today, as well as Slide 2 of the presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our filings with the SEC.","Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures. In that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph, who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph W. Babb","Before we begin, on behalf of our colleagues, I want to extend our thoughts and prayers to the victims, their families and the entire city of Boston after the tragic events of yesterday.","Today, we reported first quarter 2013 earnings per share of $0.70 or $134 million compared to $0.68 or $130 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. Broad-based average loan growth in each of our primary geographic markets, together with tight expense controls, contributed to our increased net income in the first quarter.","Turning to Slide 4 and other highlights. Average total loans grew $498 million compared to the fourth quarter and reflected an increase of $594 million or 2% in commercial loans partially offset by a decrease of $106 million or 1% in commercial real estate loans. A $356 million decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance was more than offset by broad-based increases in other business lines, including general Middle Market, National Dealer Services, Energy, and Technology and Life Sciences. We expected a decline in Mortgage Banker Finance due to typical seasonal factors, as well as the anticipated normalization of mortgage volumes in line with declining refinance activity. We continue to add new customers and expand existing relationships, and the pipeline is strong.","Total first quarter period-end loans were down from a seasonally strong year end yet above the first quarter average, demonstrating the positive growth trend we are seeing in the portfolio. Average deposits decreased $590 million in the first quarter to $50.7 billion, primarily reflecting a decrease of $1.3 billion or 6% in noninterest-bearing deposits largely related to our Financial Services division, which provides services to title and escrow businesses. Period-end deposits did not change significantly.","Net interest income declined $8 million in the first quarter, primarily reflecting 2 fewer days in the quarter. The net interest margin increased 1 basis point, as excess liquidity declined almost $1 billion. Noninterest income decreased $4 million to $200 million, largely reflecting decreases in customer derivative income and commercial lending fees from high fourth quarter levels. Our tight expense control was reflected in the decrease in noninterest expenses of $11 million to $416 million in the first quarter, mainly due to a decrease in salaries expense.","Credit quality was stable in the first quarter, as our strong credit culture continued to be reflected in solid credit quality metrics. We had lower net charge-offs along with declining nonperforming loans. The provision for credit losses was basically unchanged from the fourth quarter 2012.","Our strong capital position is a source of strength to support our growth. We remain focused on total payout to shareholders, reflected by share repurchases and dividends, while maintaining our strong capital ratios. We repurchased 2.1 million shares in the first quarter, and combined with dividends, we returned 77% of first quarter net income to shareholders.","On March 14, we announced that the Federal Reserve had completed its 2013 capital plan review and did not object to our plan and contemplated capital distributions. Our capital plan includes up to $288 million in share repurchases for the 4-quarter period that ends in the first quarter 2014.","Turning to Slide 5 and a look at our footprint. We continue to leverage our standing as the largest U.S. commercial bank headquartered in Texas in order to generate new customer relationships and expand existing ones. Average loans in Texas in the first quarter were up 3%, surpassing a record $10 billion, and average deposits increased 2%. The Texas economy continues to be a growth leader. Overall, job creation in Texas continues to be well above the national average, supported by strong drilling activity and manufacturing conditions. The Texas economy leads the nation in job growth, adding 80,600 jobs in February, reportedly the biggest monthly gain ever and has averaged nearly 1,000 new jobs a day over the past 12 months.","California was second in job growth with 41,200 jobs added in February. We continue to be well positioned in California. The California economy is gaining momentum, particularly in Northern California, where technology companies in Silicon Valley continue to drive growth. The rate of private sector job growth in California is above the U.S. average. Housing markets there are looking firmer, even in harder-hit Southern California. Average loans in California were up 2%, while average deposits were down, reflecting declines in our California-based title and escrow business.","In Michigan, auto sales have gradually increased. We expect this trend to continue through 2013. The economic recovery in Michigan is broadening beyond the auto sector. Housing markets statewide are improving, as sales, prices and the rate of new construction all increased. Average loans and deposits in Michigan were up from the fourth quarter.","In closing, we remain focused on growing the bottom line in this low-rate environment. We are pleased with our continued loan growth, tight expense management, solid deposit base and credit performance and strong shareholder payout.","Comerica is an enduring company steeped in a long tradition of relationship banking, with outstanding customer service as our hallmark. We believe we are ready for the road ahead and have the right strategy in place to make a positive difference for our shareholders, customers and employees.","And now I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen L. Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. As Ralph mentioned, total average loan growth was $498 million, or 1% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a continued increase in commercial loans and a slowing of the decline in commercial real estate loans. In fact, the combined commercial mortgage and real estate construction average loan decreased $106 million, down from a decrease of $241 million in the fourth quarter and $344 million in the third quarter of last year. On the right-hand side, average commercial loans were up $594 million and were the main driver of our loan growth. On the top portion of the bar, Mortgage Banker Finance, which provides mortgage warehouse lines, saw average loans decline $356 million this past quarter, driven by lower refinance volume. As we have said in the past, Mortgage Banker outstandings can be volatile and should continue to generally reflect mortgage refinance volume.","As you can see, positive trends continued, with period-end loans greater than the average in the first quarter. Period-end loans were down from year end as a result of the strong seasonal growth we had going into the end of the year. In particular, Mortgage Banker was down $687 million on a period-end basis.","Loan yield, shown by the yellow diamonds, declined 6 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the expected decline in purchase loan accretion, as well as the continued mix shift of our portfolio and a decline in 30-day LIBOR of 1 basis point. Our average and period-end loan performance for the quarter was better than the industry, as evidenced by the H.8 data. We believe this is a continued reflection of our geographic footprint and expertise in many diverse industry segments.","General Middle Market average loans have increased 4 of the past 5 quarters, with a $262 million increase in the first quarter. Also, National Dealer Services grew average loans $248 million, Energy increased $151 million, and Technology and Life Sciences grew $122 million.","In our Commercial Real Estate line of business, commitments have increased for the past 5 quarters, and construction loans grew for the second consecutive quarter, up $83 million in the first quarter, as demand is improving. Total loan commitments increased $357 million as of March 31, with commitments increasing in several lines of business. While our utilization decreased to 47.7% from 49.4% at the end of the fourth quarter, the change primarily reflects the decline in Mortgage Banker usage.","Lastly, our loan pipeline increased, reflecting a solid rebuilding of the pipeline after the robust loan closing activity at the end of last year.","As shown on Slide 7, our total average deposits declined $590 million to $50.7 billion after growing for 6 consecutive quarters. In particular, average deposits declined about $700 million in our Financial Services division, which provides services to title and escrow companies. We also saw deposits decline in several of the businesses that had strong loan growth: Energy, Technology and Life Sciences, and National Dealer. We believe this reflects our expectation that deposits will decline as the economy continues to slowly improve and companies use their excess cash in their businesses.","Our average noninterest-bearing deposits declined $1.3 billion, while interest-bearing deposits increased $662 million despite the fact that we lowered deposit pricing by 1 basis point, as shown by the yellow diamonds on the slide. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 86% at March 31, down from 88% at year end.","Slide 8 provides details on our securities portfolio, which primarily consists of highly liquid, highly rated, mortgage-backed securities. The MBS portfolio averaged about $9.6 billion (sic) [$9.8 billion] in the first quarter. We continue to reinvest prepayments, which were about $900 million in the first quarter. The yield, shown in the yellow diamonds, declined as a result of purchases of securities, with rates in the 1.5% to 1.7% range. We expect prepayments of approximately $750 million to $850 million in the second quarter, assuming rates remain at current levels. There was no accelerated amortization -- premium amortization recognized in the quarter.","At March 31, the remaining net unamortized premium was about $85 million or under 1% of the portfolio balance. The average duration on the portfolio remains low at 3.4 years. We will continue to manage our securities portfolio dynamically, taking into account loan and deposit trends, along with the current rate opportunities and the unappetizing reality of holding securities at these low rates over the longer term.","Turning to Slide 9. Our net interest income declined $8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to 2 fewer days in the quarter, which had a $7 million impact. Our net interest margin increased 1 basis point.","We've summarized in the table on the right the major moving pieces in the first quarter. Loan growth contributed $4 million to net interest income and helped offset the impact of lower accretion and the continued low-rate environment. While we remain focused on holding spreads for new and renewed credit facilities, there are still several mix shift dynamics impacting the loan portfolio, including high-yielding commercial mortgage loans being replaced by lower-yielding C&I loans, older fixed-rate loans maturing, as well as positive credit migration. All of these factors combined had a $2 million or 1 basis point impact on the net interest margin, which has been trending down over the past couple of quarters, indicative of the slowing of the impact.","Also, approximately 85% of our loans are floating rate, of which 75% are LIBOR-based, predominantly 30-day LIBOR. Average 30-day LIBOR declined 1 basis point in the first quarter and had a $1 million or 1 basis point impact on the margin.","Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio contributed $11 million, which was a decline of $2 million in the quarter or 1 basis point on the margin. We have about $46 million of total accretion remaining to be realized on the acquired portfolio. Accretion should continue to trend downward each quarter, and we expect to recognize accretion at the upper end of the range we previously communicated of about $20 million to $30 million in 2013. In aggregate, total loan-related items had only $1 million or 3 basis point negative impact on the margin.","Dynamics in the securities portfolio, including prepayments being reinvested at lower rates, as well as lower average balance, had a $2 million or 1 basis point negative impact. Lower deposit costs added $2 million and provided a 1 basis point increase to the margin. And finally, average excess liquidity decreased almost $1 billion, increasing the net interest margin by 4 basis points.","Our asset-sensitive balance sheet remains well positioned for rising rates. Based on our historical experience and asset liability model, we believe a 200 basis point annual increase in rate, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result in an increase in net interest income between $175 million and $185 million.","Turning to the credit picture on Slide 10. Credit quality continued to be strong in the first quarter. As you can see by the yellow diamonds, net charge-offs decreased to 21 basis points of average loans or $24 million. The chart on the right shows our watch list loans were stable, increasing modestly by $22 million to $3.1 billion or 7% of total loans. While our nonperforming loans decreased $26 million.","Our provision for credit losses of $16 million was unchanged from the fourth quarter. With the decline in nonperforming loans, the allowance to NPLs increased to 120%. In addition, the average carrying value of our nonaccrual loans is about 55%, and the $617 million allowance is now over 6x the annualized first quarter net charge-offs.","Slide 11 outlines noninterest income. First quarter customer-driven fees decreased from high fourth quarter levels, including commercial lending fees, which were down $4 million, following robust year-end closing activity. Customer derivative income, which is included in other noninterest income, declined $5 million from an elevated level in the fourth quarter, as well as from impact given new regulation, which prescribes the size and types of customers with whom derivatives can be transacted and requires full reporting of each customer trade. A $3 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts was a result of seasonal service charges, partially offset by higher earnings credit earned on higher deposit balances around year end. Noncustomer-related categories increased $2 million to $16 million, primarily due to a $2 million increase in deferred compensation asset return, which was completely offset in noninterest expense.","Turning to Slide 12. We continue to maintain tight expense control, which resulted in an $11 million decrease in expenses in the first quarter. Salaries decreased $8 million and reflected a $3 million impact from 2 fewer days in the quarter and a $4 million decline in severance, partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation asset return, which, as I mentioned, is completely offset in noninterest income.","In addition, employee benefits increased $4 million, mainly due to higher pension expense. While occupancy, restructuring and other real estate expenses declined a total of $7 million in the first quarter.","We continue to carefully manage our workforce, which has decreased 3% over the past year, as shown on the bottom chart on the slide.","Moving to Slide 13 and capital. In the first quarter, we completed our 2012 capital plan with the repurchase of 2.1 million shares under our share repurchase program. Combined with dividends paid, we returned 77% of net income to shareholders in the first quarter. Shares repurchased were partially offset by about 700,000 shares from options exercised, as well as employee grants that primarily occur in the first quarter. As Ralph mentioned, the Federal Reserve completed its review and did not object to Comerica's 2013 capital plan last month. The plan includes up to $288 million in stock repurchase for the 4-quarter period ending March 31, 2014. We believe our shareholder payout, which is one of the highest among our peers, is a reflection of our strong capital position, with a 10.4% Tier 1 common capital ratio and an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio of 9.4% on a fully phased-in basis.","Finally, turning to Slide 14 and our outlook. Our expectations for full year 2013 compared to full year 2012 remains unchanged from what we outlined on our call in January, with the exception of noninterest income. We are now expecting noninterest income to be relatively stable year-over-year. Our success with cross-sell initiatives and selective pricing adjustments is expected to be partially offset by greater-than-anticipated regulatory pressure on certain products, such as customer derivatives. The outlook does not include noncustomer-driven income, as it's difficult to predict.","I'd like to remind you that our outlook for expenses is that they will decrease from the full year 2012 level even after you remove restructuring expenses, which totaled $35 million last year and are now complete.","In this slow-growing economy, we will continue to focus on the things we can control: allocating resources to our faster growing markets and industry segments, driving cross-sell opportunities and carefully managing expenses.","In closing, we are pleased with our continued loan growth, tight expense management, solid deposit base and credit performance and strong shareholder payout, and we remain keenly focused on delivering a growing bottom line. Now we are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to start, with net interest income now down $20 million or so year-over-year, I guess the guidance for lower spread revenue is really a function just of the starting point. My question is, with the Sterling accretion and premium amortization both looking like they're going to be less of a headwind in coming quarters, do you see yourself in a position to grow net interest income through the year from this first quarter level?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Steve, on net interest income, we are not changing our overall guidance for the year, which is that we expect net interest income to be lower year-over-year due in part to the fact that we had $71 million of accretion last year and we are expecting $20 million to $30 million of accretion this year. We do see a continued impact of the low-rate environment, and we are focused on having loan growth offset that impact. We are seeing some positive trends this quarter but too early to call the rest of the year.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But Karen, if the Sterling accretion should decline, right, in the coming quarters given where we were relative to the full year outlook and I think you're saying that the prepayments on the MBS book will be lower, too, so would you at least agree that the headwinds should lessen over the next couple of quarters?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, that is true that the Sterling accretion will decline each quarter. Very difficult to talk about the premium amortization on the securities portfolio because that's dependent on things outside of our control. But yes, we are seeing a general slowing of the headwinds.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then on the expenses, the headcount continues to grind lower. How much lower can you push that? Can you give us some color on which areas you're still finding opportunity to reduce headcount?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. We are very focused on managing expenses, as you know. Our outlook for the year was lower based on the impact of no restructuring costs this year, as well as taking those expenses down further. Some of what you're seeing on the expenses, though, are the focus on efficiencies that we had last year that will impact us from a full year run rate this year. And you're starting to see that in the first quarter.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But should we continue to expect headcount to go -- to decline this year? Is that what you're budgeting?","Karen L. Parkhill","We are focused on managing our headcount appropriately and continuing to find efficiencies. I won't discuss what our headcount budget is going forward, but we are continuing to find efficiencies. That said, we did have a strong quarter this year on expenses, and there were some expenses like 2 less days in the quarter that impacted us positively this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Scinicariello with UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, just a couple of quick ones on some of the loan growth trends. And I know you had a little bit of dip in the period-end balance. This quarter, just kind of wondering maybe what were some of those kind of puts and takes on those drivers. And then as you look forward, you still expect to see good growth going forward. How much of the new pipeline is still coming from new customers, firstly? And then secondly, do you feel that you'll be able to kind of reverse the slowing pace of decline in CRE and actually grow that by year end?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, I'd be glad to take that. I think that's actually a really good story. As I think Karen covered with you, we had very diverse growth for the first quarter. There was no kind of home run in there. It's general Middle Market. It was Dealer, our Technology and Life Sciences. We did overcome some of that mortgage banking finance back up there of just over $350 million, but we also saw growth, Stephen, in health and in Environmental Services. Our Small Business portfolio actually stabilized, which was, I think, a real positive, up very moderately. And our Wealth Management business, it grew on record referrals between the commercial bank and to Wealth Management. So I think all of those businesses, if you think about it on a go-forward basis, I think are all positioned to grow in the future quarters, and that's where we've been reallocating some resources. Specifically, to your point about Commercial Real Estate, it was a big quarter for us. While we did see the averages on a linked quarter decline, you did see the end-of-period balances rise, and that was very positive. And that was on the back of residential single-family construction and multifamily construction in our portfolio, as well as mini perm growth in our multifamily. And that, again, is very consistent in our big-growth markets, urban markets in Texas and California. So I can't put my finger on one particular thing, and I think that's one of the strengths. We're getting the growth across all our core markets and across a number of our businesses.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That sounds great. And then, is about 2\/3 of that pipeline still coming from new customers overall?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, it is about 2\/3, though, one thing I'd point out is when you look at a pipeline of new versus -- new to new versus new to existing, kind of the pull-through on that pipeline tends to be very much higher on your new to existing, so I wouldn't exactly use that as a proxy of how we're going to get all of our growth. But it looks very healthy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you give us a little bit of color on line utilization? What was the line utilization change if you exclude the mortgage warehouse for the quarter?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, absolutely. Yes. So we did see, as you may recall in the fourth quarter, we saw line utilization run up. That's an end-of-period calculation, but we saw that reverse end of period to the end of the first quarter. And that number did back down. It was down about 170 basis points. But frankly, if you look at the change in the end-of-period mortgage banking finance, that was down $686 million. So that represented almost 70% of the decline. Really, the balance of it was Technology and Life Sciences, and that was down just, frankly, to a few capital call facilities. They were paid down at the end of the year. And that's just normal kind of movement. So I would characterize line utilizations for the bank as really stable.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. So -- and then you might have already mentioned it, but just in terms of what type of demand you're seeing on the Commercial Real Estate front, can you talk about what you're seeing there in terms of the drawdowns on some of the lines related to projects there?","Lars C. Anderson","Right, yes. So over the past year, I've been sharing with you all how much we've been doing in terms of closing volumes in Commercial Real Estate, but I've also pointed out that these are very, very well-capitalized projects, and a lot of equity has been plowed into these projects ahead of the senior debt that we're putting in. We're beginning to see that line utilization hit. We're beginning to see these projects get funded with some of our dollars, which, I think, is very positive. And then, we're seeing a number of them roll out into mini perms, which, of course, are fully funded facilities, which is very positive. Those may stay with us for 6 months. They may stay with us for 3 years because the extra strategies, of course, on those is either to refinance them to the perm market, to redevelop on them to broader projects if they have adjacent property kind of available or to sell the project. And frankly, as cap rates have moved around, we see the -- our developers have wavering kind of volumes going to the permanent market, which impacts some of those outstandings.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. Then lastly, just on the margin, Karen. I know you don't really give too much guidance here, but just given the benefit you saw from excess liquidity starting to come off and seems like you're seeing some bottoming here on the downside risk to the securities book and then the abating Sterling accretion, is it fair to assume that we are likely to bump -- to bounce around a bottom here in terms of the margin without significant incremental downside?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. John, the big wild card there is excess liquidity and where that goes. But we do see a slowing of the other impacts of the trends. I won't predict margin, obviously, because I can't, but the big wild card is excess liquidity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is actually Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. I just have a couple of quick questions. So C&I, we've heard from, I guess, a couple of your competitors that the rates are getting very competitive in that segment. Can you talk a little bit about that, what you're seeing?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Sure. I would say we haven't really seen a significant change from, say, the last quarter, which I had characterized as, I think I used the term, a fistfight every day out there in the marketplace. It is very, very competitive. It used to be that the California markets were the most competitive for us, but it's really leached into, I think, the Midwest, into Michigan, into Texas and, frankly, into a lot of the other businesses. So it just means you got to be better than ever, spending more time with your customers and prospects, developing deeper, deeper relationships than ever before. And that's really what we're focused on. But I have not yet seen any relief there in terms of how competitive the pricing is. There are particular segments, though, that I would point out where it may be exceptionally aggressive. And in those cases, we've made a very conscious decision to stay very focused on our relationship-pricing approach. And frankly, if it moves outside of our pricing envelope or our risk envelope, if covenants and structure begins to fall away, that's okay. It's one of the strengths of Comerica, is we've got great markets. We got a lot of diverse businesses we're in. And we're not so big that we can't be nimble to reallocate those resources and find the growth where we can. We're up $3.3 billion in commercial loans; in the last year, over 13%. And so I think we've proven we've been able to kind of adapt to that competitive market.","Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up. I think last quarter on the call, you guys were talking about how you viewed, I guess, loan rates overall as relatively stable on outside of accretable yield. Do you still feel that's the case?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, I think loan rates are stable at a pretty darn aggressive level, yes.","Karen L. Parkhill","But I'd like -- on the overall portfolio, though, we are continuing to see a declining yields based on the overall portfolio mix shift. So while absolute loan rates are stable to customers, there is an impact on the portfolio.","Lars C. Anderson","And maybe just additional follow-up to Karen's point, one of the things we really focus on is the loan spreads. We got to make sure that we're covering our cost to capital; it's risk adjusted. And if I look back in our commercial businesses here for the last 5 consecutive quarters, our loan spreads have held. And so I just think, again, it's evidence of our discipline and, frankly, trying to find the opportunities in the market where we can in industries and markets that we understand and know.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Robert Placet from Matt's team. Just first, in terms of your outlook for fee revenues being flat in 2013 year-over-year, this implies some modest upside from the $200 million 1Q level, so I guess I was curious if you could just talk to some of the biggest growth opportunities in fees from here.","Ralph W. Babb","Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure. We are very focused, as we've talked about in the past, on fee growth and on increased collaboration across our lines of business around driving that fee growth. So really, it's being driven by the keen focus that we've got on it and increased collaboration. And Lars, I don't know if you'd want to add anything.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. No, I think you made the point well. There is certainly a heightened focus and -- but it plays to our strengths. I mean, we've been a relationship-oriented bank for a very, very long period of time. It's how we've earned premium and how we've built long and enduring customer relationships. So I just think this is one of those challenges in the road, as we have some headwinds and some of the capital markets areas that Karen touched on and it creates maybe some -- just some challenges there. But frankly, we've made some investments into our card programs, Direct Express. We're one of the largest issuers of commercial cards for travel, entertainment programs in the country. It's great to see our fiduciary income in wealth begin to really get some lift. We got some great things going on there in asset management. So I look at treasury management. We've continued to make product investments there, and I think all of those create a very attractive long-term value proposition for Comerica.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, looking on Slide 8, the duration of your securities portfolio increased again this quarter to 3.4 years, up from 3 years last quarter, I believe. I was just curious if you could speak to that increase and if you've changed your strategy at all in terms of what you're buying there.","Karen L. Parkhill","Our strategy on what we're buying has not changed. Keep in mind the duration each quarter on our portfolio is the factor of what is rolling off, as well as what is rolling on. We continue to manage our portfolio very conservatively. What I would add is that when we look at an extension risk of an up 200 basis points scenario, a shock to the yield curve, you'll see that the maturity for the portfolio has not changed quarter-over-quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was hoping you could help us understand a little bit more on the deposits. With total or average total deposits being down -- but you obviously, highlighted the period end was flat -- what does this imply for excess liquidity going forward? And how much visibility do you have in the sort of deposit inflows and outflows of the escrow business?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. On excess liquidity, that's obviously managed fluidly, and you're right, Ken, it's the factor of both deposit and some growth. We'd much rather have -- be invested in loans than we would in deposits at the Fed. So as we see loan growth and as deposits fluctuate, that excess liquidity will move around. I don't know if that answers your question.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe a different question. If deposit balances were flat period end versus period end, should we see an increase in excess liquidity in the second quarter versus first?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Excess liquidity is a factor of both loans and deposits, so should we see it flat, it really depends on overall loan growth. But ideally, we would like to see excess liquidity coming down and being invested in loan growth.","Ralph W. Babb","I think one of the positive things we saw, too, was in the businesses that grew, that Lars was talking about earlier, we started to see deposits go down, which tends to be a signal that they're starting to invest in the short term. Now that may not be long term. It's more for current demand, I believe, because everybody's being very cautious. But that's a positive signal from that standpoint. The other one is our title escrow business can go up and down as we've seen a lot depending on what home sales are or refinancing is in any one quarter, which will drive that excess liquidity up or down as well.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick question, in terms of the customer-driven noninterest income, that, I guess, used to be up and now it should be stable. Seemed like the rationale was just increased regulatory scrutiny, I suppose. Was there anything specific that changed it? Or is this just kind of your general feeling about the regulatory environment has changed?","Karen L. Parkhill","It's our focus on going forward. We're seeing an impact currently and seeing -- thinking that, that is likely to persist, particularly on our derivative income, where the new regulation dictates the size and type of customers where -- who we can transact derivatives with, as well as requires full reporting of each trade. And because of that new regulation, we are seeing an impact and expecting that to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Ebrahim on in behalf of Erika. I just [indiscernible].","Karen L. Parkhill","Erika?","Ralph W. Babb","We can't hear you.","Operator","The question has been withdrawn. Your next question comes from the line Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you can just expand a little bit on the, just the Mortgage Banker business, understanding the seasonality and understanding your point about pipelines being strong. Can you just again remind us about how balances tend to track either applications or originations?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Sure. So we provide -- just as little backdrop, we provide warehouse financing, working capital financing that bridges the difference between the time when a mortgage loan is originated and when an investor buys that or a pool of mortgage loans. That's simply what we do. So we are subject to see variations in those lines of credit, as mortgage application volumes rise or fall, typically driven by interest rates. Frankly, that has a lot to do with it. We have, throughout the year, shared with you, though, we have seen some variation that's been the results of investor constraints, their ability to, frankly, purchase enough of the volumes that have been held on those warehouse lines. So that has given us maybe a little bit higher levels than we otherwise would have realized throughout the year. So I would watch mortgage rates. For us, we actually have significantly changed the blend from about 70-30 refi to purchase, and we finished up this particular quarter at about 50-50 purchase versus refi, which is a pretty dramatic change, and I think it's a very positive one. It reflects on the improvement in the national housing economy and, frankly, the fact that the -- our mortgage customers are very active out there on the purchase market, working closely with Realtors. We also have a number of very tight relationships with some large national homebuilders that are feeding us a lot of purchase volumes. So fortunately, the results of that plus the fact that we have a very strong pipeline, we're bringing in new mortgage companies every single month. I do think that the more granular the broader base of customers in this business is creating a bit of a insulation on the downside. As maybe we do see a reduction in mortgage volumes. It's going to be spread over a lot more customers at Comerica.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And in that business, can you give us an idea of what the average yield is on the Mortgage Banker book versus the 3\/31 of the whole commercial book?","Lars C. Anderson","Well, unless it's in the earnings deck broken out, I don't think is -- I really can't do that. But what I would tell you is this. It is a very attractive business. It has some of the highest cross-sell we've got. 90% plus of our customers have treasury management products with us, which I think is a good lead indicator of who their lead bank is and lender. And frankly, I would tell you this is a very attractive business to us. This is subject to that same disciplined relationship pricing model, and we get returns that are very attractive to our shareholders.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last question just on efficiency ratio, Karen, it's been around 68% for a few quarters now, and I'm just wondering -- I know you have that long, long terms under 60 with higher rates and heard your comments about what rates mean for NII still, but versus where we still currently are at 68%, can you make progress on the efficiency ratio from here without rates going up?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, thanks for your question. Our efficiency ratio, while it has been rounding to 68% quarter-over-quarter, if you look outside of the rounding, it has been trending down appropriately. We did lay out, as you may recall, our long-term target to be under 60% last year, and we talked about what it takes to get there. It takes loan growth, fee growth, expense management and a bit of a rate uptick from where we are today. So we're tracking on all of those first 3 things, and we can move the needle without rate. But to ultimately reach our goal, we will need a slightly higher rate environment but clearly not a normal rate environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Ebrahim in behalf of Erika. Yes, apologize for that previously. I just wanted to follow up on your comments in the question on deposits and excess liquidity means. Thanks, Karen, for providing color in terms of the potential for deposits probably trending lower as the economy picks up and businesses draw down on balances. So should we sort of expect that if that were the case, we should see a steady decline in securities portfolio, both in absolute dollar terms and in terms of the percentage of earning assets going forward?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, thanks for the question. On the securities portfolio, just like excess deposit, we would much rather be invested in loans. So yes, as we see deposit potentially be used for customer use rather than sitting on our balance sheet and loan growth, we would expect to not only have our excess liquidity decline but have our securities portfolio decline as well.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got that. And I guess one last question just in terms of should we -- you guys haven't made any comments about the dividend post the stress test. Should we anticipate a potential similar increase in the second quarter like last year or...","Karen L. Parkhill","On dividends, we did increase our dividend in January last year from $0.15 to $0.17. That was part of the 2012 capital plan.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. But as part of the 2013 capital plan, could there be potentially another dividend increase in the second or third quarter of this year?","Ralph W. Babb","The review of dividends is really the purview of the board, and they will look at the dividends as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","I understand the Fed recently, about 3 weeks ago, put out new guidance on the leveraged loans, and I believe it was really unchanged since the initial proposals a year ago. But I'm curious of what the impact of those, that new guidance is. And then also secondarily, if you have any comments on maybe what today's environment is relative to the '06, '07 time frame?","Ralph W. Babb","Okay. John?","John M. Killian","Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. We've been working on this new definition for sometime along with everybody else in the industry as well. It is different than prior guidance. So we're all learning how to apply it as we go forward. Frankly, it's just too early to tell what the overall impact would be, but we think the rule is a reasonable one, and we will certainly comply going forward.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","And how is this -- maybe if you could give us some color on the environment today relative to, say, the '06, '07 time frame for levered loans, like the lending environment?","John M. Killian","I think it would be fair to say in '06, '07 given the rather frothy state of the economy at that time, there were certainly more of those opportunities in the marketplace. We are seeing an increased level, certainly increased from the depths of the recession of late. So I suspect we will continue to see more of those as the economy continues to improve. We are maintaining our disciplines, our credit policies and considering them on a case-by-case basis. We are able to do some of those loans and some, frankly, we are not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford Bernstein.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on noninterest-bearing deposits and sensitivity and dynamics there. Could you tell us -- embedded in your sensitivity to that 200 basis point rise in rates, which is about a 10% increase in net interest income, what are you assuming that -- what are you seeing around the noninterest-bearing deposit dynamics in that simulation?","Ralph W. Babb","Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","In that simulation, we do expect deposits to decline, as the economy improves and as customers, hopefully, are using their deposits to grow their businesses.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Could you quantify that or...","Karen L. Parkhill","No, we have not quantified it because it's a range analysis. It is based on history and is based on some of our thoughts around our large deposits that we currently have on the books.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Sterne Agee.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Wanted to maybe get an update, Ralph, if you could, on M&A and if you're seeing any increased activity in terms of people looking to pair up with you and maybe your appetite for acquisitions in the next couple of quarters.","Ralph W. Babb","As I've said in the past, from an appetite standpoint, we are very comfortable with our footprint today. And when you look at the numbers and especially the loan growth that we're seeing in the Texas and California markets, as well as the Michigan markets, we have a very good position in the urban markets that we're focused on. That means our list of strategic opportunities is shorter than it was. I won't say that it -- there aren't those that don't exist out there today that we would have an interest in. I think overall what you're seeing is a slowness in the M&A market, primarily due to some of the uncertainties in the capital requirements, and people are focusing on being conservative at the time until they get a better feel for where they can go from a leverage standpoint.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, I just wanted to follow up on some comments about expenses. I was hoping to get maybe a little more color around just the kind of the branch network and what kind of changes you might be making to your branch profile, whether in Texas, in California or also in Michigan?","Ralph W. Babb","Well, I think if you remember our strategy has been not -- we're not a mass market retail bank. We put our banking centers in locations that not only provide retail access but wealth access, small business, middle market, and that's been very important for us. Therefore, we don't have the footprint that many do that are dealing with the current issues. We are constantly looking at our model and bringing our model from -- and what I mean by model is the size of a banking center, and that size has been coming down for a period of time now as we look for new areas to open. So it's very much a point of being in branding and being in the right places for the types of businesses that we have and that we do. And we want multiple access in -- for multiple businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked. Just a couple of quick questions on expenses first. Other than the 2 days, were there any other seasonal increases in the expense base related to payroll taxes? And second, what were litigation costs in the quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. On increases, we said when we gave the outlook that we did expect increases for the year on things like pension and payroll, which shows up in employee benefits. And so you're seeing that in the first quarter, and that should continue throughout the year. On legal expenses, that was down, but that can be volatile.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Levin with Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe you could talk about on the loan growth front, when you talk to your customers, what are you hearing from your customers today versus their confidence and their outlook for their businesses in the broader economy versus what you might have been hearing a few months ago?","Ralph W. Babb","I think, today, we are hearing continued caution. People are making good money, as I would describe it, and especially in the businesses that Lars went over earlier. But they're being cautious. They're not investing for the same term that they would have invested for in the past. They're really investing to meet current demand. Lars, you want to add anything to that?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. No, I think you hit it well. I think there's still a very much of a guarded kind of position relative to making any significant investments. It's, I'd say, a reserved atmosphere and, clearly, I think if you look at the first quarter of the year, it was very quiet economically. And I think that was a reflection of continued uncertainty from our customers and our prospects.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, when you think about the percentage of your business that comes from Midwest now versus the percentage of your business that comes from Texas and California, are you happy with where it is now? Or do you want to continue to see a shift away from the Midwest to Texas and California? How should we think about that from a longer-term perspective?","Ralph W. Babb","Well, the Midwest is a very important market for us and has been and will continue to be. And as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, the Michigan economy is coming back. The growth profile of Texas and California, as we've mentioned in the past, is beginning to accelerate. And now we have a good balance of markets, which was one of the key strategies was to be balanced. And when you look at that today, we're getting close to being almost 1\/3 in each market. California market and the Michigan market are very close to being equal today. And as I mentioned earlier, we passed $10 million in the Texas markets, so it's about $3 billion-plus behind in the loan book, I believe, and is growing quite well. So the strategy for us is working well to balance out the geographic markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. First of all, in terms of the yield on the residential mortgage portfolio, that actually seemed to increase about 15 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And I guess if you haven't already mentioned this, I'm just curious as to what the driver of that increase was and if that's potentially sustainable.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, that -- the increase is really driven by fourth quarter significant decrease really around changing NALs in that portfolio.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So on a go-forward basis, we should think about the 4.39% number as a reasonable starting point for the next couple of quarters?","Karen L. Parkhill","I think that's a reasonable starting point. Obviously, it's a small portfolio, and it can be impacted by small swings.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Sure. And I guess, just following up on your comments about the fee revenue guidance, I noticed -- and maybe I'm mixing issues here, but it looks like in the Wealth Management business, profitability in that business over the past year has actually risen quite visibly on a percentage basis largely due to credit improvement but not much revenue improvement. Does the commentary that you're talking about relative to fee revenue have much to do with Wealth Management? And if not, how do you intend to grow that revenue?","Karen L. Parkhill","Actually, in Wealth Management our fees have been increasing nicely. You'll see a line item for fiduciary fees, which is our Wealth Management business, and you'll see that increasing nicely. One of the impacts on the overall or the key impact on the overall revenue for our segment reporting or our line of business reporting is the funds transfer pricing that we have internally on our deposits and our loans. So -- but on a fee basis, I would point to the fact that fees are actually increasing in the Wealth business.","Ralph W. Babb","And I would add to that and as Lars speaks to a lot and Curt does as well that the interplay between our major businesses and the cross-sell and the teamwork is -- has risen a lot, and that has been a real plus for the organization because we're seeing good growth in those fee-based areas. Lars, you have anything to add to that?","Lars C. Anderson","No, Ralph, I think you hit it well. I think it's one of our best growth opportunities for noninterest income for our company. We have, as you know, a very rich Middle Market book of business that, frankly, I think that we can achieve much higher cross-sell rates into the partners, principals, owners, executives of these companies as we have a go-forward basis. And Curt and I are working closely together with some very talented Wealth Management colleagues with the right kinds of products for advisory fiduciary. I think we're very well positioned to drive that in the future.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just a follow-up on that, have you put out any guidance in terms of what you hope that growth rate might be relative to the overall revenue growth rate of the company?","Ralph W. Babb","We have not.","Lars C. Anderson","No. No, we have not, but I would assure you that the leadership in our commercial businesses have this on their scorecard. They have it in their annual review. And this is a very, very important part of their future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with the G.A. Davidson (sic) [D.A. Davidson].","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of questions, just to go back to the escrow and deposit -- excuse me, escrow and title deposit business. Can you give us an idea of what your balances are in that business and maybe you highlight the end-of-period trend from 12\/31 to March 31?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, let me just find the exact balances. Karen, you...","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, I'm looking.","Lars C. Anderson","Okay, let's see.","Karen L. Parkhill","So our deposit balances in our FSD business are around -- and then they can fluctuate, but average for the quarter was around, fourth quarter, yes, a little over $3 billion.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, so...","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Sorry, that was average for the first quarter, Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. And I -- to characterize maybe that a little bit, there are -- quarter-to-quarter, you may not see as much variation, but it kind of comes in waves, and I think as Ralph referenced earlier, it does -- there is some correlation to the mortgage markets, the amount of closings, activities that are going on. But I would also tell you that some of the variation that we see in that businesses is as we bring in new customers. This has been a growth business for us, and as we bring those relationships in, some of them bring substantial deposits with us. And I would leave you with one last point there: We are very focused on ensuring that this cost to deposits are very rational relative to our company needs.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And you gave us, in the press release, the average balances for title escrow, the average numbers from fourth quarter to first quarter, just hoping to get a sense of how big is basically entire finance -- how much of that $3 billion of Financial Services division would be escrow and title?","Lars C. Anderson","I would be guessing to give you the exact number, but it would be a significant part of those deposits. We do have a few other types of companies that we work with. I'll give you an example, large law firms, some institutional deposits that we go to work for them, but that would be the biggest driver of our deposit base.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then on the construction portfolio, you've highlighted single family and multifamily. Can you give just any sense of pockets of particular strength where you're lending into or where demand has gotten particularly stronger?","Lars C. Anderson","Okay. I missed one word in there. Could you repeat that?","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I was just -- on the construction segment, you talked about growth there in single-family residential, as well as multifamily, just wondering if you could give some sense as to any pockets of strength geographically and where you guys are particularly focused on putting your money to work.","Lars C. Anderson","Right, right, okay. So that hasn't changed. We're very focused on the Texas and the California markets, the urban markets, the Houstons and Austins. And as you look at the Dallas-Fort Worth area, very rich. If you look at the, really, San Francisco, Northern Cal Bay Area, very interesting, Silicon Valley, as well as even in Southern Cal. So depending upon what the asset class is depends upon what we're active in. For example, there's less activity in Southern Cal in single family. There's a lot of activity in Northern Cal, but we're starting to see pickup in the industrial class in Southern Cal, which I think is a real positive. You're seeing multiple classes of assets in Northern Cal. Activity levels pick up, but it's still dominated by multifamily. If you look at Texas, again, dominated by multifamily. But again, we're seeing broader asset classes become very interested -- interesting to us. One thing that has not changed is we're very focused on primarily doing business with developers that have gone through the cycle with, that have followed through on doing what they said they were going to do. And we did for them the same things where we developed very strong relationships. They're well-capitalized projects. And frankly, I'm very encouraged. If you just look at those end-of-period numbers, I think that, that bodes well for us for this line of business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with Art Capital (sic) [RBC Capital].","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jon Arfstrom, RBC. Just a couple of quick ones. The Midwest, you've touched on it, but it's the first time in a long time, and it looks like you had upped loans sequentially. I'm just curious if there's anything specific there or if you feel like it's broad based and it's likely hit the bottom in terms of loan balances.","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. So, obviously, we were very pleased to see that kind of growth. It was our leading state, actually, in growth in terms of balances, so that was very positive. It was driven really primarily by 2 categories: general Middle Market, so you would guess that a good amount of that would be driven by the automotive recovery, suppliers and such middle market companies there that draw -- drew on their facilities but also began to make some investments; and then our dealer business. Our dealer business in, frankly, Michigan and the Midwest has really picked up, and I think that, that's a real positive for us. So is this -- did we hit bottom, was, I think, part of your question. Very difficult to tell, but I think it was a great step in the right direction and speaks to the health in the improving Michigan economy.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Karen, a quick one for you. Any art to the buyback pace? Or is it just -- my caveman math says you take the current pace and multiply it by 4, and that exhausts what you've got for the next 4 quarters? Is that fair?","Karen L. Parkhill","That is fair. We are -- we try to be in the market every day that we can. We don't pretend to be soothsayers on the market or try to market time. So I think your comment is fair.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Joe Stieven with Stieven Capital.","Joseph Albert Stieven - Stieven Capital Advisors, L.P.","Ralph, mine sort of follows up on Jon Arfstrom's comments. When you look at your capital, which is great and your asset quality is great, what do you feel? And so I'm not asking for a prediction, but what do you feel is the right level of capital, that tangible common basis that you need to run your business sort of in a -- in the new world order? That's question number one. And then question number two is how much flexibility do you have in your stress test CCAR submissions to -- because even now, you guys are paying out one of the highest ratios of everybody, but your capital is still building and growing? So do you have the ability just sort of go back and say, yes, we're still building capital. We don't want to -- maybe buy a little bit more before next year? Or is it still just like going up to the great Wizard of Oz and getting your blessing? So that's it.","Ralph W. Babb","Okay, thank you. Well, I think the answer to your question there is the uncertainty that's out there. As you've seen, there are a number of different focuses on what is the right capital structure, including Basel III. There's been other suggestions put forth. And until we understand exactly what those rules are, I think it's premature to estimate what it may be for us on the longer term. Historically, as well, we have always been conservative on the capital side, and I think that has held up well in the downturn that we saw. And we will certainly continue to do that as well. But until there's certainty, until the rules are adopted, I think it's too early yet to indicate where we want to be, like we have in the past, which we will do hopefully again when we know those rules and can make that decision. And we've always been very transparent as to what our focus is. Karen, do you want to add anything to that?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Just to put some color around what Ralph said, in the past you may recall that we did have a public capital range under which we operated. So our shareholders knew that, and they knew the kind of payback that we would do over and above that capital range. Once the rules are final and clear, we would like to go back to doing what we had in the past. As Ralph said, just too early right now. And on the stress test in capital plan, yes, we do come at it from a position of strength, and that is one of the reasons that our capital payout -- that our payout ratio is one of the highest amongst our peers. But each year is a different year, and we'll have a new test in a new year next year.","Operator","That was our final question, and I'd like to turn the floor back to Ralph Babb for any closing remarks.","Ralph W. Babb","Well, we appreciate everybody being on this morning, and thanks for the discussion. And I hope everyone has a good day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Darlene P. Persons","Thank you, Carmen. Good morning, and welcome to Comerica's second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Vice Chairman of the Business Bank, Lars Anderson; and Chief Credit Officer, John Killian. A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC's website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. As we review our second quarter results, we will be referring to the slides which provide additional details on our earnings.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. In that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause future results to vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement contained in this release issued today, as well as Slide 2 of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call as well as our filings with the SEC.","Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures and in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within the presentation.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ralph, who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph W. Babb","Good morning. Today, we reported second quarter 2012 earnings per share of $0.73, or $144 million, an 11% increase from the first quarter. Our results reflect our focus on the bottom line in this slow-growing national economy.","Turning to Slide #4, in further highlights, loans continued to grow with average loans up $959 million, or 2%, compared to the first quarter, primarily reflecting an increase of $1.2 billion, or 5%, in commercial loans. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of average commercial loan growth resulting in a 20% year-over-year increase, including our acquisition of Sterling Bank shares last July.","The increase in average commercial loans in the second quarter was broad-based with increases across nearly all of our businesses. Deposits continued to grow in the second quarter. We had record deposits of $49.4 billion at June 30, 2012 with an increase in average deposits of $368 million, primarily driven by an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits.","Excluding the decline in accretion, net interest income was stable. Non-interest income increased $5 million to $211 million, including a $3 million increase in customer-driven fee income. We maintained our tight control of expenses with decreases in several categories. Credit quality continued to be strong. The provision for credit losses decreased $3 million to $19 million.","Our capital position remains a source of strength to support our future growth. We repurchased 2.9 million shares under our share repurchase program in the second quarter. In April, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend 50% to $0.15 per share. The combined share buyback and dividend returned 81% of second quarter net income to shareholders.","In addition, we have reviewed the Basel III regulatory capital framework and believe that on a fully phased-in pro forma basis, we are well above the proposed capital levels.","Turning to Slide 5, in our corporate news, Comerica Bank ranked highly in the 2012 American Banker\/Reputation Institute Survey of the reputations of 30 large banks. Comerica ranks fourth overall and #1 in the categories of citizenship and governance. According to the consumer survey, Comerica had the second largest positive gain in reputation from a year ago and was 1 of only 2 banks that placed in the top 5 of nearly every survey category.","And on Slide 6, a new Census Bureau report shows the cities with the largest growth. Comerica has a presence in 9 of the top 15: Houston, San Antonio, Austin, Los Angeles, Dallas, Phoenix, San Diego, Fort Worth and San Jose. We believe population growth drives economic growth and that we are well positioned in these growing cities.","Turning to our key markets, we had 38% average loan growth year-over-year in Texas, including our acquisition of Sterling. Our growth has been broad-based with increases in almost every business line. We are also investing resources in Texas in Technology & Life Sciences, Environmental Services and Mortgage Banker Finance. In his most recent Texas Economic Activity Index, our Chief Economist, Robert Dye, stated that Texas drilling activity remains strong with the state's energy sector driving job gains. The energy and manufacturing sectors are boosting the demand for services, providing a broad basis for ongoing economic growth.","Average loans were relatively stable year-over-year in our Midwest market, which is primarily Michigan. The rate of growth in the Michigan economy has slowed into mid-2012 after being lifted by the rebounding auto industry in 2011. A softer U.S. economy through mid-year 2012 will likely dampen further gains in auto sales and production for the second half of 2012. However, with ample pent-up demand and high affordability, auto sales are expected to hold up near a 14-million unit pace this summer and that will support ongoing moderate growth in the Michigan economy.","We had average loan growth of 7% year-over-year in our Western market, which is primarily California, with increases in National Dealer Services, Global Corporate Banking, Technology & Life Sciences and Entertainment, as well as notable growth in Middle Market the last 2 quarters. Our most recent California Economic Activity Index showed an expansion in that state's economy, driven by gains in the high-tech sector, which includes many of our Technology & Life Sciences customers. However, California job growth is below the national average and state and municipal fiscal conditions remain challenging.","In summary, our loan and deposit growth, solid credit performance and tight expense management reflect our focus on the bottom line. Our capital position remains solid, and we continue to be active capital managers. Our consistent, conservative relationship-focused approach to banking is making a positive difference for us and our customers.","And now, I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen L. Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. As Ralph mentioned, total average loan growth was 2%, or $959 million, quarter-over-quarter as shown on the left-hand side of the slide. On the right-hand side, you can see commercial loans drove the increase, up 5% or $1.2 billion as a result of growth in many lines of business, including National Dealer Services, Global Corporate Banking, Middle Market Banking and Energy. The green part of the bar shows that on average, Mortgage Banker loans were essentially unchanged.","However, as in the past, there was significant variability in the balances in the quarter. In fact, in the last week of the quarter, Mortgage Banker loans grew approximately $500 million. Importantly, our commercial loan growth was partially offset by a decrease of $252 million, or 2%, in average commercial mortgage and real estate construction loans.","Turning to Slide 8. Total commitments increased for the fourth quarter in a row with a $636 million increase in the second quarter. Energy, Mortgage Banker Finance, Technology & Life Sciences and National Dealer Services contributed the largest increases. With the growth in outstandings outpacing the increase in commitments in the second quarter, our line utilization increased to 48.8%. Also, our pipeline remains strong in the second quarter with increases in many business lines and approximately 60% attributed to new business.","As shown on Slide 9, our deposits continue to grow and we're at an all-time high. Our average deposits increased $368 million quarter-over-quarter with $491 million coming from noninterest-bearing deposits. The Western market drove the increase with the largest contribution from Technology & Life Sciences and the Financial Services division. Additionally, we were pleased that we were able to lower deposit pricing by another basis point as shown by the yellow diamonds on the slide. However, as stated before, we believe we are at or very near the floor for deposit rates. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 89% on June 30.","Turning to Slide 10. Our net interest income was stable, excluding the $7 million decline in accretion of the purchased discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio. Accretion should continue to trend downward as we expect to recognize total accretion of about $25 million -- $20 million to $25 million for the remainder of the year. As you know, there are many moving pieces in net interest income.","Quarter-over-quarter, our increase in average loans provided an $8 million benefit, but was partially offset by a $4 million negative impact from lower loan yields, excluding accretion. While we remain focused on holding spreads for new and renewed credit facilities, a continued shift in our loan portfolio mix drove the yields' decrease. This was largely due to the decrease in Commercial Real Estate loans and the increase in lower-yielding, higher credit quality commercial loans.","In addition to loan volumes and yields, the mortgage-backed investment securities portfolio had a $5 million negative impact on net interest income. I'll discuss that further when we get to the next slide. It's important to reiterate the fact that a continuation of the low rate environment is not a further negative for us as the impact from falling rates has mostly already been absorbed. We continually update our interest rate sensitivity, and our current update reflects the fact that approximately 85% of our loans are floating rate, up from our previously reported level of 80%. Of our loans that are floating rates, 75% are LIBOR-based, predominantly 30-day LIBOR. Therefore, rate movement on both the short and long end of the curve should have little impact on us, given the floating rate predominance in our loan book and the relatively small size of our securities portfolio.","Importantly, our asset-sensitive balance sheet remains well positioned for rising rates. We believe a 200 basis point annual increase in rates, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result in approximately $160 million increase in net interest income. Loans with rate floors consist of less than 10% of our portfolio and therefore, will not be a major drag on revenue expansion as rates rise.","Slide 11 provides details on our securities portfolio, which primarily consists of highly liquid, highly rated mortgage-backed securities. Interest earned on this portfolio decreased $5 million, primarily a result of accelerated premium amortization of $3 million, which is faster forecasted prepaid fees on the portfolio. In addition, lower reinvestment yields and a small decrease in the size of the portfolio had a $2 million impact on the interest earned in the second quarter.","At June 30, the remaining net unamortized premium was about $115 million or just over 1% of the portfolio balance. The average duration on the portfolio remains low at 2.7 years. The average yield is 2.66%, excluding the impact from the accelerated premium amortization which equates to about 11 basis points. Our target level for the securities portfolio continues to be $9 billion, so we continue to reinvest the prepayments which were about $750 million in the second quarter.","While current reinvestment rates for 15-year MBS are in the 1.7% to 1.8% range, we do try to invest as opportunistically as possible within our parameters to maximize yield, minimize present premium and maintain a short duration. We expect that the prepayments will continue to be about $750 million to $900 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.","Turning to the credit picture on Slide 12, credit quality was strong. Net charge-offs remained relatively low at $45 million or 42 basis points of average loans. Our provision for credit losses of $19 million was a $3 million decline from the first quarter. While overall credit quality continues to improve, charge-offs are approaching normalized levels. Our watch list and non-performing loans continue to trend downward after a slight uptick in the third quarter last year, reflecting the addition of the Sterling loan portfolio. Watch list loans decreased $371 million to $3.8 billion or less than 9% of total loans. Non-performing loans decreased $109 million, and we are now at the lowest level seen since 2008. Foreclosed property remains stable and very low at $67 million.","Finally, we received the annual Shared National Credit, or SNC, exam results at the end of June. They are reflected in our results and were in line with our expectations.","Slide 13 outlines the growth in non-interest income which was $211 million, up $5 million over the first quarter. Continued growth in customer-driven fee income of $3 million resulted primarily from increased customer derivative income, which was partially offset by a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. We are seeing the success of our profit improvement revenue initiatives which are assisting us in offsetting the headwinds that resulted from regulatory reform. Other changes in non-interest income include $5 million for an annual incentive payment from our third-party credit card provider and a $3 million increase in net income from principal investing in warrants.","Finally, deferred compensation asset returns decreased $7 million in the second quarter. They are completely offset by a decrease in deferred compensation plan expense in non-interest expenses.","Turning to Slide 14. We continue to maintain good expense control. Expenses declined $16 million to $433 million. Salaries expense declined $12 million, reflecting stock grants of $5 million booked in the first quarter and $7 million in lower deferred compensation expense as mentioned previously.","In addition, annual merit increases were offset by a 2% decrease in our workforce as shown on the bottom left section of the slide. We had $8 million in restructuring costs in the second quarter related to the acquisition of Sterling which closed last July. We now expect to incur about $25 million to $30 million in merger and restructuring expenses for the remainder of 2012, primarily related to real estate optimization which will occur in the third quarter.","Our careful expense management resulted in reductions in several other categories, including a decrease of $4 million in foreclosed property expenses as well as smaller decreases in occupancy, software and equipment. Litigation and legal expenses decreased $3 million, but remained somewhat elevated due to the changes in loss estimates reflecting recent developments on certain litigation contingencies.","Moving to Slide 15, in capital, as you can see on the left side of the slide, our capital is strong and we have robust capital generation in the quarter. Therefore, we have excess capital available which we are returning to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have outlined the primary effects from the Basel III capital framework.","Last month, the Federal Reserve Bank issued a notice of proposed rulemaking related to Basel III capital standards for the United States. These rules have been published for comment and are not yet final. Proposals narrow the definition of capital, increased the minimum levels of required capital, introduced capital buffers and increased the risk weights for various asset classes. We have reviewed the proposal and even under the new stricter definition, on a fully phased-in pro forma basis, Comerica is currently estimated to exceed the standards for well-capitalized banks. It's calculated according to the proposed rules today. Our Tier 1 capital ratio is estimated to be between 9.3% and 9.4%, comfortably above the new 8.5% regulatory standard which will be phased in over the next 7 years. We continue to monitor the regulatory environment and assess its implication on capital as the rules are finalized.","Turning to shareholder payout on Slide 16, as Ralph mentioned, we repurchased 2.9 million shares under our share repurchase program in the second quarter. And when combined with the shares repurchased in the first quarter, we have completed $121 million of our $375 million capital plan. As a reminder, the Federal Reserve concluded its review of Comerica's 2012 capital plan in March. The plan provides for up to $375 million in equity repurchases for the 5-quarter period ending March 31, 2013.","In April, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 50% to $0.15 per share. The share buyback, plus the dividend, resulted in a shareholder payout of 81% of second quarter net income, above our 10-year historical average of 77% prior to the downturn.","Finally, our outlook. We have obviously benefited from good loan growth in the first half of the year. As a result, based on average loans for full year 2011, compared to full year 2012, we now expect growth of 5% to 6%, which is slightly more than we had previously guided. While our loan growth so far this year has been strong and broad-based, we have also continued to benefit from our expertise in a couple of industries which could see some variability going forward. For example, our Mortgage Banker business has grown along with the robust mortgage refinance volume. We still expect those balances to moderate over the next couple of quarters as mortgage origination volumes are forecasted to slow.","For example, the Mortgage Bankers Association is forecasting mortgage originations to fall almost 25% in the second half of the year. Also, we anticipate National Dealer Services loans will experience the normal seasonal decline as dealers reduced inventories in anticipation of the new model year. In addition, we expect Commercial Real Estate loans to continue to decline, but at a slower pace.","Finally, the current economic outlook does bear a demand for new loans, and we intend to continue to exercise [Audio Gap] relationship pricing discipline. On net interest income, we are narrowing our outlook at the higher-end of the previous range for growth of 3% to 5%. We expect that higher loan volume will continue to be offset by a decline in yields. As I mentioned earlier, securities yields have been declining and loan yields have been impacted by a mix shift in the portfolio and improved asset quality. We expect our credit expenses to decline from last year's level, albeit at a slower pace as we approach normal historical levels. And we expect credit quality trends in our portfolio to remain positive, which will be partially offset by loan growth as  the result -- and result in a continued reserve release. Therefore, we expect to see the provision and net charge-offs at or near the second quarter levels for the remainder of the year.","Our net interest income, we are revising our relatively stable outlook to 1% to 2% growth over last year's levels as we are more than offsetting the significant regulatory headwind. The non-interest expense outlook is unchanged with the expectation for it to be relatively stable, plus or minus 1% compared to last year as we continue to maintain tight control of expenses. As far as the tax rate, we expect a rate of about 26% for the full year.","With regards to our synergy expectations for the Sterling acquisition, we continue to be on course to deliver the loan and non-interest income growth we previously announced. The former Sterling footprint, which was predominantly Houston, San Antonio and Kerrville, has already seen loan growth of over 10% and we believe we are well on our way to meeting the 15% fee increase goal since the acquisition closed.","In closing, we are very pleased with our continued loan and deposit growth, increased customer fee income, tight expense management and solid credit performance. In the current interest rate economic and regulatory environment, we remain keenly focused on the bottom line.","Now, we are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Don Jon Arfstrom.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question for you on Commercial Real Estate. Karen, you talked a little bit about declining but at a slower pace. Can you give us a little more color as to what you're seeing there? It's obviously the one area of your balance sheet that continues to be a bit of a drag?","Ralph W. Babb","Can we ask Lars to comment on that. Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Right. Hey, Don, yes, let me talk about that just for a second. As we have previously shared, we do see continued moderation in those balances over the next quarter or 2 throughout the balance of the year. We're continuing to see our customer base access the long-term kind of permanent markets and move some of their assets there, and that clearly is putting some downward pressure on that portfolio. But on the flip side, I would -- I tell you I'm very encouraged as we've shared in previous calls. We've had some very nice activity, volumes that is consistent with our existing strategy which we have not changed. It's very much, Don, a footprint, urban market oriented portfolio strategy. We're working with experienced developers, many that we've gone through the crisis with and they're in very good condition. We're seeing a lot of multi-family opportunities very well capitalized in California and in Texas. So I think that we're going to begin to see the benefits of those construction loans that are very well capitalized as we head into next year, but we would expect some moderation in those balances throughout the balance of the year.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Karen, just a question for you. What are you expecting on the pace on the buyback? It looks like you still have about $250 million left. I'm just curious if something -- this is something you expect to spread over the next 3 quarters or accelerate it a bit?","Karen L. Parkhill","You should expect it to spread over the quarters. We don't claim to be market timers on anything including share repurchase, and so we are in the market every day that we can be repurchasing shares.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask, just given the strong loan growth that you did have in a couple of key businesses this quarter, I guess I thought that growth that you were implying would be a little stronger going forward and I realize you're concerned somewhat about the mortgage warehouse possibly having some decline. Are you seeing -- I guess, the number that you gave last quarter on commitments to commit, can you give us that? I missed it if you gave it. And then just can you talk maybe more about the pipeline in terms of the Middle Market, large corporate, et cetera?","Ralph W. Babb","Sure. Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, I'd be glad to take that, Ralph. Hey, Brett, first of all, I don't believe in the prior quarter we shared the commitments to commit. We did give a little bit of guidance into our overall commitments, which through this past quarter, it was the fourth consecutive quarter of commitment increases, up $636 million. So I think that was really good. That was building on about $1 billion of expansion in our 2 overall commitments in the first quarter. For this quarter, it was really driven by Dealer, Energy, TLS, MBF and a number of businesses. The overall, though, as we look at the balance of the year, the loan growth opportunities for us, yes, we see we were up in commercial loans $1.2 billion roughly, or 5%, as Ralph pointed out, about a 20% annualized growth rate, which has been a nice. Our Dealer business has obviously benefited, that was up 13% quarter-over-quarter, Global Corporate Banking, Middle Market, which was great to see, California really impacted that and in particular, northern California having a positive impact and Energy. So all of those were some nice tailwinds that we had expected. And we're doing well, I think, in those segments. I would say, though, as we look to the balance of the year, it's important to keep in mind, as I shared just a minute ago, we do expect some moderation in Commercial Real Estate balances, at least for the balance of this year. Also, 2 of our businesses with unique variability characteristics.  First, Mortgage Banking Finance, which at least the Mortgage Banking Association's forecast would lead us to expect the balances in that portfolio would moderate here over the next 2 quarters. And then I think the other key component of that would be Dealer, which we had previously shared, Brett, that's a seasonal business. We do see inventories clear during the summer, getting ready for new models to come in, so nothing unusual there. One last footnote, I've been spending a lot of time in the markets with customers, prospects and it's pretty clear to me there's a rising sense of kind of uncertainty, though, given the fiscal cliff, political environment, there's a lot going on. I think there's people that are becoming more reticent about making investment, so all of those would factor into, I think, our thinking for the balance of the year.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up I wanted to ask was the guidance -- would the loan guidance that you have for average balances imply slightly lower end-of-period balances in the spread revenue guidance essentially? I know you don't want to give margin guidance explicitly, but it assumes that the margin would be under some additional pressure. Question there is just on, is it going to be on the securities portfolio, or do you also continue to see any pressure on loan portfolios going forward? Are you seeing -- do you expect more pressure on the loan portfolio yields, I guess, is the easiest way to ask it.","Ralph W. Babb","Yes. First of all, I think it's good news in terms of loan spreads. We've gone through a period of crisis and then a lot of competitive pressures on pricing on loans, obviously, as banks have become much more active in the marketplace. You may have seen the first -- excuse me, the second quarter Fed survey that outlined that loan spreads had compressed kind of at record levels since 1986. So it's a competitive market. For us, we have largely held our loan spreads, and I think that's good news. And frankly, I would expect that to continue. Our value proposition, our relationship-focused approach, I think, is being well received in the marketplace.","Karen L. Parkhill","And I would just add to that on loan yields that in our overall portfolio, we're obviously seeing higher-yielding Commercial Real Estate assets come off the books, both higher credit quality but lower-yielding Middle Market type loans coming on the books, which has impacted our loan yields so far this year and we think will continue. And finally, the benefit of accretion, as we mentioned before, will be slowing as we approach the end of the year.","Ralph W. Babb","Really a change of mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Scinicariello.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to follow up a little bit on the mix shift going on in that portfolio and just kind of obviously know the trends of the Middle Market have been strong and you wanted to emphasize the Commercial Real Estate, but just kind of trying to gauge kind of the extent to which that, you see that continuing going forward and kind of how much pressure that could mean for loan yields? Do you think the mix shift at the similar pace that we saw this quarter could continue or maybe start to slow down as we start to see some of the pipeline in the CRE start to materialize?","Karen L. Parkhill","Now, just before Lars, I would just say that the biggest impact is the accretion on the loan yields. So you should make sure you focus on that. We had $25 million approximately of accretion the prior 3 quarters. We had $18 million this quarter and we expect $20 million to $25 million for the rest of the year.","Ralph W. Babb","And I think just to underline what Lars was saying earlier, we expect that the Commercial Real Estate will start to, what I will call, plateau for the end of the year and that then mix shift will slow from a higher rate environment to what we would focus on being our commercial C&I lending which is, at this point, higher credit and also lower yield from that standpoint. Lars, do you want to add anything to that?","Lars C. Anderson","No, I think that's well said. There is -- our expectation is that Commercial Real Estate, hopefully, as we head into '13, will begin to show some different growth kind of characteristics. But clearly, we are continuing to stay very focused on our Middle Market businesses that I think are very well positioned and stable. Our Dealer business, our Energy business, well positioned. Technology & Life  Sciences, general Middle Market and I'd underscore, too, it's been a while since we've really seen the good core of Middle Market banking lift in California, and that's very substantial for us. We continue to see nice lift in Texas. And so I would say our portfolio trends should continue with, hopefully, a moderation and a decline in the Commercial Real Estate component.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Much in the net interest income guidance certainly applies -- implies a similar or even slightly better loan growth run rate, and I think you said you felt pretty good that even to the extent you see some modest on the yield pressure as the shift continues and whatnot, you still feel very confident that you should be able to kind -- to grow through it, I guess, is the question.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, yes. I think we've shared that there's a couple of businesses in the short term with some variability, but we're not changing our strategy. It's being very well received. We're paid a premium at Comerica for our value proposition. And frankly, I think in the marketplace today, what I am seeing is that business owners, partners, executives are looking more and more for the relationship-focused banking model that Comerica can successfully deliver and get paid for.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great, great. And then just last, any reason why we shouldn't expect to see the full amount of the buyback executed?","Karen L. Parkhill","We don't predict the future on buybacks.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew O'Connor.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","There's been a couple of banks, including yourself, that have said the impact of the low rate environment is mostly reflected in your balance sheet. And obviously, you're a little bit different in that most of your loans are priced off the shorter term part of the curve. But I guess, while I look at the securities book, including for you, you're adding new securities with yields that are 75 to 100 basis points lower and I just got to think there is still some more drag from that. So I do want to follow up on the comment that you think the bulk of the impact of the low rate environment is already in the NIM.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, I think, Matt, what I said was the bulk. Clearly, we do continue to have a securities portfolio which is relatively small as a percentage of our assets that does have prepays that we're reinvesting at current market rates as they prepay. And so we do expect, and that's part of our net interest income outlook that the reinvestment rates will remain at about current yields which are very low. And so we do expect some impact from that.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the premium amortization, I know you guys tend to be pretty conservative in how you account for that, and it seems like you try to do a little forward-looking view on the write-down that you took this quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","That's correct. On the securities portfolio, the premium amortization is a full forward-looking view.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, so if rates stayed at these levels then you wouldn't expect any additional hits in the third quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","That is correct. If rates stayed at this level.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately, if I may, the Basel III, a 90 to 100 basis point hit, how much of that do you think you can mitigate over time?","Karen L. Parkhill","The rules are not yet final, as we said, so difficult for us to say how much we expect to be able to change. I think the important thing is that we are well above the standardized levels at 8.5%, which we don't need to be above until 2019. So we are well ahead of the game. And obviously, once the rules are final, we will be focused on not only adhering to the rules, but also making sure we operate well within them.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And is it right that the increase in the RWAs is from the -- mostly from the unfunded commercial commitments that are, I guess, less than a year?","Ralph W. Babb","Yes.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. So the RWA increase is mostly from unfunded commitments less than a year. We also have some impact on low loan-to-value Commercial Real Estate development loans as well as deferred tax asset change in risk-weighted assets and the change in non-accrual loans and those kind of loans.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, as a follow-up on this, do you have any thoughts -- is there any hope that the unfunded commitments of less than a year, that the guidance might change there? Because, obviously, that could have implications for credit availability for a number of corporates out there, I would think.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes.","Ralph W. Babb","I think we just have to wait and see what's going to happen, but I think there will be changes in the rules, as Karen was talking about, in the future. And as they evolve, the good news is that we are ahead of it even today and that puts us in a very good position to adjust accordingly as the rules evolve.","Karen L. Parkhill","Right. And as the rules become final, I think, there might be changes in the overall industry and in overall customer appetite for things like unfunded commitment.","Ralph W. Babb","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the reserve release here. You're currently running reserves at about 1.5% of loans, that's down about 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Karen, I think you mentioned that you're expecting continued reserve releases through the end of the year. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense as to the size of those reserve releases over the next couple of quarters. The reserve release this quarter was visibly higher than last quarter, so I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of the pace of the reserve releases and where you might be comfortable reducing the reserves relative to outstanding loans.","Ralph W. Babb","John, why don't you comment on that?","John M. Killian","Sure, I'd be glad to. There's really no target for where we want reserves to be. So we'll continue to review every sizable problem loan every quarter. We'll continue using our existing reserve methodology. And right now, our total reserve of $703 million is almost 4x our annualized charge-offs. As you know, going forward, reserve levels for various charge-offs and problem loans decline but increases, we have growth in the portfolio. In the near term, as you mentioned, we did say that charge-offs and provisions would be very close in the third to fourth quarter to what they were in the second quarter and I would expect the reserve release, which overall was $26 million in the second quarter, $23 million in the first quarter, to be very much in that range as we go forward through the next couple of quarters.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then just a bigger picture question perhaps for Ralph. Now that we have the NPR for Basel III out in the public domain as it were, are you sensing that there may be better opportunities for M&A within your markets now that the banks that you compete with and some of the smaller banks have a better sense of what those rules are going to be?","Ralph W. Babb","I think everybody is, at this point, doing what we are. They're watching and waiting for the rules to evolve before decisions are made on those types of items. As always, we're focused on the communities we serve and the opportunities that may or may not arise in those communities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And one last quick question, was there any effect in this quarter from the recently announced interchange settlement?","Karen L. Parkhill","We don't comment specifically on specific cases, but what I would say is we do believe that we are adequately reserved for all litigation-related matters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Turner from Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","I realize it's almost insignificant, but I noticed the NPLs for the home equity portfolio almost doubled from $9 million to $16 million, and there is usually some seasonality in that, but I don't know if you could add any color around that.","Ralph W. Babb","Sure. John?","John M. Killian","Yes, I'd be glad to. We've got about a $1.6 billion portfolio in home equity loans. It's 3% of the total portfolio, to your point. About $900 million of that is from Michigan. It's all self-originated. We've never used brokers nor have we done subprime and our average home equity line of credit balance, by the way, is about $45,000. However, delinquency rates and charge-off rates have consistently been better than industry statistics and the relatively modest increase in NPLs that you saw this quarter were results of some changes in our policies where we got a little more conservative on when we move things to nonaccrual. So we basically moved to a 90-day standard as opposed to 120 to 180, which I think the whole industry is moving toward a 90-day standard. That's why you saw the increase.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then also, not to sort of beat the dead horse on the NIM or NII guidance, just when I look at it from a high level, your loan growth is coming in strong, your raised your loan growth guidance, your NII changes essentially similar to where it was. Your guidance is basically unchanged. Your accretion income is really -- expectations for accretion is unchanged. So given the higher loan growth, that assumes the NIM's down and I understand that some of the mix shift. I guess my question is embedded in your thoughts or your guidance. Are you assuming that you will continue to maintain the loan spreads that you're having now? Or is there some conservatism in there that further rate pressure would ensue?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, we are very focused on full relationship pricing with our customers in maintaining pricing and spreads on new and renewed loans as much as we can. So that is built into our thought process.","Ralph W. Babb","I think what you would see is, you'll see that continual shift in the mix...","Karen L. Parkhill","That's correct.","Ralph W. Babb","Which is built-in.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So if there was additional competitive pressures, that could be a little bit of downside or -- and if you maintain it, that's basically where guidance is right now?","Ralph W. Babb","Right.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just want to clarify in the accretion numbers you threw out there. There was $25 million, I believe, in the second quarter run rate and you expect this to fall to $20 million to $25 million for the entire second half, so kind of $10 million to $13 million per quarter. Is that right?","Karen L. Parkhill","That's correct, and you should expect it to be decreasing each quarter.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then if you think about the $25 million in the second quarter, where was the contribution of that? Was it mostly from Commercial Real Estate and maybe a little bit from C&I?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, it's mostly from Commercial Real Estate, and you're right, just a little bit from C&I.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Well, then if you look at your C&I yield, because I was wondering if there's anything in that number, it only fell by about 4 basis points quarter-from-quarter and down to about $352 million. I'm wondering, when you think about the inflow of the kind of the new money yield there, how quickly do you anticipate this should really decline over the next few quarters and what is that new money yield?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, I don't think we comment specifically on spreads for loans because they vary by risk rating and by structure on the loans. But what I would say on C&I in general is we are working again to maintain pricing on all new and renewed business as much as we can. And I think that's one of the reasons why you're seeing less of a decrease on the C&I yield.","Ralph W. Babb","And that's true in the Commercial Real Estate sector as well.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, I was going to say, Ralph, yes, that in Commercial Real Estate, in particular, we've got, we have some great relationships, some terrific projects that over the last year, that we've been originating that I think are very fair spreads for the kind of value proposition. We've been very reliable through the cycle. Our developers know that and we're getting paid for it. We -- whether it's Commercial Real Estate or it's our C&I, Middle Market focused businesses, we have a very disciplined approach to relationship pricing and we're okay to take a pass on deals. I mean, we -- and we do it every day, but it just means we have to spend more time in the market looking for the right kinds of opportunities, the customers and prospects to get paid fairly. I think we're doing that.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just one last question on the Mortgage Banker balance, a year ago, it was sitting at $600 million, now it's at $1.5 billion. I heard your commentary around kind of pressure. Even if there is second half pressure, what is the normal run rate, the normal balance? And I know it moves around a lot, but over the course of the cycle, where -- what's kind of the average balance for this that we should think about?","Lars C. Anderson","I'm sorry.","Ralph W. Babb","We have a new balance on Mortgage Banker Finance.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. Gosh, that's really hard to peg because if you go back over the last few quarters, you'll see that there was some very wide swings. If you go back into the fourth quarter of last year and into the first quarter, it would be hard to peg a number for you. But I would just tell you that as we do look out over the balance of the year, that we would expect that there would be some moderation in those balances. I mean, we've seen balances between quarters decline $0.5 billion or more. But it can surprise you because as I think we've all been surprised that we've continued to have record low rates kind of quarter after quarter. That's a key driver of the growth in that business. But I also want to underscore one other very important point. There's been a lot of changes in the mortgage industry over the last couple of years. Comerica has been very stable, very focused on this warehouse lending approach to really prime mortgage companies. And that reputation has served us well, we are clearly serving a lot more mortgage companies today than we were 1 year ago and we're cross-selling them. And I think that, that gives us a much broader base to work from as we move forward.","Ralph W. Babb","Yes, that increase in market share, I think, as I've watched the kind of the ups and downs here recently is, it's about $0.5 billion or so that will go up and down but that doesn't mean the mortgage market can't change and dry up for a longer period of time. It really depends on where that's going as Lars mentioned about what was going on with the Mortgage Bankers Association and their prediction. And then I just heard a commercial on rates are at a new all-time low and many brokers are out there selling those rates again for refinance. So it -- a lot depends on what's happening in the market there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a little bit further on Mortgage Banking very briefly, Karen, did you say Mortgage Banker balances at very end of the second quarter were down $500 million or they were $500 million?","Karen L. Parkhill","They were up $500 million.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","They were up $500 million. Okay, so from the 2 point when -- okay, so it's up $500 million versus last quarter. Got it. Okay. So then the growth -- I know you guys don't want to comment specifically on like C&I loan growth guidance, but when we think about that, Mortgage Banking still very strong, should we view the rest of C&I? I'm looking at Page 7 here, is also being up in the quarter or in the next quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. We do expect to continue to see growth in our C&I portfolio, and that's built into our overall loan expectation.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And that's excluding any impact for Mortgage Banking?","Karen L. Parkhill","Correct. We actually expect Mortgage Banker to decline in the second half, consistent with the Mortgage Banker Association Survey.","Ralph W. Babb","As well as our Dealer business, which is seasonal moderation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Karen, I wanted to go over my math in terms of net interest income. Let's forget about the margin and accretable yields. Let's get to the dollars. If I look at the midpoint of your guidance of roughly 4% year-over-year net interest income growth and apply that to last year, you get this year about $1.725 billion in net interest income. Then I back out the roughly $880 million of net interest income you've earned so far in the first half this year. That leaves you with roughly $845 million net interest income for the second half of this year or roughly $420 million to $425 million per quarter versus a $440 million run rate in the first half. Is that an accurate assessment?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, but what you need to make sure you take into account is the impact of lower accretion. In each quarter, again, we expect $20 million to $25 million in accretion for the rest of the year, and that is going to come at a declining pace each quarter. And remember, we had $26 million in the first quarter, $18 million in the second quarter.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. I think that sounds like we're taking that in effect with your guidance so my point is, in the second half of this year, we're looking roughly at $420 million to $425 million net interest income line versus the $440 million line in the first half.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. And then I think you need to make sure you take into account the fact that our loan yields will -- should continue to be impacted by the mix shift in the portfolio as Commercial Real Estate loans come down and lower-yielding Middle Market loans come on the books. And then we also do have the slight impact from our securities portfolio on the reinvestment rate on those yields.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner from D. A. Davidson.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. You talked about some of the variability you expect in the mortgage business. Just in terms of the Dealer Floor Plan business, $2.5 billion or $2.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, what's the magnitude of that seasonality that you might expect over the second half of the year?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Okay, yes, I believe the overall Dealer Finance business was at $4.3 billion. That was the average for the quarter, for the whole business. But it is a little bit difficult to tell and I'd be hard pressed to kind of give you a range there. But given a stable environment of continuation of, say, 14 million units, which is what we are hopeful for, I would just say that you typically would end up with some moderation in maybe $0.5 billion or more. But I'll tell you, that can really vary depending upon a lot of circumstances. I think that we saw that. You can have the supply chain interruption, you can have a lot of things that go on in there that can significantly impact that.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then Lars, I was wondering if you could just give some commentary on the Small Business piece. It was down a couple of hundred million dollars this quarter, maybe just give us some thoughts on that.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. Yes, it's a good question. And, obviously, Small Business had took the brunt of, I think, this economic storm that we've seen. I think our Small Business clients are probably feeling as guarded as any segment that we've got. So they're reflecting a slow growth economy. We are continuing to see the runoff of some term credits that may not exactly fit into our longer-term kind of strategy of growth of just kind of core C&I and Small Business. Our Small Business customers, though, our sense of it is, they're continuing to delever and become more liquid, so we're seeing that. On the flipside, I would tell you that our pipelines have continued to grow. I think I shared that in the last quarter. They continue to be very strong, and, in fact, this past quarter was our best quarter of new loan production that we've had in at least a couple of years. And I think that, that bodes very well for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Terry McEvoy from Oppenheimer.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A year ago this month, you closed the Sterling deal. Earlier in the call, you talked about loan growth tracking expectations. I guess my questions would be, is it coming in the areas you expected it to be when you first announced that deal and how do you see that transaction being additive to Comerica going forward?","Ralph W. Babb","The transaction is going very well and very much as we expected. The team has come together well in the market, especially in the Houston, San Antonio, Kerrville markets and I believe the latest number showed about a 10% increase in loans outstanding since the acquisition, and we're very excited about that combination. And the other synergies are on target as we expected.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the real estate optimization later this year, are the cost saves of those events, is that built into the 2012 outlook or will any cost saves be more visible next year in 2013?","Karen L. Parkhill","Our -- all of the cost saves are built into the outlook.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then just one last question on the Wealth Management there was virtually no provision, if I remember. And you said something about decreasing in Private Banking in the Midwest markets. Is that a conscious decision of Comerica? Or is that simply a function of the market itself decreasing?","Ralph W. Babb","John?","John M. Killian","Yes, it's not the intent of any strategy at all. That' s just the way the numbers came out this quarter. We intend to execute that business strongly across the country.","Ralph W. Babb","It's a very important business for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Look, there you've been given on the balance sheet growth and the spread income, and sorry to beat you up again here on the margin, but that implies about 5 to 10 basis points of margin compression by my math through the back half of this year. Is that a fair level at least to think about? I know you don't give guidance, but I just wanted to see in terms of magnitude if that's a fair range.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes.","Ralph W. Babb","Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","Obviously, we don't give guidance on our rate NIM because that can move around quite a bit and it also is dependent on the level of our excess deposits. So I won't give guidance on that. But I would focus on the guidance that we've given for net interest income and the impacts around that of lower accretion of the lower loan yields due to the mix shift of the impact on the mortgage banking backed securities which we talked about and of loan growth. I would focus on that.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And then separately, the second quarter level for comp and benefit expense, about $250 million in total, I wanted to see if that is a pretty good run rate to stick with going forward or if you could expect some incremental volatility in that number outside of the Sterling impact?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. No, that is a pretty good number to look at going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Rose from Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to get a little bit of color on the increase in utilization rates. I understand why it was up in part due to the growth outstripping the growth in commitments. But as we sit here and look at kind of a maybe a slowdown in technology spending, energy is under pressure, how should we think about utilization rates and commitments going forward?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars, do you want to take that?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. I'd be really glad to. Obviously, yes, utilization rates were just math, driven by overall Commercial or overall loan growth of $950 million. Commercial loans up $1.2 billion and yet commitments, way up a healthy $636 million, now the math around that pushed our total utilization rates against commitments of 140 basis points to 48.8%. The biggest contributors that drove that were Dealer, Energy, Technology & Life Sciences, Mortgage Banking Finance and such. And so I'm not sure I would jump to any conclusions there around utilization rates and where that would be going in the future. We're obviously glad to -- we were glad to see that. But I couldn't point to one particular business that I think would particularly influence that going forward. We're just going to continue to stay very focused on our Middle Market businesses which are the biggest part of our commitments and commitment growth. And we're -- we feel very good about our long-term growth prospects of all of our Middle Market businesses and general Middle Market, as I mentioned, picking up in California. I think Texas continuing, will have impacts on that. So I hope that's somewhat helpful to you, though, it's hard to guide you exactly where I think that will be.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that is helpful. And then as a follow-up, when I kind of look at the net interest income in Texas, even excluding the impact of the accretion, I guess it implies that competitive pressures continue to take shape in Texas. Can you kind of comment on what you're seeing out of maybe some of your larger competitors? Are they still being very competitive on rate and structure?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. We are seeing a very competitive marketplace. There is no question about it. I would say from a geographic perspective, the West Coast is the most competitive, maybe Michigan, Texas, but really, we're seeing good competition. It's very competitive across all of our segments. The good news of it is, I think that our strategy is playing out very well. It's being very, very well received. And in spite of that, we're continuing to hold on our loan spreads. We've done that for 2 quarters  in a row and I feel very bullish. I think we've got the right businesses, kind of in the right markets with a very talented bankers. I think we've got some of the best bankers in the marketplace and you got to have them to execute kind of this relationship banking model that I think is being well-received  and driving some nice growth in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","A couple of real quick questions. On your guidance for net noninterest expense up 1%, does that include the $20 million to $25 million of merger expenses in the second half of the year?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, it does. It includes restructuring expenses.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So then next year, you should have noninterest expense go down even further factoring out any type of growth metrics?","Karen L. Parkhill","That is correct.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And on the MBS portfolio, I think you said your duration's around 2.5 to 3 years. Is the new stuff you're adding on, is that same duration mix?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, it is. When we focus on adding securities, we're focused on keeping duration as low as possible while maximizing yield and keeping premium as low as possible. So we have -- our 2.7% --  2.7 duration has been on the portfolio for a few quarters now.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then just -- and then so when you're reinvesting the new for the runoff, what type of yields are you getting for those, for those securities today?","Karen L. Parkhill","Today, we're getting yields between 1.7% and 1.8%.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then did -- I don't know if you disclosed it, but have you disclosed what type of CPR rates you have on the securities currently?","Karen L. Parkhill","We don't disclose that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Klock from Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And really quick, and I'm sorry if maybe this is answered already, but I bounced on a couple of different things this morning. And maybe this is a question for Lars, the loan growth does seem like syndicated national credits, that those balances increased about $0.5 billion or about half the total growth in C&I this quarter if you take out the Mortgage Banker Finance. So I guess maybe you can talk about that. Is there opportunities that you're seeing because of what's going on in Europe, the bigger European banks that have U.S. operations, that maybe you're seeing some better looks at deals because of that or maybe you can talk about the growth in that, the SNC portfolio?","Lars C. Anderson","Okay, I'd be glad to -- 2 kind of issues that I'll try to cover, first, the European banks, how they're linked. We're seeing some opportunities there. They were somewhat limited. Some of the changes in the marketplace have been bulk purchases portfolios. We're really spending our time building relationships rather than focus on buying credits. That's kind of where we are at our best. So I'd say that, that is somewhat limited. We've seen some opportunities with existing customers where we've been able to expand our relationships, but we have pretty conservative hold limits. And so we're going to stay in the box there and stick with the conservative strategy there. As that relates to the Shared National Credit portfolio, it was up by actually $478 million. I think it's on Slide 20, 23. I think the important thing to point out is, the Commercial loan growth for period end, which is what you'd measure that against, because the SNC number is period end, was up $1.4 billion. So you're talking about roughly $900 million in production that was non-Shared National Credit. So it is by far the majority of our production. But a couple of things I want to point out is, we use Shared National Credit as simply a tool, a very conservative tool, to manage our risk exposure in industries and segments that we've been in a very long time, we're very comfortable with and that we have very good asset quality profitability kind of metrics from. In fact, if you look at the Shared National Credit portfolio at our bank today, the returns, the asset quality of those credits really is consistent with the overall portfolio. Last point I would make for you is, we underwrite our Shared National Credits like we do any other credit. There's no difference in standard there and we hold them to the same relationship banking pricing standards, and frankly, execution that we have of any other credit in our portfolio. So we're very comfortable with it. We're very comfortable with our lines of business, but it simply complements some long-term businesses that we've been in.","Ralph W. Babb","Yes, I would underline that relationship approach to Shared National Credits. Some of our biggest relationships and meaning total banking relationships, not just credit would fall under that category.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just one follow-up for John Killian. John, did you say earlier, when you were talking about the provisions, the guidance, the overall guidance is that the provisions and charge-offs should be down year-over-year and trending down, but did I hear you say that the third and fourth quarter provisions and charge-offs should be similar to the second quarter level?","John M. Killian","Yes, you did, Brian.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I think at what point, I guess maybe that's the thing is, that if loan growth, there is some expectation, Karen, that loan growth should be moderating in the second half of the year, there's probably less pressure on needing to provision for the loan growth in the second half of the year. Is that maybe the way to think about why that -- why the good loan growth that you had in the first half of this year, I would expect provision to go up from that $19 million run rate in the second quarter, but is that why we're kind of ...","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, I think that's correct. Obviously, the key drivers of our overall reserve are loan growth and credit quality. So yes, your statement's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Regarding the Energy portfolio, you've had a lot of growth in that over the last year, I know much of it probably related to Sterling. Can you just talk about the composition of the portfolio, whether most of it is Shared National Credit in nature and what kind of concentration you're comfortable with in terms of Energy loans to total loans over time?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, Jennifer, yes, it's been obviously a business that we've been in a very long time, a Texas-based company and we're very comfortable with it. And frankly, we developed, I think, a really nice reputation in the industry. Today, it represents somewhere around 5.5% or so of our overall loan portfolio, so it's very manageable. It was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, the growth in it, so we didn't have quite growth in it over the last quarter. It is very clearly consistent with our relationship banking model. We work very closely with management teams and sponsors that we worked with for a long period of time. And frankly, we get excellent ancillary business out of working with these management teams and companies because they value our long-term commitment to the industry. If you look at the portfolio overall, it's very much of a liquids kind of oriented portfolio towards our natural gas, liquids and oil, which is really where you want to be. That's not a mistake. The portfolio continues to have excellent performance characteristics in growth, asset quality and profitability. So we're very comfortable with where we are today. We got a proven track record, a robust credit policy that served us very, very well. And I would just remind you that back in the '90s, we -- this portfolio went through $10 a barrel gas, $1.70 natural gas. It also made it through 2009 at $40 a barrel. Yes, at $40 a barrel, yes, did I say?","Ralph W. Babb","Gas.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. At $10 in the '90s, $40 a barrel in 2009, and frankly, our performance has been excellent. So we're very comfortable with where we are and with our strategy. And we're going to continue to grow with our customers and we're going to stay very focused on our existing strategy, no changes there.","Karen L. Parkhill","But Jennifer, you had mentioned in your question that you thought that much of the Energy growth was related to Sterling and I just want to let you know that Sterling did not have the robust industry expertise in Energy that Comerica has had for a long time. So we wouldn't necessarily attribute that to Sterling. What I would also say is, you asked about the composition of SNC, most of our Energy loans are SNC loans.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, and that is really a reflection of a very conservative approach to our hold limits in an industry that's very asset-intensive, right. Thanks, Karen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala from Bank of America.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had one high-level question for you, Ralph. So if I take a step back, if the Fed is on hold for the next 2 years or through 2014, I guess, that implies to me that the outlook for your bank is that loan growth is getting better and that's balanced with the provision, the credit leverage from improving credit moderating, but that also implies that if the margin will continue to grind down and we don't know what's going to happen in terms of the CCAR process each year in terms of your ability to continue to increase capital return. And I guess in that scenario, as you look out over the next 2 years, what do you think the other levers are that are available to you in terms of improving EPS in an environment that's difficult for that long? Is it to -- Matt's question, M&A, would it be a special dividend or are there more expense leverage outside of -- it sounds like the base for next year on a core basis is $1.73 billion. Is there something -- what else -- I mean, or are you really saying, \"Look, this rate issue is cyclical, so we're not going to do something outside our comfort zone just because rates are low for another 2 years?\"","Ralph W. Babb","That's a good way to summarize in total. We will stay with our philosophy and our strategy of growing in the markets where we are. We think we're very well placed in building relationships for the longer term. Now there are levers that we continue to look at all the time, and that's expenses. And I think we've set a record of doing that. We look at expenses every year and making sure those are the right places for the right leverage. We've been an active capital manager and we'll continue to be that within the rules and guidelines that are out there. And as you know, those aren't, as we've talked about, aren't set yet at this point in time. So the strategy, I believe, and especially the strategy of the geographic expansion that we undertook several years ago and is now paying off in Texas and California and balancing out that geographic distribution is working very well and the growth is going to be, as we talked about in the comments, in the states where we are, especially Texas and California. And so I think we're very well positioned to weather through the storm that may be there or may not be there from that standpoint based on rates and whether there continue to be at a low level.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question was for Lars. Several quarters before, we saw the positive turn in C&I loan growth, right. You were able to telegraph this because you looked at the increase in commitments to commit. I'm curious here with the economy softening, when you look at this leading indicator, are you starting to see a downturn or any softening in the C&I coming?","Lars C. Anderson","Right, Steven. Yes, we've had -- we've had I guess now, 8 conservative quarters of Commercial loan growth which has really been terrific and the last few has been very strong. Our pipeline continues to look good. I would just say, though, that at least from what I'm hearing in the marketplace and I've been spending a lot of time out there with customers and prospects is, there is this growing sense of uncertainty and maybe a cooling of the economy that could impact, I think, business activity in the second half of the year. But you mentioned the word telegraphing, I would say this, though, I think that we're as well positioned in the marketplace today in our markets and our businesses as any franchise. I mean, going out into the marketplace today and talking about Comerica's story of reliability, our size, our products, our strengths, our capital position, talking about our customer service commitments and our relationship banking model and then thirdly, I think most importantly, being able to take bankers out there that, on the average, our group managers have average tenure at Comerica of about 20 years, our average relationship manager, almost 10 years. Those are the folks that execute our relationship banking model. So I'm very encouraged about our businesses, about our markets, about our products and our growth prospects longer term for sure, Steven.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe I could follow up on that because I hear that you're very encouraged, you're well-positioned, you expect moderation in Mortgage Banker crit. But I guess we all struggle because when you look at the average loan growth guidance, right, it implies $42 million, $42.5 million for the full year, your period-end loans I think were $44 million. So it implies a pretty steep decline coming in the second half of the year. Period-end might be down $2 billion looking at your guidance. So I guess what I'm trying to reconcile, is my math wrong or is your term moderation really implying a pretty steep decline in loans coming in the second half?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, I would say on our outlook, it is based on what we said, the decline in Mortgage Banker Finance, seasonality in Dealer, overall decline in Commercial Real Estate, continuing decline in Commercial Real Estate, so it is against that backdrop, as well as the backdrop of a not-so-robust economy out there and the fact that we intend to continue what we've been doing on maintaining our relationship pricing discipline.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And maybe just a few quarters ago, you talked about $100 million in annual profit improvement from revenue and expense initiatives. How much of that $100 million has now been realized? And are you still on track for the full $100 million?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, Steve, we are on track to receive the profit improvement that we had planned for earlier in the year. We do monitor and measure that at a very granular level every month and so we are comfortable with it. In terms of timing, we expected it to be spread fairly evenly across the quarters this year and that is still proving to be the case.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Karen, could you share how much of that you've realized already?","Karen L. Parkhill","You know what, we -- it's very difficult to track at that kind of level on how much we've realized already, but it is spread evenly and so you can deduce it from there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 really quick ones on fee income. I'm just wondering can you just talk about what the drivers of fee income growth will be from here? What areas do you expect to lead that forward?","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure. On fee income, we do expect to see continued customer-driven fee income increases. As we put in place, as part of our profit improvement revenue initiatives this year, a big focus on fees, doing things like higher penetration on cross-sells, ensuring that we actually collect fees and don't waive much in fees, things like that. So we do expect customer-driven fee increases to continue. The other part of the noninterest income revenue are things that are variable and we don't necessarily expect to continue for the rest of the year, things like gains on principal and investments, investments and warrants, gains on our auction rates, securities portfolio and the $5 million in our annual incentive that we received this quarter on our credit card portfolio.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So if I bring that on together, and I wanted to ask you about the other income line, because there's always a lot of the volatility stuff in other, so what was outside of the bonus gain in there this quarter? What else was strong in there and kind of how do you expect that line to trend over the course of the year?","Karen L. Parkhill","We also had strong customer derivative income, too, which is part of the customer derivatives that I haven't mentioned, they're  customer income that I haven't mentioned. But in other, what else is in that? It's really the gain on our principal and vesting warrants and our auction rate securities.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then so when you think about it, it's kind of like the same way people have been asking about NII, can you -- do you expect fees to be able to grow from here? Or is it just that they'll be able to grow off of a decent comp from year-over-year?","Karen L. Parkhill","We do expect to be able to continue to increase customer-driven fees year-over-year.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","No, I meant from the current quarter. I mean, from the run rate.","Karen L. Parkhill","And from the current quarter run rate.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then the volatility is just the pluses or minus underneath that. Okay. Great.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Levin from Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So you obviously have very strong C&I loan growth. When you think about return on capital, what's the all-in return on capital you're getting on the C&I loans that you're making in the current environment?","Karen L. Parkhill","We don't disclose the returns that we're getting on each individual loan, but what I will say, is that we are very focused on overall relationship returns for each of our customers every time we price any product to them and those overall relationship return hurdles are fairly strong.","Ralph W. Babb","Both on economic return on equity, as well as regulatory return on equity spreads, among other things, that are looked at on every credit.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And the second question is sort of related. Given how challenging this environment is for all banks, is there a point at which you sort of consider shrinking the bank, returning some capital to shareholders and then you can raise capital at some later point when the cycle ultimately turns? Is that even on the table at all or that's not even close to being on the table?","Ralph W. Babb","No, I think the focus is, as we see things evolve, we'll continue to be an active capital manager and returning the appropriate amount that, we believe, to our shareholders during any given year. And as the rules get more finalized, we'll be, as we have in the past, more open with what we think the current target for capital is in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Question, so on the one hand, you're raising guidance, you're at the high-end of spread revenues, loans are better than you thought. And on the other hand, you're signing a note of caution with slowing Mortgage Banking business, National Dealer, seasonally slower, continued decline in Commercial Real Estate, Midwest is flowing into the middle year, uncertainty with your clients with the macro situation. So my question is, are you raising guidance, really, solely due to what you've seen in the first half of the year?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, I would say that our guidance for the rest of the year is driven in large part to the strong performance that we've seen in the first half of this year.","Ralph W. Babb","The issue, Mike, as you know very well is, when you look out for the rest of the year, we have the election, we have what's going on in the European sector, as well as the slowing in the Asian sector and the fiscal cliff that is in the paper every day. And that has caused us to be cautious while I think Lars said a while ago, we had not really seen an effect at this point. And we'll still be out there and looking for new business and new relationships as aggressively as we have in the past and making sure that we are leveraging our abilities to the best point for our shareholders.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Are you cautious partly because of what you're seeing from your customers, however? Are you hearing or seeing this with their behavior?","Ralph W. Babb","We are hearing from our customers. But I would say also, and I think we talked about it in the last call, that capacity has gotten to be part of a factual situation where customers are beginning to borrow and having to invest in what I would call the short term in order to meet the demands that they have. Our customers, as Lars was talking about earlier, are doing very well and have seen a very good turnaround in the last couple of years. And so, at this point, as I mentioned earlier, we've not seen that slowdown, but there is a lot of caution that's being discussed and they're not going to reach to the what I would call more historical investing until they get certainty in what the rules are going to be going forward in the economy.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And the answer to the other question, so are you forecasting loans to be down from period-end second quarter levels?","Karen L. Parkhill","We're not going to comment specifically other than what we've said in our guidance, Mike, that we do expect loans to moderate in certain areas like we've talked about. We do expect continued growth in C&I.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, you said you're asset-sensitive. You've always been asset-sensitive. I look at the decline in yield on the loans down 13 basis points this quarter, the decline in yield on securities, down 16 basis points this quarter and decline on deposits only 1 basis point. But then that I hear your statement saying low rates should not be further negative for you guys. And it's just a little surprising, given the decline in the loan securities yields, you said deposit rates are at a floor. I mean, you almost have a built-in excuse, right? You can say it to anybody, who expected rates to be this low for this long and you've always been asset-sensitive, so you should be getting hurt by that. But instead, you say, \"Well, it shouldn't really be a further negative for us.\" It just seems like you're putting your neck out on the line when you really don't need to. What gives you this kind of surprising confidence?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, I think what you need to take into account is, that our overall relative exposure to the rate environment is low. And when we say that comment, that's what we are referring to.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I just -- I really want to understand this. I want to understand this not only for you, but for the industry, that the pain is already done, when you see the exposure in the rate environment. I mean, forever, Comerica, for decades , Comerica has been core deposit funded for Commercial loans, and it's natural that you're asset-sensitive. So if rates are low, you can't reprice those core deposits down forever, and it sounds like you're at that point now and those loans and securities get repriced lower. So I guess -- unless you're hedging and doing something else, and I thought you said that the new yield on securities is 1.8%. Versus the second quarter, it was 2.6%. So right there, that's another 80 basis points on the securities portfolio. So can you give me any other color as to how you get to that conclusion?","Karen L. Parkhill","Well, first of all, the securities portfolio, the rate prior quarter was about 2% where we were reinvesting. So it has come down, but not 80 basis points, closer to 20 to 30 basis points.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Would it been for -- the overall yield on securities is 2.6% in the second quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","That's correct. I thought you were talking about the reinvestment rate.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Right. But that -- so that would just drag down your overall yield. I'm just looking, forecasting March. I know you're not giving guidance on that, but go ahead.","Karen L. Parkhill","So on our securities portfolio, yes, we do have prepays every quarter. We do expect those to be $750 million to $900 million per quarter, and we are reinvesting those at low rates. We currently do not have any hedges on our portfolio. At some point in time, in a better rate environment, we do intend to put hedges back on the portfolio. We had them in the past, they have run out at this stage. So that's our securities portfolio and our hedging strategy. On the loan side, 85% of our loans are floating rate, and of that, 75% are LIBOR-based and most of that is 30-day LIBOR. So when we talk about the asset sensitivity in our -- on our business, we are talking about the fact that we are mostly floating rate exposed, mostly 30-day LIBOR exposed and the fact that the securities portfolio, yes, is reinvesting at lower rates, but we've given you the amounts of those prepays that we expect going forward.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","But -- last follow-up, sorry, the loan yields keep coming down, though. I mean, they're down 13 basis points just last quarter. Don't you expect that to go down also?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, and we've talked about on loan yields, the fact that there is a mix shift in our overall portfolio and that mix shift is the higher-yielding. Commercial Real Estate loan is coming off the books and being replaced by lower yielding but better quality of loans coming on the books. And so that is the  phenomenon in our overall loan portfolio yield. At the same time, you've got accretion impacting that yield which needs to be taken into account. And then on loan yields for new and renewed business, we are focused on maintaining spreads everywhere that we can. And because we are focused on that, the yield in our portfolio will come down less than it would have if we hadn't been very focused on the new and renewed pricing.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Babb, do you have any closing remarks?","Ralph W. Babb","Well I would like to thank everyone for being on today and your interest in Comerica.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. ","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. Good morning and welcome to Comerica\u2019s first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Participating in this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curtis Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, David Duprey and Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile. ","During this presentation we will be referring to slides which provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC\u2019s website as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement in today\u2019s release in Slide 2, which I incorporate into this call as well as our filings with the SEC for factors that could cause actual results to differ.","Now I will turn the call over to Ralph who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph Babb","Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported first quarter 2017 net income of $202 million or $1.11 per share, which included $0.04 in restructuring expenses, as well as a tax benefit of $24 million or $0.13 share. Quarter-over-quarter, our net income increased 23%, which helped drive a double-digit ROE and 1.14% ROA for the quarter.","Relative to the first quarter of last year, our earnings per share increased significantly due to improved credit quality in our Energy portfolio, higher interest rates, as well as successful implementation of many of our GEAR Up initiatives.","Turning to Slide 4 and an overview of our first quarter results. With a $900 million decrease in average mortgage banker loans and $290 million decrease in Energy, total loans declined compared to the fourth quarter. Apart from these two business lines, average loans increased $176 million. As far as deposits, we saw the typical first quarter decline following very strong growth in the fourth quarter. The decrease was mainly in noninterest-bearing deposits.","Net interest income increased $15 million to $470 million. This included the benefit from increased interest rates and a lower level of wholesale funding, partly offset by lower loan balances and two less days in the quarter. Overall, credit quality continued to be strong. Net charge-offs were $33 million or 28 basis points and included $13 million in Energy charge-offs. ","Total criticized loans declined again this quarter and included a $283 million decrease in Energy. Based on the continued improvement in credit metrics, we modestly reduced our reserve allocated to Energy loans to about 7% of Energy outstandings, and our allowance for credit losses for our entire portfolio declined about $17 million.","The lower net charge-offs, coupled with the reduced reserves, resulted in a $19 million decline in the provision to $16 million. An increase in fee income and a reduction in expenses demonstrate that our GEAR Up initiative continues to reap benefits.","Noninterest income increased $4 million with growth in deposit service charges, investment banking and fiduciary, partly offset by a seasonal decline in card fees. Noninterest expenses declined $4 million. Expense savings resulting from GEAR Up and a decrease in related restructuring charges were partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits, primarily due to annual stock compensation. During the first quarter, warrants and employee option exercises, as well as vesting of employee stock grants, added 4.1 million shares.","The stock compensation activity resulted in a credit to our income tax provision of $24 million. A new accounting standard requires us to recognize the tax impact from stock compensation activity in the tax line, whereas it was previously recognized in equity. We repurchased 1.5 million shares for $105 million under our equity repurchase program. We have approximately $140 million remaining under our 2016 CCAR plan, which we expect to execute in the second quarter. We have been steadily increasing our buyback, which reflects our solid financial performance and strong capital position.","And now I will turn the call over to Dave, who will go over the quarter in more detail.","David Duprey","Thanks Ralph. Good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 5, mortgage banker loans decreased $102 million due to weather slowdown in home sales and lower refi volumes. Our loan \u2013 our portfolio volume was approximately 77% purchased versus refi compared to the industry average of 39%. As expected, mortgage banker balances began to rebound this quarter and are expected to continue to grow for the spring summer home buying season. We had a reduction of $289 million in Energy loans.","As anticipated, balances have continued to decrease as customers deleverage through asset sales and capital raises. We expect the pace of reduction in loan balances to slow up as energy prices have stabilized and the rig count has increased. Also, we started seeing a few excellent relationship opportunities with E&P companies that have performed well for the downturn and have been conservatively underwritten. Our auto Dealer Floor Plan portfolio increased $144 million as dealers continue to build inventory in preparation for the pickup in spring sales.","Growth for the total loan book began to return in late February. And average loans for March were better. This resulted in period-end loans above the average for the quarter. As of March 31, commitments decreased to $51.3 billion, and average line utilization was stable at 51%. We've had a broad-based increase in our loan pipeline, and our commitments to commit grew 44% to $1.2 billion. Overall, customer sentiment is positive, reflective of the improving economy and anticipated changes coming out of Washington. Yet, we remain cautious.","Our loan yield increased 21 basis points, primarily due to a 22 basis point increase in average 30- day LIBOR. Reflecting typical seasonality, deposits declined $1.9 billion relative to the fourth quarter, including a $1.6 billion decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits, as you can see on Slide 3. Period-end deposits of $58.9 billion were well above the average, indicating a positive trend. Also, deposits have grown over $1 billion relative to the first quarter last year, with noninterest bearing increasing $2.4 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits now represent 53% of our mix.","Our relationship-oriented deposit base had helped us keep our deposit costs low at 14 basis points. We continue to prudently manage pricing and have not instituted any standard pricing adjustments in response to the recent increases in short-term rates. We are closely monitoring our deposit base, as well as the market, and believe we are well positioned.","We continue to maintain the size of our securities book, as shown on Slide 7. The total yield on the portfolio increased one basis point as we actively manage the portfolio. Recently, we have been able to invest prepays at a slightly higher rate than they are running on. For example, we have seen MBS yields in the 2.40s, with only modestly longer duration and extension risk than the portfolio average. The recent rise in mortgage rates has not had a significant impact on the pace of prepayments, and the estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about 3.5 years. And the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to four years. Finally, the portfolio is in a relatively small unrealized net loss position of $43 million.","Turning to Slide 8. Net interest income increased $15 million, while the net interest margin increased 21 basis points. Our loan portfolio added $9 billion and 17 basis points to the margin. The increase in interest rates provided a $23 million benefit, which was partially offset by two less days in the quarter and lower loan balances.","In addition, we've had a lease residual adjustment of $2 million in the fourth quarter that was not repeated. Balances at the Fed contributed $3 million and three basis points to the margin. The increase in the Fed funds rate added $4 million and was partly offset by the $1 billion decrease in average balances. Wholesale funding costs decreased $2 million as the increase in 6-month LIBOR was more than offset by the benefit from sub-debt that was repaid in mid-November. Finally, deposit costs declined $1 million due to the reduction in CD balances.","Our overall credit picture remains strong, as outlined on Slide 9. Total criticized loans declined over $200 million and are now about 5.5% of total loans at quarter-end. This includes a $61 million decrease in nonaccrual loans, which now represent only 1.1% of our total loans. Net charge-offs were $23 million or 28 basis points, which is below our normal historical range.","Reflecting the continued strong credit quality and improving energy credit metrics, our allowance for credit losses declined by $17 million, while the allowance-to-loan ratio remained relatively stable at 1.47%. Of note, our assessments of the recent Shared National Credit exam is reflected in this quarter's metrics.","Energy loans at quarter-end were about $2 billion and now represent 4% of our total loans. E&P loans make up about 70% of our portfolio. Spring redeterminations are approximately 12% complete and have resulted in modest increases in borrowing basis. Many of our customers have increased reserves through acquisitions, improved production and new drilling at all slightly higher prices. As criticized and nonaccrual Energy loans continue to decline and charge-offs remain manageable, the reserve currently allocated for Energy loans is now about 7% of energy outstandings.","Slide 10 outlines non-interest income, which increased $4 million or 2%, and was up 11% to the first quarter of last year. We had strong treasury management deposit service charges, driven by the early success of our GEAR Up initiatives, as well as receipt of annual fees. In addition, stronger market conditions resulted in increases in investment banking and fiduciary income. This was partially offset by a decline in card fees, primarily due to the seasonally lower volume and timing of pay periods for our government card programs. Changes in non-paid categories essentially offset each other.","Expenses declined $4 million, as shown on Slide 11. Salaries and benefits increased $14 million, primarily due to annual stock compensation and higher payroll taxes. In addition, the gain on the early termination of certain leveraged lease transactions that we realized in the fourth quarter was not repeated. This was more than offset by declines in most other expense categories, including a $9 million decrease in restructuring charges and a favorable litigation-related settlement of $2 million. We also had a typical seasonal decline in advertising cost. Overall, expenses remain well controlled and the realization of our GEAR Up initiatives continue to be evident.","Moving to Slide 12. In line with our 2016 capital plan, we again increased our stock buyback with $105 million of repurchases in the first quarter under our equity repurchase program. Through the buyback, together with the dividend, we returned $147 million to the shareholders. As a result of our higher stock price, there was significant exercise activity at stock options and warrants. This activity, combined with the first quarter employee stock awards, added 4.1 million shares during the quarter.","Also, these issuances, and along with a higher stock price, resulted in our average and our period-end diluted share count increasing to 180 million shares. We submitted our CCAR plan for the 2017-2018 cycle earlier this month and expect to receive the results in mid-June. With our strong capital ratios and increased profitability, we remain focused on returning excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way.","Turning to Slide 13. Our asset-sensitive balance sheet positions us well to continue to benefit from increases in rates. Over 90% of our loans are floating rate. Therefore, as rates move, our loan portfolio reprices quickly. In our outlook for 2017, we previously indicated that we had expected the December rate rise would contribute $70 million, assuming a 25% beta.","Given that we have been able to manage our deposit pricing, we are updating this outlook and now expect $85 million in additional net interest income over a 12-month period. And with the further 25 basis point increase in rates last month and assuming our deposit rates has moved with the 25% beta, which has yet to materialize, we should gain about $70 million more in net interest income over a 12-month period or over $50 million for 2017.","We currently estimate that the next 25 basis point increase could provide an additional $40 million to $85 million in annualized net interest income. The outcome depends on a variety of factors, including deposit betas, balance sheet movements such as deposits declining as companies use the cash in their businesses. Additional scenarios, other key variables and a list of assumptions are in the appendix.","Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph.","Ralph Babb","Thanks, Dave. Turning to Slide 14 and an update on our GEAR Up expense and revenue initiatives that we announced last July, we continue to be on track to reach our goals. The recent increase in rates should help us reach our targets faster for an efficiency ratio below 60% and an ROE consistently in the double digits. And we remain committed to achieving our target for an additional $180 million in pre-tax income in 2017 and $270 million in 2018 relative to when we kicked off the initiative.","With pilot programs underway, we are moving forward with our revenue initiatives, which include training, relationship management tools and fine-tuning incentives. On the technology front, we are rationalizing applications and designing ways to enhance back-office efficiency. Also, we are initiating implementation of our end-to-end credit design project, which will increase our relationship managers' capacity and enhance customer satisfaction. This includes simplifying the governance process, introducing new technology to support a digital approach and pooling of back-office resources across all of our markets.","On the right side of the slide, you can see some of the major drivers to the savings we have achieved so far, our largest initiative involving streamlining our workforce. We also replaced our current pension and retirement account benefits with a newly redesigned defined benefit retirement program. Finally, we are carefully pruning our banking center network and rationalizing our total real estate requirements.","On Slide 15, we provide our outlook for the full year 2017. Assuming continuation of the current economic environment, we now expect total average loans to increase 1% to 2%, including a reduction in mortgage banker and Energy loans. We expect to see the typical second quarter seasonal rebound in mortgage banker, but average mortgage banker loans for the full year are expected to be below last year. If oil and gas prices remain at current levels, we believe Energy loans could stabilize by the end of the year. Aside from mortgage banker and Energy, we expect the remainder of the portfolio to grow 3% to 4%.","As far as net interest income, our model indicates that the benefit in 2017 from the recent increases in short-term rates is expected to be more than $135 million. As Dave mentioned, there are numerous assumptions that are included in this calculation such as deposit betas and the pace of LIBOR increases. Also, while not included in this outlook, we remain well positioned to benefit from any further rate increases. In addition, loan growth and lower wholesale funding are expected to contribute to net interest income.","With continued strong metrics, our credit outlook is slightly better than what we have previously indicated. We now expect the provision for the full year to be between 20 and 30 basis points and net charge-offs to be similar to the 28 basis points we had in the first quarter. Our outlook for net interest income and non-interest expenses has not changed. We expect non-interest income to increase 4% to 6%, and excluding restructuring expenses of $25 million to $50 million, remaining non-interest expenses are expected to decline 1% to 2%.","Finally, assuming no further tax benefit from employee stock activity, we expect our effective tax rate for the remaining quarters to be approximately 33%. In closing, 2017 is off to a good start. We are benefiting meaningfully from increased interest rates, and our overall credit metrics have remained strong. We have already reached significant expense savings from our enterprise-wide GEAR Up initiative and are committed to fully delivering on the efficiency and revenue opportunities to further enhance our profitability and shareholder value.","In addition, while there is no certainty as to what may prevail in Washington, we believe we are well positioned and can act quickly to benefit from changes that reduce taxes, provide regulatory relief or fiscal stimulus that can drive economic growth.","Now we'll be happy to take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Hi, Steve.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Ralph, I'm trying to better understand the significant increase in the loan pipeline, and I'm looking at the 44% increase in commitments to commit. If many businesses are in wait-and-see mode, right, waiting to see what comes out of Washington, one, why are they building commitments so aggressively here? And two, have you seen other periods where businesses increased these commitments, but ultimately don't draw on them?","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to take that?","Curtis Farmer","Steve, I think that, really, when you think about the loan portfolio, you've got to think about it more broadly, so across really all of our business lines, as Ralph and Dave alluded to, with the exception of mortgage banker and Energy. And when you think about sort of the path we've been on, there is definitely a lot more optimism than we saw in the third quarter or fourth quarter of last year, even though some of that may have waned a little bit.","And really, across all of our geographies, across all of our business lines, we are seeing increased activity and increased optimism with our customers. Now some of that still is cautious on the part of many of those clients, but I think it\u2019s a lot higher than we have seen in the last 6 or 12 months, and again, broad spread across all of our businesses and across all of our geographies, with the exception of mortgage banker and Energy.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. And then just, Curt, on my second question, have you seen other periods where the commitments have increased but you did not see businesses follow-through, and ultimately, at some point, draw on those commitments?","Curtis Farmer","Well, it\u2019s always there, as you know, a factor that could come to play. Not all of these will result in booked transactions. And so through the cycle, we probably experienced this before where some clients might \u2013 we might have commitment or term sheet out there that would not come to fruition, but you have to assume a fair amount of the real book based on the sort of historical trends with our client and the conversations that we\u2019ve had.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, thank you. And just one separate question on deposit costs. We now have another quarter of deposit costs staying completely flat. Now in the outlook, you do assume a 25% beta following the March hike. Are you just being conservative? Or do you see something that leads you to believe betas might move up fairly materially from here? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Steve. Quite frankly, I prefer to think of the former, that it\u2019s the conservative outlook. We have not seen anything that would indicate that those prices are going to move at this point.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Great, thanks for the color.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Thanks a lot. Good morning everyone. I was wondering if you could just talk about the auto business and Michigan a little bit. More specifically, all the talk about softer sales. So just one question is, can you talk about your confidence in growing that floor plan book this year? And then secondly, can you just talk about any signs of slowing in this broader Michigan economy or worries you may have just about the auto complex? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to talk about the demand?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. The SAR rate glides down slightly from its peak of over $18 million. We\u2019re still expecting annual SAR rate somewhere in the $16.6 million range, which, by historical standards, it\u2019s still very high. When you think about the floor plan business, actually, a little bit of slowing helps us because vehicles stay on the lots longer.","So borrowings under our facilities end up being higher because of that. You also look at some other factors. I mean, I think the average life of the vehicle or the average age per vehicle on the road is still about 11 years, so there\u2019s still probably a lot of pent-up demand there. We are still a net acquirer of additional dealerships as you see some roll-ups in the industry occurring, and so that\u2019s helping us grow the business overall.","So we still remain pretty optimistic about the business. We\u2019re heading into a busier season in the spring from activity owned in terms of new purchases. And then in terms of sort of the Michigan market overall, we really have not seen any pullback. I think the activity that you\u2019re seeing with the larger car manufacturers is having a halo impact across the Michigan market.","The Detroit market certainly is enjoying some resurgence, both in terms of job creation, real estate values, et cetera. The auto suppliers that we work with still are going very strong. And so we remain pretty optimistic about Michigan at large, including Detroit.","Ken Usdin","Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up, just on the mortgage side. You guys have now almost 3\/4 of your originations are purchased. But given that switch to purchase and expected purchases, I think you\u2019re still expecting to grow in MBA. Do you still think that, that book will be down? You can\u2019t outgrow that with just your better mix?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, we\u2019re heading into the spring-summer buying season, and so from a mix perspective, that will help us a great deal. But just the decline we saw in the first quarter was larger than we normally experience, it\u2019s possible that there were some clients that sort of pushed refinances into the fourth quarter, so that might have sort of helped volume in the fourth quarter, but hurt volume in the first quarter. And so while we\u2019re expecting that business to grow for the remainder of the year, we\u2019re overcoming sort of the headwinds we had in the first quarter. But to your point, the fact that we are more oriented towards purchase money will definitely help in the spring-summer buying season.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Curtis Farmer","Good morning.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the deposit side, when you start to see repricing kick in and betas kick up, where do you expect to see it coming through first?","David Duprey","That\u2019s been question that is often posed. Remember, we\u2019re really in uncharted water here. We\u2019ve been in these very low rates for a very long period of time. There is substantial liquidity in the system. Once that liquidity begins to be utilized through economic expansion, then I suspect, at that point, we\u2019ll begin to see those betas begin to actually move. As I said numerous times, we\u2019ll continue to say we\u2019re not looking to be the leader in repricing. We\u2019ll certainly be competitive. We\u2019ve always been competitive. And quite frankly, that\u2019s just the way we\u2019re going to follow it.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then on the decline in balances in 1Q, can you just kind of help us understand how much of that drop is the normal seasonality? It looked like a pretty big decline. Does that sort of close to $2 billion drop in average deposits? Is that what you normally see in the first quarter? Or was there some competition taking deposits away and you just chose not to reprice to hang onto them?","David Duprey","I\u2019m certainly not aware of competition pulling that away from a pricing perspective. We do typically see declines in the first quarter. I think it is important to note that this quarter actually was a $1 billion improvement over where it was a year ago. Now remember, a year ago, we actually intentionally encouraged some deposits to exit because of the lack of capability, if you will, in terms of how they\u2019re treated under the LCR calculations. We did not have that repeat here this particular quarter.","Ralph Babb","Yes. And a lot of that volatility, those are corporate customers that we see.","David Duprey","Yes, that could have temporarily park some very substantial balances at the end of the year and they tell us in advance, but those will be with us for a week, 2 weeks and they\u2019re going to move them out, and that\u2019s very typical of what we see in December. And then in early January, those ones move up.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you.","David Duprey","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Good morning. Dave, just actually a follow-on question on the deposit base. So I think in your prepared remarks, you had made some comments about the way you sort of trended toward the end of the quarter, which looks like sort of a favorable outlook for the year. Is your sense that loan growth will outstrip deposit growth this year? Or do you see sort of such appetite on the deposit side that deposit growth would maybe even be stronger than loan growth for the full year?","David Duprey","Quite frankly, I hope that loan growth isn\u2019t that stronger than deposit growth. We are sitting on, as you well know, a considerable amount of excess liquidity. Deposits are so difficult to predict because, again, we tend to see large movements with some of these very large corporate customers. But on balance, I assume as the economy continues to grow, you\u2019re going to begin to see in the industry an amount of that excess liquidity begin to be deployed into the businesses.","Ralph Babb","I think that will begin to happen, too, if in \u2013 if uncertainty continues to improve overall because \u2013 I think right now, as was said earlier, that there\u2019s a lot of caution out there. People are waiting and watching to see, although the U.S. consumer confidence picked up, and that could help in a number of ways, especially the auto industry.","Scott Siefers","Yes. Okay, perfect. And then maybe if I could switch gears just secondly. Maybe, Pete, on the energy portfolio, I mean, everything is pointing in the right direction. We\u2019ve got some stabilization in prices. Do you have a sense for how rapidly you would be willing to draw down that \u2013 the roughly 7% reserve here as we continue to look forward?","Pete Guilfoile","Scott, as you know, we\u2019ve been releasing reserves on energy now for a few quarters and a lot of that has really been as a result of payoffs and pay-downs. Now we\u2019re starting to see the risk rating upgrade. And I think you\u2019re going to see that happen in an even bigger way this quarter. We have the redetermination process occurring this quarter. And of course, a lot of these credits are Shared National Credits, so they\u2019re a little bit sticky to upgrades. So that whole process will probably take us through the end of the year.","So I think throughout the end of the year, we\u2019ll be \u2013 as long as energy prices remain relatively stable, we\u2019ll be seeing upgrades and pay-downs approved as credits. And therefore, there will be an opportunity for us to release more reserves on Energy. The amount of those though are dependent upon a lot of factors, including loan growth. And as you know, we had a \u2013 our first quarter is the seasonal down quarter for us in terms of loan growth. We\u2019re hoping we\u2019re going to see a fair amount of loan growth the rest of the year. So some of that released reserves in Energy will get absorbed by, hopefully, some loan growth.","Scott Siefers","Okay. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you guys very much.","Ralph Babb","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Dave Rochester","Hey, good morning guys. Just back on the deposits, not to beat a dead horse, but I know balances were down a little bit last year on both an average and in a period basis and were down this quarter as well. I know there\u2019s some seasonality. I know these are a little tough to predict, but it just sounds like you\u2019re thinking deposit growth trends could continue to be somewhat challenged just given the use of liquidity by businesses as the economy continues to ramp up, as you mentioned. So should we expect at this point deposits decline this year as well maybe a little bit more just given that ramp-up in the economy?","David Duprey","I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume, Dave, that if the economy continues to grow, if \u2013 and those funds do get deployed, that, yes, you could see some drop in those deposit levels. Hopefully, in our case, we see that also move into loan growth as well. But obviously, time will tell. But I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that, at some point, we\u2019re going to start to see those deposit levels begin to decline.","Dave Rochester","I know you have to maintain a certain level of HQLA. How much cash can you reallocate into funding loan growth over time?","David Duprey","We haven\u2019t disclosed our specific percentage, but let me simply say, I\u2019m not concerned about that at this time.","Dave Rochester","Okay. So maybe we see a little bit of cash flowing in, so loan growth incrementally over time, and then the rest will be funded by, I guess, wholesale funding?","David Duprey","Exactly. As Ralph just said, if you didn\u2019t hear him, if you see on one of the slides there, we indicate our loan-to-deposit ratio is at 82% here a moment.","Dave Rochester","Yes. And so in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about funding on the wholesale side, given your asset sensitivity, are you primarily looking at funding with overnights, or would you term some of that out a bit?","David Duprey","We have a variety of options depending on the need and what we see in terms of loan growth, what type of loan growth, et cetera, will drive how we make that determination.","Dave Rochester","Okay. But safe to say it will probably be a mix?","David Duprey","I think that\u2019s reasonable.","Ralph Babb","And we\u2019ve done that through a lot of ups and down over the years to manage that.","Dave Rochester","Okay. Thanks guys.","David Duprey","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thank you. Good morning.","David Duprey","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Question on the asset \u2013 sorry, in the deposit beta, the Slide 13 that you guys have. The $85 million from the December rate hike, you\u2019re assuming a zero deposit beta, but a 25% deposit beta for the March hike. I just want to make sure like the way I would understand that, that\u2019s just conceptual, right? Because there\u2019s \u2013 I believe that there\u2019s probably no fundamental reason why once you have zero beta, once you a 25% beta, like your rates go up and say, I don\u2019t know, September, they\u2019re all going to kind to have \u2013 they\u2019re all going to be impacted in the same way. Is that the right way to think about it?","David Duprey","I wouldn\u2019t disagree with that.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. So it\u2019s \u2013 and this is just right now what your sort of best guess is, assuming low betas over the course of the year? Okay.","David Duprey","We\u2019re trying to provide a conservative outlook.","Ralph Babb","Right.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay. And then just a quick question on the Energy portfolio. Obviously, oil has been pretty stable. You\u2019re releasing reserves. Things are better. In terms of loan growth in Energy, is it a matter that there\u2019s just not enough demand to grow Energy loans more aggressively? Or is this more of a risk issue on your side that you don\u2019t want to grow Energy loans? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","That\u2019s a very good question for us. And over time, we will grow it. It\u2019s a matter of balancing it with the overall portfolio. Curt, do you want to add to that?","Curtis Farmer","No, I think you said it well, Ralph. It is a good customer base for us, and we\u2019re going to take care of our good customers. And we are seeing some, what we call, new to existing opportunities as well as some selective new to new opportunities in the energy space. But also, as Dave said earlier, asset sales, tapping the capital markets, et cetera, these companies that are still in existence are a lot stronger than they were before. They have more options available to them, and so there is a of supply-and-demand factor at play. But again, we are seeing some select new opportunities.","We do believe that the \u2013 if oil prices stay where they are or in this range, if rig counts stay high, the net portfolio will start to level off here at some point in 2017.","Ken Zerbe","All right, great. Thank you.","David Duprey","Thank you.","Operator","You\u2019re next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Please go ahead.","David Duprey","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Ramsey","Hey, good morning, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on credit and reserve release, I guess, sort of taking your comments earlier and the guidance together, I guess it sounds like we should expect net charge-offs to exceed provision for the remaining three quarters of 2017. How should we think about the pace of that? With the spring redetermination, is more of that in the second quarter than the fourth? I mean, is it more sooner than later? Or is it kind of equal through the year?","Ralph Babb","Bob, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint it. Certainly, we expect the way redeterminations are going that there\u2019ll be a number of credits that we feel should be upgraded. And to the extent that we feel comfortable upgrading them this quarter depends on if they\u2019re Shared National Credits or not. And if they are Shared National Credits, yes, there is an additional process that we may feel like we need to go through to make sure that other people agree.","And so that process could take \u2013 could push off some of these upgrades. But also saying that there are credits that we\u2019re going through the process now that we probably aren\u2019t comfortable upgrading them yet. We want to see, perhaps, another couple of quarters of performance before we\u2019re going to upgrade them. So that\u2019s perhaps a long way of saying that I think the whole upgrade process could take us really through the end of the year as long as prices remain stable.","Bob Ramsey","Okay, fair enough.","David Duprey","You might want to comment just overall your feeling of how strong the portfolio is today.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, yes. We\u2019re seeing a lot of strength there. And we\u2019re \u2013 companies are deleveraging, and they\u2019re deleveraging kind of fairly quickly. They\u2019re showing they have the ability to raise capital. And they also have the ability to generate liquidity very quickly by selling assets. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of good things in the portfolio right now.","Bob Ramsey","Great. One other question around loan growth. I know you guys talked a lot about borrower optimism and the pipeline. Industry-wide, it sort of seems like there\u2019s been a real deceleration in growth once you strip the seasonality out of it. I\u2019m just kind of curious, outside of the Energy and Mortgage Banker Finance books, if you think about year-over-year growth, have you all seen that same deceleration? Or have things gotten more stable?","Ralph Babb","I think you\u2019re seeing the stable to up slightly when the need is there. They are moving to take care of current demand, but not, in my terms, not investing in the future because the uncertainty that we were talking about earlier doesn\u2019t project that the economy is going to start growing at a more rapid pace than we are today. Robert Dye, our economist, when you look at the various markets we\u2019re in and if U.S. forecast is about 2.3% GDP and two to one gets to three, that\u2019s not a rapid increase to be thinking about for the future. Curt, do you want to add anything to that.","Curtis Farmer","No. I think when you \u2013 as you said, when you take out the seasonality of businesses, for us, that would be primarily our dealer business and Mortgage Banker Finance. If you look at more their core business lines for us, I think I said it earlier in the call, there\u2019s definitely more optimism and our pipelines are stronger than they were six months ago, 12 months ago, but there is still caution out there, and that\u2019s got to translate into volume for us, but we\u2019re having good conversations with customers. Some of those were in the early planning stages and some of those will translate into volume if we see the economy continue to grow and some of the things that are proposed by the administration may be coming to pass will help fuel that as well.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. And I guess, I know you said in March balances did start to grow again. Is it your expectation that in the second quarter, you all are at that sort of positive 1% to 2% year-over-year average balance growth in total, everything all together?","Curtis Farmer","I think we definitely feel more optimistic about the second quarter versus the first quarter just given some of the businesses that are seasonal in nature. Mortgage Banker Finance and dealer should kick in. But again, if you look at the pipeline we have right now and many of our core businesses, including the markets, Small Business, et cetera, then we are anticipating growth in the second quarter.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","On the loan growth side, just want to talk a little bit about your normalized expectation. So like as we see some of the benefit of, hopefully, some economic improvement under Trump and some business optimism materializing into loan growth, where do you think is a good normalized level in next year, should we say, when it comes to loan growth? Are you still expecting more like GDP? Or do you think now given the GEAR Up efforts and your rationalizing of your business base, everything, you could do GDP plus 100 basis points? Well, how would you describe that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, I think that always a good bellwether for us is to grow in line with GDP. And I think that's proven throughout various economic cycles to be the appropriate way to manage our balance sheet and protect us on the risk side as well. Having said that, at any given time, there are certain geographies and\/or certain business lines, it may grow at a higher rate than GDP. But when you average out the portfolio, you take into consideration some of the seasonality in our portfolio in line plus or minus slightly, GDP is a really good measure for us.","John Pancari","Okay. So that didn't change at all given the GEAR Up efforts and everything?","Curtis Farmer","No.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then, separately, in terms of betas, I know there's a lot of focus around what's going to happen\u2026","Ralph Babb","John, we're having a hard time hearing you.","John Pancari","Sorry, can you hear me better now?","Ralph Babb","Yes, John.","John Pancari","Okay, sorry. So on the beta set, I know there's a lot of focus on deposit betas, but how do you view the impact of intensifying loan pricing pressure? I know you've got some of the big universal banks like JPMorgan and some of the super-regionals that are dialing up competitive pressure. Is that something you expect could weigh on your ability to see rate hikes help your loan yield pricing as you move forward?","Ralph Babb","I think we've always seen the competitive environment and especially as Curt was talking about the slow growth environment that we've been in for the last number of years. And going forward, we are very focused on building relationships for the long term. And a lot of what we're doing in Europe supports that effort and provides additional tools to our people and additional time to our people to be able to develop those relationships. And that's not changing in the culture of our institution. And opportunities will be there. And appropriate pricing, people will pay for the type of services they get, and that's a very important, and it's a very important part of our model.","John G. Pancari","Okay. All right, thanks Ralph.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Kevin Alloway","Good morning. This is actually Kevin on for Jennifer this morning. Just a quick follow-up on Energy. Do you mind just providing the cumulative loss in the portfolio to date since oil started declining?","Ralph Babb","I'm sorry, could you repeat that question again.","Kevin Alloway","Sorry. Can you just give some detail on the cumulative loss in the portfolio since oil started declining?","David Duprey","Yes. I don't have that number in front of me at this time.","Kevin Alloway","Okay. And then maybe, what's a good target for the size of your Energy book going forward as a percentage of loans this year? Maybe trying to make it not as large as it was previously?","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to talk about the demand?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. We don't have a specific target that we're trying to hit. We \u2013 again, we're going to take care of our good clients. We like the business. We want to be in the business. Having said that, I think we're comfortable where we are for the time being. And that, I think, is about 4% of our total loan portfolio.","Kevin Alloway","Perfect. Thank you.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.","David Eads","Hello. Good morning. Maybe another just quick Energy follow-up. When you guys gave the provision outlook for the rest of the year, is that just assuming that the energy reserve, that the reserve releases come down \u2013 or come out related to the shrinking in the portfolio and the potential upgrades? Or does that embed some level of reducing the reserve percentage from the 7% it is now?","Ralph Babb","Yes. David, it would be both. We expect that we're going to be reducing reserves on the Energy portfolio as a percentage of the entire portfolio. And that will be as a result of some payoffs and pay-downs, which certainly reduces the denominator, but also as a result of upgrades. And that's really where you get the acceleration in \u2013 we think a reduction in reserves is when you start to see the upgrades.","David Duprey","Actually, you're seeing things even on the criticized side and non-accrual side that are acting very favorably for the future.","Pete Guilfoile","That's right. And absolutely. And so those credits, we expect that our criticized levels, probably by the end of the year, will be significantly lower than where they are now, which is still relatively high levels, 45%.","David Eads","All right, great. That's helpful. On a different note, on expenses, if I strip out the restructuring charges this quarter, I've got you right at a 60% efficiency ratio for the quarter. And just kind of thinking going forward, if the revenue outlook is a little bit better, are there areas where you guys might consider increasing investments and sort of thinking about expenses and efficiency more from the efficiency ratio standpoint and potentially investing more? Or are you guys pretty set on thinking about it from the expense dollar standpoint?","Ralph Babb","I think we're pretty set on \u2013 when we went through the whole GEAR Up process, we were looking at our model from a growth perspective and what we wanted to do in the future and rightsizing and making sure that we were putting our expenses in the most efficient way in the businesses that were most important and the support to those businesses. So I think it all falls in line is we're moving forward. Curt?","Curtis Farmer","I might just add, Ralph, that in addition, part of our GEAR Up focus was to look for opportunities to do things better, smarter and faster and look at simplification opportunities for some of the tasks today that might be weighing on our relationship managers that we could remove from them to create more capacity. So we feel good about our ability to increase volume on the lending side, on fee income side, et cetera, with the staff we have in place now because we have really looked at fundamentally changing with the way that we do business today, freeing up more capacity with our salespeople.","David Eads","All right. Thanks for taking the questions.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brett Rabatin","Hey, good morning. Wanted to just go back to the tax rate actually and just the guidance around that. You're essentially saying with the 43% for the rest of the year, no obvious additional impact from stock options and restricted stock. Would it not be fair to assume that there would be some impact from that in the next few quarters? Or can you give us some more color around what might transpire there?","David Duprey","Yes. Brett, the challenge there is, to be quite frank, we can't really predict stock option exercises. The best thing, that typically occurs in the first quarter, so we wouldn't expect anything through the balance of the year in terms of vesting of awards. It would strictly be a result of option activity, which is totally driven by stock price and employee or formal employees, retirees desire to process a few transactions.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. So restricted stock for the rest of the year, this thing is limited?","Ralph Babb","I believe, it's exclusively first quarter here, first quarter of 2017 and begin now first quarter of 2018.","Brett Rabatin","Okay, great. And then also, I want to follow up on Technology and Life Sciences, kind of flattish linked quarter. It seems like there's been some softer industry trends in that business maybe in 1Q. Can you give us an outlook and then just what you guys saw in the first quarter?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. I'd say that TLS states overall, the component that we have continued to see growth within has been our Equity Fund Services where we provide capital call and subscription lines to venture capital and private equity firms. So that business has consistently been growing for us. On more the traditional Technology and Life Sciences business, we saw some calls 12, 6 months ago in the business with a little bit of slowdown. But I would say activity has definitely picked back up. The [indiscernible] markets were stronger than they were. So we are anticipating growth overall in TLS when you balance toward the traditional business and the Equity Fund Services business on a go-forward basis. I don't have a specific growth target that I would share with you, but we continue to feel very good about that business longer term.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. Great, thanks for color.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin with Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Scott Valentin","Good morning.","Curtis Farmer","Good morning.","Scott Valentin","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on Commercial Real Estate. It's not a big part of the portfolio, but the retail is about 11% of Commercial Real Estate. And given the pressure we're seeing in that segment, any trends you're seeing? Any concerns you have maybe with vacancies or rental rates?","Pete Guilfoile","No, actually, our Commercial Real Estate portfolio is performing extremely well. And it's heavily weighing toward Class A multifamily construction, and we like that a lot because particularly how it performs not only in the good times, but in the downturns as well. We do have a small amount of retail, but the vast majority of that retail is in what we call neighborhood shopping centers, so vis-\u00e0-vis the construction of small shopping centers, the patrons of which are within 5 miles of the center. It's the grocery stores, restaurants, hair salons, that type of tenants. And that portion of retail actually has been holding up pretty well and that would be a very large majority of that retail segment.","Ralph Babb","You might talk just a little bit about the customer base, the long-term customers that we do business with. Peter","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, yes. We're highly selective in terms of the developers that we're doing business with. And I would say we're especially very selective about the developers that we're doing business with in the retail space. It's a small handful of developers who are very high caliber, very strong and have proven track records.","Ralph Babb","It seems a lot of equity now compared to the past as well upfront.","Pete Guilfoile","That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.","Scott Valentin","And just on Commercial Real Estate, any thoughts there? It's about, I guess, almost $5 billion. It's been pretty stable. Any thoughts that maybe given sounds like more equity, maybe underwriting is a little \u2013 is more positive from your perspective? Are you getting more down payment, maybe terms are better? Is there any thought to maybe increase that lending segment? ","Ralph Babb","Well, one of the things that's very important to us is the thing that Pete was just talking about, it's our long- term customer base that we have done business with for a long time and have a good relationship. There is a lot of upfront there, and we're there for them. But \u2013 and they are doing new projects and moving forward, and we'll continue to provide for them and others that we know that have been not as aggressive during the period.","Scott Valentin","Okay, all right. And then just a quick follow- up. Another way to think maybe about deposit pricing. I think, Ralph, you mentioned that the loan deposit ratio is around 82%. At what point \u2013 or how high can you drive that? And secondly, at what point do you think that starts to put pressure on your deposit pricing that you still have to pay up maybe to keep deposit growth?","Ralph Babb","Well, I think, if we see the economy pick up and you start to see demand pick up, then I think we go into the mode that we've been in the past in funding and layering in the funding that is there. The competition for deposits will go up as well. And that's part of the reason we use the beta and talk about the beta going forward. But we've done it many times in the past. And it's hard to predict exactly how that will happen and how fast it will happen, but we're prepared to appropriately do the funding that we need.","Scott Valentin","Okay. And how high would you let the loan deposit ratio drift? Could it going to be 95%, or is that too high?","Ralph Babb","We really haven't set a point for that. If you go back in history, and I know history was a long time ago, at this point in time, it was not unusual to see banks above the 100%. I'm not sure that, that will happen today.","Scott Valentin","Okay. Thanks very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Terry McEvoy","Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first one would \u2013 is it safe to assume that Comerica would expect to see a similar increase in loan yields from the rate hike we just had in March here in the second quarter, and that's based on what we just saw in Q1 following the December rate hike? A ","Ralph Babb","The only caution I would put to that, Terry, is at the moment, LIBOR is actually trailing that FHLMC rate rise. It's about 3.5, 4 basis points behind at the moment. We hope to see that gap close, but again, there's a lot of liquidity in the system, so that would be the only factor at this point. It's not a huge number, but it's certainly an impact.","Terence James","Terry McEvoy","Thanks. And then as a follow-up, do you expect to complete the remaining authorization on the buyback, the $139 million? And I mean, the average diluted share count had some changes in Q1. Any sense for what that number will be here in the second quarter?","David Duprey","Well, first of all, I'm highly confident that we will complete the remainder of that CCAR plan, that remaining $139 million at this point. Share count, obviously, that buyback absolutely will be impacted somewhat by the stock price. And then, again, in terms of actual shares outstanding, it's hard to predict how activity could impact that. It's fully baked into the dilutive number today, although, again, that's impacted by share price.","Terry McEvoy","Understood. Thanks.","David Duprey","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Just on the capital, it had a very nice solid increase in the first quarter. And I'm just wondering, 2-part questions. Do you guys target a capital ratio? And then, secondly, I'm just curious how you think about dividends versus buybacks. Because I look at the dividend payout ratio and you're a little bit below peers, and I'm just wondering how you think about that.","Ralph Babb","We haven't set a target that we've disclosed. But historically, we've been very aggressive at returning both in dividends and on the buyback side and would foresee that we will continue to be aggressive with the opportunities that avail themselves.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then just a separate question. The loan pipeline, which had a very nice increase, can you talk about what's driving that increase? And then secondly, have you seen Small Business also contribute to that loan pipeline?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. It is broad based, as I said earlier, across our business lines and across our geographies. So it would include Small Business, as you just mentioned, Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate, Technology and Life Sciences, even some of our national businesses like our U.S. banking business line. And also, in our \u2013 as we head into the seasonal spring-summer, in our seasonal businesses as well, dealer and Mortgage Banker Finance. So I wouldn't point to one business, it's sort of outrunning another, but it is broad based across our business lines and across our geographies.","Peter Winter","Okay, thanks. Nice quarter.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Hi, Brian.","Brian Klock","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Just a real quick question then. Thinking about commercial loans and the Dealer Floor Plan book and your C&I book, so the first quarter was down a little bit, but then usually you guys have the pickup in the second quarter as more the lots get that a lot.","Just wondering if you think about \u2013 when we think about second or third quarter also, as usually when you get to pay-downs, when obviously, with the strong summer season, you get to selling off the lots, but it seems like the cars are sitting on the lots longer, so maybe just give us your thoughts on where you think that Dealer Floor Plan book might do, do you think it may actually not decline as much even though car sales are expected to decline a little bit this year? I guess, where your thoughts on the Dealer Floor Plan book.","Ralph Babb","Well, I think as Curt was talking about earlier, it really depends on demand. And we saw the consumer sentiment picked up a bit. If that flows through, you'll see, I think, a buying increase in cars. If it doesn't, then as you said and Curt said earlier, it will cause a slowdown and you will see more on the lots for longer. It really depends what overall. Curt, do you want to add anything to that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, it\u2019s difficult to predict. The third quarter is normally when we see some pullback and then we start seeing some acceleration into the fourth quarter as the new model year starts rolling out. And assuming that these SAR rates would hold and the consumer confidence that Ralph alluded to earlier, then we would expect there to be decent volume across the industry in 2017. As I said earlier, for the short term, if there is a slowdown, you don't necessarily see a drop-off in volume as cars just sit in the lot a little bit longer. But that does eventually is where it will work its way out if you see a significant downturn. But again, the SAR rate that's anticipated for the year, it's still very high on a relative basis.","Brian Klock","Great. Thanks for your time guys.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","I will now turn the conference back over to Ralph Babb, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","Ralph Babb","I would like to thank everyone for your time and your interest in Comerica, and I hope you all have a great day.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Darlene Persons. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.","Darlene P. Persons","Thank you, Monserat. Good morning, and welcome to Comerica's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Vice Chairman of the Business Bank, Lars Anderson; and Chief Credit Officer, John Killian. A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC's website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com.","As we review our second quarter results, we will be referring to the slides, which provide additional detail on our earnings.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements, and in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause future results to vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement contained in this release issued today, as well as Slide 2 of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our filings with the SEC.","Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures. And in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph, who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph W. Babb","Good morning. Today, we reported second quarter 2013 earnings of $0.76 per share or $143 million compared to $0.70 per share or $134 million for the first quarter of 2013. Average loan growth, fee income growth, expense control and continued solid credit quality contributed to our 9% increase in earnings per share in the second quarter.","Turning to Slide 4 and other highlights. Average total loans grew $276 million compared to the first quarter, and reflected an increase of $337 million or 1% in commercial loans. Our Middle Market business lines across all 3 of our major geographies were the key contributor to our loan growth in the second quarter. Overall, customers remain cautious but relatively more positive in this slow-growing economy. Average total deposits increased $756 million or 1% in the second quarter, primarily reflecting an increase of $570 million or 3% in noninterest-bearing deposits.","Net interest income remained relatively stable in the second quarter, declining $2 million as the contribution from an additional day in the quarter and loan growth were offset by the decline in accretion on the acquired portfolio and the impact from continued shifting loan portfolio dynamics. The net interest margin decreased 5 basis points, primarily due to lower accretion on the acquired loan portfolio and lower loan yields due to the continued mix shift in the portfolio.","Credit quality was solid in the second quarter, with net charge-offs of 15 basis points, which is the lowest level since the first quarter of 2007. Nonaccrual loans also decreased, as did watch list loans. These positive metrics are indicative of our strong credit culture and have resulted in a $3 million decrease in the provision for credit losses.","Noninterest income increased $8 million in the second quarter to $208 million, reflecting broad-based growth in several categories, as well as an annual incentive received from our third-party credit card provider.","Noninterest expenses of $416 million in the second quarter were unchanged from the first quarter, reflecting our continued tight expense controls.","Our capital position continues to be a source of strength to support our growth. We repurchased 1.9 million shares in the second quarter under our share repurchase program, and combined with dividends, returned 72% of second quarter net income to shareholders.","On July 2, the Federal Reserve approved its final version of the Basel III capital rules. We estimate that our June 30, 2013, Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio is 10.1% on a fully phased-in basis. This is well in excess of the minimum requirement to be considered well-capitalized, and assumes we elect to exclude most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income.","Turning to Slide 5, and a look at our footprint.","We are well-positioned in our primary markets, where our relationship-based approach and experience combined to make a positive difference for our customers. Our strategy is to have balance between our markets, and we are making meaningful progress. Texas continues to be a growth leader for the U.S. economy, with strong high-tech and energy sectors. Job growth is well above the U.S. average on a percent change year-over-year basis. We continue to leverage our standing in Texas as the largest U.S. commercial bank headquartered in the state. Average loans in Texas were up 7% year-over-year.","California residential real estate markets are quickly improving, and home prices are increasing in all major metropolitan areas. Many homeowners are experiencing increased wealth, providing broad-based support to the state's economy. Job growth in California is above the U.S. average on a percent change year-over-year basis. Average loans in California were up 10% year-over-year and average deposits were up 4%.","Increased auto production and sales have strengthened the Michigan economy. June auto sales reached the 15.9 million unit rate, the highest level in over 5 years. Residential real estate markets in Michigan are stabilizing statewide and home prices are increasing. And according to the National Association of Manufacturers, Michigan is the top state for manufacturing job creation from December 2009 to March 2013. Texas ranked second. Average loans in Michigan were relatively stable year-over-year, while deposits grew 5%.","In closing, we remain focused on growing revenue in the slowly expanding economy. Our relationship strategy is working well in this low rate environment, as evidenced by growth of loans, deposits and fee income. Also contributing to our strong shareholder payout were our tight expense management and solid credit performance.","And now I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen L. Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning. Turning to Slide 6. As Ralph mentioned, total average loan growth was $276 million or 1% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting a continued increase in commercial loans and a slowing of the decline in Commercial Real Estate loans.","As you can see, positive trends continued with period-end loans greater than the average in the second quarter. Period-end loans increased $392 million from the end of the first quarter to $45.5 billion.","By line of business, Middle Market loans across all 3 major geographies were a key contributor to our loan growth in the second quarter. In fact, average loans grew $250 million in our National Dealer business and $213 million in our general Middle Market business.","And looking at trends, loans in our general Middle Market business have increased 5 of the past 6 quarters, with the largest increases in the last 2 quarters. Somewhat offsetting that growth, we did have a $270 million decline in Corporate Banking, which is one of the most competitive segments and reflects our desire to maintain our pricing discipline.","Loan yields, shown in the yellow diamonds, declined 7 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the expected decline in purchased loan accretion, as well as the continued mix shift of our portfolio. Total loan commitments increased almost $1 billion as of June 30, with commitments increasing in all major markets and nearly all business lines.","Also, line utilization increased to 48.2% from 47.7% at the end of the first quarter.","Finally, our loan pipeline increased to the highest levels since the first quarter of 2012. In fact, it is more than 10% higher than last quarter with increases noted in most business lines.","Continuing with loans on Slide 7. By type, as opposed to line of business, average commercial loans were up $337 million and were the main driver of our loan growth. On the top portion of the bar, Mortgage Banker Finance, which provides mortgage warehouse lines, saw average loans increase almost $100 million this past quarter. As we have noted before, Mortgage Banker outstandings can be variable, and we expect that they will moderate as mortgage refinance volumes slow, in line with the Mortgage Bankers Association forecast.","The pace of decline in Commercial Real Estate loans continued to slow. In fact, as depicted in the chart on the right, the combined commercial mortgage and real estate construction average loans decreased $67 million, down from a decrease of $106 million in the first quarter and $241 million in the fourth quarter of last year.","Breaking the bar into pieces, developer Commercial Real Estate has stabilized at $3 billion and is showing signs that it is starting to grow. In fact, commitments to developers have increased for the past 6 quarters, and construction loans grew for the third consecutive quarter, up $102 million in the second quarter with demand improving. Offsetting that growth, projects are moving quickly to the permanent long-term financing market upon completion before the construction loan can be converted to a mini perm mortgage on our books.","On the other hand, owner-occupied real estate, which makes up 72% of our Commercial Real Estate exposure, declined $131 million in the quarter. These real estate loans for the factories, warehouses and offices of our commercial customers continued to be impacted by amortization and refinancings to the long-term market. Our customers are growing and performing well, but remain cautious about expanding their facilities in the current economic environment.","As shown on Slide 8, our total average deposits increased $756 million or 1% to $51.4 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits grew $570 million, while interest-bearing deposits increased $186 million. Deposit pricing declined 2 basis points to 19 basis points, depicted in the yellow diamonds on the slide, as higher rate CDs matured and we have lowered rates on select products.","Average deposits in our Financial Services division, which provide services to title and escrow companies, increased $228 million after contracting about $700 million in the first quarter. And deposits in our Corporate Banking business increased almost $400 million due to tax-related seasonality. The same seasonality also impacted period-end deposits, which decreased $862 million.","Slide 9 provides details on our securities portfolio, which primarily consist of highly liquid, highly rated mortgage-backed securities.","The MBS portfolio averaged $9.4 billion in the second quarter, down $235 million from the first quarter as we purposely slowed the reinvestment of prepayments in April and May due to the unattractive, low yields that were available. At period-end, the balance of the MBS portfolio was $9.3 billion. The decline was mainly due to the slowing of reinvestments, as well as a decline in the fair value of the portfolio as a result of rising rates. The net unrealized gain on the portfolio was $10 million, a decrease of $219 million pretax or $139 million after-tax, and was recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI. With the rise in long rates and current rate expectations, we believe the pace of prepays will slow, with $500 million to $600 million in prepays expected in the third quarter. Consequently, at 4.1 years, the estimated duration on the portfolio increased from 3.4 years at the end of the first quarter. However, the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock remained relatively constant at about 5 years as a result of the composition of our portfolio and the fact that prepaid fees should stabilize. We will continue to manage our portfolio dynamically, taking into account many factors, including not only our loan and deposit expectations and the overall yields available, but also the duration and mark-to-market impact on our portfolio in a rising rate environment.","Turning to Slide 10. Our net interest income was relatively stable, declining $2 million in the second quarter. We've summarized in the table on the right the major moving pieces. One additional day in the quarter added $4 million to net interest income. Loan growth contributed $2 million and helped offset the effects of the low-rate environment. Lower funding costs, including debt maturities in the second quarter, as well as lower deposit costs, added $1 million and provided a 1 basis point increase to the margin. Offsetting these positive contributions was a $4 million decline in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, which had a 3 basis point impact on the margin. We have about $38 million of total accretion remaining to be realized on the acquired portfolio. Accretion should continue to trend downward each quarter, and we expect to recognize about $25 million to $30 million in 2013. While we remain focused on holding loan spreads for new and renewed credit facilities, there are still mix shift dynamics impacting the portfolio. These include higher-yielding commercial mortgage loan shrinking, while lower-yielding C&I loans are growing and older fixed-rate loans are maturing.","In addition, 30-day LIBOR declined over 0.5 basis point in the quarter. As a reminder, approximately 85% of our loans are floating rate, of which 75% are LIBOR-based, predominantly 30-day LIBOR. All of these factors combined had a $4 million or 2 basis point impact on the net interest margin.","Dynamics in the securities portfolio, including prepayments that were reinvested at lower yields, as well as a lower average balance, had a $1 million or less than 1 basis point negative impact.","And finally, average excess liquidity increased almost $300 million, decreasing the net interest margin by 1 basis point. We believe our asset-sensitive balance sheet remains well-positioned for rising rates. Based on our historical experience and asset liability model, we believe a 200 basis point increase in rates over a 1-year period, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result in more than a 10% increase in net interest income of approximately $185 million.","Turning to the credit picture on Slide 11. Credit quality continues to be strong in the second quarter. Net charge-offs decreased to $17 million or 15 basis points of average loans. The charts on the right show our watch list loans declined $224 million and our nonperforming loans declined $44 million. With the decline in nonperforming loans, the allowance to NPLs increased to 130%. And the $613 million allowance covers our trailing 12 month net charge-off over 5x, as you can see on the lower left chart. As a result of the continued positive trends in our credit metrics, our provision for credit losses declined $3 million from the first quarter to $13 million.","Finally, we received the annual Shared National Credit or SNC exam results at the end of June. They are reflected in our second quarter results and were not significant.","Slide 12 outlines the $8 million increase in noninterest income.","Second quarter customer-driven fees increased $4 million due to broad-based increases across most customer-driven fee income categories, including a $3 million increase in customer derivative income. This was partially offset by a $2 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts from the seasonally high first quarter level.","Noncustomer related categories increased $4 million to $20 million, primarily due to a $6 million annual incentive received from our third-party credit card provider. This was partially offset by a securities loss of $2 million.","Turning to Slide 13. We continued to maintain tight expense control, which resulted in stable expenses in the second quarter. Salaries expense decreased $6 million, reflecting a slightly smaller workforce, seasonally higher stock compensation in the first quarter and decreases in incentive compensation. This was partially offset by the impact of merit increases and 1 additional day in the quarter. Offsetting the decline in salary expense in the second quarter, we had a $4 million write-down on other foreclosed assets and a $2 million increase in outside processing fees, primarily due to increased activity tied to revenue growth and the outsourcing of certain functions.","Going forward, there are 3 extra days in the second half of the year, which will impact our salary expense. In addition, we expect to incur additional salary, software and consulting expenses related to regulatory compliance, predominantly stress testing, particularly as we migrate to becoming a full CCAR bank this year. In addition, occupancy expenses are typically seasonally higher in the second half of the year.","Moving to Slide 14 and shareholder payout. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares under our share repurchase program. Combined with the dividends paid, we returned 72% of net income to our shareholders in the second quarter. We believe our shareholder payout is a reflection of our strong capital position. Shares repurchased were mostly offset by the impact of share dilution from warrant and employee options, resulting from the increase in our stock price during the quarter.","We are pleased that the Basel III capital rules have been finalized. We believe we are already well above the required minimum to be considered well-capitalized, with an estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common capital ratio of 10.1% at June 30 on a fully phased-in basis, assuming we elect to exclude the impact of AOCI.","Finally, turning to Slide 15 and our outlook. Our expectations for full year 2013 compared to full year 2012 remain unchanged from what we outlined on our call in April, with the exception of provision. We are now expecting the provision and net charge-off to decline from last year's levels, with both these levels in the second half of the year similar to the first half. Based on current trends, we believe we should see continued improvement in credit quality, partially offset by loan growth.","In this slow-growing economy, we will continue to focus on the things we can control, allocating resources to our faster growing markets and industry segments, driving cross-sell opportunities and carefully managing expenses.","In closing, we are pleased with our loan deposit and fee income growth, tight expense management, solid credit performance and strong shareholder payout. We remain keenly focused on delivering a growing bottom line.","Now we are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see if you can give us some color on loan pricing. What you're seeing in your markets, if you're seeing any ability there to price better, given the steepness in the curve, at all?","Ralph W. Babb","Okay. Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. John, so as you know, we typically price with the shorter end of the yield curve, as Karen mentioned earlier. So as you're seeing a steepening in the yield curve, that hasn't had as much kind of impact on us. Obviously, the hiccup in the leveraged loan market did move, I think, some activity like to the shorter end of the yield curve, which helps senior bank debt. But overall, I don't think the interest rate shifts have really had any significant impact on us. And as you know, LIBOR really hasn't significantly changed. So we're staying very focused on our existing strategy. We haven't changed our pricing strategy at all, John.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Are you seeing any change in the competitiveness of some of your competing banks on that front at all or any room to improve pricing, just given any changes in the competitive landscape?","Lars C. Anderson","Well, I would say that we have continued to see a very aggressive marketplace in terms of pricing. And if I look back a couple of quarters ago to today, I would say that it has gotten relatively more aggressive. We do see durations getting stretched on a number of facilities, and that's pretty active across a number of our businesses. So we're continuing to just focus on our discipline, our product, and what we do and feel very comfortable. We're getting the kinds of returns that are attractive to our shareholders, and we're going to stick to our guns with that, John. And -- but I don't see it as an opportunity for us to significantly increase spreads or yields, but I do think that we're very well-positioned with the businesses we have, the expertise we have, the markets that we have to continue to de-lever. And as you know, our loan spreads have largely held here over the last year.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, Karen, you're probably going to shoot me down on this. But on the margin, I wanted to see if we can get some just additional color on your thoughts there on the margin. Could we see a bottoming in the margin over the next couple of quarters here? And can you talk about the magnitude of compression that we might see?","Karen L. Parkhill","I laughed, John, because you're right. In terms of the margin, as you know, it's extremely difficult to predict, and the key variable there is excess liquidity, which can bounce the margin up and down, and just very difficult for us to predict. I would say, on net interest income, which does drive the margin, that you will continue to see a decline in the accretion benefit. We've mentioned that we expect to see $25 million to $30 million this year. We've seen $18 million so far, and that means we will continue to see a decline in the next 2 quarters, and that will impact the margin. We do expect loan growth to offset the decline that we've seen on our portfolio loan yield. We do expect that to continue, but eventually wane, and it's just difficult to predict, eventually, when that will turn around.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to start, regarding the slowdown of the reinvestment of securities in 2Q, where are you able to reinvest today, and have you started reinvesting that cash?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, Steve. We have started to reinvest. When rates did rise last month, we did move back in the market to purchase securities. Today, we're seeing yields in the 2.20 to 2.50 range.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And what duration would that be, Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","Similar duration to what we've got on the portfolio.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I'm curious, what impact has the stock market -- [indiscernible] and as the yield curve's steepening, what impact has that had on confidence, if any, of your business customers? Have you seen anything?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars, you want to comment on that?","Lars C. Anderson","Sure, yes. Steven, frankly, we haven't really seen a significant change in terms of, I would say, the wealth effect in terms of business owners. Where I think we've seen more activity there would probably be in our Wealth business. You may have noticed that our Wealth loan portfolio had nice growth, up almost $80 million. Our fiduciary fees, asset management fees continued to grow. Part of that, frankly, we have a -- we continued to enhance our collaboration, cross-sell across our platform and continue to work with those customers. Because if you think about it, many of our Middle Market companies that are private, privately-owned, they're feeling better. There are companies that are de-leveraging. They're creating liquidity and they're thinking about exit plans. And that's where we bring expertise to the table. So I think that, that's one of the areas where we've been able to really benefit, and I think that, that showed up in our numbers. But to answer your question specifically for business customers that we would see, say, in Middle Market banking, no, I haven't seen that.","Ralph W. Babb","I think you're still seeing a lot of uncertainty out there, just to add to what Lars was saying. And people were waiting and watching to see what's going to happen, and they're doing quite well on their current operations, but they just don't want to invest until they know what the outlook's going to be, including the many uncertainties that are there on particular items that will affect their earnings.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. I'd say cautious optimism is probably a pretty good description of the way they're feeling, but still dampening the investment at this point.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. Karen, just a final one for you. Can you help us think about the dollars of incremental expense related to the stress test, now that you'll be a CCAR bank?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, we will have dollars related to consulting expenses, additional headcount and some software expenses. I'm not giving out the exact dollar, but I will say that related to increased regulatory expenses, we will be spending about $15 million annually, a year just related to regulatory expenses. Some of that is already in our run rate, but not all of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question, just in terms of loan growth, obviously, we see your guidance that it's going to be slower, that's fine. My question, though, is how should we think about the interplay between Mortgage Banker, which has actually held up pretty well this quarter, and I guess my suspicion is just given the rising rates, given the slowdown refis, that actually could fall pretty materially in the back-half of the year versus growth in the rest of the portfolio?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. Absolutely, Ken. Yes, obviously, with a rising interest rate environment on mortgage rates, I think the 30 years is up now 4.5%. So that's clearly going to have, we believe, an impact to Mortgage Banking Association, as they're projecting a 39% decline in mortgage apps in the second half of the year, and clearly, we think that could help, would moderate some of our outstandings. I would underscore a couple of things though, Ken, that I think are important. Our business continues to become more granular. We continue to add more mortgage companies, which I think with those expanded facilities and commitments that we're seeing, that gives us a little bit more kind of insulation on the downside also. If you look at the volumes that we're doing today, if you go back a couple of quarters, our purchase volumes were 30%. Last quarter, and I'm talking about the first quarter, they were 50%. In the second quarter, they were 60%. That general migration towards a purchase volume concentration, I think, helps us, positions us well. We have very strong relationships with some large national builders that are giving us some good volume. And in addition to it, we're in some good growth markets like Texas, where the housing market continues to expand and we expect to gain more of the purchase volumes. So yes, could we see some moderation? I think it's a good observation, but I think we're going to manage the business to position ourselves for the long haul. We have great customers, some of the best cross-sell we have in the bank, and certainly, in the Business Bank in that particular business.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And then, when we think about the timing of the potential decline, I mean, is there enough carryover business from second quarter that locked in at the lower rates or should we actually see a pretty -- the steep declines starting fairly soon, meaning third quarter, and then, maybe stable in fourth?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. I'd say that, that would be very difficult to tell. There's a number of dynamics that actually impact the outstandings on these facilities, including the investor and the investor market. So I really couldn't give you a number there that would be helpful.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. But even with that decline in mind, do you guys still believe that slow but positive total loan growth is achievable in the third and fourth quarter, correct?","Karen L. Parkhill","We have not changed our loan growth outlook, that is correct.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on some of John's questions. I think -- or actually, my first follow-up question is, on the liquidity side, Karen, I appreciate that you've started to reinvest into this higher loan rate environment. How should we think about the proper level of liquidity for the bank going forward?","Karen L. Parkhill","We are positioned well with liquidity for the rising loan growth environment. We like that position because we do want to ultimately reinvest in loans. From an overall liquidity perspective, we are feeling very comfortable. We currently have a little bit less than $3 billion on deposit with the Fed, and that moves up and down depending on our overall balance sheet position. I don't know if you need more color, Erika.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess I'm just wondering, if I look at average balances, your cash with the Fed is about 7% of earning assets. If loan growth is normalizing and there are more reinvestment opportunities, can that level go down, and hopefully, margin?","Karen L. Parkhill","It certainly could go down. One of the things that we need to be mindful of, though, is the potential new rules coming out -- or new rules coming out on liquidity. Those have been proposed by the Basel committee, but have not yet been written in the United States, so we will be paying close attention to those and making sure that we are ultimately compliant with them.","Ralph W. Babb","I think the thing I would add to that as well is, things pick up and people get more positive, you will see that excess liquidity go down because people will begin to use it again to invest for the future, not only the consumer but also, our business customers.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I see. And the -- just switching topics a little bit. It seems like, given your reinvestment rate on the securities book, we should expect that we've, perhaps, hit a bottom on your bond yield, but could you remind us exactly where you're originating new loans in both Corporate Banking and Middle Market in terms of your spread to LIBOR?","Karen L. Parkhill","We don't give the origination yields out. But you should know that we are very focused on holding or increasing spreads everywhere that we can on new and renewed loans. It is something that we track every month and we have been successful.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. And Erika, I would just reinforce that, and I know you know this, but we take very much of a relationship approach. We're not just looking at the individual credit. We're looking at the entire relationship and what they're really bringing to Comerica, and the ability for that customer relationship to generate shareholder value. So that's -- obviously, credit is a key component of it, but we really take a relationship-type approach when valuing our customers.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood. And just 1 more question before I step out of the queue. Karen, have you given us an update on under the Basel III proposed rules, what your liquidity coverage ratio would be?","Karen L. Parkhill","We have not given that because the rules are really just proposed at the Basel level and still have a long way to go. They have yet to be written in the United States. We, and many other banks, if the rules are passed as drafted under Basel, would need to add liquidity. And it is something that we are very focused on, but we're waiting for rules to come in the United States.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Placet on Matt's team. First question, as it relates to the decline in period-end DDA balances this quarter, you pointed to some seasonality. I guess what specifically caused the seasonal drop this quarter?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Karen L. Parkhill","They were mainly tax-related seasonality due to company building up liquidity in order to pay certain tax bills, and that's why you saw a decline at period end, too.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then looking at expenses as it relates to your comments for personnel and occupancy expenses in the second half of the year, I was wondering if you could talk to the magnitude of the increase in those categories. And then is it safe to say that the level of expenses should drift higher versus the $416 million level this quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, we do expect expenses to be slightly higher, and that's due to 3 additional days in the second half than we've had in the first half, as well as increased headcount mostly related to stress tests and the fact that our occupancy expenses are seasonally higher in the second half than they are in the first half.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question on the $80 million premium amortization balance. What was the quarterly run rate that impacted net interest income in the second quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","Can you repeat your question, please?","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. On the premium amortization, I was wondering what the second quarter impact to that was, just thinking about that on a go-forward basis as durations could potentially extend.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, so about $9 million.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And does the duration of the premium amortization sort of match the available-for-sale securities portfolio?","Karen L. Parkhill","When we look at premium amortization every quarter, it is something that as interest rates have increased and the duration on our portfolio extends, we expect could increase a little bit, if that answers your question.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No, it does. And just one follow-up. What was the period-ending mortgage banker balance? And if you don't have that, maybe you can help us think about what was the quarterly change in the mortgage banker balance on a period-end basis, not an average basis?","Ralph W. Babb","Okay. Yes, so mortgage banking finance on a period-end basis was up $374 million. That was against an average of $78 million. One of the things that I would remind you is that, oftentimes, the ending period balances do spike. Typically, mortgage companies build up their inventory throughout the month and at the end of the quarter, would then sell off to investors. So the change was $374 million. And the ending balance for mortgage banker finance was $2.4 billion.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A question on the decline in Corporate Banking loan balances in the second quarter. You indicated it was largely competitively driven. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on that. And is it a trend that you expect to continue in that bucket?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Okay. Well, as I've shared on previous conference calls, as we look at the competitive landscape from a pricing structure, including duration of credit, as you go to the upper segments, clearly, Corporate Banking, that's where we've seen the most competition, frankly. And as we look back over the past quarter, it's been a tough market. It's been very, very aggressive. There's clearly excess liquidity. If you look at some of the syndicated credit market, there is a significant oversubscription in those facilities. And frankly, we're a company that is just not going to overreach. We are not going to trade off credit quality nor relationship pricing for volume. And so at times, you've got to make a difficult short-term decision on some credits. But I think for the long term, we're very well positioned. We've got some great customers in both U.S. banking and international. And I think from a long-term perspective, it's a great growth business for us. But in the short run, it's challenging. We are not going to overreach. This is not the time to do that.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","What do you think will offset that largely, Lars. Is it Middle Market and Dealer?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. We're very fortunate that we have a diversified geography between Michigan, Texas, California, with unique businesses even embedded in those markets, whether it's Automotive, Energy, Environmental Services, Technology and Life Sciences. And if you think about some of those businesses from a long-term perspective, they look very attractive. I think Energy, Technology and Life Sciences, you saw growth in Environmental Services this quarter. Our Small Business had its fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Wealth Management grew. And we continue to have a very stable growth in just kind of our general Middle Market. What I'd say is non-industry specific. And you put on top of all of that, what we're beginning to see is this turn in kind of our Commercial Real Estate line of business. The story looks pretty attractive for the long haul, I think, for us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple more questions on loans. Can you just remind us of the typical seasonal pattern of Dealer Floor Plan and just how underlying trends are going in that business?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Sure. Well, typically, what you would see, if you look at the calendar year -- over the years, you would see that inventories would build as you headed earlier in the year in the spring, and then you would see a very active sales season as you headed through the summer. That is both at -- frankly, the consumers are very active in buying, and also, you have an interest in our dealers and clearing the past year's model and making room for the new year model. So that's the typical seasonality that you would see in the business. But we didn't see that last year. So you've got to kind of keep that in mind. Now the second part of your question was about utilization rates. Utilization rates today are at near-record levels for us and I think for the industry, which is a reflection of the strength of the auto industry. You saw June's numbers come out, and annualized sales were 15.9 million units, which I think is very positive. One of the things that I keep a very close eye on is, as those inventories build, is how rapidly they're turning. And what we're seeing is inventories turn in that high 50 to low 60 to 80 kind of range, which over a long period of time is a very healthy number. So I like our business, I like the way that we're positioned and our inventory is turning and our business -- our dealers are doing very, very well. One note I would point out is that our margins on new models and used are getting compressed. It's a very competitive marketplace out there.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. And my second question is regarding -- on the Commercial Real Estate business, I'm just wondering how much more runoff you foresee. I know you point out in the deck that the rate of decline continues to slow, but we're still down another $300 million when I look at that total commercial loan number at $9 billion. So at what point do we get to stabilization there?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. So I think it's important to break apart the total commercial loan portfolio because you both have owner-occupied real estate, which frankly, if you think about a big part of our portfolio, Middle Market Banking, these are companies that are delevering. Their credit facilities are owner-occupied or amortizing. Maybe they're even paying them off. And the financing to those same companies is showing up in the expansion of other financing in Middle Market Banking, like revolving credit facilities, import, export facilities. So that could continue to decline. We just really don't know. I think as owner-occupied, as Middle Market companies begin to reinvest in the facilities and expand, then we'll see that grow. The other half of that Commercial Real Estate portfolio is really the professional developer, and this is what we oftentimes talk about. It's very focused on, oftentimes, multi-family. It's urban market oriented. It's the construction portfolio that Karen referenced earlier, as well as our national developer business that does business with some of the best and biggest homebuilders in the country, as well as REITs. And that part of our business, we're actually seeing growth. So I think that, that's very positive for us. And I would expect our Commercial Real Estate professional developer business to continue to grow as we get down on the road. We have very good pipelines in that business.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And last quick one just on, Ralph, your earlier comment about companies hopefully using their deposit at some point to invest. Karen mentioned that a lot of this quarter's deposit outflows were more seasonal. But I'm just wondering, underneath the surface, are you seeing any suggestion that companies are, in fact, either drawing down deposits to invest or contemplating drawing down deposits to invest versus taking up the incremental loan?","Ralph W. Babb","I think we've seen it in some businesses. I wouldn't call it a trend, but it has, at least, shown a glimmer of hope that investment is starting. Whether it's trend or not, we just don't know.","Lars C. Anderson","I think that's right. Where you primarily have seen a reduction in deposit balances has been in general Middle Market Banking. And frankly, that's when -- where we're seeing good, stable loan growth. So I think a number of those companies are putting now liquidity to work.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Sterne Agee.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was just hoping to follow up on capital and the provision. From a capital perspective, I was wondering, now that we're getting closer to having full clarity on ratios, what do you think about capital and sort of where things might normalize over the next few years? And then secondly, I just wanted to ask about the provision, and thinking about the guidance for a lower provision for the year and the back half of the year, assuming loan growth is moderate or slow as you indicated, if the provision level might be similar than it was relative to 2Q anyway.","Ralph W. Babb","Karen, you want to talk about capital?","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure. On capital, we are feeling good that now that the final rules are out, that our capital clearly complies with the rules if they were fully phased in and they don't fully phase in until 2019. So we remain very well capitalized. In terms of where things should normalize, we expect to continue to be well capitalized. And as our capital does grow, we expect to hopefully continue to pay back to shareholders. Does that answer...","Ralph W. Babb","John, do you want to...","John M. Killian","Talk about provision? Sure, I'd be glad to. I think it's helpful to look at the major proponents of the provision to get a more full understanding of this. So at 15 basis points, net charge-offs are well within the normal ranges, and we expect them to be similar for the rest of the year. We've made great progress in reducing NPLs, but they should still trend a little lower. They're 471 at the end of the second quarter versus 515 at the end of the first. We do expect loan growth to partially offset some of this improvement, which leads us to the bottom line that we expect net charge-offs and provision to look very similar in the second half of the year to our actual results in the first half.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe a better way to ask it is just that the relative level, assuming you're growing and where the reserve is today, even the credit is improving, would that provision not increase a little bit in the back half of the year relative to the second quarter?","John M. Killian","Very difficult to predict how much loan growth we're going to see, so we're pretty comfortable with the guidance that we've instituted today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a bigger picture loan growth question and then one follow-up. Just a question on the period-end loans being a bit higher, even the Mortgage Banker Finance and then the large increase in the pipeline that you discussed. Is there anything specific going on there? And what's the driver?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. Jon, I don't think there's anything that is specific on pretty much what you pointed out. It's what you would typically see. Mortgage Banking Finance and National Dealer were the 2 big drivers for the increase at the end of the quarter. Other than that, I would say it was business as usual.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the pipeline?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. The pipeline was up 10%. It was very broad based in terms of the growth. I think that, that was very positive. And in fact, there was kind of a reverse correlation in the number of businesses that maybe did not grow for the quarter. You saw some pretty good pickups in the pipeline. So I think that, that's a real positive. International finance was up, Technology and Life Sciences, National Dealer Services, Entertainment, Energy, our Middle Market businesses in Texas and Michigan, as well as U.S. banking. So it was very broad based, and we're encouraged with that. If you put that back against the fact that we increased our commitments for the whole portfolio by almost $1 billion in linked quarter, I think that, that paints a pretty positive picture, though, against what's going to be a competitive environment.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- this may be subtle but probably monumental from my point of view in that Michigan's no longer your largest loan market for the first time ever, I believe. How is the Michigan pipeline? You seemed pretty optimistic in terms of your prepared comments, but the balances have been a little bit flat. I'm curious how the pipeline is and how you view the loan growth potential of that market.","Ralph W. Babb","Michigan is a critical market for us long term. We have very high market shares, great long-term kind of relationships. And as you noted, I mean, in terms of total loan growth, we did not grow in Michigan, though, for the quarter, but in commercial loan growth, we did grow for the quarter. The automotive industry is certainly positively impacting that, so I feel great about the Michigan market. We've got some great bankers, great relationships. But it's clearly closely tied to the automotive industry. So it is -- continues to be a very large Middle Market business, though, for Comerica, and it's going to continue to be an important point of growth for us, I think, in the long haul. It's just not likely to have the same growth rates that you would find in Texas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello with UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Just a real quick question on the loan portfolio mix shift dynamics. Just kind of curious, given some of the turning that you're starting to see in the Commercial Real Estate segments, and do you necessarily need higher rates for that kind of headwind to turn into a tailwind? Or I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about those portfolio dynamics going forward.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. There are several things that are going on in the portfolio dynamics that we've talked about before. We've got -- although we only have 15% of our portfolio in fixed-rate loans, those do continue to mature. And we do have the mix shift that you talked about with Commercial Real Estate continuing to come down and C&I continuing to come up. That will eventually turn. As it turns, it will have a positive impact on both our loan growth and on our net interest income.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And so just given some of the trends that you're seeing, Lars, do you feel that's something that might be able to kind of happen in this year or is it something maybe farther out?","Lars C. Anderson","Well, frankly, in terms of the loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate line of business, I think a longer -- a higher longer-term rate is going to benefit us. You're going to see less activity of our developers moving their balances to the long-term financing market, and I think that's a real plus for us. It's interesting, cap rates have not moved at all. They continue to be very low, so it continues to be a very active market, and we're well positioned in the right markets.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you, got you. And then lastly for me, just on that jump in the pipeline, definitely good to see that. And would you characterize the pipeline still about 2\/3 coming from new customers still?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, it's actually declined just a little bit on new customers, just slightly. But I'd say largely, it's still slanted towards new customer relationships. But as I cautioned in the past, just looking at the percentage on pipelines of new versus existing is a little tricky because when you look at the pull-through of the pipeline, it tends to be at much higher multiples with existing customers versus new. And I'm talking multiples of 5x more likely to close business with an existing customer than with a new. But not a material shift, just slight.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First, Karen, you mentioned that premium amortization was $9 million in the quarter. Can you give us the quarter-over-quarter comparison? What was it the quarter prior?","Karen L. Parkhill","We were about the same quarter-to-quarter.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And in terms of your sensitivity to higher rates, I think you talked about roughly $185 million from 200-basis-point uptick. Can you just remind us, first, what are some of the underlying assumptions for that? And I know you have a slide that you put out in the quarter where you showed it could vary from 145 to 220, depending on what happens with some of the underlying assumptions. And given that we saw a 4% deposit outflows this quarter, I understand some of that is seasonal, how sensitive are we to further outflows of non-interest-bearing deposits?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, okay. Our rate sensitivity, as you know, is dynamic and does change. It has moved up over the last few quarters because we have greater non-interest-bearing deposits and greater amounts of floating rate loans. And I did share that chart sort of intra-quarter that showed the dynamics and the movement. On the sensitivities, yes, our interest rate sensitivity is based on the assumptions we put into it. Some of the key assumptions in that number are that we do expect deposits to decline. We do expect to have a mix shift in our deposits from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing as customers search for yield. So we do expect continued loan growth. We expect our securities portfolio to remain relatively stable, but we do expect our excess liquidity to decline but still remain in an excess liquidity position. When we showed the rate sensitivity intra-quarter, we did show that, that interest rate sensitivity could range depending on different deposit outflows and different loan growth. And those sensitivities yielded somewhere between $150 million increase to over $200 million increase depending on the various assumptions that we put in.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And can you just give us a sense of what you're assuming for competition in those underlying assumptions? I mean, I would assume that if we are to see a pickup, we could see further easing of standards and competition potentially compress spreads, but I would just be interested to hear your underlying assumption.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, we do assume that rates remain fairly steady from where they are today. There would be a little bit of competition built into that and so a little bit of pressure, but not a lot.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just get one quick follow-up. How much did loan utilization change x the warehouse?","Karen L. Parkhill","X the warehouse...","Lars C. Anderson","Okay. Yes. If you actually take out the warehouse, we were relatively stable.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just trying to get a sense on the employee count and kind of where we see that bottoming, where you're still trimming and what areas are you hiring and plan to hire going forward?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Our employee count is now just a little over -- a little under 9,000 employees versus slightly over last quarter. So there was a small change in employee count. We are hiring, as we mentioned, to help us work on the stress testing capital plan requirement. At the same time, as we see normal attrition and we try to be focused on being as efficient as possible everywhere that we can.","Ralph W. Babb","And we're very focused on our growing markets and making sure that in our appropriate products, we have the necessary expertise and people in place to capitalize on it.","Lars C. Anderson","Ralph, an example of that would be we are continuing to invest in our Technology and Life Sciences office. We opened a new office in Houston. We have a new one opening in New York. We're continuing to invest in our general Middle Market businesses and core markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","Just coming back to this capital question and what's the right level to run out long term. When I think about the Basel III progression, we kind of all came to grips a couple of years ago with the minimums and then this kind of buffer on the buffer concept emerged where banks would have to carry an extra 50 bps or so for mostly AOCI risk. With the AOCI opt out, I really should not kind of given the spot level you're going to run down to. But with the AOCI opt out, do you kind of get to throw away that buffer on the buffer concept or are there enough other things like the stress test uncertainty every year that you feel like even without AOCI to worry about it, it makes sense to carry an extra buffer?","Ralph W. Babb","I think you will have an extra buffer. The question is how much for us, longer term, as an individual bank. And we need some time to look at that as it phases in. And I think we will eventually get back to where we were before the downturn where we looked at and actually shared what our -- where we wanted to be from a capital standpoint so that investors understood what we were thinking about for payouts longer term.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And really just maybe just a quick follow-up on capital. I think we've asked you every question we possibly can on the past hour. So maybe I guess Karen and Ralph, thinking about the buyback, and obviously, buffers are -- now you guys have a significant amount of excess capital still, at least in my opinion, even when you get to Basel III. I guess maybe talk about the idea and your thought process with the buyback. And obviously, it was somewhat of a no-brainer when the stock is below tangible book, but given the run in the shares this year, I guess how are you thinking about the incremental capital you're deploying, the return you're getting on that growth organically versus the buyback and then even thinking about the potential for acquisitions, so maybe you can kind of talk about now how you're thinking about the buyback going forward.","Ralph W. Babb","Karen, you want to start?","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure, happy to. So we are disciplined around our buyback. We do look at it as a use of capital. And like any other competing use of capital, it should have an internal rate of return above our cost of capital. We do have an analysis and a model that looks at that, and we are disciplined about it. We're not going to tell you what the output of that model is, but we will say at the current stock price, we feel very comfortable continuing to buy back our stock.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess Ralph, I guess what do you think about potentials for acquisitions versus organic?","Ralph W. Babb","Well, first of all, I would say as I've said in the past, I'm very comfortable with where our footprint is today, both in California and Texas and Michigan. And therefore, internal growth is a very good strategy for us. That's not to say that there wouldn't be possibilities for an acquisition if it were in the right places in one of those markets from that standpoint. And then you'd have to look at it from all of the other focuses as well, price and the culture of the given potential acquisition and whether it fits in that market.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Sorry to pile on but 2 quickies here. You mentioned the trends in dealer finance all looked very positive. You've seen 19 -- nearly 20% year-over-year growth in that portfolio. I guess I'm just curious what your outlook is over the next year for demand in that business. Do you -- are you expecting continued high teens growth in that business or is there the potential that, that could slow down?","Ralph W. Babb","Yes. So just from an accuracy perspective, there's actually about a 24% year-over-year growth in the portfolio. But it's a business that if we look at it historically, we're running at numbers that were like 2008 both from outstandings perspective utilization. We feel very comfortable with that as a company where it is today. I'm expecting, as we talked about earlier, that some of the seasonality will moderate some of those balances as we head into next year. But clearly, 2014's annual sales rate on auto sales is going to have an impact on the outstandings likely for our dealers and will impact us on the longer term in terms of our growth profile of the business.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Lars, you mentioned earlier you expected prepayment fees to stabilize. And I guess I'm just curious, over the last couple of years, as you've seen increased competition for Middle Market loans, have you been -- have your competitors been forcing you to move away from prepayment fees on some of your commitments or have you held pretty firm on that?","Lars C. Anderson","It's -- when I refer to structure, that's one of those things that go into that basket. That's a good insight. We obviously try to build in a prepayment penalty into every transaction and every relationship we can because there is a cost of liquidity associated with it. But it's part of the larger pricing of the overall relationship that we have. But I would say from a general industry perspective that, that is clearly kind of an area that has given along with durations and advanced rates and a number of other areas. But for us, we've really stayed the course. We've been very disciplined. And frankly, we could have had a lot more growth in some of our businesses if we were willing to kind of reach outside of our traditional risk management, relationship pricing box, but that's what got us here. We think it positions us well for the long haul. And frankly, our customers appreciate what we deliver, so I think we're well positioned.","Operator","The next question comes from the line Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just real quick, a couple of questions on the guidance. The net interest income expectation where that's trended lower. If you strip out the purchase accounting accretion piece of that, is there a sort of core net interest income? Has it reached a level where the growth offsets expected compression? Or would that continue to trend lower as well?","Ralph W. Babb","Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. That's difficult to say. But as you've seen in the last couple of quarters, the vast majority of our decline on net interest income has been due to accretion. And so the other impacts on the portfolio have been slowing, and at some point, should turn.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then last question, maybe if you could expand a little bit on the loan growth expectation. I mean, the commentary overall seems to be that market conditions are improving and that line utilization is up. You've got a record pipeline, and yet, you all are saying you expect growth at a slower pace going forward. And I just was hoping maybe you could reconcile those 2 points of view.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Keep in mind that our outlook is a full year to full year outlook. So when we look at 2011 and 2012, we did have robust loan growth. And in 2012 to 2013, we're expecting continued loan growth but at a slower pace than the prior year. So that would be our overall outlook. And yes, we do have some positive signs that we talked about on loan growth going forward through the back half of the year, but remember that, that's against the backdrop of a slow economy and a very competitive environment, under which we expect to maintain our pricing structure discipline.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. And Karen, and one last thing I'd add on to that. You mentioned line utilization being -- remember, line utilization, when you adjust really for the end of period dealer Mortgage Banker Finance, it was really flat.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Oppenheimer.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just one last thing on my list. In the release, it was mentioned that the provision connected to the Mortgage Banker Finance book increased in the second quarter. I was wondering, did the rapid move up in rates pose additional credit risk to those borrowers? And have you taken a closer look at that customer base with a potential of weeding through some of those weaker borrowers that could add to the potential decline in that book in the back half of this year?","Ralph W. Babb","John?","John M. Killian","Terry, no, it really wouldn't add to the additional risk in that business. Our Mortgage Banker Finance business is completely a warehouse business. So to the extent that their loan balances are up in the reserve methodology, they get a higher standard loss factor. But there's no real impact other than that.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Guys, I'll let you off the hook. I think all my questions have been answered at this point.","Operator","And that does close our Q&A presentation.

[Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. Good morning and welcome to Comerica\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curtis Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, Dave Duprey; and Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile.","During this presentation, we will be referring to slides which provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC\u2019s website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ralph, who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph Babb","Good morning and Thank you for joining our call. Today we reported fourth quarter earnings of a $112 million or $0.63 per share, excluding a deferred tax adjustment related to the new tax law and a one-time employee bonus, as well as restructuring charges and tax benefits from employee stock transactions. Adjusted net income was $226 million or $1.28 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted third quarter results of a $1.27 per share. Recall that the third quarter included elevated interest recoveries which added $0.06 per share. ","Full year 2017 adjusted net income to common increased to $842 million or $4.73 per share compared to 2016 adjusted net income to common of $532 million or $3.02 per share, a 57% increase. On slide 4, we have outlined certain items that impacted our results. The largest item is the $107 million impact of the write-off of net deferred tax assets. ","Turning to slide 5 and an overview of our full year results, revenue grew 11% including a 15% increase in net interest income which benefited from higher interest rate as we prudently manage loan and deposit pricing. In addition, successful execution of our Europe initiative helped increase fee income over 5% and lowered expenses 4%. We continue to navigate the energy cycle and credit quality remained strong. ","Altogether this drove an84% increase in pre-tax income and substantially higher returns with an adjusted ROE of 11% and an adjusted ROA of 1.2%, and an efficiency ratio of 58%. As far as loan growth excluding cyclical declines in energy and mortgage banker, average loans increased $670 million. The most notable increases were in national dealer services, corporate banking and private banking. ","Non-interest bearing deposits grew 4%, however, were more than offset by a decline in interest bearing deposits. The decrease was primarily due to customers using their excess liquidity for working capital needs and acquisitions. Our deliberate approach to relationship pricing as well as strategic actions we took in light of the LCR rules. We repurchased 7.3 million shares in 2017 under our equity repurchase program. ","Through the buyback and dividends, we returned $724 million to our shareholders, a 58% increase over 2016. This reflects our strong capital position and solid financial performance. ","Slide 6 summarizes our fourth quarter results; average loans for the fourth quarter were $48.9 billion, an increase of $270 million or 1%, compared to third quarter. As expected, seasonality drove an increase in national dealer services and a decline in mortgage banker finance. We also had growth in corporate banking and technology and life sciences. ","Average deposits increased $1.1 billion with a majority of the growth coming from non-interest bearing deposits, which is in line with our normal seasonal pattern. We continue to closely monitor our deposit base. In conjunction with the December rate increase and for the first time this cycle, we made minor adjustments to standard rates on select products. ","As I mentioned the third quarter included elevated interest recoveries, excluding the $13 million decrease in interest recoveries net interest income increased $12 million primarily due to higher interest rates and loan growth. Credit metrics were strong with 13 basis points of net charge-offs. Non-interest income grew 4% with increases in almost every category reflecting the traction we are gaining with our gear-up initiative. ","In conjunction with revenue growth, expenses were up yet remained well controlled. And with the tax reform bill, we are distributing some of the benefits to our hard working team. We granted 4500 colleagues a one-time $1,000 bonus and we raised our minimum wage to $15 per hour, which impacted over 700 employees. We increased our pay after our shareholders as we repurchased a $148 million or 1.9 million shares which expect to gradually increase our stock \u2013 we expect to gradually increase our stock buyback as we progress with the remainder of the CCAR year. ","And now, we\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave, who will go over the quarter in more detail. ","Dave Duprey","Thanks Ralph. Good morning everyone. Turning to slide 7, fourth quarter average loans increased 270 million compared to the third quarter. Our auto dealer floor plan portfolio increased as dealers rebuild inventory with the delivery of 2018 models. In addition, the sector continues to consolidate and our customers which are larger, multi-franchise dealers tend to be importers. Corporate lending also had a strong quarter with expansion of several large relationships. ","We saw growth across many of our key specialty and national business lines. For example, technology and life sciences, specifically equity fund services continue to grow as private equity and venture capital fund formation remains robust. (inaudible) growth, general middle market decline due to a pickup in M&A activity, planned exits, continued to deleveraging by customers and trade labor markets impacting customer\u2019s growth and aspirations. ","We remain disciplined with structure and pricing in a highly competitive environment. Average energy loans decreased $2 billion or 4% of our total loans due to an increase in capital markets activity, as a result of firmer commodity prices. Seasonality impacted mortgage banker as expected with a normal winter slow-down of comp sales. ","Total period end loans were stable but above the average for the quarter. Our loan yields increased 6 basis points excluding non-accrual interest recoveries. In the third quarter, interest recoveries totaled 17 million, compared to 4 million in the fourth quarter. Typically we recover 1 million to 2 million a quarter, cutting that aside, higher rates added 4 basis points to our yield and we expect to see the full benefit of the December rate increase in the first quarter.","In addition, other dynamics that added 2 basis points included elevated loan fees, which was partly offset by the mix shift in the portfolio. Our loan price volume remained solid in the fourth quarter. Customer sentiments has improved over the past month or so, but as of yet we have not seen signs of a significant increase in line usage. ","Average supplies increased over 1 billion or 2% relative to the third quarter as shown on slide 8. Non-interest bearing deposits were up over 700 million and money market accounts increased nearly 600 million. This was partly offset by decline in time deposits and CDs. The growth has been broad based, with increases in nearly every business line and is in line with typical seasonality. ","Of note, our loan-to-deposit ratio remains low at 85%. As far as rates, we continue to very closely monitor our deposit base as well as competition and remained focused on prudently managing deposit pricing. We do this on a product and market basis, as Ralph mentioned, late in the fourth quarter we made minor adjustments to our standard rates for certain product classes in each market. ","Our (EBITDA) continues to be low. The average deposit rate increased just 3 basis points in the fourth quarter. Our objective is to retain and attract deposits while managing our total cost. We rely on our relationship model and stay close to our customers, understand our needs and offer competitive and appropriately price products. Our securities book remains at about 12 billion as shown on slide 9. ","Recent security purchases have been under slightly higher rates and pay downs, resulting in a modest increase in the yields for the total portfolio. The estimated duration of our portfolio remains relatively short at about 3.2 years and the expected duration under a 200 basis points rate shot extends at modestly to 3.8 years. Finally, the portfolios unrealized loss position is 123 million.","Turning to slide 10, net interest income and the net interest margin were stable. As we mentioned the third quarter included elevated interest recoveries. Excluding the $13 million decrease in interest recoveries, net interest income increased $12 million and margin increased 7 basis points. In total, increased rates contributed a net 5 million or 4 basis points to the margin. Loan growth added 3 million and other dynamics added 2 million or one basis points. Finally a lower level of wholesale funding added 2 million or 2 basis points to the margin. ","Our overall credit picture remained strong as outlined on slide 11. Total criticized loans decline 203 million and represented less than 5% of total loans at quarter end. This includes a $42 million decrease in non-accrual loans which comprised less than 1% of our total loans. Net charge-offs were 13 basis points or 16 million. ","As far as energy loans, total balances, criticized and non-accruals loans as well as charge-offs all decreased in the fourth quarter. We expect loan balances will remain at approximately this level. Fall redeterminations were nearly complete and borrowing bases have increased slightly, mainly due to drilling activity and acquisitions. ","Slide 12 outlines non-interest income which increased 10 million or 4% with growth in almost all categories. This was led by a continued strong growth in currencies. Service charges on deposit accounts declined 2 million due to three fewer business days in the quarter. ","We remain on track to achieve our GEAR Up revenue charges. For the full year, non-interest income increased 56 million relative to last year including growth in card, treasury management, fiduciary, brokerage and foreign exchange. In conjunction with revenue growth and the tax reform related bonuses that we previously announced, expenses increased as shown on slide 13. ","Salaries and benefits rose 10 million reflecting a one-time bonus to approximately 4500 employees, as well as increase of performance related compensation. Also outside processing increased in line with growing card fees. ","Finally, restructuring charges were 13 million, which is an increase of 6 million from the third quarter. Partly offsetting this technology costs including software and equipment decreased. Expenses remained well controlled. Ona full year basis, excluding restructuring charges, expenses are down 22 million or over 1% with declines in most categories. Expenses tied to revenue growth have increased including a $30 million increase in outside processing as well as higher incentives in advertising expense. ","Results from higher rates and careful management of loan and deposit pricing, our efficiency ratio was 58% as our GEAR Up initiatives continue to be realized. ","Moving to slide 14, As Ralph mentioned in the fourth quarter we repurchased 148 million or 1.9 million shares under our equity repurchase program. Together with dividends we returned 200 million to shareholders. Of note, during the fourth quarter employees stock activity and warrant exercises added about 412,000 shares. This activity resulted in a credit to our income tax provision of 4 million or about $0.02 per share. ","Our asset sensitive balance sheet continues to be well positioned to benefit from increases in rates, as illustrated on slide 15. Approximately 90% of our loans are fully ready with majority tied to 30 day LIBOR. Also our biggest earnings source comes from non-interest bearing customer deposits, which results in one of the lowest cost of funding among our peers. ","Rate increases alone drove a 200 million or 10% increase in our full year 2017 net interest income. We\u2019ve now altered the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. Our deposit data has remained very well, although we currently anticipate it will begin to rise. Thus we estimate a full year 2018 benefit of the 2017 rate increases to be 110 million to 125 million. ","Of course the outcome depends on a variety of factors such as the pace at which LIBOR moves, deposit betas, and balance sheet movements. In addition, at some point we will add wages as we did regularly in the past. Our asset liability committee continues to assess our position to determine the appropriate path given the balance sheet movements in our other (inaudible).","Now I will tur the call back to Ralph to take you through our outlook for 2018. ","Ralph Babb","Thank you Dave. As usual our outlook is based on the current economic and interest rate environment. It also includes the continuation of the execution of our GEAR Up initiative, which is expected to yield $270 million in benefits by year-end 2018. In total, we expect average loans to increase in line with GDP growth. We expect loan growth in most businesses lead by middle market particularly in California and Texas, as well as technology and life sciences, national dealer services and mortgage banker. ","We expect to maintain the current size of our energy book. Corporate banking should be stable as it is one of the most competitive segments. We will maintain our relationship focus as well as loan pricing and credit discipline. Overall, our customer sentiment is more positive given the progress Washington has made on tax and regulatory reform, but remains cautious as we closely watch for signs of stronger economic growth. ","We expect our net interest income to increase as a result of the full year benefit from the 2017 rate increases which as Dave mentioned , our model indicates is about 110 million I to 125 million. Loan growth is expected to also contribute net of related funding. And while not included in this outlook, we are well positioned, independent from any further rate increases. ","Of note, 2017 non-accrual interest recoveries were $28 million and we do not expect this elevated level to be repeated. With continued strong overall performance of our portfolio, we expect a provision between 15 and 25 basis points and net charge-offs to remain low. We expect the pace of growth of non-interest income to continue and result in a 4% increase year-over-year, excluding deferred comp asset returns as they are difficult to predict. ","We believe continued execution of our GEAR Up initiatives will help drive revenue growth of $40 million particularly in card, fiduciary, brokerage and treasury management. ","Non-interest expenses are expected to increase 1%. Additional savings derived from GEAR Up are expected to be above $50 million. This is expected to be more than offset with increased outside processing expense consistent with growing card revenue as well as inflationary pressure son items such as annual merit, staff insurance and marketing. In addition, technology, project expenses will continue to rise as invest to meet customer demands that continue to optimize our infrastructure. ","Restructuring expenses are expected to be approximately $47 million to $57 million in 2018, relative to the $45 million incurred in 2017. Recall the first quarter includes elevated salaries and benefits expense due to annual share compensation and associated higher payroll taxes. ","Of note, effective January 1, we adopted a new revenue recognition standard whereby non-interest income of certain products totaling approximately $120 million for 2017 will be presented net of cost, effectively lowering our non-interest income and expense. This change of presentation was not included in this outlook and has no impact on our bottom line. However, it will improve our efficiency ratio by approximately 150 to 200 basis points. ","Finally, we expect our effective tax rate under the new tax law to approximately 23%. This is slightly higher than the federal statutory rate as it includes state taxes and reflects the elimination of certain deductions and a reduction in the benefit of our tax credit investments under a lower tax rate. ","In closing, Comerica made significant forward progress in 2017. We benefited meaningfully from our relationship and banking strategy and proven advantage from a loan and deposit pricing as interest rates increased. In addition, credit metrics remained strong. The successful execution of our Europe initiative helped drive fee income and a reduction in expenses. This resulted in a significant increase in our returns and help drive our efficiency ratio to 58%. ","As we look forward to the year ahead, we remain focused on further enhancing shareholder value by growing relationships, continued implementation of our GEAR Up initiatives, and returning excess capital to our investors. The full year impact of 2017 rate increases should help drive further revenue growth. Also we expect to benefit from the lower tax rate and we are well positioned to take advantage of additional rate increases, favorable changes in regulation and economic growth. ","Now we will happy to take any questions you might have. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with WedBush Securities. Please go ahead. ","Peter Winter","I was just curious, as your borrowers benefit as well from the tax reforms; do you think that the increase in their cash flows would delay the need for bank loans?","Ralph Babb","I think it will have an effect. We\u2019ll have to see how much and it depends how fast the economy picks up. Curt, you want to add to that. ","Curtis Farmer","I think you\u2019re right Ralph, I think short term it should have an impact in terms of lessening the borrowing need. But longer term, I think it\u2019s very positive for the economy and for the businesses that we work with and (inaudible) the country at large and so we see it in the net positive. ","Peter Winter","Can you just walk through the analysis that you do when the right time, is that interest rate hedges? ","Ralph Babb","Do you want to take that Dave?","Dave Duprey","Peter we look at that on a weekly basis candidly, specifically given the recent [Feb] commentary. Obviously we\u2019ll monitor that very closely. We have typically used straight slots, four year slots, if we go back years ago. We\u2019ll be looking to potentially reintroduce that looking at other strategies and well. Today that four years slop rate isn\u2019t all that attractive to us, I can\u2019t give you the price exactly today, but I think late last week it was in the 70s. So in fact you are anticipating three rate rises in the coming year. It\u2019s not all that attractive, but then in terms of locking that in for a four year period, if you\u2019re only going to pick up 70 or 72 or 75 basis points, but that\u2019s how we are looking at it. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brett Rabatin","Wanted to first ask, just thinking about all the regulatory changes that are potentially happening, how does that factor in to your guidance for expenses in 2018 and then can you talk about capital, and just, I know we\u2019re not there yet, but it would seem like you\u2019d have a pretty big opportunity to be more aggressive with capital. ","Ralph Babb","I would say at this point there is not an effect on expenses that we\u2019re expecting. When we look forward at the opportunities that are out there especially at our size of institution, things that would be most important to us is being able to manage our capital position to an appropriate level and based on the earnings growth overtime, as well as regulatory relief from specific designation. ","Brett Rabatin","Just wanted to go back to the - I know for some time you talked about loan growth being equivalent to GDP, what factors might change that this year? I know you\u2019re looking for kind of flattish energy, is that a function of pay-offs continuing to be partially and offset there or what would change your outlook for loan growth to be better than GDP aside from the obvious increase in loan utilization from clients. ","Curtis Farmer","I think that as we\u2019ve said on prior earnings call, GDP is a good measure for us, kind of when you look at the compilation of all the businesses that we are in, as well as the markets that we serve, that does not mean that we would not have businesses that would potentially grow slightly faster than GDP, but when you look at kind of average across the portfolio, we think that\u2019s a very prudent approach to managing risk and managing appropriate returns to our shareholders. ","As far as the energy portfolio is concerned, we continue to like that business and we\u2019re going to take care of our clients, but quite frankly what we are seeing there are new opportunities released for the matching pay-offs in the portfolio. And so we anticipate that that portfolio will remain relatively flat for 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Alexopoulos","Ralph, looking at the significant reduction in the effective tax rate in 2018, am I looking at the guidance correctly that at least for this year you expect most of that benefit to just fall to the bottom line?","Ralph Babb","We would expect a great deal of the benefit fall to the bottom line. There will be additional investments, but remember because of going through GEAR Up, and as you know we\u2019re in the midst of that today we\u2019ve been reinvesting with a fair amount especially in the technology. And as we all know technology changes are rapid especially on the product side and we will continue to do the appropriate thing to stay current there. ","Steve Alexopoulos","Ralph if you think beyond 2018 and the capacity of the SKUs, do you step up the pace of investment. There is talk of loan competition getting worse, what\u2019s your view at this point, how you use this longer term?","Ralph Babb","Longer term I think it will be based on where the economy is, and we as well, and I mentioned to get it on GEAR Up have capacity today, and so that if were to be used up, we would begin to reinvest and basically the tools that we need to continue to be growing at the same time to be and have the kinds of products and services that need to be competitive. ","Steve Alexopoulos","Maybe just one separate question for Dave, on the deposits regarding the pricing there you talked about you changed it late in the quarter. Give us some color on the actions that you took and what should we expect this coming year in terms of an increase for 1Q \u201918?","Dave Duprey","We did a real deep down analysis of looking at the positive (inaudible) over the last couple of years, a real deep down analysis looking at competition by region. And where we made adjustments were on our premium money market with regards to business money market segment, and for large balances we defined that as over 10 million and over, and we increased by 20 basis points. And then on our retail side, again for our larger retail customers a (inaudible) that we prefer to as planned circle. And for the larger balances we define as 500,000 or more which increased at 15 basis points.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliot with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliot","Maybe back to capital, the [CET] 1 ratio ticked up again a little bit this quarter, you are now 11.6%. Can you talk about how you think about the optimal level for capital, is it 11.6, is it lower and how does that change if you lose [specific] designation. ","Ralph Babb","We have not talked about a target for capital, but I think and where you\u2019re going with your question, one of the things that is important to us is being able to manage capital and return the capital to shareholders either through dividends or in the buyback. And today I would say that dividend is a little higher on our list and looking forward and I think there will be hopefully the ability to become more active in managing these numbers.","Geoffrey Elliot","And in terms of some of the total payout that you think you could achieve if you\u2019re going to be more active, we\u2019ve seen a couple of banks go to the kind of 150% type range is that something that you think in this regulatory environment in this macro environment could be reasonable?","Ralph Babb","I think depending on growth that\u2019s out there that overall I think you will see paybacks begin to grow, so that the institutions which we were talking about earlier can effectively manage their capital position. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Just a follow-up on the rates on the positive side, appreciate that color you gave us on that benefit from rate increases slide. And I see that for the December hike, you\u2019re using the 20%-40% beta. And just wondering on your forward model for NII or you give us the 200 basis points sensitivity, can you help us understand obviously with higher rates you have a higher starting point, but what\u2019s the betas you\u2019re now building in to the core standard model. ","Dave Duprey","If I recall correctly, again I believe that the standard beta that\u2019s wired in on that analysis is a very (inaudible), but focused on 50% beta.","Ken Usdin","50% as the core. And on another side, just in terms of deposit growth you had really good deposit growth still across the platform and I knew that you did mention you touched up rates a little bit. But can you talk about the balance between customers still bringing in cash versus the prior question about loan growth. What are you just seeing from your customer base in terms of business flows, is it a still wait and see, is it people getting ready to invest, how would you characterize people\u2019s kind of loan to deposits amongst your customer base?","Dave Duprey","As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we contingency some customers de-lever payment. We have the confidence and continue to have record levels of liquidity. And quite frankly I think until we see some of that find some level of equilibrium, and I do expect the vast majority of our customers who maintain entire level of cash they may have historically, but I do think that that does put a bit of a pressure point in terms of loan growth because at that point we\u2019re still not yet seeing them (inaudible). I think as confidence grows in the economy and there certainly are positive signs, continued positive signs, including tax reforms. I think our hope is that that will encourage our customers to begin the (inaudible) capital commitments so they can (inaudible) on the side lines to begin to utilize that cash and therefore begin to draw down on those lines of credit. ","Ken Usdin","And Dave last one, if there is a bucket where you would sense that that customer base might start to use as their certain business or geography, where you would feel like the conversation or the tone is getting that place?","Ralph Babb","Curt do you want to (inaudible) on that?","Curtis Farmer","Yeah, I\u2019ll be glad to Ralph. When you look at 2018, a couple of comments I would make is, first, the first quarter tends to be a little bit softer for us from a loan growth perspective and deposit growth as well. We just would see some natural cyclicality in our business line related to mortgage banker finance, but also just sort of general business cycle with a number of the businesses that we bank. But for the full year of 2018 we continue to have growth expectations, as I said earlier, in line with GDP. ","And we look at sort of from a geographic standpoint, we have growth expectations across all three of our geographies, our major geographies really led by Texas and California, but expecting growth in the Michigan economy as well. And would include to a (inaudible) middle market a small business but also a number of our specialty business lines, technology and life sciences, environmental services, dealer or mortgage banker finance etcetera again with the caveat being on the latter to the normal seasonality. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with Suntrust.","Jennifer Demba","How is this excess earnings from the tax reform impacted, thoughts on M&A in near term, and then maybe longer term next couple of years as the SIFI designation goes away we may see some more M&A of larger banks and maybe the $20 billion to $50 billion asset levels. ","Ralph Babb","We always look at alternative as they come up, but we\u2019re very focused when looking at acquisitions. And in our footprint especially because we are very happy with the footprint, we have a lot of opportunity to grow there, some of the fastest growing markets in the country and we\u2019ve done two acquisitions over the last 20 years and they were specifically to expand that footprint both in California and Texas. But we would certainly look at any opportunities that came up and make an appropriate judgement as to whether that would accelerate the growth in our markets, but also add to and fit right in to the culture. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Steve Moss","I was wondering what your thoughts are if we get in to set hike here in March or June or both, and what the impact would be to NII?","Dave Duprey","I think Steve if you just kind of looked at the slide where we have the projected data that\u2019s coming from the residual in 17 and I think slide 15. If we use December, we\u2019re sending 55 million to 70 million in a recognized (inaudible) have a couple of weeks spend because of that in AAA from that. And if you want to take a real high level shot, use (inaudible) of that if it comes in March, you can assign whatever beta you want to assign, we\u2019re seeing 20 to 40, and as December rate rise, I think we\u2019ll have a far better sense the closer we get to March is to whether or not that 20 to 40 remains at. At this point in time we are not seeing a significant amount of pressure on beta beyond those two adjustments that we\u2019ve made and we\u2019ve talked about. ","Steve Moss","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then second question with regard to card fees, is that sustainable here or is that more of a seasonal impact here?","Curtis Farmer","One of the things Steve that we did two years ago was we entered in to a new merchant agreements with third party and so we\u2019ve been on an upward trajectory in terms of sales activity across all of our business lines and that would include a traditional business bank clients for our business, retail clients as well. And then just looking at some of the other card programs we have in place, with some of the government card programs we\u2019ve got and these traditional commercial cards, so we do feel like cards here have upward trajectory opportunities for us from NII perspective. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","John Pancari","In terms of the margin, just want to get a \u2013 assuming if you can give us a little bit of color around your expectation for the margin in coming quarters? Could we see some modest low single digit expansion here on the linked quarter basis through \u201918 assuming the rate hike outlook? And then separately, I know you gave the NII benefit of what the past hikes could do to in terms of the spread revenue. What\u2019s the follow-through from the December hike in terms of the margin? Thanks. ","Dave Duprey","(inaudible) in the margin from that December rate rise, (inaudible) there are incremental rate rises throughout the balance of \u201918 and we certainly hope that we\u2019ll see that even with a deposit fee that that could begin to elevate is still going to be a net positive to us overall because of our continued (inaudible) sensitivity. I will point out albeit not that significant but two items that are in the margin in the fourth quarter is the higher level of the business recoveries and we continue to have an elevated level of overnight funding as I said. And the positives obviously influence that overnight funding which also has an impact on the margins. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Just a quick comment on the new accounting standard, I just want to make sure that the numbers that we\u2019re talking about is it a 120 million reduction in both NII and expenses, is that the right way to think about it or is that --.","Ralph Babb","120 is a gross number. ","Dave Duprey","First of all Ken 120 is the 2017 impact, we\u2019re not setting (inaudible), obviously where you can just see growth and the particular programs impacted by that (inaudible) accounting standard we\u2019ll see that number increase. But yes, it\u2019s a reduction of both net interest income and net interest expense, zero impact on pre-tax, zero impact on net income. ","Ken Zerbe","So probably a little bit higher to 120, okay and understood. And then just in terms of the beginning of the year the loan yield, obviously everyone\u2019s very concerned about the competing way and then seeing more aggressive on loan yields. I know it\u2019s only been a couple of weeks, but have you guys seen any signs at all, whether you guys or other banks are actually reducing your loan yields so far in the year?","Curtis Farmer","Ken it\u2019s always a competitive environment and I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s any more or less competitive at the moment. Where would I continue to focus on full client relationship and appropriate profitability, take care of our good clients and we are not anticipating a change to our pricing model at this time, but we\u2019ll continue to watch and see what happens from a competitive landscape perspective, but we believe we have a competitive advantage just in terms of the markets we serve and our expertise in some of our specialty business lines. ","Ken Zerbe","And then just a last question, in terms of the deposit beta, I know you guys talked about like the competition being the one aspect of what you look out when you set deposit rates. But can you maybe just remind us from a qualitative standpoint, why is your customer base presumably behaving so much differently than the rest of the industry, because all we hear in for other banks is commercial deposits or depositors are demanding more yield, but we\u2019re just not seeing that occur. What\u2019s the difference there?","Dave Duprey","I think the primary difference Ken is the fact that a very large portion of our commercial base has been on interest bearing. A substantial component of that 80% roughly is linked to earning credit allowance programs. That utilization remains very high, and as long as that utilization remains high, there is a not a whole lot of pressure to adjust or move those funds in to any kind of an interest earned product or pressure on the overall ECM rate. So we\u2019re benefitting from that mix. As to that preponderance, the preponderance of our interest bearing is retail and the retail has not seen the type of great competition amongst peers as you read relative to the commercial balances. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","In terms of loan growth, I know you mentioned deleveraging on the borrower side and from M&A it has led to pay-downs. Regarding pay-downs can you give us an idea of what they amounted to at all this quarter versus last quarter and then separately I know your mentioned that line utilization you saw no real change, where is it now and where was it lets\u2019 say in the last reflationary type of cycle, so I guess \u201904-\u201905 through \u201909. Thanks. ","Curtis Farmer","John, this is Curt, and maybe to start with the first part of your question just around client activity in general and you mentioned a couple of things that we already reference. In terms of just general M&A activity and customer sitting on more liquidity, I\u2019d also say that a couple of markets and the very sort of type labor markets we\u2019re impacting borrowing activity also and so to speak if we could change there that might free up some capital. ","I\u2019d say overall, the words we used previously around for the cost cautiously optimistic continues to be case, but I think (inaudible) wise the tax reform changes, help from optimism standpoint, I think you will see that lead through in terms of activity overall. ","From a utilization standpoint, we were at 51% for the quarter. And that tends to track fairly closely in a general range for us in terms of prior quarters. I cannot speak specifically to past economic cycles, I do not have that data readily available. But I\u2019d say in general, it\u2019s been an non-relative range. ","John Pancari","Do you have the loan pay-downs that impacted loan balances this quarter?","Curtis Farmer","No. I do not. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC. Please go ahead.","Jon Arfstrom","A couple of follow-ups, maybe for you Curt. Just general middle market you\u2019re talking about your growth potentially been led in \u201918 by general and middle market. Would you say the simple question that you\u2019re feeling more optimistic today on general and middle market than you were a couple of quarters ago. ","Curtis Farmer","Yes. I think I am being more optimistic and that\u2019s really based on conversations that we were having with clients and some of the planning that they are doing. So I think our customers that have been sitting on the sidelines, maybe borrowing to meet operating cash flow needs but not doing major CapEx expansion. I think that that\u2019s starting to, at least from a planning perspective we are starting to hear from customers that the cost of increased activity. ","Jon Arfstrom","Tech and life sciences, Dave you touched on it a bit as a driver of growth on a (inaudible) who wants to handle it. But talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening there and what your expectations are?","Curtis Farmer","The technology life sciences growth that we saw in the quarter was really focused in our equity fund services group where we provide a capital, call it subscription lines to venture capital and private equity firms and we\u2019ve seen a lot of continued net creation of capital there in the core business and so we expect that to continue in 2018. The core business has been a little bit flatter for us, we still really like the business. I would say that it\u2019s become very competitive. Some of the venture capital firms we work with are probably being a little bit more selective than they were previously. That\u2019s a business that we do, a lot of very lending, so there\u2019s a lot of $1 million, $2 million, $3 million transactions and so it does require a lot more volume to get a sustainable growth there. And I would say that in general we expect growth of equity fund services, but maybe it will get more flattish growth from traditional core in 2018 just based on what we\u2019ve seen up to this point of what we saw in 2017.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, that makes sense. Dave may be for you on the deposit adjustment that you talked about earlier in the call. Do you expect this as something you\u2019ll have to do with each subsequent rate increase, or is it too difficult to tell at this point?","Dave Duprey","Well certainly I can\u2019t predict the future, but we will watch the competition very closely. We\u2019ve a number jewels we\u2019ll monitor that. We will remain, as I said a while ago we are remaining competitive. So if the competition moves, that will probably answer your question.","Jon Arfstrom","And then last question on energy, it might be buried in here somewhere. But can you talk about have you had any ability to release some energy reserves. ","Ralph Babb","Yes we have releasing reserves over a number of quarters now. Remember though that our criticized and energy although they lack progress it\u2019s still around 25%. So, we\u2019re holding that healthy amount of reserve against the energy book. The good news there is that if we do take any charge-offs in energy (inaudible) more stubborn energy credits, we shouldn\u2019t see any negative impact on provisions. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe Bruyette Woods. Please go ahead.","Brian Klock","I wasn\u2019t sure if you talked about the (inaudible), the question is for you Dave, with the excess liquidity, you still have about 5 billion of excess liquidity sitting in earning assets. Just talk about what are you thinking about with, I know it\u2019s a flatter curve, but any thoughts about putting some more of that to work if loan growth doesn\u2019t come through and because of securities portfolio. ","Dave Duprey","I will tell you Brian, I think you kind of answered that with what you believe in. Given that that flat yield curve, I believe it\u2019s still [intuitive], all but attractive to large (inaudible) like you know long term yield at those very low levels. And we\u2019re looking to maintain that investment portfolio today at around 12 billion. And while we are seeing some slight uptick in those yields, but certainly not all attractive from a long term perspective. ","Brian Klock","And that looks like just from an inflexion point that, I guess any of your new purchase money is coming in at higher yields in the portfolio at this point. So does it seem to make sense going forward as well?","Dave Duprey","Going forward it\u2019s always hard to tell, but certainly off late we have been able put some upgraded securities in to that portfolio versus the beta.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vinning Sparks. Please go ahead. ","Marty Mosby","Wanted to ask you about, you have couple of earnings levers one is the assets sensitivity that you have. As rates start to go up, given the funding and loan structure that you showed. What are your plans to not leave the vulnerability eventually when rates go back down? Are you going to neutralize this position at one point? Do you have a plan to do that? How do you begin to evolve your position as rates are changing around us?","Ralph Babb","Dave you mentioned that earlier.","Dave Duprey","Marty often we look at on a weekly basis. We are regularly challenging what we think of the forward yield curve, where we are at this day, what our options are relative to locking in, what\u2019s the attractiveness of locking in. And as I mentioned earlier, when you look at how flat that forward yield curve is at the moment, it reaches (inaudible) picking out 70 or 75 basis points and again having locked that in for four years is being all that attractive to us. ","At some point, and we certainly hope, and the indications are actually even then some of the (inaudible) that we may finally start to see a bit of a steepening in that yield curve, and if that happens we will be opportunistic. ","Ralph Babb","And you might topple the (inaudible) what we\u2019ve been over this far --.","Dave Duprey","Historically we try to dramatically reduce our asset sensitivity and quite frankly maintain relative neutrality. And you lock that in on a 36 to 40 month basis and at some point we hope to get back to that again. ","Marty Mosby","And do you see using interest swaps and do you have kind of a target for rates in the sense of when the yield curve [list]. You know I am not thinking more strategically than I am tactically, just that you have that vision and you do want to narrow that gap down?","Dave Duprey","There are really several different factors that you are trying look at. Part of this has four yield curve, part of it quite frankly is, what\u2019s the message coming out of the fed in (inaudible) whether it\u2019s a bad plot or even some of their comment that are irrelative to what they believe are going to be factors in either are holding rates failure as a contingency rates improvement, obviously as of late we continue to hear very positive commentary of relative to forward rate movements which again plays well at its sensitivity. ","The other side of that on the more down side you either look at what do you think the (inaudible) are and at the moment we are not anticipating that. We are certainly not hearing any of that commentary coming from the fed. So we don\u2019t see that as a high risk at this point in time. Over time that could change and we\u2019ll obviously adjust accordingly. ","Marty Mosby","And then kind of pulling that with capital in a sense of the excess capital or even liquidity that you have on the balance sheet, how do you envision in a sense to pulling that. Would it be from a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the more aggressive, yes I want to get all those things pull the end, utilize, being as productive as possible or we want to kind of scale in to this over the long run and take strategic advantage when the opportunity you see come up like you talked about interest rates. ","Dave Duprey","Currently we want to be aggressive when it comes to \u2013 if you want to just focus on managing capital overall. We\u2019ve currently want to continue to be very focused and enhancing our return to shareholders. Our overall performance in terms of return on equity and (inaudible) mentioned increasing focus as we have now accomplished a lot of relative to our performance. ","Our capital remains strong and we continue to be very optimistic about our future performance. That gives us confidence in terms of when we look at the capita going forward, pushing on increasing that distance, pushing at potentially increasing the overall request in terms of our capital return to shareholders when we do CCAR submission. ","So in terms of where do you want to put that on a spectrum, our confidence level certainly is much higher today than it was a year or two ago.

As expected, commercial loan growth was partially offset by the continued decline in Commercial Real Estate loans. ","Deposits also continued to grow. We had record deposits of $49.3 billion at March 31, 2012, and had an increase in average deposits of $532 million or 1%, primarily reflecting an increase of $461 million in noninterest-bearing deposits. ","Net interest income, including accretion, was stable. Noninterest income increased $24 million, driven by a $10 million or 6% increase in customer-driven fees, offsetting the headwinds of regulatory reform. ","We continued to have tight control of expenses. Noninterest expenses decreased $30 million in the first quarter to $448 million, primarily due to the decrease in restructuring expenses related to our acquisition of Sterling Bank shares. ","Credit quality continued to improve in the first quarter. This was the 11th consecutive quarter of a decline in net charge-offs with a $15 million decrease. Net charge-offs are at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2007. The provision for loan losses was relatively stable. Our expectations is that we will continue to see the provision and net charge-offs at or near these levels for the remainder of the year, assuming the current pace of economic growth is sustained. ","We continue to approach capital management from a position of strength. As we announced on March 14, 2012, the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan and the capital distributions contemplated in the plan. The capital plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors, provides up to $375 million in equity repurchases from the first quarter of 2012 through the first quarter of 2013. We repurchased $33 million or 1.1 million shares under the share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2012. Our capital plan further contemplates an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.15 per share, a 50% increase. A dividend proposal will be considered by our board at our meeting on April 24, 2012.","Turning to Slide 5 and our key markets and customer sentiment. Our customers in Texas are feeling more optimistic, as evidenced by the 4% quarter-over-quarter average loan growth led by increases in Energy, Middle Market and Global Corporate Banking. We continued to leverage the synergies from our Sterling acquisition. Momentum in the Texas economy increased in early 2012 after cooling at the end of 2011. Labor market conditions improved, the energy sector remained active, and residential construction activity has increased. We expect to see ongoing gains in our Texas economic activity index throughout 2012, driven by continued strength in those 3 areas.","Average loans in our Midwest market, which is primarily Michigan, were up 1% for the fourth quarter, driven by National Dealer Services and Global Corporate Banking. A rebounding U.S. auto industry drove our Michigan economic activity index sharply higher in the start of this year after stalling in late 2011. Every component of the Michigan index has increased, a sign that the recovery in Michigan is reaching beyond the revitalized auto industry and into the non-manufacturing sectors of the state economy. This is good news for our customers in the state, where we have a long history of service through numerous economic cycles. ","Average loans in our western market were up 3% compared to the fourth quarter, led by National Dealer Services and Technology & Life Sciences. Our California economic activity index remains flat. Some parts of the California economy are vibrant, notably the high-tech industries of Silicon Valley, which includes many of our Technology & Life Sciences customers. However, the housing sector is still a drag on the California economy. In addition, the state's large government sector remains challenged by weaker-than-expected state tax revenues and expected cuts in federal defense spending. These challenges will likely keep California's economic growth in check through the first half of the year.","In closing, continued loan and deposit growth, increased customer fee income, tight expense management and solid credit performance reaffirm our focus on improving the bottom line, even in this low-rate environment and slow-growing national economy. Our capital position remains strong, and we continue to be active capital managers. We are in the right markets with experienced, dedicated colleagues and the products and services our customers\u2019 desire. ","And now, I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen L. Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning. Turning to Slide 6. Ralph talked about total average loan growth of 2% or $815 million quarter-over-quarter, as shown on the left-hand side of the slide. On the right-hand side, you can see commercial loans drove the increase, up $1.2 billion or 5%, driven by broad-based increases across National Dealer Services, Energy, Global Corporate Banking, Middle Market Banking and Technology & Life Sciences. Our commercial loan growth was partially offset by an average decrease of $352 million or 3% in commercial mortgage and real estate construction loans. ","Importantly, as you can see by the green bar depicted on the slide, our Mortgage Banker average loans quarter-over-quarter were virtually unchanged. We have talked about variability in that business. In fact, in the fourth quarter, period-end Mortgage Banker loans grew $500 million and then declined $250 million in the first quarter. We believe our balances in this business could continue to be variable as mortgage rates stabilize and refinancing becomes a smaller component of the overall volume.","Turning to Slide 7, which shows the period-end loan balance picture. Decreases in Commercial Real Estate, Mortgage Banker and consumer loans were offset by broad-based increases in all other commercial loans, resulting in a $333 million or 1% increase from the end of the fourth quarter 2011 to the end of the first quarter this year. Period-end commercial loans increased 3% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to believe the pace of decline in our real estate balances is slowing. And as said before, Mortgage Banker loan balances are difficult to predict. However, we do expect continued variability.","Importantly, commitments increased for the third quarter in a row, with a $1 billion increase this quarter on the heels of a $1.9 billion increase in the fourth quarter. In fact, commitments are at the highest level since the third quarter of 2009, with Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate and Energy contributing the largest increases. Because of this growth in commitments, line utilization remains stable at 47.4%. Also, our pipeline increased significantly in the first quarter across almost all of our business lines, with approximately 2\/3 attributed to new business.","As you know, we track our loan growth against the industry. On Slide 8, you can see our average loans have been growing at a more rapid pace than the industry for the past few quarters. We have benefited from the fact that we have a higher proportion of C&I loans, which have been growing at a relatively faster pace. Also, the Sterling acquisition, which closed at the end of July last year, has helped accelerate our growth. The former Sterling footprint, which was predominantly Houston, San Antonio and Kerrville, has seen loan growth of over 10% since the acquisition closed, which is in line with the revenue synergy goal we announced last year. Growth in Middle Market and Energy has more than offset the planned runoff in Commercial Real Estate. ","C&I loans are depicted by the chart on the right. Remember that C&I loans, as defined by H.8 data, do not include Mortgage Banker. Our average C&I loan growth was impacted by the decline in dealer outstands in the second and third quarters of last year, mainly due to the Japanese supply chain disruption in our auto dealer lending business. As this started to rebound through the fourth and first quarters, our loan growth outpaced the industry. In addition, we believe that we benefit from our footprint, which includes the faster growing market of Texas, as well as our focus on Middle Market and expertise in several industries that are seeing accelerated growth, such as Energy and Technology & Life Sciences. ","As shown on Slide 9, our deposits continued to grow in the first quarter across all major markets and most lines of business. In fact, period-end deposits grew $1.5 billion to $49.3 billion, topping the record level we set in the fourth quarter. Our average deposits increased $532 million quarter-over-quarter with over 85% of it coming from noninterest-bearing deposits. We are pleased not only that a large portion of our deposit growth is noninterest bearing, but also that the interest-bearing deposits grew even as we continued to carefully lower deposit pricing as shown by the yellow diamonds on the page. Our cost of deposits today averages 26 basis points.","Turning to Slide 10. Our net interest income was stable. Quarter-over-quarter, loan growth contributed about $7 million to the net interest income change and a decrease in our deposit costs added about $2 million. These increases were partially offset by one less day in the quarter, worth about $5 million, and about a $5 million impact from a decrease in loan yields. The decrease in loan yields was primarily driven by a mix shift in the loan portfolio with a decline in Commercial Real Estate loans and an increase in commercial loans. We remain focused on holding spreads for new and renewed credit facilities. However, we have seen some spreads tighten consistent with improving credit risk migration.","Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio was $25 million in the first quarter 2012 compared to $26 million in the fourth quarter. Accretion should continue to trend downward as we expect to recognize total accretion of about $35 million to $45 million for the remainder of the year. Just as a reminder, our target level for the securities portfolio continues to be $9 billion, heavily weighted and highly liquid, highly rated mortgage-backed securities. Currently, the average yield is 2.73% with a duration of 2.9 years. ","As mentioned before, our balance sheet remains well positioned for rising rates. Approximately 80% of our loans are floating rates, and 70% of that is LIBOR based, predominantly 30-day LIBOR. Therefore, the impact of the low-rate environment has been absorbed, and rate movement on the long end of the curve should have little impact on us. We believe a 200-basis point annual increase in rates, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result in approximately $165 million increase in net interest income, which is an increase from the $150 million number given last quarter, primarily due to strong noninterest-bearing deposit growth.","Turning to the credit picture on Slide 11. Credit quality continues to improve. Net charge-offs in the quarter decreased $15 million to $45 million or 43 basis points of average loans. Our growth charge-offs decreased $23 million to $62 million. Recoveries were $17 million compared to the $25 million we had in the fourth quarter. Over the last 8 quarters, recoveries have averaged about $20 million per quarter, substantially higher than the $7 million average per quarter for the 2 years prior to that. As noted before, the timing and size of recoveries is the most difficult credit metric to forecast.","Our provision for loan losses was relatively stable at $23 million, reflecting the increase in loan balances, improved overall credit quality and our prudent, consistent reserving methodology. We ended the quarter with a reserve ratio of 1.64%. ","Our watch list and nonperforming loans also continued to trend downward, with a slight uptick in the third quarter last year reflecting the addition of the Sterling loan portfolio. Watch list loans decreased over $261 million to $4.2 billion at March 31. Nonperforming loans decreased $31 million. Foreclosed property remains low and in fact, decreased $27 million or almost 30% to $67 million.","Slide 12 outlines the growth in noninterest income, which grew 13% to $206 million in the first quarter 2012. The $24 million increase included a $10 million or 6% growth in customer-driven fee income resulting from increases in service charges on deposit accounts, investment banking fees, fiduciary income and commercial lending fees. We were also aided by the cross-sell successes we are having with the legacy Sterling footprint. We believe we are well on the way to meeting the fee income goal we had set for Sterling as a part of the revenue synergies we had announced.","The growth in noninterest income is partially a result of annual service charges paid in the first quarter, about $3 million, as well as the implementation of our profit improvement revenue initiative. We are pleased to be offsetting the headwinds which have resulted from regulatory reform, such as reduced interchange fees. Other changes in noninterest income include an increase of $4 million in gains from the redemption of auction rate securities and $5 million in charges incurred in the fourth quarter related to the Visa settlement.","Turning to Slide 13. We continue to maintain good expense control. Expenses this quarter benefited from the fact that we recorded no restructuring costs compared to $37 million in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we still expect to incur about $40 million on restructuring expenses for the remainder of 2012, with about $5 million to $10 million in the second quarter. ","Our careful expense management resulted in a decrease in net occupancy expense of $6 million and a decline in salaries expense of $4 million, reflecting a 2% decrease in our workforce, as shown on the slide. This was partially offset by increases in litigation and legal expenses of $5 million and employee benefits expense of $8 million, primarily due to an increase in pension expense. Litigation and legal expenses increased primarily due to changes in loss estimates reflecting recent developments on certain litigation contingencies and are not expected to be repeated.","Turning to capital on Slide 14. As Ralph mentioned, the Federal Reserve completed its review of Comerica's 2012 capital plan last month. The plan provides for up to $375 million in equity repurchases for the first quarter period ending March 13, 2013. Additionally, our board will consider a 50% increase in Comerica's quarterly dividend next week. ","This slide shows our payout ratio would have been 81% had we executed on the capital plan in the first quarter. This is significantly higher than last year and the peer median. We used first quarter estimates for our peers and assumed our capital plans were also in place in the first quarter. There are only 2 peers that have active share repurchase programs and only 2 that have announced dividend increases. ","We believe our payout relative to peers is a reflection of our strong capital position, with 10.37% Tier 1 capital. Importantly, the quality of our capital ranks among the best in our peer group, with common stock comprising over 99% of our Tier 1. It will be 100% common after we redeem the remaining $25 million of Trust Preferred Securities outstanding, which we intend to do in the second quarter.","At some conferences last month, we communicated long-term goals for our efficiency ratio to be below 60% and return on assets to be above 1.3%. On Slide 15, we have provided a walk-forward, depicting how we expect to reach the return on asset goal. Our average ROA over the past 20 years is about 1.2%, and our goal is to surpass that level by growing revenues and keeping expenses as flat as possible over the longer term. As you can see on this slide, driving loan and fee growth while managing expenses are key drivers. Importantly, while we believe a modest increase in rates will be necessary to reach our goal, we expect to well exceed our goal in a normal rate environment.","Finally, our outlook. Our expectation for full year 2012 compared to full year 2011 remains unchanged from what we outlined on our call in January, with one exception. We now expect the provision to decline from the full year 2011 level and instead be in line with the run rate from the first quarter. This is consistent with our view that we should continue to see positive credit migration, partially offset by moderate loan growth, which, combined, is now expected to result in a modest reserve release. ","In closing, we are very pleased with our continued loan and deposit growth, increased customer fee income, tight expense management and solid credit performance. Even in the current economic and regulatory environment, we feel confident we can continue to deliver strong bottom line growth to our shareholders. ","Now we are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Conor Fitzgerald ","This is Conor Fitzgerald for Erika. Just on your guidance, quickly, for the outlook for average loans to increase moderately, which, like you said, you didn't change. Because 1Q '12 was pretty strong, was there any pull-forward there? Or do you expect that kind of growth to taper off in the second half of 2012?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. I think that was Conor, and I apologize, again, for my laryngitis to everybody. Obviously, we had a very strong quarter, in particular in commercial loan growth, up 5%, $1.2 billion. The growth was very broad-based across a lot of our major markets, most of our businesses. So we feel very good about our momentum as we look forward into the second quarter, but we are expecting moderate average growth for 2012, and that's given the backdrop of a continued weak economic environment. And we also have to keep in mind that we do have some businesses with some variability, Conor. For example, dealer. Dealers tend to build their inventories in the spring and sell them down in the summer, so there's some seasonality there. And of course, Mortgage Banking Finance. You've seen there's some variability as mortgage rates continue to change. That can certainly impact the outstandings of our portfolio as we head through the balance of the year. But again, I'd point out that we do have very nice momentum. Commercial Real Estate commitment\u2019s up. Energy commitment\u2019s up, Middle Market -- and it's very broad-based, so we feel good about the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two quick questions here. But first of all, in terms of mortgage banking, I saw balances were down, but did the higher mortgage banking fees contribute to the noninterest income this quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","We did.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes.","Karen L. Parkhill","Go ahead, Ralph.","Ralph W. Babb","Go ahead, Karen.","Karen L. Parkhill","We did see fee increases in commercial lending increase. And in Mortgage Banker, that obviously contributed a little bit.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just the other question on what is your outlook for reducing your excess liquidity going forward. It looks like you were able to bring that down a bit this quarter.","Karen L. Parkhill","We did bring it down. It's now, on ending, under $3 billion on excess liquidity. Clearly, that is a factor of loan growth going forward. Hard to give an outlook, loan and deposit growth, obviously.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sorry to hurt you again here, Lars, but can you give us a little bit more color on the pickup in Mid-Market loan growth? I mean, that's been an area that -- you haven't seen a big pickup in that yet. You've seen more so large corporate, but it's good to see the Mid Market move here, and I just want to get some added color around what you're seeing there and the sustainability of that.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. No problem. Glad to address it for you, John. First of all, as I pointed out, I think, on the last conference call, that as we look at our business, Middle Market business, it really includes kind of our general Middle Market as we break that out and a lot of our other kind of Middle Market industry groups. We had nice broad-based growth last quarter. And I'd also point out, we've had 4 consecutive quarters now of commercial loan growth, so we've had a continuation of nice momentum. If you look specifically at the first quarter, obviously, we did have a nice quarter. If you look at the average balances: our general Middle Market was up about $170 million, which was really positive; our dealer business, up over $400 million; Energy up $350; Technology & Life Sciences was up $125 million; our international strategy, which is really Middle Market-oriented, that was up $80 million. And yes, large corporate, that has U.S. banking in that, was up $180 million. But on a relative basis, that was a smaller component of a very broad-based Middle Market growth momentum for our company. So we feel very good about kind of the momentum across the board, John.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Then in terms of pricing, I mean, are you seeing the need to give a little bit more here in terms of pricing? And are you becoming a bit more accommodated to meet that demand?","Lars C. Anderson","We're really not willing to trade off kind of volume for pricing. And the fact of the matter is we're staying very focused on our relationship banking strategy that has a very disciplined relationship pricing model, and it served us very well for a long period of time. Now with that said, we are seeing the most kind of competitive pricing at the larger end of the market, but frankly, the whole market, overall, is competitive today. What we're trying to really focus on is spending more time in the marketplace. We've enhanced kind of our sales focus, business development focus, investing in resources. And I think if you spend more time with customers, more time with prospects, you put yourself in a position to have more opportunities and get paid for it, and that's kind of the hallmark of Comerica. And frankly, we're seeing our new and renewed loan spreads largely holding, even in today's environment.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, Karen, on the margin, I know you don't really give guidance here. But just given your color that you had said about the funding cost and what you're seeing on loan yields here, is it fair to assume that this stability that we see here this quarter is sustainable and that this could be the margin floor or at least -- or maybe an inflection in the margin?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. On our outlook on margin, as you know, we do talk about net interest income, so I'll talk about it from that perspective. We did say from a year-over-year period, from 2011 to 2012, that we do expect net interest income to increase moderately. And when we said that, that was a reflection of assuming moderate loan growth, accretion at a slightly higher level year-over-year and a full year of Sterling. So we are still focused on that guidance. Hopefully that's helpful.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the buyback, the pace seemed a little bit light here in the first quarter. Just wondering, do you expect to use the entire $375 million authorization through 1Q '13? And then how should we think about the pace? Is it now more stock-price focused? Or are you still targeting a percent of net income?","Ralph W. Babb","Actually, as you -- Stephen, this is Ralph. As we were talking about in the comments, we were approved to do up to $375 million in the stock repurchase program, and we started off with $33 million in the first quarter. And we will move to use that as we move through the 5 quarters, which first quarter being the first of that quarter and the first quarter of '13 being the last, and it will accelerate as we move along. And as you know, at the current level, with our stock price trading right at tangible book value, that is a good investment for the shareholders longer term to execute our buyback at these levels, as well as we mentioned that we will be talking at the board meeting here next week about raising the dividend 50% as well.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just one question on this loan growth guidance. Last quarter, I think you guys said you expected 2% to 5% average growth, I'd say. I think Karen defined moderate. Do you still see that as a reasonable range? Or are you a bit more optimistic given how strong the numbers came in this quarter?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. I mean, Karen can speak to kind of the 2012 kind of expectations, but we continue to feel good about moderate average loan growth for the year. With that said, clearly, commitment\u2019s up $1 billion, 4 consecutive quarters of commercial loan growth. Our pipelines are up very significantly as are commitments to commit, and it's very broad-based. We -- you already heard some of the discussion about some of the recovery in Michigan and hopefully, maybe the beginnings of it in California. So with all that said, we still continue to look at the year against a pretty weak economic environment with some variable businesses.","Karen L. Parkhill","And I would add, when we gave that guidance, Steve, we were focused on the fact that Mortgage Banker was likely to be variable.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","It's Jessica Ribner in place for Paul. Sorry for that. We just had a couple of questions on what you're seeing in C&I. And also, I -- if you had said it, I'm sorry, but I had missed any guidance for merger charges going forward.","Ralph W. Babb","Karen, do you want to take the restructuring charges for the quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. So on restructuring charges, as you know, we did not have any restructuring charges this quarter. We do expect to have about $40 million of restructuring charges for the rest of the year, with about $5 million to $10 million in the second quarter.","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Sure. Okay. So Jessica, I'll pick up the C&I question for you. As I shared earlier, we are seeing very broad-based kind of listing activity. I'd say it's -- there's nothing -- there's no particular business or industry that's carrying the day for us. Obviously, Energy, a nice expansion, as you would expect, we're very well positioned in that industry. And it continues to expand, and we're working with our customers there, but Technology & Life Sciences continues to do very well. Our customers there are expanding. We continue to see that as a growth business for us. But if you just look at our general Middle Market, I think that we're seeing our customers more encouraged and maybe in a position to begin to make more decisions for investment in hiring than they have in the past. They're still guarded relative to the past. I'd also point out that x -- outside of C&I, we're beginning to feel a little bit more comfortable with Commercial Real Estate as the pace of declines decrease. I referenced earlier that the growth in commitments about Commercial Real Estate have -- that was one of the key drivers, and we're definitely seeing a slowing pace of decline. So on a consolidated basis, hoping that, that will give us some additional strength in overall commercial loan growth.","Ralph W. Babb","I think one of the things, Lars, too, that we're hearing from our people is, especially the Middle Market and the manufacturing side are beginning to run out of capacity, which means they're starting to invest for the future.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. As I mentioned, they still tend to be guarded. But in a number of industries, you are beginning to see some investment, and that's part of -- that's really what's the key driver in our general Middle Market that we're seeing. There's expansion of plants, equipment, and we're seeing some hiring going on in particular industries. And I think that bodes well for the future for us and for our markets.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And just one follow-up question. Where do you see utilization rates going forward?","Lars C. Anderson","Well, as you may have seen in the deck, the utilization rate was stable. It was actually -- it was a good story though, because, of course, in that formula, the denominator moved faster than the numerator. So it was one of those issues that we're having growth on both sides of the formula. So I think it's a real positive. It's hard to exactly peg where utilizations will be. We're just hoping that we continue to see usage levels increase and if this interest in investing in businesses in Middle Market continues and frankly, that we continue to grow with our customers and continue to move market share, which I'm convinced that we're doing today.","Ralph W. Babb","Yes. As we mentioned earlier, the commitments were up $1 billion, and the utilization was actually consistent at the 47, I think, .4% [ph].","Karen L. Parkhill","Correct.","Lars C. Anderson","Correct. Yes.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Placet from Matt's team. Just a follow-up on the topic of capital and share buybacks. I guess given your announced share buyback plan and outlook for continued loan growth, where do guys see your capital ratios trending through the year? And can you remind us if you have a target capital ratio or at least a level where you wouldn't want to go below?","Ralph W. Babb","Karen, you want to...","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure. In terms of target capital ratio, that is something that we would -- we have done in the past and would like to get back to. But until the capital rules are clear, very difficult for us to be giving a target capital out there.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then well, just in terms of how we should think about your capital ratios trending through the year, if we assume loan growth continues and if we assume that you guys execute on your entire share buyback plan, what does that mean for your capital ratios?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Obviously, our -- for uses of capital, we like loan growth. So should we see robust loan growth, you can see that capital come down slightly. It's very difficult to predict though, so it's not something that we try to predict.","Ralph W. Babb","That would be good to see, see loan growth even better than we expected and use the capital for leveraging the loan growth, which is profitability over the long term and return over the long term. And that will always be balanced, as we have in the past.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. So with that said, if loan growth does come in better than expected this year, should we expect maybe reduced buybacks than what you guys announced?","Ralph W. Babb","I think at the current level of what we're forecasting, I don't expect that. If loan -- it would have to be very robust to put us in that position. And like Karen said, we have to come to a conclusion on what the capital guidelines are going to be going forward and then what cushion we would put into that as well.","Robert Placet - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. And if I could just get a follow-up just on your comments on reserve release from here. I guess as we look at your reserves to loans, already at 1.6% and with an outlook for continued loan growth, I guess, is it possible that you draw down reserves too much this year? And maybe, again, if loan growth comes in better than expected, you could actually see some modest reserve build next year?","Ralph W. Babb","John, do you want to take that?","John M. Killian","Sure. As you know, it's not quite as simple as just having a target for a reserve level. We do have a very rigorous methodology, which we've been using for over 10 years. That includes reviewing every sizable problem loan every quarter, and that methodology has served us well in up and down cycles. The average carrying value of our non-accrual loans, for example, is 60%. If you look at our $704 million reserve on the ALLL at the end of the quarter, it's almost 4x the annualized first quarter net charge-off run rate. So we feel we are pretty well reserved, and going forward, we're going to follow the methodology. Reserve levels will vary as charge-offs and problem loans decline, but increase as the portfolio grows as well.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Commercial Real Estate MTLs ticked up a little bit at 1Q '12, and I'm wondering if you could provide us some commentary around kind of that trend and also, how underlying early-stage delinquencies in both classified assets trended within our Commercial Real Estate, if you have the data.","Ralph W. Babb","John?","John M. Killian","Yes. A little color on Commercial Real Estate. Frankly, Craig, I'm feeling pretty good about the trends in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio. It's -- the credit metrics in Commercial Real Estate have improved dramatically over the last 10 quarters or so, and they continue to improve. It is possible to have a slight variability from quarter-to-quarter, and that's what we saw in the first quarter. But the overall momentum is still really improving, and it improves across the board. Past dues, nonperformers, inflow, it's all going in the right direction with a little variability, as you saw in the first quarter.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just on the securities portfolio. I know you guys use 200 basis points commonly to kind of look at your net interest income on a scenario basis in terms of a parallel shift. But if you take in the same 200 basis point parallel shift and you run it through your securities portfolio, do you know roughly what it does to your duration of 2.9, in terms of duration extension?","Ralph W. Babb","Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","Can you repeat the question, please?","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. So you guys use 200 basis points. You referenced on the call, in the K in terms of an interest rate scenario and what the impact is net interest income in terms of your earnings power. And if you take that same 200 basis points and instead, you look at the impact to the duration of the securities portfolio, which right now is 2.9, do you know what that extends to?","Karen L. Parkhill","It would increase it to over 4, likely, somewhere between 4 and 5.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Nomura.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","This is, I think, about some of these deal impacts and modeling them out for the rest of the year. So you gave enough guidance that we can kind of back into quarterly run rates. But is the integration expense simply timing of discrete projects you have in place? Or is there something that's going better than you had planned in the integration? And I guess, really, where I'm going is, the back half of the year implied is like $15 million to $20 million, and obviously, that's your best estimate right now. But what's the degree of confidence around that back half of the year integration expense? And is there a risk that it comes in lower as it did in the first quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. On integration, we do have confidence. The rest of the integration to be done right now is really around our leases for real estate and our properties, and so that's why it's timed and back-half loaded. We do feel confident in that estimate.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then I guess the same kind of question on the accretable yield. The $25 million in the guidance implies it steps down by about half for the rest of the year. Was there just kind of one or a handful of discrete recoveries that drew that higher in the first quarter? Or is there -- and I guess the background for the question would be a lot of the banks that did deals have kind of had a steady stream of non-accretable difference steadily reclassified to accretable, and so kind of the accretion lasts much longer and higher than expected. Is there any kind of that kind of theme developing in the book? Or is it really just timing of a couple of recoveries in the first quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","It's mostly just timing. We did see a little bit more accretion this quarter than expected, mainly due to, obviously, prepays on deals that we were refinancing. We do have about a little less than $100 million left in our accretion to go from here, and we do feel fairly confident with our guidance of $35 million to $45 million, for the rest of the year.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","The last one for me, I mean, just kind of Mortgage Banker versus Dealer Floor Plan, one normalizing down, one normalizing up. I mean, I guess my dummy math has always been just take them both back to where they were kind of in 2010 and '11, and that would put Dealer Floor Plan at $3.5 billion to the $4 billion range, mortgage in the $500 million to $1 billion and imply the 2 portfolios combined need to come down a bit. But at the same time, I guess there's been a lot of disarray in the wholesale mortgage funding channel. It seems like you guys might have a share story that goes beyond just volumes when we look at these balances. And so I know it's impossible to say the normalized level of a Mortgage Banker is exactly x, but I guess is it too harsh to take it back to 2010 and '11 levels? Or is that still kind of where it should trend over time as mortgage activity normalizes?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars, do you want to take that?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. First of all, I guess there's 2 points there. I can quickly speak to, first, Mortgage Banking Finance and then Dealer. In Mortgage Banking Finance, 2 key drivers that we're seeing in terms of the variability in the outstandings of that business. One is clearly mortgage rates. That drives volumes and clearly impacts the outstandings in our portfolio, and we did expect and do expect that there'd be some moderation if rates pull back this year. So trying to determine the exact balances in that portfolio would be challenging. I think you've just kind of look at it through that lens. But one of the things I want to underscore, there has been a lot of change in the industry, and there is no question about it that we have been moving market share. A lot of disruption, we've been in this industry a long time. We've got a terrific reputation, a solid source of financing, and the businesses continues to perform really outstanding for us. And frankly, our cross-sell to those customers has really been kind of leading in terms of our industry groups. In terms of our Dealer portfolio, very difficult to tell where those balances will be. Obviously, we\u2019re very pleased to see sales units up over $14 million. To the degree that, that grows was as we hit through the balance of the year, that could certainly positively impact us, but I'd keep in mind, too, that the industry does have seasonality in it, as I spoke to earlier.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brett Rabatin with Sterne Agee.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Sorry, Lars, to keep having you talk there, but was curious if there was anything that affected the Energy balances at the end of the quarter. Obviously, growth wasn't as strong as the average for the quarter. And then also, was curious, Karen -- I didn't quite hear if I missed it. Was there any change to what was defined as moderately increasing on the loan growth of 2% to 5%?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars, do you want to start?","Lars C. Anderson","Sure. Let me speak first to Energy. None of our portfolios follow exactly the averages and endpoints. There's variation there. But something to keep in mind, I think, with Energy, obviously, we had nice growth on an average basis of $350 million. The endpoints clearly are up in the $80 million range. You would also see in our noninterest income that we had a really strong quarter in terms of bond economics, where we're working with our customers into bringing debt capital solutions to them. So there is some variation. There's a windows in the bond markets, and our customers do recap from time to time. So you see some variation, but I think, overall, our customers are stable. They're growing, and I think it's going to be a good business for us with nice noninterest income associated with hedging and accessing the bond market.","Ralph W. Babb","So there was no particular event that was driving that?","Lars C. Anderson","No particular event.","Karen L. Parkhill","And then on the question about moderate loan growth. There was no change in our definition of 2% to 5% on moderate loan growth. And while we are pleased with our pipeline, that is a full-year 2011 to full-year 2012 forecast, and we put it out there with -- keeping in mind the economic backdrop and the fact that we do expect variability in our Mortgage Banker business.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Terry McAvoy with Oppenheimer.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A question for Karen. The efficiency improvement revenue enhancement program that was announced, I believe, after third quarter earnings, with the goal of $100 million, any sort of kind of status where are we now? And I guess, specifically, is that built into maybe the fee income trends that we saw in the first quarter, reflecting any changes that were made as part of that program?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Just to remind people on our profit improvement program that we talked about last fall, that was $100 million improvement in profit improvement driven by both expense and revenue focus, 2\/3 expense and 1\/3 revenue. That plan is very much on track. It is something that we monitor and talk about monthly at the executive level. There are over 350 projects that make up that profit improvement plan. We are tracking them to completion, and yes, it is built into our outlook and on both fee income and on expenses.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just one other question. As I look at your 3 core markets and loan growth, the Midwest region had the slowest amount of growth, which I find a little surprising, given what your economic activity index for the state continues to report each month. Is that a reflection of losing market share? Or are you holding your own? Or maybe is it just that your runoff of Commercial Real Estate is a little bit more pronounced in the Midwest than in Michigan that's maybe hurting the bottom line balances?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. The Midwest and Michigan in particular, obviously, is seeing some recovery. We are seeing some Commercial Real Estate projects that kind of run off. So that does impact us in that market, but we've got a very solid book of business there. We continue to move some market share, I think, there, pick up some new customers. But most of all, we're seeing some growth with some existing customers, but I don't think there's any big story there other than a nice steady increase in activity in that market.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Josh Levin with Citigroup.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When you talk to your C&I loan clients about their investment plans, how are they thinking about the trade-off between using the cash on their balance sheets to fund their investing versus borrowing to fund their CapEx?","Lars C. Anderson","Sure. It's interesting. We continue to get record levels of deposits. In fact, this particular quarter, noninterest-bearing demand deposits were the big driver. Those are relationship deposits primarily driven by businesses. It's interesting. We're seeing a pickup in investments, CapEx, hiring, working capital, and yet, our customers tend to be carrying more liquidity than we've seen in the past. I'm not sure if it's a paradigm kind of shift, maybe a more cautious position, but we clearly see this as different than prior cycles, and it's clearly benefiting us from a deposit growth perspective.","Ralph W. Babb","I think that's true both with the consumer as well as the business side. People are being more cautious, in talking to various -- of our customers are holding more liquidity, as Lars was saying.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, we're even seeing that in small business, Ralph, so it's -- will be kind of across the board. Yes.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And when you talk about taking market share, do you have a sense of how much market share you're taking from other banks versus non-bank competitors, such as the capital markets?","Lars C. Anderson","Unfortunately, in commercial corporate banking, there's not a good index for that. So what I'm always looking at is how the overall markets are growing and how we're growing relative to them in the spaces that we serve and we know, and I feel very good. Like I've mentioned 4 consecutive of quarters of nice commercial loan growth. The last 2 have been very robust. So I feel very confident that we're outpacing the markets. But I would tell you, we're not changing our strategies. It's not a result of us changing what our markets are, our businesses. I think that what we're doing is we're reallocating resources. We're creating more accountability. We're spending more time in the market, the customers as well as prospects, and I think that's serving us well.","Operator","You next question will come from the line of Justin Maurer with Lord, Abbett.","Justin C. Maurer - Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC","Just a quick question on the -- I've talked about mortgage. Does HARP help that business at all? Or is that largely done just kind of through the existing larger bank servers and such? Or should you guys potentially see any benefit from that?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. Justin, the HARP volume has not really impacted our customers in Mortgage Banking Finance. Our customers are primarily focused on, really, more the prime mortgage market. So it has not had a significant impact on our volumes. Market share gains and favorable mortgage rates have been the key drivers.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Let me give Lars a rest for at least a couple of seconds and ask Karen a couple of quick questions. If I calculate your all-in cost of deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, those -- looks like those were down about 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 16 basis points. You mentioned that the -- that it was 26 basis points for the interest-bearing deposits. How much lower do you think you can drive those from the current levels?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. We are monitoring our cost of deposits at a very granular level, and we focus on it every month. So because of our keen focus, we will continue to find opportunities. I'm not sure though that those opportunities will continue to add up to something meaningful at the total average deposit cost level.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I'm presuming your net interest income guidance includes the effect of the drops TARP repayment?","Karen L. Parkhill","It does. TARP repayment is built into our guidance.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. And then just one final quick question. The commercial mortgage loan yields are up about 80 basis point year-over-year. They're up a little bit less than 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Can you give a little color as to what's driving that?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. No problem. I feel a lot better than I sound. I think a significant impact to that is the fact that the majority activity that we're seeing is in footprint urban market-oriented, multifamily projects, construction projects, very well capitalized. Obviously, that's a -- tends to be a fee-rich kind of opportunity for the company, and I think that, that's having a very positive impact on us. I think that that will also help us once we begin to see drawdowns on those facilities just in terms of overall growth in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio.","Karen L. Parkhill","We are also aided in that portfolio by accretion from the Sterling loan discount on the Commercial Real Estate loans coming off.","Lars C. Anderson","That's true.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian (sic) [Ryan] Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups from earlier questions. You guys reiterated moderately higher net interest income year-over-year, although 1\/2 last year excluding Sterling. So I just -- I appreciate we'll be up moderately, but how do we think about the run rate for the rest of the year relative to 1Q? I think given your guidance that accretion will be coming down, is the expectation of a decline from here? Or can we see loan growth actually offset the accretion headwinds?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Clearly, loan growth will be the key driver going forward. We do, as you said and as we guided, expect accretion to be coming down. So we are focused on loan growth being the driver.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Lars, I have a sore throat too, so I'll try to make this one quick. But I understand you guys are taking share in the Mortgage Banking area, and HARP isn't really impacting. But I'm just trying to understand, we look at industry volumes, we've seen apps up each of the last 2 quarters, and I understand there could be differences in terms of timing, but I guess I'm just trying to understand. Your balances were down quarter-over-quarter. Can you just give us a sense of what actually drove the balances down relative to what we see in the rest of the industry?","Lars C. Anderson","Well, some of the headlines, Brian, are being driven by the HARP volumes overall, but we did expect that we would see some declines in the first quarter. If you look at the averages, it was only down $50 million. It was down $250 million in terms of end points. So it kind of tracked about what we had expected. Volumes, overall, for the mortgage companies that we bank, which are very much a prime mortgage-oriented market, did decline some. I will tell you that the percentage of purchase volumes did increase, which I think was a positive for us in that business. It's going to be driven though largely by mortgage interest rate changes throughout the balance of the year. I think that'll be a big driver for us.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","A question for Karen. First, on the fee income, you guys have talked about a good solid start to the year. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is within the other noninterest income, it was $29 million. And I know you talked about certain things within the investment banking and other sort of items. Maybe the bigger question, just on the $206 million, what is sort of a more recurring run rate out of that number? Because if I annualize that number, it gets to be significantly higher than the $792 million they had for the full year of 2011. So it seemed if you're keeping your guidance the same, should we think that the next -- the rest of the year should be a lower level of fee income versus this first quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. On our noninterest income, I think it's important -- on the 6% increase in customer-related fees that we talked about, that was a $10 million increase. Important to note that $3 million of that, approximately, is driven by an annual increase in service charges, so that would not be repeated for the rest of the year. Also, on noninterest income, we did have securities gains, which we don't build into our forecast when we give the outlook. Those are very difficult to predict.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And then one other question for you, Karen, on the securities portfolio. You say that the target is for a $9 billion target on the MBS portfolio. It's around $9.5 billion right now, I guess. What\u2019s the quarterly cash flows coming off of that portfolio? In case the loan growth does slow down, is that something that would just build back in taxes liquidity?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Currently, right now in our securities portfolio, we are reinvesting our prepayments. Those are averaging around $850 million to $900 million a quarter. We expect that to continue. The $9 billion target is still our target, but included in the balance sheet number is some unrealized gains from our mark-to-market of that portfolio. So that's why you see it above $9.5 billion -- at approximately $9.5 billion right now. We do also -- while we're not market timers, we do try to, as we reinvest those prepaid, hit the market when we can have some better yields, and so that's why you see variability in that target balance number.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And actually, Lars, sorry, I got one more question for you. On the syndicated credit book, it looks like that was up about $300 million in the first quarter. Maybe you can kind of give some guidance. And is it sort of across those key portfolios of National Dealer Service, Energy and the Middle Market? Is that where we saw the growth in the syndicated books?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. Brian, that's a pretty good description, but I would say it was very much weighted towards general Middle Market. We had a lot of activity in the fourth quarter kind of coming into the first quarter with just kind of core Middle Market companies that we had good activity on.","Operator","Your next question will come from Michael Rose with Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on M&A. You're about 9 months out from the Sterling deal. Obviously, you have a buyback in place, and probably, you're going to increase the dividend here. Any updated thoughts on M&A activity and kind of what you're seeing in your opportunities going forward?","Ralph W. Babb","I think as I said before, I feel very comfortable with our footprint today and where we are. And if you remember, when we announced Sterling, that was a very strategic move for us, because it put us into Houston and San Antonio as well as Kerrville. As things come up, we -- we're always looking, but from the standpoint of expansion today, it would have to fit and be at an appropriate price to expand in those markets where we are.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Karen, a couple of follow-up questions. You mentioned confidence in both the M&A cost the rest of the year and also, the accretable yield. In terms of your confidence, is your confidence that those are the numbers that are going to be actual or that you're confident that you can beat those numbers going forward in terms of M&A expense and accretable yield?","Karen L. Parkhill","So I think you're talking -- when you say M&A expense, you're talking about the restructuring charges.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Karen L. Parkhill","We've given a range for that guidance of $5 million to $10 million next quarter. Hard to tell you where it's going to be within that range. We've also said that we expect about $40 million for the rest of the year. Again, there's a plus or minus there, more likely a minus than a plus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when you look at things in a vacuum, given some of the comments on the accretable yield and the restructuring cost in the second quarter, I'm looking from first quarter to second quarter, is it roughly about a $0.10 headwind given the fact that accretable yield could be down $12 million to $15 million, and the M&A expense could be up $5 million to $10 million versus first quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Clearly, there is a headwind from accretion coming down and restructuring charges going up next quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sean Ryan [ph] with Endava Global Research [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I just had a question about the securities portfolio, just with the duration creeping out a little bit more this quarter. Just wondering how you're thinking about that, and if -- I'm not sure you're comfortable with this level. Is there some point beyond which you don't want to go? Should we expect to see it continue to creep out a bit more?","Karen L. Parkhill","We want, in our securities portfolio, to obviously be in highly liquid, highly rated securities. We are in that. It's mostly invested in mortgage-backed securities, which are highly liquid. Yes, the duration did creep out a little bit but not much, moved from 2.7 last quarter to 2.9 this quarter. We are -- we do have robust prepays on that portfolio, as we talked about, averaging between $850 million and $900 million per quarter. We are continuing to reinvest those prepays. Should we see robust loan growth and our -- with our deposit growth, we will, obviously, not continue to reinvest those prepays. So hopefully, that answers your question.","Ralph W. Babb","We've not changed the strategy is really what you're saying.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, strategy remains the same.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jeff Davis with Guggenheim Securities.","Jeff K. Davis - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","My questions have been have been answered.","Operator","Your next question will come from Steve Scinicariello with UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones for you. So I just noticed on the strong pipelines, 2\/3 coming from new business. I know that's up from last quarter, and I just kind of wanted to follow up, like what are some of the key reasons or some of the key drivers why you're picking up share from the competition out there?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. Well, you are accurate. 2\/3 of the pipeline today is new business opportunities for Comerica. I'd like to be able to make it easy and point to one particular business, but I can't do that. It's very broad-based. It's not broad-based just across our businesses. It's broad-based across our major markets also. So that would -- I think it gives us good momentum as we head into the second quarter.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. No, it definitely, definitely looks strong. And then just looking on Page 28 of the slide deck, focusing on the strong deposit growth, up 6% on the Specialty business side, just curious to get a little bit more color there just given how strong that has been.","Ralph W. Babb","Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. We continue to see deposit growth across most of our businesses and our markets. The Specialty business deposit growth has been driven by businesses like our Technology & Life Sciences business.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So basically, is there any reason why we shouldn't see these kind of trends continue as you continue to book these new customers and take market share? Or it sounds like as long as this momentum continues, then these result -- type of results can continue as well. Is that fair?","Karen L. Parkhill","And I think because we drive full relationships with our customers, when we are capturing new customers, we are focused on gaining their transaction account deposit. So yes, from that perspective of new customer gain, we should expect to see increased deposit.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sorry to prolong this call, but I just have one question for you, Ralph. In terms of Michigan, the legacy Michigan versus today, curious your view as to what's changed and what's possible. I guess, a little background. The reason I ask is it's been stable to a drag in that market for a long time, really, 5 years, maybe even 10 years, and it's pretty obvious to me that things have changed for the better. And I'm just curious what you think is possible longer term in that market and whether or not it's possible that it can start to keep pace with the rest of the franchise in terms of growth.","Ralph W. Babb","I think as I mentioned earlier in talking about our activity index there, it has bounced back extremely well. It's broad-based, and we're seeing expansion not just in the auto industry but now, more broad-based. And as I look at Robert Dye, who's our Chief Economist, and his projections, he's looking for GDP to increase significantly better than the national average going forward. So I think things are moving in the right direction. We have a lot of very good customers and clients there. We're seeing expansion start to happen. And as was mentioned earlier, capacity is running out, which is a good news, meaning as in the auto industry that Lars was talking about, with auto sales at the $14 million -- I'm sorry, the 14 million unit level, that expansion is accelerating. So I feel very good about what's happening in Michigan today as do our colleagues there, and it's a very important market for us today and going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Reynolds with Wunderlich Securities.","Kevin B. Reynolds - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","All my questions have been answered by now.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I just have one quick question. On your kind of slide deck, talked about your long-term ROA goal of 1.3%. Obviously, interest rates is a big piece of that, but you did point out that the loan growth assumption of 5% to 6% is pretty meaningful. I assume that that's 5% to 6% on an annualized basis and not just aggregate from here. So what does that -- what would that translate to without knowing kind of the time line you're looking at here on this target in terms of the kind of loan-to-earning asset mix? Obviously, that mix becomes a big part of achieving that goal.","Ralph W. Babb","Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Sure. Yes, the loan growth there -- this is a long-term goal, so that loan growth is a long-term number, but it is annualized. So when we think about the loan-to-deposit ratio, which I think is what your question is, we do -- it's hard -- it's very difficult to predict deposits. And so we didn't build that much into the equation, but what we did build into the equation is the interest rate that we would earn, as you can see on the chart. We don't need to get to a normalized rate environment, which we would define as Fed funds and LIBOR, which moves in tandem with Fed funds, typically, to be around 3.5% to reach our goal.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Well, I guess -- if I just ask a follow-up to that, I guess what I was really asking is not so much loan-to-deposit mix, but as you looked at your kind of earning asset, asked at what right now is 75% loans and 25% non-loan earning assets. What does that have to get to, to drive you towards that 1.3% number?","Karen L. Parkhill","We are focused on loan growth on -- over the long term much more than overall asset growth. So we would expect that a better growth in our mix between loans versus the rest of the earning assets would skew more heavily toward loans.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Babb for any closing remarks.","Ralph W. Babb","Well, thank you, all, for your interest and being on the call today.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release issued today, as well as Slide 2 of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our filings with the SEC.","Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures. And in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph, who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph W. Babb","Good morning. Today, we reported third quarter 2013 net income of $147 million or $0.78 per share compared to $143 million or $0.76 per share in the second quarter and $117 million or $0.61 per share in the third quarter of 2012. Quarterly earnings per share grew 28% over last year, primarily due to fee income growth, expense control and continued solid credit quality. Part of the expense improvement was due to a $25 million reduction in restructuring expense related to the successful integration of Sterling Bancshares.","Turning to Slide 4 and other highlights. Average total loans were up $497 million or 1% on a year-over-year basis, but decreased $799 million or 2% compared to the second quarter. Loan volume in the third quarter compared to the second quarter was impacted by the continued economic uncertainty and the understandable caution of our customers, as well as seasonality in our auto-dealer floor plan loans and a decline in refinanced volumes impacting our mortgage warehouse financing business. While loans outstanding were down quarter-over-quarter, total loan commitments increased $560 million as of September 30, with commitments increasing in nearly all business lines. In addition, our loan pipeline remains strong and is 10% higher than it was a year ago. And we continue to grow deposits, reflecting our relationship banking strategy. Average total deposits increased $2 billion or 4% year-over-year and $417 million or 1% over second quarter to $51.9 billion. In further comparing our third quarter results to the second quarter, net interest income remained relatively stable at $412 million, reflecting the benefit from 1 additional day in the quarter and improved yields in the securities portfolio offset by the decline in loan balances and lower loan yields. Credit quality continued to be strong, resulting in an $8 million provision. Net charge-offs increased slightly from their low level, while nonperforming assets and watch list loans declined, resulting in a small reserve release. Noninterest income increased $6 million to $214 million, primarily due to a $4 million increase in customer-driven fee income. Noninterest expenses increased $1 million to $417 million as an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense was partially offset by decreases in other categories.","Turning to our capital position. Our capital continues to be a source of strength to support our growth. At September 30, 2013, our tangible common equity ratio was 9.87%, and we estimate our Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio to be 10.4%. We repurchased 1.7 million shares in the third quarter under our share repurchase program and are now 2 quarters into our 4 quarter share repurchase plan announced last March.","Turning to Slide 5. We have a unique footprint that primarily covers the major Metropolitan areas in the 3 states you see here: Texas, California and Michigan, where there are good opportunities to pursue the types of businesses we serve. Our recent Texas Economic Activity Index showed the state economy ticked up in July after being relatively stable since last November. Gains in July were broad-based and indicated that upward momentum will likely continue in the months ahead. We expect the Texas economy to show solid growth through the end of this year.","The FDIC's annual deposit survey as of June 30, 2013, recently made public shows that we have increased our market share in Dallas, Fort Worth and Austin. Average loans and deposits in Texas were both up 4% year-over-year, reflecting growth in most segments. Our most recent California Economic Activity Index is ahead of the 2012 average and reflects a variety of factors contributing to the improving, but uneven growth in the California economy. Labor markets are generally improving and residential real estate prices are firming statewide, so conditions look favorable for ongoing moderate economic expansion in the state.","We strengthened our market share in the San Jose area according to the FDIC survey, while maintaining our market share position in greater Los Angeles. Average loans in California were up $1.1 billion or 8% year-over-year, with growth in most lines of business. Deposits were down 3% year-over-year, primarily due to a decline in deposits attached to our title escrow business as the mortgage refinance market slowed.","Our most recent Michigan Economic Activity Index is well ahead of the average for all of 2012. Stronger auto sales in late summer should lead to solid production this fall. Labor markets are firming and house prices are improving so there is broadening support for the Michigan economy. We strengthened our #2 market share position in Michigan according to the FDIC survey. Average loans in Michigan were relatively stable year-over-year, while deposits grew 4%, reflecting increases in every segment.","We remain focused on the bottom line in this uncertain environment with prolonged low rates. We believe our geographic footprint is well situated in Texas, California and Michigan and that our relationship banking strategy will contribute to our continued success. We are staying the course and maintaining our discipline with an eye on the road ahead.","And now I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen L. Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6, as Ralph mentioned, average total loans were up $497 million or 1% on a year-over-year basis. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, average loans decreased $799 million or 2%, reflecting a $630 million decrease in commercial loans and $180 million decline in combined Commercial Real Estate construction and mortgage loans. The decrease in average commercial loans was primarily driven by declines in general Middle Market, National Dealer Services and Mortgage Banker Finance, all of which I will discuss in more detail on the next slide. Offsetting some of this decline, average loans to our Technology and Life Sciences customers increased $112 million.","In the broad category of Commercial Real Estate loans, construction loans grew for the third consecutive quarter, and commitments to developers continued to increase. However, we continue to see commercial mortgages decrease for 2 reasons: one, Commercial Real Estate construction projects continue to move quickly to the permanent long-term financing markets; and two, owner-occupied real estate, which makes up 73% of our Commercial Real Estate loans, continued to decline with normal amortization. You can see on the left chart that total period-end loans were down $1.3 billion, primarily due to an $875 million decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance and a $354 million decrease in National Dealer Services. As Ralph mentioned, our total loan commitments have increased in nearly all business lines. With commitments up and outstandings down, line utilization decreased to 45.4% from 48.6% at the end of the second quarter. Mortgage banker and auto dealer were the big drivers of the decline in utilization, but even without these 2 businesses, utilization was down 1%. Importantly, our loan pipeline remains strong and is 10% higher than it was a year ago. Finally, loan yields, shown in the yellow diamonds, declined 3 basis points in the quarter, reflecting the continued mix shift of our portfolio.","Continuing with loans on Slide 7, we've provided additional data on the 3 major areas affecting our loan performance in the quarter. General Middle Market average loans were down compared to the second quarter, which we believe is related to customer cautiousness. This belief is supported by the fact that line commitments have increased slightly and average deposits have increased compared to the second quarter. As shown in the upper right chart, National Dealer Services, which includes our auto floor plan loans, had average total loans decline $223 million in the third quarter after increasing $250 million in the second quarter. The yellow diamonds show the period end inventory supply on dealer's lot. As you can see, the supply increased at the end of the third quarter, and along with that, our dealer outstandings grew $133 million in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. However, our average loan balances for the quarter were down, in line with the average inventory supply, shown by the orange diamond, reflecting both the strong sales level in the industry, as well as the normal seasonal changeover to new 2014 models. We expect to continue to see the normal seasonal pattern which would suggest that inventory levels will continue to rebuild in the fourth quarter.","Shown in the bottom right chart, Mortgage Banker Finance, which provides mortgage warehouse lending lines, saw average loans decline $210 million in the third quarter, and as I mentioned a moment ago, declined $875 million at period end to $1.5 billion. This was expected given the rise in long-term rates and its impact on the refinancing market and is in line with the decline in mortgage volumes, which is shown on the yellow line on the chart. We expect these loans will continue to decline in the near term, but eventually stabilize, along with mortgage volumes.","Turning to deposits on Slide 8. Our total average deposits increased $417 million or 1% to $51.9 billion, reflecting increases in most lines of business. Noninterest-bearing deposits grew $303 million while interest-bearing deposits increased $114 million. As shown by the yellow diamonds on the slide, deposit pricing declined to 18 basis points as higher rate CDs matured and repriced. Period end deposits increased $1.7 billion, primarily reflecting an increase of $2 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits, again, reflecting growth in most business lines, with the largest increase in Corporate Banking.","Slide 9 provides details on our securities portfolio, which primarily consists of highly liquid, highly rated mortgage-backed securities. The NBS portfolio averaged $9 billion in the third quarter, down $411 million from the second quarter, resulting from a decline in the fair value of the portfolio due to the rise in long-term rates, combined with the slowdown in the pace of purchases to reinvest prepayments. The fair value of the portfolio decreased $34 million in pretax in the third quarter, resulting in a net unrealized loss position for the portfolio of $24 million. And the estimated duration of the portfolio increased slightly from 4.1 years at the end of the second quarter to 4.2 years at the end of the third quarter. This increase in duration resulted in a retrospective adjustment to the premium amortization of $4 million and added 17 basis points to the yield on the portfolio in the third quarter. The expected duration under a 200-basis-point rate shock remained relatively constant at about 5 years as a result of the composition of our portfolio. Based on current rate expectations, we believe that the pace of prepaids will continue to slow, with $350 million to $450 million in prepaids expected in the fourth quarter, down from almost $600 million in the third quarter. We continue to manage our portfolio dynamically, taking into account many factors, including our loan and deposit expectations, as well as overall yields and duration available.","Turning to Slide 10. Despite the decline in loan volume, our net interest income remained relatively stable, with a small $2 million decline in the third quarter. We've summarized in the table on the right the major moving pieces to our net interest income and net interest margin. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points, including a 5-basis-point impact from the $1.2 billion increase in average excess liquidity, which added $1 million to net interest income. Total loan portfolio dynamics reduced net interest income by $7 million or 3 basis points on the net interest margin. This included a $6 million impact from reduced loans outstanding, $5 million from lower loan yields, resulting from the continued mix shift in our loan portfolio, as well as $1 million decline due to the drop in 30-day LIBOR, which decreased over 1 basis point on average in the quarter. You may recall that approximately 85% of our loans are floating rates, of which 75% are LIBOR-based, predominantly 30-day LIBOR. And while we remain focused on holding loan spreads for new and renewed credit facilities, there are still mix shift dynamics impacting the loan portfolio. This quarter, the mix shift was primarily due to higher-yielding loan balances declining and continued positive credit migration. Offsetting these negative impacts, interest on loans benefited from 1 additional day in the quarter, which added $4 million, and from $1 million increase in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired portfolio. We have recorded $26 million in accretion so far this year and expect to recognize about $2 million to $4 million in the fourth quarter. We have about $35 million of total accretion remaining, which we expect to realize over the next few years at a declining pace. Dynamics in the securities portfolio had a positive benefit, increasing net interest income by $2 million or 3 basis points on the margin, primarily the result of a $4 million improvement in yields due to slowing prepayment speeds. This was partially offset by a decrease in average balances. Finally, lower funding costs, including debt maturities in the second quarter, as well as lower deposit costs, added $2 million and provided a 1 basis point increase to the margin. We believe our asset-sensitive balance sheet remains well positioned for rising rates. Based in our historical experience and asset liability model, we believe a 200-basis-point increase in rates over a 1-year period, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result in about a 13% increase in net interest income or approximately $200 million. This number is higher than the equivalent number in the prior quarter due to our growth in deposits.","Turning to the credit picture on Slide 11. Credit quality continue to be strong in the third quarter. Net charge-offs increased slightly to $19 million or 18 basis points of average loans. The charts on the right show our watch list loans declined $210 million and our nonperforming loans declined $12 million. With a decline in nonperforming loans, the allowance to NPLs increased to 131%. And as you can see on the lower left chart, our $604 million allowance for loan losses covers our trailing 12 months net charge-offs over 6x. As a result of the continued positive trends in our credit metrics, our provision for credit losses declined $5 million from the second quarter to $8 million, resulting in a small reserve release. Finally, as we mentioned last quarter, we received the annual Shared National Credit exam results at the end of June. They were reflected in our second quarter numbers and were not significant.","Slide 12 outlines the $6 million increase in noninterest income, which was driven by a $4 million increase in customer-driven fees. Commercial lending fees were the largest contributor, increasing $6 million due to higher syndication agent fees and higher facility fees charged on commitments. These increases were partially offset by a decline in fiduciary income, primarily due to seasonally higher fees in the second quarter related to tax return preparation. The increase in noncustomer-driven income was primarily due to an increase of $5 million in warrant income from the exercise of warrants related to some Technology and Life Sciences relationships. Somewhat offsetting this increase was a decline in incentives received from our third-party credit card provider. Last quarter, we booked the full $6 million annual incentive payment. Going forward, we will record this incentive which can vary from year to year on a quarterly basis.","Turning to Slide 13. Our expenses remained well controlled, which resulted in relatively stable expenses in the third quarter. Salaries and benefits expense increased $10 million. This reflected an increase in incentives, as well as 1 additional day in the third quarter, which was partially offset by lower staff insurance expense. The incentive expense increase includes a year-to-date accrual adjustment for senior officers incentives based on favorable performance relative to peers, as well as an increase in business unit incentive, in line with increased loan commitments, fee income and deposits. Offsetting the salary and benefit increase was a decline in other noninterest expenses. This included a decrease of $6 million in litigation-related expenses, primarily due to a $5 million legal reserve release, following the pending settlement of a class action case. And we had a $4 million write-down on other foreclosed assets in the second quarter that was not repeated.","Moving to Slide 14 and shareholder payout. In the third quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares under our share repurchase program. Combined with the dividends paid, we returned 70% of net income to our shareholders in the third quarter. We believe our shareholder payout is a reflection of our strong capital position, with an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio of 10.4% at September 30 on a fully phased-in basis, excluding the impact of AOCI. Shares repurchased were more than offset by share dilution primarily from our warrants as average stock price increased during the quarter.","Finally, turning to Slide 15 and our outlook. We have typically provided a year-over-year outlook and updated it through the year. Along those lines, know that our expectations for full year 2013 compared to full year 2012 remains unchanged with the exception of customer-driven fee income. Given the strong fee generation we had, particularly in the third quarter, we do believe that our full year 2013 customer-driven fees will be modestly higher than our 2012 customer-driven fees.","Turning to the final quarter of the year. This slide outlines our expectations for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. We expect average loans to be stable with third quarter levels. We believe we will see a rebound on our auto dealer floor plan loans as dealers receive their 2014 model inventory, and we expect mortgage banker outstandings to continue to decline, in line with the Mortgage Banker association forecast for mortgage origination. We also intend to maintain our pricing and structure discipline which is core to our culture and has served us well throughout economic cycles. Net interest income is expected to be lower in the fourth quarter due to an expected decline in purchase accounting accretion, as well as the continued effect of the low rate environment. We expect loan portfolio yields to decline due to the continued loan mix shift and improving asset quality. With continued strong credit quality, we expect net charge-off, provision and reserve release to remain low, similar to what we have seen in the past 3 quarters. We expect customer-driven noninterest income for the fourth quarter to be relatively stable as we believe we will be able to continue to generate the solid fees we booked in the third quarter. On the other hand, noncustomer-related income can include volatile and unusual items. For example, we had a $6 million annual incentive payment from our third-party credit card processor in the second quarter and a $6 million in warrant income from Technology and Life Sciences customers in the third quarter. These types of items are difficult to predict, but overall, we expect noncustomer-related income should decline in the fourth quarter. Finally, we expect slightly lower expenses in the fourth quarter as we continue to manage expenses carefully. Incentive compensation should be lower in the fourth quarter given the year-to-date accrual adjustment we incurred in the third quarter. This will be offset by additional expenses related to regulatory compliance, predominantly stress testing, as well as seasonality of certain expenses such as occupancy.","In summary, we will continue to focus on the things we can control, allocating resources to our faster-growing markets and industry segments to grow relationships, while carefully managing expenses.","Now we are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe I could start, looking at core C&I loan trends, excluding mortgage banker and dealer finance, you've seen a real weakening over the past few quarters. I know you said commercial customers are cautious, something you've said over the last few quarters, but do you have a sense why customers seem to be getting so much more cautious here? And how do you reconcile that with your customers continuing to want more commitments, but then going on to borrow even less?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars, you want to take that one?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, well, a couple of things, Steve. First of all, if you look back over the last several quarters, you'll see a continued increase actually. If you look over the last 1.5 years, about a $4 billion increase overall in commercial loan outstandings. That's about 18% in growth. But your point is well taken that we have seen utilization rates decline this quarter. If you strip out the Mortgage Banking Finance and National Dealer Services, utilization rates are down about 1% on the rest of the businesses. Frankly, I think it's a reflection. And I spend a lot of time with customers and they have just continued uncertainty about the current economic environment. It's difficult for them to make investment decisions with pretty unclear economic horizon right now. So we're going to focus on what we can control, and that is making sure that in the markets we serve, we continue to grow customers, which we're doing. We're broadening customer relationships. You see these commitments continue to rise, and I think we're going to be well positioned. Once the confidence returns, we're going to start to see access to those commitments. And I think we have some nice upside potential there, Steve, once that confidence does return to the marketplace, at least for the markets that we serve, in Texas, California and Michigan and some of our industry groups.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And maybe one just for Karen. How should we think about the timeline to deploy this excess liquidity position that you built up in the securities book over the next quarter or so, or do you hold some of that for eventual loan growth?","Karen L. Parkhill","No problem, Steve. Thank you. Our securities portfolio, we treat on a very dynamic basis. That includes the excess liquidity that we hold at the Fed. We do want to remain positioned for loan growth, and as we think about that, we will manage it dynamically, taking into account the forward factors around where we think our deposits are going, where we think our loans are going. And we are also mindful of our securities portfolio, the long-term effect that, that could have, particularly on our tangible common equity as that will be mark-to-market in a rising rate environment.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Does that imply that you just hold this position about where it stands today?","Karen L. Parkhill","We'll continue to manage it dynamically. We can't say whether we'll hold it or not, but it will be a dynamic equation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just to go back on the loan growth question for a second. When we looked at your footprint places like California, Texas, healthy economies that are growing, it doesn't seem to be coming through in the loan growth. Is it just potentially big types of industry groups that you guys are dealing with? I'm just curious. What's the disconnect there?","Ralph W. Babb","Well, I think what -- Lars can follow up on this, too, but underlying what he was talking about earlier is our customers are doing very well in the economies where they are and the footprint that we have. But they're being very cautious about investing for the future like they normally would until they get a good feeling as to, as Lars put it, what the rules will be going forward. And as we all know, we have a lot going on right now in Washington as well, and people are holding and waiting and watching to see what's going to happen before they move forward.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, let me just -- to really underscore Ralph's point, if you take Michigan as an example in the automotive industry, we bank some of the best in the business there. In the Middle Market space, they're doing very well. They're generating a lot of excess cash. And frankly, they're delevering. I was with a customer just a couple of weeks ago. They're running 3 shifts. They're running about 100% capacity. His position was, we're going to continue this through the end of year, kind of get through the window. But he said, frankly, he's prepared to make some very significant investments in '14 if the auto industry continues at the pace that it's on. And frankly, I think most would expect that. In Texas, I think if you look at those numbers, our underlying kind of general Middle Market activity and commitment levels are very good. In fact, if you look at our commitments in linked quarters, they were up very nicely in Texas. But you did have some impact from Energy, which is based here out of, again, unique industry, based out of Texas. The Energy portfolio has been fairly flat the last couple of quarters, and that certainly figures into the math and the geography as a number of our Energy customers really focused on harvesting existing investments and accessing the bond market in paying down debt. But they're the same customers. We're well positioned, and we're well positioned for growth with them as they start to refocus on CapEx and rig counts go up.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So could we just switch to the capital side for a second? You guys are obviously in a very strong position as you head into your first round of CCAR. Just when you think about the potential, what you would ask for under CCAR, is there any change to the thought process under the CapPR scenario, meaning this is the first time you're going through this particular process? Any change in the mindset around that?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, it is the first time that we will be moving from a CapPR bank to a CCAR bank. We have been investing very heavily in people and technology to improve our process as a CCAR bank. It's too early to talk about what our potential capital ask would be, though. But I think it's important to know that we continue to believe that we come at this from a position of capital strength.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Sterne Agee.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask a question just around pricing and I know last quarter the large Corporate segment took a bit of a decline just due to you guys stepping away from what you were seeing in terms of pricing. Can you talk about that this quarter and maybe more in terms of Middle Market and what you're seeing in terms of how that's impacted your loan balances and the decisions you had to make around that?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Sure. Well, let me just clarify something from the second quarter earnings call. The Corporate Banking space continues to be a very important business for us in the long term. We've got some great customers there that we continue to work with and grow. And we're just having to be more selective in terms of new opportunities because that is where we see the most competitive space, not just from a pricing perspective but also from a structure perspective. And this is clearly not the time to overreach. If you do, there's consequences, so we're being patient. We're being very focused. We've got some great bankers, a lot of experience. And I think it's going to be a segment that's going to grow in the future. But we're going to be patient and we're going to be disciplined about our relationship pricing. In the Middle Market segment, it's a competitive marketplace out there across our footprint. It's hard to pick one geography over another to say which is the most competitive today. I think the thing that you got to focus on is making sure that your bankers are spending a lot of time in the marketplace and they're spending a lot of time with customers and prospects, building out those relationships. And I'd remind you, there's ways to improve profitability, client profitability, just beyond the credit pricing, and that's your broadening relationships and we're focusing on that as you'll see client-driven, noninterest income gains. We're very focused on cross-sell. But it's a challenging market, but I think that we've got the right business model. The Middle Market knows that we've been committed to it for a very long time, and we're very well positioned for a recovering economic environment.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my other follow-up was just around Technology and Life Sciences and maybe any color around the growth you did have this quarter. Was that any of that market share gains or was that all just kind of the growth of the segment?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. So you saw the IPO market obviously pick up more recently. And frankly, at the end of the day, the IPO market, the exit market, really drives the whole Technology and Life Sciences kind of space. You've got to have active DCs [ph] and private equity investment to make that work well. If you look at the -- if you break it down, if you look at the early stage part of Technology and Life Sciences, we continue to have very, very strong national market share, and we're very active in that space. We've also seen some excellent growth in our equity fund services business where we provide both core banking services, credit services into venture capital -- capitalist and private equity firms that have been very successful and recently announced that we had opened a new office in New York where we're seeing a lot of growth, and that's gotten a lot of traction. We've also opened an additional office in Houston, hired some great bankers there and we're seeing some nice successes there. So I see this as a good, long-term growth business for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question, just on expenses, I want to clarify the -- obviously, your guidance is for lower expenses in the fourth quarter. It seemed like it was because of an accrual adjustment and third quarter being a little higher. Is that right? But are you undertaking any more, I want to say, aggressive expense initiatives to keep expenses lower given what we're seeing on the loan side?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, thanks, Ken. You are right. One of the key reasons that we expect expenses to be lower in the fourth quarter is because we did have a year-to-date accrual adjustment in the third quarter around incentive comps given our relative performance to our peers, so that is one of the big drivers. We do expect some expenses to increase in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, namely, some seasonal expenses like occupancy, as well as some expenses related to stress testing capital planning. On expenses in general, we remain keenly focused on managing our expenses as we have for the past several years, and we will continue to do that, but there are not any major aggressive initiatives as we manage those expenses. It's really just continuing to do what we've done all along.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that helps. And then in terms of the slower prepayments, I know you highlighted the $600 million down to $350 million to $450 million. I'm assuming that the lower premium amortization is in your lower NII guidance, but can you quantify that? Like, how much potentially comes from slower premium amortization versus the negatives of the other items?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, you're right, it is in our guidance. And yes, we do expect slower prepays next quarter. We continually look at the life of our portfolio each quarter, the expected life. And as we continue to look at it, if rates continue to rise and prepays continue to slow, the expected life of our portfolio will extend a little bit, and that could result in some slower premium amortization going forward and a possible reversal of premium previously recognized, but that shouldn't be by a material amount.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a clarification question, the incentive payment from the third-party credit card provider. Presumably, we had it last quarter. We -- we're not expecting it this quarter, so actually this quarter was a surprise positive. It was extra income versus what we normally would've assumed. Just want to make sure I'm right on that.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. So as I mentioned, we used to record that incentive payment on an annual basis. We now will accrue it each quarter going forward. So yes, last quarter did have an annual payment and this quarter had some accrual.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is on the efficiency outlook for next year. I think you mentioned, Karen, that you're controlling the things that you can control, and your efficiency ratio has been consistent in about 67% over the past several quarters. As we look out into 2014, if there's not a significant improvement in the loan growth outlook and the rate environment remains what it is, is there more room on the expense side to drop that efficiency ratio from the 67%? Or is most of the efficiency improvement from here going to come from the revenue side?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. We -- as you know, Erika, we did set a long-term efficiency ratio target to be below 60%, and we continue to focus on moving toward that target regardless of the overall environment.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, got it. So I just wanted to make sure I understood that. If nothing changes on the revenue picture, you're still committed to taking it down below 60% on the other side of the equation?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. When we first announced that target, we did show a walk forward of what it will take to get there, which includes loan growth, fee growth, keeping expenses as flat as possible, and the fact that we would need a little bit of a rate environment uptick to ultimately get over the goal line, but certainly not a normal rate environment to get over the goal line. And so as we think about that in the near term without a rate environment uptick, we won't necessarily get over the goal line, but we will continue to bring that efficiency ratio down.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just a follow-up to Steve's question on the liquidity. Are you comfortable with your liquidity levels relative to the liquidity proposals that are -- might -- may be finalized at the end of this year? In other words, if the LCR passes as defined, how much excess liquidity do you have to redeploy?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, so the rules are far from final. We don't even have an initial draft or an NPR out in the United States. We are continuing to monitor that heavily. On the LCR ratio, as guided by the Basel III committee, we and all banks would need to add liquid assets to our portfolio.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just one more question, if I may. The larger banks have to deal with the supplementary leverage ratio that has them holding 100% capital against unfunded lines of commitment. Do you think that's an opportunity for potentially market share taking for regional banks like yours that don't have to deal with the SLR? Or is it way too early to tell?","Karen L. Parkhill","I think it's very early to tell because there are so many other things that can affect the competitive environment. You are right in the case that we, at least as proposed right now, will not need to adhere to a supplemental leverage ratio. We do, however, need to adhere to the normal leverage ratio which, for us, is not the binding constraint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Loan growth front, I wanted to get a little bit more clarity on what you're seeing on the Commercial Real Estate front. I know you gave us some good color that you're seeing borrowers remain cautious on the commercial front in general, but are you seeing any noted improvement in CRE lending? I know that some of the other CRE lenders are starting to see improving drawdowns on that front.","Ralph W. Babb","Lars, do you want to take that?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, sir. We -- as you can see in our numbers, our actual construction lending continues to make gains. We, again, showed another quarter of growth there. There is -- there's a lot of volume out there. We're positioned in terrific states, Texas and California, where you're seeing, in particular, a disproportionate amount of multi-family activity. And I think we're certainly getting our share. In fact, if you go to that page, I think it's 24, in the slides, it gives you a pretty good view of what's going on with our Commercial Real Estate portfolio. And as you see, the construction loans continue to increase. What you'll also notice is that the commercial mortgage loans, we have not seen that kind of increase, and there's really 2 components to that. The first is the mini perms, that is the conversion of construction projects over to a short-term extension of credits, typically 3 to 5 years for our developers for them to stabilize and position the market to go to the permanent market or sell the product. What they're seeing is a higher velocity of these projects moving more rapidly to the permanent market. The permanent market is taking, at this point, unstabilized, in some cases, projects, which is very unusual and different from, say, going back a year ago. The other component of that would be owner occupied. In the owner-occupied space, you're continuing to see, given the profile or the kinds of customers that we bank, they continue to delever. You see natural amortization. You see them paying off some of that longer-term debt that's on their balance sheet. And one last thing I'd note, there are some lenders in the marketplace that are providing, what I would say, is longer-term financing within banking that is outside of our underwriting standards, 15-, 20-year kind of fixed-rate financing, 30-year amortization. And that's not something that we do. So again, a time not to overreach. We're going to focus working with our developers and we got the same stable of them. We're picking up some new ones. These are typically very strong developers that have liquid positions. They're putting a lot of liquidity into these projects. And one of the things that I would point out with the increase in the construction portfolio, we are expecting that we will see advances under those credit facilities as we kind of go down the road and as they fulfill their obligation to properly equitize these projects. So I think we're well positioned. I think we got great long-term markets. We got great bankers, and I think that this is a business that will serve us well as we head down the road.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. So the permanent financing players, the insurance companies and the conduit fencers are certainly getting more aggressive?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, absolutely. Both -- you see it in the pricing for sure, but you also see it in the structure.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then, secondly, on the pricing side, can you give us a little bit of actual data points there in terms of where you're seeing new money yields come in on C&I and CRE right now?","Lars C. Anderson","I wish I could tell you exactly, kind of take an off-the-shelf price for you, that would make it easy. But we handle one relationship at a time at Comerica. Each one of them are individually underwritten. There's no standardized product. We look at the overall relationship. It's beyond just the credit. It has to do with how deep we get into the relationship. I'm really proud of the success we're making, for example, in deepening our relationships across into Wealth Management. We've seen a 50% increase in the penetration rate in Wealth Management services to our customers over the last couple of years. That's a lot of progress that's been made, and that all goes into ensuring that we're getting the right kinds of returns on the relationship for our shareholders. But I'll sum it up maybe helping you a little bit and just say that I don't see any easing in the competitiveness in the marketplace. It continues to be very aggressive. There's too few opportunities for the demand that's out there, so we're having to be very patient and careful. But we're also having to be more active in the marketplace looking for the right kinds of opportunities for the companies, developers that are looking for the value proposition that we deliver, that relationship banking kind of strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","My questions have been answered.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just real quick, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the mortgage warehouse business. I mean, it looks like the average balances are down much less than I would've guessed given industry volume, and I'm curious what to make of that. And then the end-of-period balance is down a lot more. How much of that is the normal end-of-period volatility? And how much of that is something that's more of an indicator of where we are headed into the next quarter?","Lars C. Anderson","Okay, very good. I'll take it, the second piece of it first, which is the ending balances. I'll tell you, it's very difficult to tell. There's a lot of variability at the end of each quarter and a lot of it has to do with the investors and kind of the activity levels that we see in terms of migrating those to the investor community. It's difficult to use that as a proxy for the fourth quarter, but maybe going back to the first part of your question will help you with that second part. And that is, the mortgage banking association's projection is that we were down 27% in the third quarter in overall mortgage volume nationally, as you probably know. We were down a little bit under 12% in averages, so we clearly outperformed the industry in terms of averages. But you get to the end of the quarter and, obviously, we were down significantly, significantly more, which is not all that unusual. However, the MBA is forecasting an additional kind of 20%, 30% decline heading into the fourth quarter of the year. So that could clearly impact the outstandings that we have in our portfolio. A strategic issue that I want to point out and I think that has served us very well, if you go back to 2011, we have increased the number of mortgage companies that we finance, staying very true to our strategy of the strongest and the best in the industry. We've increased the number of customers that we serve by 40%. So the business has become much more granular, we have a broader base. The second piece of it is this, in the national market, 49% of the mortgage volume was purchase. Our average for the third quarter was 71%. In other words, it was much more skewed toward purchase volumes, which, frankly, has been a strategic initiative of ours to make sure that we try to capture what, to me, appear to be a recovering national housing market and would likely be a slowing refi market, and I think that's played out well for us.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like the better performance versus the industry in the quarter is part purchase versus refi mix and part continued growth in customers? That's a fair synopsis?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then what happened to yields in that portfolio in the quarter?","Lars C. Anderson","We're starting to see more activity there. There's more players in the market, and we're seeing more pressure unquestionably as more competitors enter the space seeing it as an opportunity. We're going to have to continue to stay very focused on our relationship pricing overall. One thing that we're very much focused on in trying to offset some of the compression areas, even deepening the -- our relationships with those customers in terms of cross-sell and we're doing that. In fact, our treasury management penetration into that space continues to grow disproportionately to the rest of the franchise, and I think that that's a real positive. But that's going to be clearly a challenge for us as there's fewer opportunities and there's more players in the marketplace.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Then I guess changing gears, one last question. I just want to be sure I'm thinking about net interest income in the fourth quarter correctly. I mean, it sounds like it should be something on the magnitude of at least $8 million to $10 million lower and that you lose $4 million to $6 million of premium amortization and you shouldn't have the $4 million retroactive adjustment on premium adjustment on the MBS portfolio. Is that a fair way to think about how we enter the fourth quarter and then you've got sort of the normal drag from the low rate environment?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. So we do expect net interest income to be lower, as we mentioned. You're right on the numbers that you put out for accretion on the loan portfolio. It's difficult to predict what we would do on the securities portfolio and the premium amortization because that is a very dynamic equation, but you have the direction correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So my follow-up question is for Karen. On the expense side, to Ken's question earlier, so I'm calculating about a $6 million impact for the accrual in the quarter. You talked about a $5 million reserve, legal reserve release. So I guess, those 2 seem to be offsetting. I guess what I'm thinking about, though, is when I look at the other noninterest expense line, it was $37 million this quarter. I'm thinking that, that $5 million reserve release came out of there, so that's running still a couple of million dollars later than it's been for the last 5 or 6 quarters. And I was trying to find out, maybe you can update guidance to that $15 million CCAR expense item. Would have thought we would've seen some of that here in the third quarter so maybe you can kind of -- so does that make sense, first of all, all the math that I was kind of throwing together with that noninterest expense line being something that's more like a $42 million quarterly run rate? And then where can we find the CCAR expense build in the numbers?","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure. On our regulatory expenses, we did talk about that being approximately $15 million in an increase in expenses. Most of that -- the vast majority of it is already built into our run rate, you are correct.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a question for Lars. I know, Karen, you said at the -- I think you said at the end of the last 2 weeks of the quarter the National Dealer Services book grew about $133 million. And I'm wondering, I guess, Lars, do you think that we do see this fourth quarter build, the net book -- there was an article out yesterday in the Automotive News expecting that sales volumes could be down 10% here in the fourth quarter because of the government shutdown. So does that extend the inventories a little bit longer? Does it take the dealers a little bit longer to rebuild that inventory? Or I guess, how should we think about the pace and how fast dealers will rebuild inventories during the fourth quarter?","Lars C. Anderson","Right. So first of all, regarding the government kind of issues, I'm -- I don't really think that that's going to have a significant impact at this point on our overall Dealer portfolio. I just had lunch in the last 2 days with one of our largest automotive customers. And frankly, things are as good with him and his business, which is in both Michigan and in Texas, as it's ever been. Yes, he's seeing that typical seasonal new model turnover. Karen talked about the days on hand in inventory that we typically see. You didn't see that a year ago. That was because the Japanese were rebuilding their model brands in this country, but historically, you see it. You saw -- you're seeing it this year. We did begin to see the rebuilding of inventory levels. But typically, it happens gradually as we go through the fourth quarter, up right through the end of the year. And if you look at historically, the average days on hand in January typically is kind of the highest level of the year, that's our peak month. So hopefully, that gives you some insight. I -- frankly, I'm very bullish on our Dealer business. Our dealers -- when I talk about there's variation in how our customers are feeling, clearly, this is an industry where, largely, our customers are feeling very good. They're making a lot of money. They're well positioned. They're rebranding, and refacing a lot of their facilities. You can see that probably in your own marketplace. And auto sales remain up, so we're well positioned.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Got it, thanks for that color. And I guess maybe I can squeeze in one quick one. I don't know if John Killian is there, but Texas provisions went up this quarter. Is there anything to think about what's going on there in Texas versus all the positive credit performance in the rest of the geographies?","Ralph W. Babb","John?","John M. Killian","Sure, Brian. There's nothing unusual there from a portfolio trend standpoint. Texas suffers a little bit from having such great basic loan quality that when 1 or 2 deals does happen to have some distress, it looks like an aberration, and that's how I view it as well.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So can you tell us whether that was Commercial Real Estate or C&I or...","John M. Killian","It was C&I, Middle Market C&I.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow up on Bob's question on the Mortgage Banker Finance business. You mentioned the pricing came in this quarter. I was just wondering if you could provide the delta there over the last quarter. And if you give the current yield on that portfolio, that would be great.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, we don't give yields out for that specific portfolio. It is a portfolio that has higher yields than some of our others, so...","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. So we've seen -- I'll just put it to you this way, we've seen slight compression. And if you look at our current portfolio against our new and renewed, there's a very slight compression there, but it continues to be a very attractive overall business for Comerica.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And just one last one. Sorry if you already covered this, but the bump-up in the commercial mortgage yield during the quarter, what the driver was there?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. That was mainly due to attrition of securities that were lower yielding and as well as accretion.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D. A. Davidson.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Lars, I just had a question. You drew down a little bit in Texas vis-\u00e0-vis the Energy portfolio, a little bit of a decline there sequentially, but can you kind of talk about the other loan segments within the Texas market? I was, I guess, surprised given the strength of that market in general that we had that sort of sequential decline in outstanding balances.","Lars C. Anderson","Right, yes. So I think some of the big story, if you just look at the overall growth in Texas, obviously, we had some nonstrategic assets in Commercial Real Estate that were running off. That certainly impacted some of our numbers. You heard me talk about the Energy portfolio that leveled out as a number of our customers accessed the overall bond market and paid down some of their senior debt. But frankly, I'm very encouraged. We've got -- we've added additional Middle Market bankers in the Houston market that continues to grow. We're seeing nice growth there in Middle Market. The Dallas-Fort Worth market, we're seeing good activities there, pipelines. And I would also point out, we're seeing really nice activities in small business. In fact, not just nationally, but also in Texas, in particular, we've seen sequential quarters of small business outstandings growing. So I think if you put all that together, along with our Wealth Management, it's -- we're very well positioned in this day. I think we've got a lot of the right businesses. I'd point out one other business that's fairly significant here, and we've got a nice presence and we expanded and that's Technology and Life Sciences. I've told you, I see this as a long-term growth business for us. We have -- that is based out of Austin, Texas, which is a hotbed for tech companies. That continues to grow, be very active. We're seeing pipelines grow there. We've expanded into Houston. I think we'll see that grow. We've added bankers in Environmental Services that are really canvassing the state. And again, as -- we're seeing increased cap levels, their CapEx levels, and Environmental Services as a lot of companies are very focused on going green. Reclamation, recycling is becoming a bigger part of their overall capital base, and we're going to take advantage of that because we've got a lot of expertise in that industry.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Ralph Babb, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.","Ralph W.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. Good morning and welcome to Comerica\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curt Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, Muneera Carr; Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile.","During this presentation, we will be referring to slides that -- which provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC\u2019s Web site, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, comerica.com.","This conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement in today\u2019s release on Slide 2, which I incorporate into this call as well as our SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ.","I also discuss in this call the referenced non-GAAP measures and, in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ralph, who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph Babb","Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Last month the Federal Reserve announced that bank holding companies of our size are no longer subject to supervisory stress testing, including both the Dodd-Frank Act stress tests and CCAR. Our solid financial performance and strong capital levels position us well to meaningfully increase the capital return to our shareholders.","We will continue to properly manage our capital base while supporting growth and investments in our business. Our Board will now be able to more efficiently and effectively take capital actions quarterly. Its next meeting is on July 24 and we expect to issue a press release announcing our planned capital actions at that time.","In addition, the fed recently announced that we are no longer subject to certain regulations and reporting requirements such as the liquidity coverage ratio and liquidity related reporting and disclosures. We are still in the process of evaluating the positive effects of these changes.","Our focus remains on achieving the most efficient views of our resources for the benefit of all of our constituencies including our customers and the communities we serve, while managing our business prudently.","Turning to our financial results, we reported second quarter earnings of $326 million or $1.87 per share. Our earnings per share increased 18% over the first quarter. Relative to the second quarter of last year, our earnings per share increased 65% and pre-tax income is up 39%. This is primarily due to our management of loan and deposit pricing as interest rates have moved higher, improved credit quality as well as continued successful execution of our GEAR Up initiatives.","On Slide 4, we are outlining adjustments related to certain items including restructuring, impacts from the new tax law and the tax benefit relating to employee stock transactions. The adjusted return on assets was 1.89% and adjusted return on equity was 16.7%. Please note, in the first quarter we adopted a new accounting standard for revenue recognition which match certain expenses against the related fee income. The adjusted noninterest income and expense figures for the second quarter 2017 can be found in the appendix.","Turning to Slide 5 and an overview of our second quarter results, average loans for the second quarter were up $804 million or 2% compared to the first quarter. Seasonality helped drive increases in Mortgage Banker and National Dealer Services. Technology and Life Sciences, specifically the equity fund services component grew over $300 million. Also we\u2019ve posted growth in middle market as well as several of our specialty and national businesses.","As far as deposits, average balances declined primarily due to seasonality in non-interest bearing deposits. Starting mid quarter, we began seeing a rebound in deposit balances which is consistent with trends in prior years. Net interest income increased $41 million or 7.5% and our net interest margin increased 21 basis points to 3.62%. The net benefit from increased interest rates was $21 million. With the faster rise in LIBOR, we increased deposit rates to benefit our customers. In addition, nonaccrual interest recoveries were particularly strong.","We had a broad-based decline in problem loans as well as net recoveries with charged-off loans. This led to a reduction in our allowance for loan losses and a negative provision of $29 million. Noninterest income was up $4 million with a $5 million increase in customer driven income, including commercial lending fees and customer derivative income.","Noninterest expenses were relatively stable. A seasonal decrease in salaries and benefits expense was offset by increases in outside processing and advertising. Also lower restructuring expense was offset by a business tax refund we received in the first quarter which was not repeated. We increased our capital return to shareholders. Equity repurchase increased to a $169 million or 1.8 million shares and our dividend was increased 13%.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Muneera, who will go over the quarter in more detail.","Muneera Carr","Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter average loans increased $804 million compared to the first quarter. Mortgage banker loans grew nearly $350 million with a normal pick up in spring home sales. Our portfolio continues to be heavily weighted to home purchases with approximately 87% purchased versus refi-ed compared to the industry average of 74%. We had solid growth in technology and life sciences, specifically equity fund services and general middle market increased nearly $115 million with growth in all three of our markets.","Our auto dealer [indiscernible] portfolio also increased over $100 million due to seasonal buildup in auto inventory. In addition, we saw growth across a number of our key specialty and national business lines including commercial real estate, environmental services and entertainment. Partly offsetting this growth with a decrease in private banking as a result of the few large loan payoffs.","Also, we remain selective in the large corporate base maintaining our pricing and underwriting standards in a highly competitive environment. As anticipated, the pace of decrease in energy loans have slowed, but continues due to capital markets activity and asset sales resulting from firmer commodity prices.","Total period-end loans increased $552 million with the largest contributions from mortgage banker and technology and life sciences. Also, commitments were up $1.6 billion driven by increases in nearly all business lines. Overall, the sentiment is positive, reflective of the improving economy, yet customers continue to be cautious given uncertainty regarding evolving trade discussions.","Our loan yield increased 37 basis points. Higher rates, including a 32 basis point increase in average 30 day LIBOR added 27 basis points to our yield. Nonaccrual interest recoveries which are difficult to predict increased $9 million and added 8 basis points. Finally, portfolio dynamics such as a mix shift in the portfolio and loan fees in the margin added 2 basis points.","Importantly, we are focused on a relationship strategy to appropriately manage loan pricing. As you can see on Slide 7, average deposits declined $260 million in the second quarter primarily as a result of seasonality. Municipal deposits decreased as they typically do following tax collection in the first quarter. Also, middle market was impacted by seasonality as customers utilizing their cash in their businesses. Midway through the quarter we began to see positive trends.","Average deposits in June grew $749 million over May. This included the highest growth in interest-bearing deposits for June we\u2019ve seen in many years. We expect deposit growth to continue in the back half of the year in line with the historical pattern. In conjunction with the faster rise in LIBOR, we increased deposit rates. We rely on our relationship model to stay close to our customers and help ensure we\u2019re offering competitive and appropriately priced products.","Our primary objective is to retain and attract deposits, while managing our costs. We believe we are well positioned and at the present time don\u2019t expect similar incremental standard pricing actions. Our securities book remains at about $12 billion as shown in Slide 8. The portfolios unrealized loss position of $328 million had a minor impact on the carrying value. The yield and the portfolio continues to trend up. Recent securities purchases have been in the low 340s which was above the average base of two in a quarter on the $450 million in pay downs we received in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 9, net interest income increased $41 million and net interest margin was up 21 basis points. Our loan portfolio added $59 million and 29 basis points to the margin. Increased interest rates provided the largest benefit along with higher loan balances and unusually high level of nonaccrual interest recoveries and one additional day in the quarter.","As far as our deposit at the fed, the benefit from the higher fed funds rate was mostly offset by a decrease in average balances. This resulted in a net benefit of 3 basis points to the margin. On the funding side, deposit costs were up $12 million primarily due to increased pay rates as I previously discussed. This had a 7 basis points impact. Also, wholesale funding costs increased $5 million as a result of the increase in six month LIBOR and $2 million as a result of some FHLB funding that was added in the first quarter at attractive rates.","In summary, the net impact from increased rates contributed $21 million or 11 basis points to the margin. Credit quality remains strong as shown in Slide 10. Gross charge-offs of only $20 million were more than offset by unusually high recoveries of $23 million. Total criticized loans declined $355 million or 17% and now represents 3.5% of total loans at quarter end. This included a decrease in nonaccrual loans which comprised only 51 basis points of our total loans.","Energy criticized and nonaccrual loans continued to decrease. The positive credit migration resulted in a reserve release and a reserve ratio of 1.36%. We remain vigilant and continue to look for signs of stress. At this point, we are not in any concerning credit.","Turning to Slide 11. Noninterest income grew $4 million. This included a $5 million increase in commercial loan fees, primarily related to syndications as well as customer derivative income. This was partly offset by a decline in investment banking fees. In addition, we increased the reserve for a derivative contract related to Visa Class B shares by $2 million. We remain on track to achieve our GEAR Up revenue target.","To highlight our progress, you can see the growth we have achieved on a year-over-year basis in card, fiduciary, and brokerage. Expenses remain well controlled and our efficiency ratio fell to 53% as shown on Slide 12.","Salaries and benefits decreased $5 million following annual shared based comp and higher payroll taxes in the first quarter. This was partly offset by annual merit raises, higher incentives related to our financial performance and one additional day. We continue to execute our GEAR Up initiatives, as evidenced by our total workforce reduction of 1% from the first quarter and nearly 2% over the past year.","We had increases in outside processing, which was mostly tied to revenue generating activity as well as advertising expense, which was seasonally low in the first quarter. You may recall that we had a business tax refund of $5 million in the first quarter and it was not repeated. Restructuring charges were $11 million, a decrease of $5 million from the first quarter.","In the second quarter, we repurchased $169 million or 1.8 million shares under our equity repurchase program as you can see on Slide 13. In addition, we increased our dividend 13% to $0.34 per share. Together with dividends, we returned $227 million to shareholders. Employee stock activity added about 200,000 shares during the quarter. This activity resulted in credits to our income tax provision of $3 million or $0.02 per share.","As Ralph indicated, we expect to provide an update on our planned capital actions after our Board meets next week.","Turning to Slide 14, our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to benefit from increase in rates. Our asset sensitivity is illustrated by our betas so far this cycle with a cumulative loan beta of 94% while our cumulative deposit beta is 18%. Our asset betas have outperformed our expectations, allowing us some flexibility to manage deposit costs while significantly adding to our bottom line.","We expect the net benefit from 2018 from the first quarter rate increase to be $70 million and $35 million to $40 million in additional net interest income for the second quarter rate increase. Out of our $35 million to $40 million, $6 million is already in the second quarter run rate. In total, we estimate $270 million in additional net interest income in 2018, resulting from the full-year impact of the three rate increases last year and the March and June highs this year.","For the remainder of the year, we are assuming that short-term rates remain at the current level and average deposit rates increased 8 to 10 basis points from here. We remain focused on our relationship approach to manage loan and deposit pricing to attract and retaining customers. Of course, the ultimate outcome depends on a variety of factors such as the pace at which LIBOR move, loan and deposit competition and balance sheet movement.","It is likely that the fed could be raising rates once or two more times this year and we stand to further benefit with our well positioned balance sheet. We have not added hedges to change our asset sensitivity. Our Asset Liability Committee continues to assess our position to determine the appropriate path given balance sheet movement and our outlook for rates.","Now, I will turn the call back to Ralph to provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2018.","Ralph Babb","Thank you, Muneera. As usual, our outlook assumes a continuation of the current economic and interest rate environment. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, recent regulatory developments such as elimination of CCAR and LCR are certainly positive, but it's too early to provide guidance on the effects of these changes.","As far as loans, following a seasonally strong second quarter we expect to drive moderate growth in the back half of the year. This includes increases in most businesses led by mortgage banker, primarily due to seasonality as well as Technology and Life Sciences, tempered somewhat by a seasonal decline in Dealer and a slight reduction in the pace of middle market growth due to the typical summer slowdown.","Regarding net interest income, as Muneera indicated, we expect to continue to see the net benefits of the recent rise in short-term rates. Also we expect contributions from loan growth and additional days. Recall in the second quarter we had nonaccrual interest recoveries of $11 million. This elevated level is not expected to repeat as we typically collect $1 million to $2 million per quarter. And while not included in this outlook, we are well positioned to benefit from any further rate increases.","We expect the provision to be between $10 million and $20 million per quarter as credit quality remains strong. Our fee income growth trend is expected to continue with the execution of our GEAR Up initiatives, helping drive growth in card fee, treasury management and fiduciary income. Excluding restructuring costs, expenses are expected to increase modestly from here, primarily a result of additional days in the back half of the year. We continue to be on track to fully realize our GEAR Up savings.","We expect rising technology project costs as well as typical seasonal and inflationary pressures on occupancy and advertising. Restructuring expenses for the second half of the year should be about $20 million to $25 million. We expect to continue to achieve positive operating leverage and drive our efficiency ratio lower.","Finally, we are maintaining our expectation for our effective tax rate to be approximately 23%, excluding any impact from employee stock transactions which are difficult to predict. Altogether, we expect our pre-tax pre-provision net revenue to continue to grow.","In closing, our second quarter results were solid as we\u2019ve continued to manage loan and deposit pricing in a rising rate environment. Loan growth and favorable credit metrics combined with higher fee income and well-controlled expenses helped to drive a 16% increase in our bottom line relative to the first quarter. As I mentioned at the start of the call and as a result of recently announced changes in regulation, our Board will review our capital plan next week.","We are well positioned to meaningfully increase our capital return to our shareholders. Furthermore, we expect to benefit from additional rate increases in economic growth. We remain focused on maintaining momentum and driving shareholder returns.","And now, we will be happy to take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Steven.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, good morning everybody. Ralph, I wanted to start on capital. What are your updated thoughts and how much CET1 you guys need to run the business long-term?","Ralph Babb","We really haven't put a view out there as to what our point will be at this time. That will come in the future I think as we look -- as we see how things develop.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. And as we think about this upcoming Board meeting, Ralph, could you help us think about what\u2019s on the table for this meeting? I mean, could payouts move to 150% plus where you were historically, like what range of options are you now looking at?","Ralph Babb","Well, I wouldn\u2019t put ranges on it, but I would tell you that it is -- it will be looked at from the standpoint of what is appropriate based on what we see with the business and what we feel comfortable with moving forward. And I think that puts the ability to manage capital back in our hands along with the Board. And I think you'll see that.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thank you. And then on the commercial business, if we look at general middle market, it's still pretty flat year-over-year. What are most of your middle market customers doing at this point with the benefit of lower taxes?","Ralph Babb","Curt, you want to give an update on that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, Steve, we did see growth in all three of our middle market regions and we had good momentum in the first half of the year. Having said that, as Muneera alluded to, I think middle market customers remain cautious, probably the greatest source of caution right now relates to the what may or may not have happened on the tariff side of the house. You know short-term the tax reform probably works against this a little bit in terms of loan growth, in terms of the fact that our customers have more cash less expenses to plow back into their business line. But we are not yet seeing what I would call a lot of like traditional CapEx spending occurring. Most of the borrowing that we have participated in has been either M&A type transactions or customers borrowing for traditional working capital needs.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Got you. And then just final one on deposit strategy. With the loan to deposit ratio at around 87% and you are now out of LCR, do you expect to be active trying to grow deposits or going forward do you think it's more likely you will fund loan growth from cash and securities, not necessarily need to grow the size of the balance sheet? Thanks.","Muneera Carr","This is Muneera.","Ralph Babb","Muneera, [indiscernible].","Muneera Carr","Yes, sure. I mean, our objective always is to grow both loans as well as deposits. We will be focused on that. You can see that we are doing what we need to do on the deposit cost side to be able to retain an attractive deposit.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay.","Muneera Carr","But I will also add to that, though from a security standpoint, I mean clearly that is an option that is available to us. Going forward, our securities book is a reservoir of liquidity for us, not being subject to LCR. It certainly frees up that source of funding.","Steven Alexopoulos","Yes, got you. Okay. Thanks for all the color.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning. Good morning, Ralph. Good morning, Muneera. Muneera, can you expand a little bit on your comment about deposit costs in the second half, so the 17 basis point increase regard in interest-bearing deposits to 42 basis points. You said 8 to 10 for the rest of the year, so can you tell us what that means in terms of how you're thinking about the trajectory both in the third and the fourth? I know it's one of the hot topics out there.","Muneera Carr","Good morning, Ken. So I will tell you thus far we\u2019ve done a great job of managing our deposit costs with the cumulative beta of 18%. We have been talking about the fact that Q2 was different. We saw LIBOR increasing 32 basis points in the first two quarters. We have earned a position to make some changes to our deposit cost that we believe positioned us well competitively. We don't expect to see another jump of 17 basis point something in that magnitude again. We have signaled that, generally deposit costs will continue to increase with every passing rate rise. For June, you heard my comments, I said the increase would be 8 to 10 basis points that translates to a beta of 30% to 40%. And then if you are asking me about trajectory and where things will go, for now I will refer you to our standard model which includes a 50% beta and have some fairly conservative assumptions both as for deposit runoffs. We will continue to update folks as the rate rises get closer as we can see the moment on our own balance sheet as well as what's happening in the competitive environment. What I will tell you is even with the 17 basis point increase, our total deposit costs of 42 basis points will still be one off the lowest deposit costs in our peer group. So I clearly expect that we will be able to hold on to the benefit that we are seeing from lower deposit costs so far in the cycle, which I don't expect that we will give it up, but you will see some variabilities in betas going up and down depending on what stress firing out there.","Ken Usdin","Very good. And as a follow-up to that, so you mentioned that you\u2019ve done that standardized increase and you don't expect to do one at least right now. What would change your view about having to go back to the entire rate sheet and put through a broad standardized increase again. It seems like your bias is to not do that, to your point?","Muneera Carr","Yes. So, a lot depends on what\u2019s happening in the competitive environment. It depends on what's happening with loan to deposit ratio. I would say that so far, overall, the industry continues to be well-behaved. There is still a fair amount of liquidity in the system. We see corporate treasurers having a bias to maintaining higher levels of liquidity, that's what's shows up in our own non-interest bearing deposits. And so to the extent all of that continues, I think that we won't necessarily be looking to make another broad-based price change. But having said that, you know that the fed is unwinding its balance sheet. How -- where that goes and well how that affect the system, all that remains to be seen.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then last final thing is just the 8 to 10 basis points you said is that expected to be each quarter from here, or is that your aggregate view of what happens in the second half?","Muneera Carr","That is our view specific to the June rate rise. I will tell you beyond that, I said look at the model which is at 50% and for any given singe rate drive it's -- there will be some variability. It will go up, it will go down, but like I said, I expect to close on to the benefit that we\u2019ve thus far to date.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thank you very much.","Muneera Carr","You\u2019re welcome.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","On the expense side, specifically on comp, it came in higher than what we had expected and overall expenses appeared to be have come in for the quarter higher than what you guided to. I believe you guided to down modestly off of the first quarter core base of $430 million. So what drove the somewhat higher level than you had expected for the quarter? If you could give us some specific color around comp as well? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Muneera, you want to take that?","Muneera Carr","Sure. Our view on overall expenses from the outlook that we provided earlier this year hasn\u2019t really changed. What has changed is our outlook was based on a continuation of the economic and rate environment. And as time has progressed, we received two more rate rises. We\u2019ve done a good job of managing loan and deposit pricing. The credit situation has improved. And if you look at the company's performance metrics, you can see that we are doing really well across the board. All that means that we have to look at incentive comp inside financial performance, that\u2019s one of the movers that you would see that has come through salaries and benefits expense. I mean, I pointed out workforce numbers. We continue to watch our overall expenses, but that\u2019s the main reason for the shift.","John Pancari","So there is a formal change in your incentive comp structure?","Muneera Carr","No, there isn't. The comp structure is exactly the same and it depends solely on performance and moves with good years and bad years. We are having a good year and then, hence, the increase.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then separately on the loan growth side, when you look at the update you gave us that accounted for April and May, it appears that there might have been some moderation of that pace in June. Is that what you saw and what you cited on the midmarket side, some of that cautiousness getting dialed in?","Ralph Babb","Curt you want to take that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. John, I think that\u2019s the case. When you look at sort of a go forward for us the main thing, the important thing to remember for our company, given the seasonality of Mortgage Banker Finance and Dealer, second quarter tends to be a strong quarter for us, specifically around Mortgage Banker Finance. Dealer tends to be a strong quarter in the fourth quarter. So when we\u2019re using language like moderate growth to the remainder of the year, what we\u2019re taking into consideration is that remain seasonality for the year and Mortgage Banker Finance and Dealer and probably you can see seasonality as well in the third quarter that we normally see in middle market with sort of the summer slowdown for many of our middle market clients. But we\u2019re expecting growth in most of our other businesses, and specifically I might point out continued growth in technology and life sciences, commercial real estate and a few of our other select specialty lines of business.","John Pancari","Okay, got it. All right. Thanks, Curt.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Muneera Carr","Good morning.","Ken Zerbe","Just want to, I guess, start off just in terms of the asset beta, I was hoping you can kind of go over that a little bit more. I think I calculated your total asset beta like a 120% of fed funds. I know you\u2019re tied off of LIBOR, which went up more than fed funds in the core, but can you just talk about like the timing of resets, like was there something besides LIBOR that drove a higher in terms of how the loans reset? Just would love to get more detail? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Muneera?","Muneera Carr","Good morning, Ken. I know that asset beta have been really well, 37 basis points up this quarter. You saw the effect of nonaccrual interest recoveries which were unabated. But really this is us pulling through and having normal resets that we typically do, I would expect that as LIBOR increases our actual flow through rate is about 80% to 85%. So as LIBOR goes up, on average, 20 basis points we see an improvement of either about 16, 17 basis points in our yield. That should be what you should expect going forward on the asset side.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Okay. So this quarter is just particularly unusual. Okay. And then, I guess -- go ahead.","Muneera Carr","No, the only thing I was going to point out, I mean, LIBOR did go up 32 basis points on average.","Ken Zerbe","Yes.","Muneera Carr","So and they\u2019re just pulling through the benefits of that.","Ken Zerbe","Understood. And I guess just to be super clear on the margin for third quarter, if we use just I know it's a generic example if LIBOR goes up 20 basis points, whatever, but am I thinking about right that your loan yields will go up, say, 16, 17 basis points in your example and then you\u2019re also saying deposit costs, the interest bearing deposit costs go up, I think it was 8 to 10 basis points. So, I mean, we can run the math on non-interest bearing etcetera, but that\u2019s the kind of magnitude of NIM expansion we should be looking up for third quarter. Am I thinking that conceptually correct?","Muneera Carr","You\u2019re thinking about it conceptually correct. I just used 20 as an example. I don\u2019t know where average LIBOR is going to go, so I would say adjust accordingly.","Ken Zerbe","Understood. Okay. Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","So as we\u2019re thinking about some of the flexibility afforded to you by some of the regulatory change, how much do you have in HQLA currently today? And how much of that HQLA pool can we think as flexible to potentially fund loan growth?","Muneera Carr","It's a meaningful number just in broad strokes. But clearly we have ample of funding available today. So it's not something -- this is with something we can tap as the balance sheet changes.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Okay. Just following up one last follow-up question at least for me on all the deposit questions that you\u2019ve answered so far and thank you so much for your answers. As we think about the dynamics just following up to Ken's last question, as we think of the interest rate environment continuing to normalize and of course you mentioned Muneera the fed reducing its balance sheet what -- how should we think about a normal level of noninterest bearing deposits for Comerica? And outside of the seasonality that you saw with municipal deposits this quarter, what are you observing broadly about mix shift trends?","Muneera Carr","A couple of points on that. When we look at the changes in our portfolio, you\u2019re right, year-over-year municipal deposits have been a headwind for us. But beyond that, when we look at our customer balances, when we look at Comerica's historical trends, the portfolio is behaving in line with what we\u2019ve seen in times past. So it's very typical for Comerica to have a decline in deposits in the first half of the year. It's very typical for us to go up in the back half of the year as this trend holds true for several years in the past. And so that\u2019s what we based our view on as to where things are going for us at least in the near-term. We do see some of our customers putting their money to work. It's what we said, we would be seeing people are reducing leverage, they\u2019re using their money for M&A, for working capital needs. And so that certainly continues. Beyond that, we will just have to wait and see how things evolve and it's really difficult for us to predict what happens with deposit balances.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just one final question for me. Just comparing the guidance slide in terms of your outlook for noninterest expenses, and just looking at what you had put forth last quarter, last quarter you mentioned that you\u2019re expecting a 1% increase over an adjusted 2017 number, which I think at the time implied a 1.713 billion base for '18. And I just wanted to clarify that the different language that you put on this quarter slide did not indicate a change in expense guidance.","Ralph Babb","Muneera?","Muneera Carr","We are indicating that expenses will be slightly higher than what we originally estimated, because our original estimates were based on a continuation of the interest rate and economic environment. And of course, as things have improved, it means that certain costs like incentive comp has to be adjusted. And when we go get interest recoveries of $11 million, there is compensation that goes along with that and so that\u2019s what it reflects. Also I wanted to point out that our FDIC expense we were hoping that the surcharge would go away in the back half and clearly there has been some [indiscernible] that this isn't quite reaching the percentage it needs to, and so that\u2019s another reason for us to make a slight change.","Erika Najarian","Got it. But at the end of the day, the efficiency will continue to up improve meaningfully, okay.","Muneera Carr","Yes.","Erika Najarian","Thank you so much.","Muneera Carr","Yes, thank you for reminding me. Yes, the efficiency will increase, we expect fully to have positive operating leverage.","Erika Najarian","Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. I had a follow-up question on capital specifically the pace of capital return. So under CCAR there had been this view that you had to take payouts up gradually over time through the process in light of the regulatory changes that we\u2019ve seen. Do you now feel like you guys have greater freedom to simply keep what you need and return the rest? And then implicit in that question is, can you just clarify for us the degree to which you feel bound by the submission that you made that ultimately you guys didn\u2019t have to go through the process, but nevertheless you made the submission. If you could give a little bit of color around that, that would be great?","Ralph Babb","Well as we discussed the earlier when you look at what we will be doing basically on a quarterly basis, we will be reviewing where we are from a capital standpoint and where we believe we need to be and what effects -- or the normal effects out there as to growth in the economy and so forth. And we then have the ability to manage our capital. Going forward, we haven't put out as was asked earlier a point of where we want to be from a capital standpoint. We may do that in the future, but I think we want to move down the road a while first and our CET right now is well over 11%. And I think we all understand that it is pretty high.","Bill Carcache","Right. And so in essence, there is a recognition that you are -- that the rules have changed and that in evaluating on a quarterly basis your capital levels, you are able to take that into consideration and, therefore, arrive potentially at a different outcome and you would have arrived at under the previous rules?","Ralph Babb","We could be more focused on what is happening today versus having to look out and consider what's happening over a year purposes or more. And that makes us much more agile in managing our capital going forward.","Bill Carcache","That's great. Thank you. If I may follow-up on a related M&A question. Now that you have been released from CCAR, some investors have expressed concern with the potential that some of your excess capital could be consumed in an M&A deal that could significantly dilute tangible book value similar to some of the recent deals that we have seen from others. Could you speak a little bit to your appetite for M&A whether that has or has not changed after your release from CCAR?","Ralph Babb","I would say it has not changed. And as we have always said when things became available we will take a look at them, but we feel very comfortable with our footprint today, and especially in the states where we are doing business and the growth potential there and adding internally to grow that is top of the chart at the moment where our focus is for expansion.","Bill Carcache","Thank you very much. I appreciate you taking my questions.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Good morning. Hey, Ralph, quick question just on sort of behavioral changes post-DFAST and CCAR, not as it relates to what you will do with the excess capital, but just practically what being released from this stuff means for how you will go through sort of measuring your own levels of risk etcetera, any -- under CCAR for example you spend a year and you have a dozen -- or excuse me, dozens of people getting to the same place that you can get with a few assumptions and much more rapidly. So presumably there is some opportunity to flex expenses. And even if you don\u2019t want to get into the savings, just what will you be doing differently internally now that you\u2019ve got some of this flexibility or relief?","Ralph Babb","As I had mentioned in the remarks earlier what we will be doing now is going through and looking at all the things that we\u2019ve done and put together for the previous process. And what in some of those are strengths going forward and deciding exactly what we want to do going forward and there will be some savings there as well. But it will be building the process we are going to use going forward I guess is the right way to say that. But we will save expenses.","Muneera Carr","I was going to highlight the same thing. I was going to say it's going to be a lot more efficient.","Scott Siefers","Yes. Okay. And, I guess, that\u2019s probably an iterative process, but it's not something you've come to definitive conclusions on now right? You are just sort of seeing [multiple speakers] \u2026","Ralph Babb","That\u2019s right.","Scott Siefers","\u2026 appropriate is continue to spend money versus get some savings out etcetera? That\u2019s the best way to look at it?","Ralph Babb","That's the best way to look at it, but we want to go through it fairly quickly and make a determination of where we feel we are and where do we need to be today. And we will be doing that, it will take a little while to do it, but \u2026","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right. That sounds good. Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Geoffrey Elliot with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Geoffrey Elliot","Good morning. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. In terms of capital and the split between dividend and buyback, does the regulatory change shift the way your thinking about the emphasis there?","Ralph Babb","I don't think the change causes an issue there. We will be looking at that based on what day we foresee in the future and taking the appropriate position obviously, because we know there are ups and downs in the economy that we have to be prepared for. And I think we have done that in the past very well and that will be something we'll look at as we go.","Geoffrey Elliot","And can you explain the role of the regulators now? Are there still sort of certain guardrails, if you like, in terms of what you can and can't do on capital return from a regulatory perspective, what do you need to get approval to do from the regulator and where do you just kind of have flexibility to have the Board meeting and go ahead and take your own decisions?","Ralph Babb","I think there are things that are still developing there. So I really don't have a feel for exactly how it may settle in the future. But I would say that even before CCAR and all of the tests, we routinely reviewed what our thoughts where and our planning was for the future with our local regulators to make sure that they were comfortable with it as much as we are.","Geoffrey Elliot","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Rabatin","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask first, Ralph, is there any explicit reason why you can't be a little less opaque about the capital return process and you're obviously being able to manage capital more in a real-time basis? I guess I just want to make sure there was not something I'm missing about why you can't be a little more effusive about what you plan?","Ralph Babb","Well, I think the reason for that is that it just happened and we are getting used to it. And I think the regulatory environment is looking at it as well and it takes a little bit of time for that to develop.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. Fair enough. And then I wanted to ask on the deposit side in terms of what you're expecting on deposit betas from here, what kind of assumptions does that entail from just a seasonality perspective and municipal deposits and kind of what happens from here with some of the various categories in terms of growth, especially on a core basis?","Ralph Babb","Muneera, do you want to take that?","Muneera Carr","Yes. So as I mentioned earlier, I do expect that there will be variability in there. Deposit betas go from one rate rise to the next, but overall I would say, for now, our standard model with the 50% beta is the best thing I can point you to, a lot remains to be same on how balance sheet evolves. I think the industry as a whole has a fair amount of liquidity and lot of deposit ratios are healthy. So at least in the near-term the best I can tell, I would expect that this kind of model assumption should hold true.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. And then just lastly, the credits obviously really good. Right now just from a recovery perspective is there a pool of loans whether from energy or otherwise that could still result in net charge-offs being negative going forward or can you give us any color around maybe that pool?","Ralph Babb","Pete, you want to take that?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes. It is [indiscernible] we\u2019ve been in a net recovery position like this and it didn\u2019t happen very often. We didn\u2019t expect going forward to see those kinds of recovers.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for all the color.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Peter.","Peter Winter","Good morning. Good morning. When you guys talk about modest loan growth in the second half, can you just define modest loan growth? And then, secondly, it sounded like customers are more cautious than they were in the first quarter. Is that solely just related to the trade wars or is there something else going on?","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to take that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, I might start, Peter, with the second half of your question. I don\u2019t think there is anything else going on. I do think that tariffs and trade related issues especially given the markets that we are in, Michigan, California, Texas, all who have some economic reliance on trade and some of the industry verticals that we operate in kind of given that I would say that is probably the primary concern that we are hearing from customers right now. So that's I think -- that should be in to somewhat of our moderate view on a go forward basis. But I do want to emphasize that part of that moderate view as well is just a seasonality that we see especially in the third quarter and middle market and that seasonality in both Dealer and Mortgage Banker Finance.","Peter Winter","And when you say modest, is that more like 1% to 3% type range?","Curtis Farmer","I wouldn\u2019t quote a specific number, but just would guide you towards the language that we\u2019ve used.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then just separately now that you are no longer a SIFI bank, is there some type of informal stress test exams that you have to participate in?","Ralph Babb","No. But there will be, and it was said in some of the announcements that there will be a development of how we looked at over a longer term. So I think they will be adjusting what they\u2019re looking at and how they\u2019re looking at as well as we going through the process for us too. ","Peter Winter","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Jennifer Demba","Thank you. My question is for Pete. Just wondering how the problem loan levels stand in the energy portfolio now when that portfolio should stabilize or grow?","Ralph Babb","Pete?","Pete Guilfoile","We like to see it keep from running off. It's been coming down quicker than we\u2019ve been adding new deals. We like the energy space. We are highly selective there, but we like a lot. We still have 19% criticized. We would expect that 19% would continue to come down not just through payoffs, which will reduce loan balances, there are also upgrades as well. And so we\u2019re hopeful that the energy portfolio will stabilize on the balance standpoint from where it is today.","Jennifer Demba","Thanks a lot.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Moss","Good morning. I just wanted to start off, I guess, just with -- on the credit topic and more actually CECL, just wondering what your preliminary thought could be with regard to the provision and the capital impact come 2020?","Ralph Babb","Pete?","Pete Guilfoile","We are not prepared to release anything with regards to CECL yet. We are working towards a 2020 date when we will be implementing. The only thing that I\u2019m comfortable saying is that you look at our portfolio relative to our peers, the duration of our portfolio, which is a big driver of CECL is substantially less than a lot of our peers. And so we would expect whatever it impacts there are -- from a level standpoint and then from a quarterly provision standpoint should impact us less because of that shorter duration.","Steve Moss","Okay. And then, on deposits here, your noninterest-bearing deposit mix remains really strong here, over 50%. Just wondering -- the balances are down a bit year-over-year, just wondering where do you think that goes if we see another 50 to 100 basis points in rate hikes?","Muneera Carr","So when you look at our deposit base and you mentioned noninterest bearing, 90% of that is commercial. And in the past we have mentioned that of those commercial deposits vast majority of them are tied to our treasury management products. We have a lot of connectivity that these depositors. And as I mentioned earlier in my comment, that is a desire by corporate treasurers to maintain higher levels of liquidity. So all that plays in. For all those reasons, at least as far as they're concerned, we expect things to be stable when we go along with CECL, relationship propositions, deposits come along with that. So all of that kind of goes into our thinking about the fact that generally things should be fairly stable.","Steve Moss","All right. Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Dave.","David Rochester","Hey, good morning, guys. On expenses, I know 2019 is still a bit further out, but I was just curious how you're thinking about expense growth next year is to GEAR Up efforts wind down. Why you should still get the benefit of the roll off of the FDIC surcharge that you were talking about. Any preliminary thoughts there?","Ralph Babb","Muneera?","Muneera Carr","Okay. Looking forward, I\u2019m going to say you\u2019re right, FDIC surcharge will go away. We intend to continue the expense discipline that we have used in the last couple of years. We intend to continue leveraging technology to simplify our processes and be efficient. There will be your typical inflationary pressures, but overall, I mean that\u2019s sort of what I see looking out.","David Rochester","Are you thinking that the -- oh sorry, go ahead.","Muneera Carr","No, I was going to add I do respect that the efficiency ratio will keep moving in the right directions and that will maintain positive operating leverage.","David Rochester","Are you thinking that we could perhaps see a little bit of a pickup in expense growth because of the efforts you are talking about, the fact that the tailwinds from GEAR Up are done or do you think you can remain in this low single-digit range of growth?","Muneera Carr","I believe we will remain in the low single-digit level of that.","David Rochester","Okay, great. And just switching to the NIM real quick. In the absence of rate hikes, so if we don\u2019t get a rate hike in September for example, I was just curious what your thoughts are on how the NIM would trend without the benefit of the bump up in the loan yield? Are you thinking we could see some stability in that kind of scenario or do you expect to see some kind of an upwards movement in deposit cost kind of leading into the NIM a little bit? Just any thoughts there would be great.","Muneera Carr","Yes, I mean, given our asset sensitivity, clearly NIM benefits most to the drive rates, but I would still expect that without rate, we'd have stability in our NIM. I don\u2019t expect that deposit costs will rise in a more stable rate environment.","David Rochester","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Brocker Vandervliet","Great. Good morning. I think most of the metrics on deposit costs have been covered. I was just curious operationally when a look to make the increase that was manifest in the second quarter, was that -- how is that kind of pushed down to clients? Was that broad brush across the board increases or more of a pull through in granting exceptions that kind of thing?","Ralph Babb","Curt, you want to take that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. Brock, I think first and foremost for us whether it's loan pricing or pricing on any of our fee income products where deposit pricing is to make sure that we are taking relationship approach. And so we really think that in a consideration we are looking at both competitive landscape and also our customer relationships. And so when we look at pricing increases, we really try to make sure we\u2019re passing that on to the majority of our clients as appropriate and I think we\u2019ve done that effectively thus far.","Brocker Vandervliet","Okay. And separately within equity fund services, I know that's been called out several times as an area of strength. Could you quantify that at all in terms of the annualized growth we should expect there? And secondly, has there been any change in resource allocation to that area?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curtis Farmer","First of all, I would say that it has been an area of accelerating growth in the last several years and that\u2019s really in response to what\u2019s been happening in the private equity venture capital arena there has been a lot of new fund formation. There has been a lot of both corporate or institutional and private money flowing into private equity, for example, which has created a lot of the demand there. In terms of resource allocation we look across all of our businesses to make sure that we are appropriately resourced allocated and we can shift resources as needed and move relationship managers and credit support staff, analysts, etcetera, to various business lines. Part of what we\u2019ve been doing through GEAR Up, we talked before about the Indian credit initiative which really for us is rethinking some of our processes around loan origination approval servicing going forward and that is creating through and changing some processes, additional capacity for us and Equity Fund Services would be one of the businesses that\u2019s benefiting from that.","Brocker Vandervliet","Great. Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe Bruyette Woods. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Klock","Good morning, everybody. So I just want to follow-up and I apologize if you guys answered this already, but maybe it's a question for Pete on the interest recoveries. Can you give us a size of the loans that paid off with the net interest recovery?","Ralph Babb","Pete?","Pete Guilfoile","Most of the unusually large interest recovery is driven by, I want to say two or three credits. They were good sized credits. It wasn\u2019t so much the size of the credit, though. It was how well we were accumulating the interest and not [indiscernible] through the P&L. And so, some of these were [indiscernible] not accruals for some time and that\u2019s why recovery was still large.","Brian Klock","Got you. So, I guess, what I\u2019m trying to figure out is, when you look at the criticized, that dropped so meaningfully in the nonaccrual, that dropped, so should we look at that drop and say that your core growth outside of those sort of paydowns -- you had some solid growth this quarter, I could be wrong, but just thinking about it spot quarter-to-quarter, end of period basis, it's a lot stronger core loan growth than the 4.5% linked quarter annualized growth that you just look at there from spot, so \u2026","Pete Guilfoile","Yes. That\u2019s correct. I mean, that did impact our loan growth is the fact that we were successful in getting paid off on some nonaccrual loans this quarter.","Brian Klock","Got it. Got it. And just a follow-up for Muneera. I think you mentioned something about the FDIC surcharge, when you talked about the expense going through the second half of the year. It looks like the diff is about 1.30 and it still looks like it's on its way to getting to the 1.35 by the second half of the year. So are you including any expectation of getting that $6 million to $7 million surcharge eliminated in the fourth quarter or that\u2019s not in your guidance at all you had for the second half of the year.","Muneera Carr","It's not in our guidance.","Brian Klock","Got it. Okay. All right. Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Ralph Babb, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any closing remarks.","Ralph Babb","We appreciate very much your interest in Comerica, and thanks for being on the call today. And we hope everybody has a great day. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect."],"6153":["Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) Q4 2013 Earnings Call January 17, 2014  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Darlene Persons - Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations","Ralph Babb - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer","Karen Parkhill - Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer","Lars Anderson - Vice Chairman of The Business Bank","John Killian - Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President","Analysts","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Keith Murray - ISI","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Rahul Patil - Evercore Partners","Brett Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach","Operator","Good morning. My name is Cony and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Cony. Good morning and welcome to Comerica's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Vice Chairman of the Business Bank, Lars Anderson; and Chief Credit Officer, John Killian. A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC's website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. As we review our fourth quarter results, we will be referring to the slides which provide additional detail on our earnings.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements, and in that regard you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause future results to vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement contained in this release issued today, as well as Slide 2 of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our filings with the SEC.","Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures and in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph Babb","Good morning. Today we reported fourth quarter 2013 net income of $145 million or $0.77 per share, compared to $147 million or $0.78 per share in the third quarter and $130 million or $0.68 per share in the fourth quarter of 2012. Full year 2013 earnings per share were up 12% for 2012 to $3.","Turning to Slide 4 and highlights for fiscal year 2013. 2013 net income increased 9% primarily as a result of tight expense control and strong credit quality, offsetting the headwinds of the continuing low rate environment. Our relationship banking focus and our customers' strength in this uncertain national economy continued to drive growth in average loans and deposits in 2013. Average total loans increased $1.1 billion or 3% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily reflecting an increase of $1.7 billion or 7% in commercial loans with National Dealer Services and general middle market providing the biggest contribution.","Average total deposits increased $2.2 billion or 4% in 2013 with increases in all three of our major markets. Our capital position remains solid, supports our growth and provides us the ability to return excess capital to our shareholders. We repurchased 7.4 million shares in 2013 under our share repurchase program. Together with dividends we returned 73% of 2013 net income to shareholders. We recently filed our 2014-2015 capital plan with the Federal Reserve, which is expected to release its summary results in March.","Turning to Slide 5 and highlights from our fourth quarter results. When compared to the third quarter of 2013, average loans remain stable at $44.1 billion as increases in National Dealer Services and technology and life sciences were offset by a decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance. Growth trends were positive throughout the quarter, resulting in period-end total loans increasing $1.3 billion to $45.5 billion. This reflected increases across most lines of business.","Total loan commitments are at their highest levels in four years increasing $716 million from the end of the third quarter, with commitments up in nearly all business lines. Line utilization also increased to 46.9%. In addition, our loan pipeline remains strong. Average deposits increased $904 million or 2% to $52.8 billion compared to the third quarter of 2013, reflecting increases in most lines of business and all primary markets. Fourth quarter net interest income increased $18 million or 4% to $430 million primarily as a result of a $15 million increase in accretion on purchased credit-impaired loans which was greater than expected.","Credit quality continued to be strong with the provision for credit losses and net charge-offs remaining at low levels. Non-interest income decreased $10 million to $204 million reflecting decreases of $5 million in customer driven fee income and $5 million in non-customer driven fee income. Non-interest expenses increased to $429 million. Excluding an increase of $6 million in deferred compensation, other expenses increased to $6 million primarily due to a $5 million increase in litigation related expenses from a low third quarter amount.","Turning to Slide 6. Recent national economic data supports a cautiously optimistic view of 2014. Home prices continued to increase with home builders picking up the pace late last year. Consumer confidence is climbing and auto sales are solid. Job growth has been reasonable although the unemployment rate remains high for this point in the cycle. We expect business confidence to gradually improve this year as uncertainty diminishes.","Taking a closer look at economic conditions within our primary footprint of Texas, California and Michigan, we can see the advantages of our geographic diversity. North Texas is positioned for ongoing growth in 2014 as labor markets continue to show strong expansion. Energy continues to be a strong pillar of the North Texas economy and healthcare related construction is booming, contributing to strong organic growth. The shale boom and subsequent reemergence of the U.S. as a global leader in petroleum production has placed Houston at the center of a rapidly changing global energy market.","Economic growth is expected to be strong in 2014 as the Houston metro area unemployment rate remains well below the U.S. average. Period-end loans and deposits in Texas in 2013 were up 1% and 10% respectively from 2012. The Northern California economy is expected to show moderate growth in 2014, supported by it high-tech sector and improving real estate markets. The outlook for Northern California consumer spending is solid for next year. The positive wealth effect from increased home-owners equity and steady income growth should be a boost to retail sales in the region heading into 2014.","While Southern California labor markets continued to underperform the national average in 2013, the region is making headway in recovering from the recession. After a three quarter contraction beginning in the first quarter of 2012, the labor force has consistently expanded for the past four quarters ending in the third quarter of 2013. In 2013, California period-end loans were up 7%, while deposits were down 4%. The decline in deposits was primarily in our business that serves title and escrow companies.","Within Michigan, where we have had a presence for 164 years, the Detroit area is still expanding but at a slower rate. The Detroit metro area is still adding jobs but job growth is underperforming the U.S. average. The auto industry has regained its footing, providing a boost to the Detroit regional and national economies. And auto related and furniture manufacturing industries are the mainstays of the Central West Michigan economy as that regional economy continues to improve. In 2013, Michigan period-end loans were down 1% as commercial mortgages continued to amortize while deposits were up 2%.","In closing, our strategy remains unchanged and we continue to stay the course, focused on growing the bottom line in this low rate environment. Our conservative approach to banking continues to serve us well, including our credit management, investment strategy, and capital position. We are pleased with our footprint where there are many opportunities to leverage our relationship banking strategy by providing our customers with the products and services they deserve.","And now I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 7 and loan growth. We saw the typical seasonal broad-based improvement in loan demand throughout the fourth quarter with period-end loans greater than average in almost every business line. Total average loans quarter-over-quarter were stable. However on a period end basis, loans increased to $1.3 billion or 3% to $45.5 billion. Commercial loans increased $918 million and construction loans increased $210 million.","Our period-end loan growth significantly outpaced the industry which grew 1.3% based on the Fed's H8 data for U.S. large commercial banks from October 2nd to January 1st. Also as Ralph mentioned, our loan commitments increased in nearly all business lines. Line utilization increased to 46.9% from 45.6% at the end of the third quarter. National Dealer Services was the biggest driver of the increase in utilization. Importantly, our loan pipeline remains strong.","In the broad category of commercial real estate loans, average construction loans grew for the fifth consecutive quarter and commitments to developers continued to increase. Also, while down on average, commercial mortgages were stable on a period-end basis. Real estate construction projects appear to be moving less quickly to the permanent long-term financing market. However, owner occupied real estate which makes up about 80% of our commercial mortgages, continued to decline with normal amortization.","Finally, loan yields, shown in the yellow diamonds, increased 14 basis points in the quarter with higher accretion accounting for about 14 basis points and an increase on interest collected on non-accrual loans accounting for about 4 basis points.","We have provided additional data on loan trends in the quarter on Slide 8. As I mentioned a moment ago, loan trends were positive throughout the quarter with almost all of our business lines growing. The largest contributors to the period-end loan growth are listed on the slide. Two businesses which have had some variability this year are depicted in the charts. In the upper chart, National Dealer Services, which includes our auto floor plan loans, had average loans rebound $353 million in the fourth quarter, after decreasing $223 million in the third quarter.","Loan outstandings generally follow inventory supply on dealers' lots, which increased in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonal change over to new 2014 models. Shown in the bottom chart, mortgage banker finance, which provides mortgage warehouse lines, saw average loans decrease $496 million in the fourth quarter. Period-end balances declined $147 million to $1.4 billion. This was expected given the industry-wide decline in mortgage volumes, which is shown in the yellow line on the chart.","Turning to deposits on Slide 9. Our total average deposits increased $904 million or 2% to $52.8 billion, reflecting increases in most lines of business. Non-interest bearing deposits grew $1.2 billion while interest bearing deposits declined $249 million. As shown by the yellow diamonds on the slide, deposit pricing declined to 17 basis points due to higher rate CDs maturing and selective deposit rate adjustment. Period-end deposits increased $383 million, primarily reflecting an increase of $404 million in interest-bearing deposits.","Slide 10 provides details on our securities portfolio, which primarily consists of highly liquid, highly rated mortgage-backed securities. The NBS portfolio was stable with the third quarter averaging $9 billion. The fair value of the portfolio decreased $73 million pretax in the fourth quarter, resulting in a net unrealized loss position for the portfolio of $97 million. The estimated duration of our portfolio remains steady at 4.2 years at the end of the fourth quarter. Slower prepayment speeds including a retrospective adjustment to the premium amortization similar to the third quarter, added $1 million or 5 basis points to the yield. The expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock, remained relatively constant at about 4.8 years as a result of the composition of our portfolio.","Based on current rate expectations, we believe that the pace of prepays will be about $300 million to $400 million in the first quarter, similar to the fourth quarter and down from almost $600 million in the third quarter. In light of the fact that Fannie and Freddie backed securities are subject to haircut and a cap under the recently proposed liquidity coverage ratio, we have started to invest in Ginnie Mae securities. We are selectively seeking similar duration premium and yield dimensions to what we have in our current portfolio. We will continue to manage our portfolio dynamically, taking into account many factors including our loan and deposit expectations as well as the overall yields and duration available.","Turning to Slide 11. Fourth quarter net interest income increased $18 million or 4%. We have summarized in the table on the right the major moving pieces of our net interest income and net interest margin. The biggest driver was better than expected performance of the acquired Sterling portfolio which resulted in a $15 million increase in accretion to $23 million in the fourth quarter. The remaining accretion on the portfolio is about $35 million and we expect to realize this accretion at a declining pace over the next few years. Accordingly, for 2014 we expect to recognize accretion of about $10 million to $20 million.","Also impacting loan interest income, we had a $5 million increase in interest collected on non-accrual loans. Partially offsetting this was a $4 million decline from lower loan yields resulting from the continued mix shift in our portfolio, as well as a drop in 30-day LIBOR which decreased 2 basis points on average to 17 basis points in the quarter. You may recall that approximately 85% of our loans are floating rates, of which 75% are LIBOR based, predominantly 30-day LIBOR. And while we remain focused on holding spreads for new and renewed credit facilities, there are still mix shift dynamics impacting the loan portfolio. This quarter, the mix shift was primarily due to an increase in lower-yielding loans like auto-dealer floor plans and continued positive credit migration.","As I mentioned on the previous slide, dynamics in the securities portfolio provided a positive benefit increasing net interest income by $1 million or 1 basis point on the margin, primarily as a result of an improvement in yields due to slowing prepayment speed. Lower funding costs, specifically lower deposit costs, added $1 million and provided 1 basis point increase to the margin.","Finally, we had $1.1 billion increase in excess liquidity which had a 5 basis point negative impact on the margin. As you have heard before, we believe we remain well positioned for a rise in short-term rates. Based on our historical experience and asset liability model, we believe a 200-basis point increase in rates over a 1-year period, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result in about a 13% increase in net interest income or approximately $210 million.","Turning to the credit picture on Slide 12. Credit quality continued to be strong in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs decreased to $13 million or 12 basis points of average loans and included $28 million in recoveries. The chart on the upper right shows our criticized loans which are consistent with regulatory defined special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss classifications and are similar to what we formerly referred to as watch list loans. These loans declined $201 million and our non-performing loans declined $85 million. With a decline in nonperforming loans, the allowance to NPLs increased to 160%. And as you can see on the lower left chart, our $598 million allowance for loan losses covers our trailing 12-month net charge-offs over 8 times. As a result of the continued positive trends in our credit metrics and growth in our loan commitments, our provision for credit losses was relatively stable at $9 million, resulting in a small reserve release.","Slide 13 outlines non-interest income which was driven by a $5 million decrease in customer driven fees and a $5 million decrease in non-customer related income. As far as customer driven fees, following a strong third quarter, the fourth quarter was impacted by slower economic activity and two fewer business days. Therefore, we had small declines in several categories such as letters of credit, card fees, customer derivative fees and investment banking. The decrease in these items was partially offset by an increase in fiduciary income as we continued to expand this business.","The decrease in noncustomer-driven income was primarily due to several items which were unusually high in the third quarter, such as warrant income, bank owned life insurance and incentives received from our third party credit card processor. For example, in the third quarter we recognized $6 million in warrant income from the exercise of warrants related to some technology and life sciences relationships which was not repeated in the fourth quarter. Finally, noncustomer driven income was impacted by $6 million increase in deferred compensation plan asset returns, which was completely offset in deferred compensation expense.","Turning to Slide 14. We continue to focus on tight expense control. As you can see, full year expenses declined 4%, including a $35 million reduction in restructuring expenses which accounted for about half of the decline. Our fourth quarter expenses were impacted by a $6 million increase in deferred compensation, which is directly offset in non-interest income. Excluding that, our expenses increased $6 million in the quarter, which includes a $3 million increase in staff insurance expense from a low third quarter level and a $5 million increase in litigation related expenses following a legal reserve release in the third quarter due to the favorable preliminary settlement of a Class action case. Also incentive compensation did not decline from the elevated third quarter level based on more favorable performance relative to peers.","Moving to Slide 15 and shareholder payout. We repurchased 1.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and 7.4 million shares in the full year under our share repurchase program. Combined with the dividends paid, we returned 73% of net income to our shareholders in 2013. We believe our shareholder payout is a reflection of our strong capital position with a tangible common equity ratio of 10.1% and an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio of 10.3% at December 31 on a fully phased-in basis, excluding the impact of AOCI.","The tangible common equity ratio increased 24 basis points in the fourth quarter, reflecting an increase in AOCI due to favorable pension plan adjustments, partially offset by the decline in the fair value of the securities book. As a reminder, adjustments to the pension plan are made annually while the securities book is marked each quarter. As Ralph mentioned, we submitted our capital plan and stress test to our regulators earlier this month. We expect the Federal Reserve will release its summary results in March.","Finally, turning to Slide 16 and our outlook for the full-year 2014 compared to 2013. We expect our overall loan growth to continue at a pace similar to 2013. We plan to remain focused on small business and middle market, particularly where we benefit from our industry expertise such as in technology and life science. Positive trends in commercial real estate construction are expected to improve while owner occupied real estate should continue to be impacted by amortization.","As you know, our mortgage banker business can be volatile and does have some typical seasonality aligned with home sales. So there could be quarterly variability, though we expect mortgage banker average balances for the full year to stabilize close the level we had in the fourth quarter. In addition, the current slow economic environment does weigh [ph] on demand and competition for loans across our businesses. And we intend to maintain our pricing and structure discipline. We expect net interest income to be modestly lower year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued reduction in accretion, which totaled $49 million in 2013 and is expected to decline to $10 million to $20 million in 2014.","In addition, we expect loan yields will continue to be impacted by the low rate environment but should be partly offset by loan growth as well as our low cost funding base. With respect to credit, we expect our total provision expense will be similar to 2013, reflecting loan growth offset by a continued decline in problem loans. We expect net charge-offs and reserve release to remain low. We expect non-interest income to be stable with customer-driven fees increasing modestly from continued growth in fiduciary and card fees and our focus on cross-sell opportunities.","We expect non-interest expenses to be lower. Pension expense should be less than half of the $86 million incurred in 2013, primarily as a result of the timing of the improvement in market performance and increase in long-term rates. And increases in merit, healthcare and regulatory compliance expenses should be mostly offset by our continued tight expense control. Remember that our incentive compensation is typically higher in the first quarter when grants are made. And in 2014, as a result of anticipated plan changes, we expect to incur even more of the expense in the first quarter while the full-year expense is expected to remain about the same. Finally, we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 28% of pretax income.","In closing, we are pleased with our continued loan and deposit growth. Despite the recurrent economic and low interest rate headwinds, we will remain focused on the things we can control. Deepening and growing customer relationship while carefully managing expenses. We look forward to the year ahead and we remain keenly focused on delivering growth in both pre-provision net revenue and the bottom line.","Now we are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello with UBS.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Just a couple of quick ones for you. Just as I look at the loan growth guidance and try to reconcile that with your strong and building pipelines, and a lot of the opportunities you have within your various markets. Just kind of, it seems a little bit conservative and I was just wondering if we do have a bit of a stronger economy next year what might the sensitivity around that loan growth potential be?","Ralph Babb","Lars?","Lars Anderson","Absolutely. Yeah. One thing I ought to remind you is that the fourth quarter period-ending balances do tend to, Steve, be elevated as we see extraordinary activity levels at that point. But I think Karen has given a good outlook for the year where we see consistent loan growth throughout 2014. I think we are very well positioned. Our mortgage banking finance business we expected, as she noted, to be relatively stable. I would note that we are positively gap [ph] to recovering single-family residential market in the country. 70% of our volumes in mortgage banking finance are purchase versus the industry average of 47%. Dealer, looks like is going to be strengthening but as you know that has variation. But we did see, fortunately of the $1.3 billion, over $600 million of that was really spread across nearly all of our businesses.","I think the general business activity and the climate next year is really going to dictate a lot of what we see in terms of the actual outcome in growth, in the loan growth portfolio.","Karen Parkhill","And I would just add Steve that this outlook was, again, against the backdrop of what we expect to be a continuing slow economy, low rate environment and very competitive environment.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Got you. No, that makes sense. Just seems like you're building up a lot of great momentum and it seems like get a little bit more help from the economy and that could be even better. And so just on that topic still, as you look forward where do you see the best kind of risk-reward to grow loans as you look ahead?","Ralph Babb","Lars?","Lars Anderson","Yeah. So we are going to be very focused on our small business and middle market businesses. We see nice returns in those businesses. We have seen a pickup in traction in small business. We are actually seeing some growth in the last couple of quarters in small business where we get good returns, nice, deep relationships. Across our middle market businesses, whether it's technology and life sciences or energy business, if we begin to see a pickup in CapEx there in that industry, it represents a nice opportunity. As well as environmental services, entertainment, there is a number of others including general middle market. General middle market will be clearly impacted significantly, I think, by business activity levels. We are -- if you look at utilization rates in general middle market, a climb there as there as their balance sheets hopefully grow with a strengthening economy. Could certainly put upward pressure on our loan balances.","And then lastly I would mention that we are beginning to see some growth in our private banking wealth management area as the collaboration between our commercial relationships and the principles, dealers, is really starting to get traction and helping us to drive our portfolio.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Perfect.","Ralph Babb","I think as Lars mentioned and you had mentioned earlier, if the economy picks up it will be a positive for all of our lines of business across all of our markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI","If you could just spend a minute on the LCR. So you guys had showed at a conference recently that you were in very good shape on the LCR mentioned. You mentioned today that you are changing the mix, adding more Ginnie Mae's. Did you think about your asset sensitivity as you change that mix? Does that make you rethink what your sensitivity going forward versus what it was in the past? Just curious how you think about that.","Ralph Babb","Karen?","Karen Parkhill","Sure. Yes, we did we share at the Goldman Sachs conference in December that as of the end of the third quarter, we believe that under the proposed liquidity coverage ratio that we would be in compliance. And we have been adding Ginnie Mae security. And from an asset sensitivity perspective, as you know hopefully, 85% of our loans are floating rate, and so we are asset sensitive today. The changes that we have made to the securities portfolio do not change that asset sensitivity much, if at all.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay. And then just on the, you mentioned the pension expense savings for 2014. I guess the question is, does all of that go right to the bottom line or is there anything, anyplace it gets eaten up? And then number two, what's your view for expenses outside of the pension savings?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, we did say for our outlook for 2014 that we expect our pension expense to be less than half of the $86 million that it was in 2013. On top of that pension expense, we do expect increased expenses from merit, healthcare, regulatory compliance type expenses. But we are very focused on continued expense discipline to partly offset that other increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","I just wanted to follow up on the loan growth you saw this quarter. When you look at the C&I, I think it's up around 13% annualized, did you see any shift in customer attitude towards expansion investment? Or, Lars, is this really just a seasonal bounce even though you are saying commitments are up, line utilization is up, pipeline is strong?","Lars Anderson","Yeah, absolutely. I would not say that it is a seasonal shift, you know. Middle market banking tends to be a little bit more consistent, less seasonal. I would tell you that I was really pleased to see the levels of commitments increase, which I think is a good forward indicator across a number of businesses and across our geographies. But specifically, for our middle market, I think that is really going to be driven, as we look [indiscernible] in the next year based upon business activity. I think that\u2019s going to have a significant impact on what kind of growth that we see in that area.","I would remind you that what we are seeing is a real receptivity to our relationship banking model across the markets that we are in. And we are very fortunate that we have got California which on a year-over-year basis grew a total of 10%, Texas year-over-year grew 5%. I think we are well positioned in growth markets with the right businesses and the right people.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","So, Lars, and to follow up I guess on Steve's question. So the guidance implies around 1% growth in period-end loans if you are saying [ph] the average is up 3%. Do you just not see momentum as sustainable, maybe the competitive environment? Are you just being very conservative given that it's so early in the year right now?","Lars Anderson","Well I would say that, as Karen [indiscernible] out there, it's against a continued uncertain economic environment. And while we are hearing what I would say mildly more positive comments from our customers about 2014 which I think is very positive, they continue to be very cautious about making investments. They are still licking their wounds from coming through the financial crisis and they are being very reticent about making significant investments. But they are very profitable, they are delevering, they are building their liquidity and you are seeing that in the transaction account balances that just continue to grow. Including in middle market which was very strong and I think is a good indicator of the really deep relationships that we have with our good middle market customers.","So we are going to have to see how the year plays out from an economic perspective but I think we are very well positioned.","Karen Parkhill","And Steven, I would just reiterate that on a period-end basis we do typically see higher period-end balances each quarter, particularly at year-end, which do tend to come back down post year-end.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Okay. Karen, maybe just a final question for you. Can you size for us the expected securities that you think you will be purchasing to get into compliance with the liquidity coverage rules?","Karen Parkhill","Sure. As I said before, based on our third quarter balance sheet what we disclosed at the Goldman Sachs conference is we believe, if we look -- if we interpret the rule as drafted that we currently comply. As the economy improves, the interest rate environment improves, we do expect deposits to decline, we do expect continued loan growth. And in that scenario we will need to be adding more high quality liquid assets for this new test. The rule is far from final and we remain ever mindful of adding securities today in this continued low rate environment that will be marked as the rate environment increases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Karen, on slide 14 you made a comment and it seems the slide is talking about incentive compensation was high because of favorable performance relative to peers. Can you just give us a little more clarity, like what metrics are you guys looking at? Because I know loan growth has been a little bit soft but what metrics are you guys looking at that would suggest that you are performing better than peers?","Karen Parkhill","So our incentive compensation plans as disclosed in our proxy statements, look at the relative performance on both three year and annual EPS growth and ROA -- ROE, excuse me. And if you look at that relative performance based on our peer group, that\u2019s how we calculate our incentive compensation expense.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, that helps. And then just really quick, what's the level of excess liquidity you guys have right now?","Karen Parkhill","We have at period-end about $5 billion in balances at the Fed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Just a quick question on the mortgage banker finance portfolio. It obviously held up a lot better than I expected last quarter and this quarter was down a little more, talking average balances. Is that just a function of sort of the timing with the way the averages shakeout? And then I know you guys said you expected to stay flat on average to this quarter, is that primarily a function of the purchase percentage at 75% or are there other factors that sort of give you confidence there?","Ralph Babb","Lars?","Karen Parkhill","Absolutely. So if you actually compare the reduction in our mortgage banking portfolio for the fourth quarter, you know it's pretty much in line with the MBA. And frankly we had expected a decline in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about that. We are right on plan. As we look out I think into next year, I think a really important point here is to keep in mind that we are very positively gap [ph] to, as I pointed out before, the purchase market versus refi. The industry overall has hit 47%, we are at 70%. And if you look at the 2014 projections by the MBA, it was actually an expectation for 20% increase in purchase volumes for 2014 over annualized fourth quarter. So for us that\u2019s not an accident, we strategically positioned ourselves with our customers to capture a higher level of purchase volumes and I think we are very well positioned.","One last thing I would leave there is, I am really proud of our mortgage banking finance bankers. They have developed very deep relationships with these customers. We have banked them for a long time. We have over 90% treasury management cross-sell, primary depository relationships. And I think even with some variation in the markets we are going to be well positioned. But a lot of this has to do with the housing market variability as Karen point out.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. And then in that book did spreads tighten this quarter, did they improve? I'm just curious sort of on the pricing front what you are seeing.","Karen Parkhill","The spreads improved this quarter.","Ralph Babb","Credits [ph].","Lars Anderson","Yes. So we continue to see downward pressure in the mortgage banking finance sector but it compares very favorably and we do have very high ROEs out of that business.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Okay.","Lars Anderson","I would add just one thing in closing, I think from a market share overall perspective, we are well positioned. Again, I have shared with you strategically how we have positioned our business. And that\u2019s really not a mistake. You know we continue to add customers. We have over the last two years, three years. And so frankly if you take a look at our overall business, you would find that it's much more granular today than it was, say three years ago. So hopefully that gives you some more insight into the business.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","No, it's very helpful, thank you. If I could ask one last question. I know you all highlighted the seasonality on 1Q comp expenses. Could you just remind me how much of an uptick maybe you expect in the first quarter from the fourth on the comp line?","Karen Parkhill","Sure. If we look at incentive compensation expenses, these are disclosed in our [indiscernible]. The full year -- last year 2013 compensation expense was $37 million. In the first quarter it was $10 million. So we do expect, as I said, the full year next year to be about even but because of some plan changes the first quarter to be a little bit higher than what it was last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore.","Rahul Patil - Evercore Partners","Yes. Hi, this is Rahul Patil in for John. I just want to go back to the expenses. I know you mentioned you expect expenses to be lower in 2014 and it seems like the main driver is the pension expense. Maybe you could give us some color around where else are you seeing expenses lower, especially given the headcount was actually up this quarter, the number of branches didn't change. I just want to get a sense of where else are you seeing some reduction in expenses?","Ralph Babb","Karen?","Karen Parkhill","We have a strong culture of continued expense management. And that is something that we focus on each day. As we look forward some of the things that we have been able to do are continuing to renegotiate our contracts with our vendors at better and more favorable pricing terms. So for example, late this past year we renegotiated our telecommunication contract which should provide substantial year-over-year savings. In addition we have been consolidating our vendors. So, for example, our IT contract labor, we have consolidated the vendors from 16 to 2. And as a result we should see both better quality and reduced expenses. And then thirdly if you look at litigation expenses, we have input, we have put in place a new litigation billing management system which enables us to better track, audit and collect reimbursable on our legal expenses. So it's lots of little things like that that add up to continued and strong expense management.","Rahul Patil - Evercore Partners","Okay, that's helpful. And then are you still targeting a longer-term efficiency ratio of 60% or has that changed?","Karen Parkhill","Our long-term targets on both efficiency ratio and ROA have not changed. Our efficiency ratio target is 60% and our ROA target is 1.3 times. You have seen us move the needle in that direction over the last couple of years and we intend to continue to do so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Sterne Agee & Leach.","Brett Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach","Wanted to ask, Ralph, does the guidance for loan growth this year, does that make any assumption for the line utilization rate going forward, kind of given the uptick you experienced in 4Q?","Ralph Babb","Well, I would say it's part of it. It's overall. You look at line usage, you look at what's going to happen with the economy and what your expectations are. And as Lars was saying earlier, things are moving a little more positive but I don\u2019t think as yet, the uncertainty and the caution is still relatively high with our customer base. Lars, you want to add anything to that?","Lars Anderson","Yeah, I may just point something around here, if we look at the 2014 forecast, I know I am certainly not relying on the utilization rates could get us to where we need to be. You know we are going to have to take action from a management perspective to make sure that we have the right resources and the right businesses. We have built out even more enhanced accountability in the sales management system to make sure that we are out there winning more relationships. And that\u2019s really what's going to -- you know deepening relationships and winning more relationships is really what is going to have to be a significant contributor to our growth in '14.","Karen Parkhill","And I would just add, Brett, that our 10-year historical loan utilization rate is about 47%, exactly where we are today.","Ralph Babb","Right.","Brett Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach","Okay, great, that's good color. And the other thing I wanted to ask was just around energy. And I know that's sort of what caused the decrease in Texas and those companies were obviously very profitable and liquid and that has caused some payoffs and what not. Any thoughts on that line going forward and just energy in general in terms of growth opportunities?","Lars Anderson","Yeah, from a long-term perspective, being the largest commercial bank headquartered in Texas, obviously we are in a very strong position. We strengthened ourselves in the Eastern market which is really critical. That business has shown significant growth over the last few years. If you look at the industry overall, rig counts have really leveled out over the year and that\u2019s primarily would drive CapEx in the industry. In addition, you have seen a number of our customers accessing the debt capital markets and that\u2019s paying down senior debt. But that\u2019s cyclical. I think we are well positioned. We have got great customers and as they continue to reinvest in CapEx we are going to be well positioned to drive that forward. To remind you that this is not a new business to Comerica. We have been in it a very long time. We have a time-tested, robust credit underwriting policy. It's relationship based and we are not changing our strategy around that. So that can be a contributor certainly in the future for Comerica's growth.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ralph Babb.","Ralph Babb","I would just like to thank everybody for joining us today and hope everybody has a great day.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. For those who just joined us, we had some technical difficulty at the top of the hour with our webcast portion. We\u2019re now starting over again. Good morning and welcome to Comerica\u2019s third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curtis Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, Dave Duprey; and Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile.","During this presentation, we will be referring to slides which provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC\u2019s Web site as well as in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, comerica.com.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement in today\u2019s release on Slide 2, which I incorporate into this call as well as our SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ralph who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph Babb","Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported third quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.26, a 12% increase compared to $1.13 for the second quarter. Relative to the third quarter of last year, our earnings per share increased 50% or 40% on an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring charges and tax benefits from employee stock transactions.","Revenue growth was solid, increasing 6% quarter-over-quarter with help from higher interest rates as we continue to prudently manage loan and deposit pricing. Also, we had significant nonaccrual interest recoveries as credit quality continued to improve. In addition, over the past year our GEAR Up initiative has lowered expenses and increased fee income. This has resulted in substantial improvement in our returns, with an ROE of 11.17% and ROA of 1.25%, and an efficiency ratio of 56% for the third quarter.","Turning to Slide 4 and an overview of our third quarter results, average loans for the third quarter of $48.7 billion was stable compared to the second quarter. Seasonality drove an increase in Mortgage Banker and a decline in National Dealer Services. Our customers remain cautious as progress in Washington has been slow and global tensions intensify. This is also reflected in commercial loan volume for the industry which is down. Furthermore, we are maintaining our pricing and underwriting discipline in a highly competitive environment.","Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased while interest-bearing deposits declined. Total deposits decreased through the middle of July and then began to rebound which is in line with our normal seasonal pattern. In addition, customers are using deposits in their business. We are carefully monitoring our deposit base and have not made any adjustments to our standard pricing.","Net interest income increased $46 million or over 9% to $546 million. As I mentioned, this was primarily driven by the benefit from increased interest rates and nonaccrual interest recoveries. Credit quality continued to be strong with declines in criticized and nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs of only 21 basis points. Our total reserve remains stable resulting in a provision of $24 million. The recently completed Shared National Credit exam has been incorporated into our results.","As far as the hurricanes at Houston and Florida, we are working closely with customers to address their needs. It is in these extraordinary situations that we can demonstrate the value of our relationship model. The damage to our facilities was minor and the credit impact has been manageable. Our reserves appropriately reflect our expectation of losses.","I also want to mention the recent wildfires in California. We have no facilities located in the Napa or Sonoma valleys and none of our employees have been impacted. We have approximately $500 million in loans to customers in the northern California affected areas. And as of now, we are not aware of any significant property damage. Also, we are not aware of any customer impacts in southern California. We will stay abreast of this situation and we stand ready to assist our employees, customers and the communities.","Noninterest income was stable. Continued growth in card fees reflects the traction we are gaining with our GEAR Up initiative. Following a strong second quarter, fiduciary income and customer derivative income decreased. Noninterest expenses increased as expected. Salaries were up mainly due to higher temporary labor such as additional staffing in our call center necessary to assist in a card conversion.","In addition, we had increased expense for technology as well as higher outside processing related to growing card fees. This was partly offset by a $7 million decrease in restructuring charges. Of note, excluding restructuring charges, expenses have decreased significantly relative to the third quarter last year as we continue to closely manage our expenses and reap the benefits from our GEAR Up initiatives.","We increased our payout to our shareholders as we repurchased $139 million or 2 million shares and increased our dividend by 15%. We expect to gradually increase our stock buyback as we progress through the year. Also noteworthy, last month our Board appointed a new independent director, Barbara Smith, who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Dallas-based Commercial Metals Company or CMC. She brings a number of key skills including relevant business management and significant financial expertise. We have a strong and diverse board with a good mix of industry, financial and leadership backgrounds. ","And now, I will turn the call over to Dave who will go over the quarter in more detail.","David Duprey","Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. As Ralph mentioned, third quarter average loans were stable compared to the second quarter. While our loan growth was muted, we benefitted significantly from increased loan yields.","Mortgage Banker average loans grew almost $200 million with the normal pickup in summer home sales partly offset by modestly shorter time that mortgages are sitting in the warehouse, known as dwell time. Our portfolio continues to be heavily weighted to home purchases with approximately 82% purchase versus refi compared to the industry average of 69%. ","Our auto Dealer Floor Plan portfolio decreased about $225 million as dealers reduced inventory in preparation for delivery of the 2018 models. General middle market declined due to the typical summer slowdown, particularly in Michigan and Texas. Commercial real estate also decreased as projects were stalled or refinanced to the long-term market, and we are remaining appropriately cautious as far as new business opportunities this point in the cycle.","We saw growth across several of our key specialty and national business lines such as technology and life sciences, specifically Equity Fund Services as well as environmental services. Average energy loans increased slightly to almost 2.1 billion or 4% of our total loans due to a slower pace of asset sales and capital markets activity.","Total period end loans decreased about 200 million due to seasonal declines in Mortgage Banker and Dealers, partly offset by growth in Equity Fund Services. Our loan deals increased 35 basis points, higher rates including a 17 basis point increase in average 30-day LIBOR added 19 basis points to our yield, very strong nonaccrual interest recoveries added 11 basis points.","The second quarter was negatively impacted by a $4 million lease residual valuation adjustment which was not repeated. This added 3 basis points to the third quarter yield. Other portfolio dynamics such as mix shift in loans, positive credit migration and our focus on pricing added 2 basis points.","Our loan pipeline remained solid in the third quarter and our commitments to commit are up significantly. We believe this reflects improving sentiment over the past month of so; however, overall customers remain subdued, yet optimistic given slow progress in DC and geopolitical tensions.","Average deposits declined about 1% relative to the second quarter as shown on Slide 6. This included a 1% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits and a 4% decrease in interest-bearing deposits, primarily middle market accounts. Period end deposits increased $1 billion to 57.8 billion and were higher than the average demonstrating the positive trend we saw since the middle of the quarter.","Commercial real estate balances declined as customers put their cash to use after growing deposits significantly in the second quarter. We also had declines in U.S. banking and in international. This was partly offset by a $457 million increase in general middle market with the California market contributing the most. Of note, our loan to deposit ratio remained low at 85%. As far as rates, our data continued to be very low. Our average deposit rate increased 1 basis point.","We continue to maintain our securities book at above 12 billion as shown on Slide 7. While our securities purchases were at slightly higher rates than pay-downs, it was not enough to move the yield from the total portfolio. The estimated duration of our portfolio remains relatively short at above 3.2 years and the expected duration under our 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to 3.8 years. Finally, the portfolio is in a relatively small unrealized net loss position of 24 million.","Turning to Slide 8. Net interest income grew to 46 million and the net interest margin increased 26 basis points to 3.29%. Our loan portfolio added 47 million and 26 basis points to the margin. As I mentioned with loan yields, increased interest rates provided the largest benefit along with a significant increase in nonaccrual interest collected.","The higher rate on deposits at the Fed added 3 million and 2 basis points to the margin. Interest expense on deposits increased 2 million which reduced the margin by 1 basis point. We continue to prudently and deliberately manage our deposit pricing. Increased rates on floating rate debt combined with 443 million of higher average wholesale funding cost $2 million and had a 1 basis point negative impact on the margin. In total, increased rates contributed $23 million to net interest income.","Our overall credit picture remains strong as outlined on Slide 9. Total criticized loans declined 59 million and represented only above 5% of total loans at quarter end. This includes a $49 million decrease in nonaccrual loans, which comprised less than 1% of our total loans. Net charge-offs were 21 basis points or 25 million. This included 37 million in gross charge-offs which is a $2 million decrease from the second quarter. Recoveries were 12 million, down from an elevated 21 million in the previous quarter.","Our allowance for credit losses remains steady at 753 million resulting in an allowance to loan ratio of 1.45%. Continued positive trends in the energy portfolio were offset by an increase in qualitative reserves, including for loans potentially impacted by the recent hurricanes.","Energy loans at quarter end were up 2.1 billion or 4% of our total loans. We expect balances will remain at approximately this level. Fall redeterminations were just underway and we expect borrowing bases to be stable to slightly increasing, mainly due to drilling activity and acquisitions. Criticized and nonaccrual loans as well as gross charge-offs all decreased in the third quarter. ","Slide 10 outlines noninterest income which was stable. Strong growth in card fees continued in the third quarter. This was offset by a decline at fiduciary income which was at an elevated level in the second quarter, partly related to tax preparation fees. Also, customer derivative income declined 2 million from the robust level we had in the second quarter.","Changes in non-customer driven fees mostly offset each other. Of note, bank owned life insurance was seasonally high due to the receipt of annual dividends and a warrant income, which is difficult to predict, declined.","We remain on track to achieve our GEAR Up revenue charges. Year-to-date, customer-driven noninterest income has increased 32 million relative to the same period last year with growth in card, treasury management, fiduciary, brokerage and foreign exchange.","As expected, expenses decreased as shown on Slide 11. Salaries and benefits were up $6 million mainly due to higher contract labor such as requirements for specialized IT skills and a temporary need to supplement staff in our call centers. Recall there\u2019s also one additional day in the third quarter.","Technology costs, including software and equipment, also increased as expected. Outside processing increased in line with growing card fees. Finally partly offsetting these increases, we had 7 million in restructuring charges which is a decline of 7 million from the previous quarter.","Expenses remain well controlled. On a year-to-date basis, excluding restructuring charges, expenses are down 51 million or almost 4% with declines in both categories. Expenses tied to revenue growth have increased, including a $20 million increase in outside processing as well as higher incentives and advertising expense. With help from higher rates and careful management of loan and deposit pricing, our efficiency ratio declined at 56%, as our GEAR Up initiatives continue to be realized.","Moving to Slide 12. As Ralph mentioned, in the third quarter we repurchased 139 million under our equity repurchase program. Our 2017 capital plan includes equity repurchases of up to 605 million. We anticipate gradually increasing our repurchases each quarter through the planned year. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend 15% to $0.30 per share. During the quarter, employee option exercises added above 220,000 shares. This activity resulted in a credit to our income tax provision of 2 million or about $0.01 per share.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ralph.","Ralph Babb","Thank you, Dave. As demonstrated again in this quarter, our asset sensitive balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from increases in rates, as illustrated on Slide 13. Approximately 90% of our loans are floating rate with the majority tied to a 30-day LIBOR. Also, our biggest funding source comes from noninterest-bearing customer deposits which results in one of the lowest cost of funding among our peers.","We expect the three rate increases that have occurred over the past year should alone drive more than a 10% increase in our full year 2017 net interest income. We have not altered the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet or added swaps; thus, the full year benefit from the 2017 rate increases plus the potential of the December rate high bodes well for 2018. Of course, the outcome depends on a variety of factors such as the pace at which LIBOR moves, deposit betas and balance sheet movements.","Last month at an investor conference, we provided an update on our GEAR Up initiative, which is shown on Slide 14. We have made significant progress and remain on track to achieve our GEAR Up targets. Additionally, we announced that we have identified $35 million of pre-tax benefit for 2019 with about half revenue and half expense opportunities. This includes the full run rate of initiatives that are expected to be completed later next year as well as a few additional identified opportunities.","These should increase capacity, drive revenue growth, reduce cost and improve efficiency. Therefore, we now expect our 2019 results will include a benefit of $305 million as a result of our GEAR Up initiative. With these added initiatives and refinement of our original estimate, we now expect total restructuring expense from inception to completion of $185 million to $195 million. We do not anticipate any restructuring expenses beyond the end of 2018.","Finally, on Slide 15, we provide our outlook for the fourth quarter. Assuming continuation of the current economic environment, we expect total average loans to increase about 1% relative to the third quarter. Seasonality in the fourth quarter typically drives an increase in National Dealer Services and a decline in Mortgage Banker. Supported by a strong pipeline, we anticipate increases in several businesses such as general middle market, large corporate and technology and life sciences, primarily Equity Fund Services.","Overall, our customers continue to be cautious particularly regarding long-term investment given the uncertainty regarding tax and healthcare reform. Our expectation is that we will see loans increase next year on a pace with GDP growth. We plan to provide our full outlook for 2018 on our earnings call in January.","As far as net interest income, third quarter nonaccrual interest recoveries of $17 million are not expected to be repeated at this level. We do expect to benefit from loan growth, including national dealer loans which tend to be lower yielding due to lower risk profile. The odds of a December rate rise have increased; however, as usual we are not incorporating any benefit into this outlook.","We expect continued strong credit quality to result in a provision between 20 and 25 basis points and net charge-offs to remain low. Our outlook for noninterest income is for customer driven fees to increase modestly with continued execution of GEAR Up opportunities in treasury management, card and fiduciary fees. This is expected to be offset by a decline in non-customer income such as BOLI which is difficult to predict.","As far as noninterest expense, we expect restructuring costs of about $15 million relative to the $7 million incurred in the third quarter. Expenses tied to revenues are expected to increase such as marketing expense as well as outside processing expense which is mostly tied to card fees. We also expect modest growth in seasonal items such as staff insurance and occupancy with the remainder of expenses remaining stable as our GEAR Up expense savings for 2017 are already in the run rate.","In summary, our third quarter performance was solid and we continue to drive increased returns. In fact, our ROA is at the highest level since 2007 with the Fed funds rate was over 5%. We have benefitted meaningfully from increased interest rates as well as our relationship banking strategy. In addition, credit quality continues to be strong.","We remain focused on carefully managing expenses and our GEAR Up initiatives have helped drive our efficiency ratio to 56%. Earnings per share increased 12% over the second quarter and 50% from the third quarter of last year. Any prospects for additional rate increases, tax reform and regulatory relief are certainly positive. However, we will continue to control what we can control and believe we are well positioned for the future to further enhance shareholder value.","Now, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, Ralph. Just wondering if you guys could go a little bit more into just the lending environment, seeing some puts and takes. Obviously, the seasonality general middle market was down but energy was back up a little bit and then some of the individual of the specialty businesses a little better. So can you just talk about how do you see pipeline\u2019s end demand? I know you made the point that things have gone a little slower on the policy front, but just any change in your sense of people\u2019s willingness to kind of go back and extend and build their businesses across your different lines of business?","Ralph Babb","Curtis, do you want to take that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, Ralph. Hi, Ken. Thank you for the question. Q3 is typically a little softer quarter for us with sort of what we\u2019ve called the summer slowdown, especially in core middle market. And then we have the normal seasonality at our businesses with the Mortgage Banker Finance business remaining strong but the Dealer business typically trails off in the third quarter and picks back up in Q4 with the new model year coming out. We did see growth, as Ralph and Dave alluded to, in a couple of our specialty businesses; environmental services, technology and life sciences, specifically the Equity Fund Services piece of that. We saw some growth in corporate banking. Your question about sort of the energy portfolio was up a little bit for us in the quarter. Balances are starting to stabilize there. What happened in the quarter was that the capital markets slowed in the beginning of the quarter which caused borrowing to go up a little bit and then they reopened in the latter part of the quarter. And so period end balances in energy were actually back down a little bit. So we think we\u2019re kind of leveling off in that portfolio, so to speak. In terms of sort of the outlook going forward, I think that our customers are more optimistic. We\u2019re hearing that from them and I think they are planning more in terms of sort of CapEx spend but not necessarily pulling the trigger yet. I think there is still some concern about what\u2019s going on in Washington as well as with geopolitical issues around the world and whether we\u2019re going to get tax relief, regulatory relief, et cetera. So there is some cost and that still is out there. Having said that, our pipeline heading into the quarter remains strong and our commitment to commit were up significantly. It\u2019s about 22% heading into the quarter. So Q4 typically is a little stronger quarter for us and we\u2019ll see the Dealer business come back on line from a seasonality standpoint and we feel good about sort of how we\u2019re positioned for the quarter.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Thank you for that. And then as a follow up, Ralph mentioned that customers are using their deposits in their business a little bit more too. So when you\u2019re seeing deposit growth, are you noticing any change in terms of where those deposits are going? You have a very low beta, but any change in the mix that you\u2019re seeing between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing? Thanks, guys.","Ralph Babb","Dave?","David Duprey","Thanks, Ken. There has been a bit of a shift that as you saw the shifting out of some of the money market into the noninterest bearing which actually is beneficial for us. So I think we are starting to see a little more fluidity with deposit but we also saw a pretty significant rebound in the latter part of third quarter if you see if from period end deposit balances. And in those areas where we saw the average decline; U.S. banking, international, in particular, we completely recovered those declines by the time we got through the end of September. So it is becoming much more fluid but in terms of the actual direction, time will tell.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Good morning. Dave wanted to ask you just a quick question on the margin. I think if we ex-out the interest recoveries, I think the core margin is somewhere and call like the 3.19, 3.20 range. Can you just give us a sense for what level you would expect that to come in at here as we go forward absent any further moves by the Fed? In other words, can you hold it absent additional rate hikes or does it start to drift down? What\u2019s your sense of direction?","David Duprey","Assuming our deposit betas hold and as we indicated, we are diligently working to do that. So I think that 3.20-ish margin here going forward is probably the run rate. Now I will add that deposits \u2013 not only deposits but the mix in loans can adjust that a bit. As you heard from dealer, we expect to move up here in Q4. Dealer is one of the more thinly priced products because of the low credit risk profile. On the other hand, our Fed fund balances tend to move and that also can have an impact on the margin. But again, your base premise is correct.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right, that\u2019s perfect. Thank you. And then wanted to jump to expenses for just a second. I think when you guys had previously been giving guidance for the full year the expectation was for the core expenses, ex-restructuring charges, to be down about 1% year-over-year. At least relative to what I would have expected this quarter, the core cost base came in a bit better than I would have expected. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for what the expectation for the full year and more specifically the fourth quarter would be? To hit the prior guidance that would imply really substantial ramp up in the 4Q. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for order of magnitude of cost increase in the 4Q, ex-restructuring charges?","David Duprey","I think we\u2019re going to continue to see a slight elevation going into Q4. We continue to diligently work to complete some technology projects not related to GEAR Up so that we could focus much more exclusively on the GEAR Up IT projects heading into 2018. That temporary labor component will continue a bit into the fourth quarter. That\u2019s the call center. We took all of our products; our Direct Express, our commercial cards and our debit cards are all under now a single payment processer, so that resulted in the reissuance of a significant number of cards all of which are chip embedded by the way. So in any event, that cost will continue to be elevated for a bit. So I think we\u2019ll see just a little bit of increased pressure on expenses in Q4, but nothing much.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right, that\u2019s perfect. Thank you guys very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","So I just wanted to \u2013 I fully respect that full year guidance isn\u2019t coming in January, but I wanted to point out that the 56% efficiency ratio is already well beyond what you initially laid out in GEAR Up. And I guess a follow up to Scott\u2019s question, do you also expect a little bit of a ramp higher in the efficiency in the fourth quarter given that we have no Fed rate hike that\u2019s going to be baked into the fourth quarter? And also as we think about your new landing point for 2018, is 56% a good base?","Ralph Babb","Dave?","David Duprey","First of all, Erika, you\u2019re correct in that it was a slight elevation in expense in Q4 and the fact that we do not expect that the same level of recovery in interest from those previous nonaccrual loans. What we will see is slight elevation in the efficiency ratio and if I was to bet a number, I would say 57-ish. So it will be slight. And then looking into '18, we continue to focus on the full execution of GEAR Up. We\u2019ll see some additional expense reductions. Quite frankly, the biggest contributor to the efficiency ratio is further rate hikes. We\u2019re going to do our level best to drive it ourselves with the expense management and focusing on those revenue enhancements, but there\u2019s nothing that can contribute more than additional rate hikes.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And as a follow up, as we think about the impact of a December rate hike, should we expect a similar 19 basis point impact in loan yield for the first quarter? And also if growth does pick up in 2018, do you expect spreads to compress or is Comerica continuing to be disciplined in terms of its pricing of new originations?","Ralph Babb","Dave?","David Duprey","Well, we\u2019re always disciplined when it comes to pricing, Erika. We certainly don\u2019t expect to take our eye off the ball on that for one second. In terms of the other components, a lot of it is going to be driven by deposit basis. And so we certainly are hoping for a December rate rise. And my speculation is if that does in fact occur, we\u2019ll be projecting a 25 basis point beta as we have with the previous rate rises, albeit we haven\u2019t seen that occur. But at some point I think the deposit basis will begin to gain more traction.","Erika Najarian","But just as a follow-up, Dave, on the loan yield, you saw a benefit of 19 basis points this quarter on higher rates. So exclusive of what the Street assumes for beta, will your loan yield benefit similarly in 1Q?","David Duprey","On pure yield, yes, I would agree. And remember loan mix can shift that just a tad, but on overall yield I would expect a similar impact.","Erika Najarian","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Alexopoulos","Good morning to everybody. Ralph, looking at the NIM expansion, you guys have really done a great job of keeping deposit rates low. With that said, do you think you\u2019re starting to run the risk of needing to catch up? When we look at 16 basis points of interest-bearing deposit cost, I imagine your customers are aware where the Fed funds rate is. And I hear the 25% beta, but is there a risk \u2013 there\u2019s a period where we see it catch up?","Ralph Babb","I would say that we have stayed very focused on the competition and what\u2019s being done. And there won\u2019t be a catch up from that standpoint. It\u2019s more back to what Dave was talking about. As competition begins to move up, you will see the betas start to move up as well.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the loan side, it\u2019s interesting. Over the past few quarters on the calls you guys have talked about customer optimism getting better and loan pipelines being strong, commitments to commit improving. And with that said, we see general middle market loans down quarter-over-quarter, down year-over-year. As you analyze the book, what explains loans declining? You\u2019re talking about loans growing with GDP. We\u2019re clearly not doing that here. Why not?","Ralph Babb","I think we have continued to see at this point that the uncertainty that\u2019s out there while everybody is positioned well for the growth and to finance the growth, they\u2019re not making that decision until they get a little more certainty, especially on what\u2019s going on in Washington. Curt, do you want to add anything to that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. Steven, the middle market book we have seen growth in pockets across our franchise, but in particular California has been a source of strength for us and you translate that back into the growth of the overall California economy has been less impacted by events like what\u2019s happened in the Texas market with energy and more recently with the hurricanes in Houston. And so even in this quarter, while we saw Texas and Michigan were slow for the quarter, we had growth in the California market in middle market. The first thing I would say in terms of sort of core middle market kind of adding on to what Ralph said, our customers are cautious and we\u2019re not seeing a lot of CapEx. We are seeing a lot of M&A. And in many cases, that M&A is inuring to the benefit of our clients in terms of the put of the events. We\u2019re very fortunate often to capture some of that liquidity in terms of money management in our wealth management group. But it does hurt in terms of loan outstandings. We\u2019ve also had clients who have been on the acquiring side as well, but net-net it probably hasn\u2019t been more of a drag on our balance sheet in 2017 versus a net positive. Again, fortunate for many of those customers but it does remain a pretty robust M&A environment. Fortunately, we have other businesses in some of our specialty lines of business. That\u2019s why we continue to see nice growth. And one of the factors sort of impacting our balances overall are the seasonality in the book of business that we had a strong second quarter, slower third quarter. That\u2019s tended to be the trend for us over the course of the last several years and we would anticipate a stronger fourth quarter.","Steven Alexopoulos","Curt, has any of the reduction in loans been tied to you guys tightening lending standards here?","Curtis Farmer","No, not at all. We are staying very focused on relationships and taking care of our good clients and also focused on new customer acquisition opportunity, but we\u2019re staying very focused on our existing credit standards, our existing pricing discipline. But there\u2019s no change in strategy.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thanks for all the color.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First, just a quick clarification. You mentioned commitments to commit up I think you said 22%. Can you just give a bit more detail on what that means? Is that a year-on-year number, a quarter-on-quarter number? How do you measure it? How good an indicator is it of loan growth going forward?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. Geoffrey, it\u2019s a quarter-on-quarter number. So this would be end of third quarter view versus end of second quarter. Commitments to commit is where we\u2019ve actually submitted a commitment to a client. We have a firm commitment outstanding. We\u2019re waiting for the client in many cases to finalize and accept that commitment and then fund the transaction. And so we see it as sort of the most tangible frontend indicator of a potential volume for us going forward and we track it very closely.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then just staying with loan growth, looking at Slide 24 on the technology and life sciences business, it\u2019s growing overall in terms of balances but it looks like there\u2019s quite a big shift going on towards equity fund services. And then the gray section at the top of the bars, which I guess is everything else, is shrinking. So what\u2019s happening there? Is there a shift in strategy? Is there a shift in client demand? Why is that other component coming down?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. On the technology and life sciences, as was mentioned earlier, where we are seeing growth in 2017 has been more in the equity fund services component of that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re providing capital call and subscription lines to venture capital firms and that has been a nice growth part of the business for us overall. We really like the technology and life sciences space. We feel like we\u2019ve got a lot of great relationships there and great expertise. But what we\u2019re seeing is that the venture capital firms have become a little bit more selective. They\u2019re investing more money in fewer deals. So a lot of competition \u2013 one, there\u2019s more competition out there, but a lot of competition is chasing a lot of the same transactions. And so it\u2019s been a little bit harder to get growth in the business. Remember, that\u2019s a very granular business. We do a lot of $1 million, $2 million, $3 million transactions, so it takes more volume to get sort of the same amount of growth from the portfolio. And in some cases I think there are some deals being done that probably would be outside of our credit parameters. So we\u2019re trying to make sure that we sort of stay true to our focus really around early stage and working with a more premier venture capital and private equity firms that we\u2019ve worked with historically. So this tends to ebb and flow. Right now we\u2019re seeing more growth in equity fund services, but we think longer term the business is still well positioned.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Good morning. Just a question on deposits and obviously your deposit pricing. So on Page 6 or Slide 6 that you have, if I just look from fourth quarter to now, it looks like deposits are down about $3 billion. Are you guys able to quantify or do you keep track? Like how much of that deposit shrinkage is due to customers saying, hey, I want higher rates and they are going out \u2013 they\u2019re taking their deposits elsewhere versus other things that might drive that lower? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Dave?","David Duprey","First of all, Ken, if you recall historically we typically see substantial growth in deposits in the third and fourth quarter. And again you saw that begin to happen here in September with our deposits moving up $1 billion from period end June 30. So we expect to see probably not as robust growth in the fourth quarter as we saw last year, but we continue to expect to see a fair level of growth coming in, in the fourth quarter. And then that begins to move out in the first and second quarter. That has just been the historical pattern. We are very aware of competition. We\u2019re very reactive to competition. I can\u2019t tell you that there hasn\u2019t been [Technical Difficulty] pricing, but I do believe it has been very de minimis.","Ken Zerbe","Got you, okay. And then \u2013 sorry, say that again?","Ralph Babb","I\u2019m sorry. I just was reiterating what Dave was saying. We watch that very carefully and closely with our relationships and are constantly talking with our customers.","Ken Zerbe","Understood. Okay. And then just a follow-on question. Could you just remind us what\u2019s driving most of the interest recoveries at this point? Are those the energy-related loans or something else?","David Duprey","It is predominately the energy portfolio.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. And then \u2013 so your guidance that these decline going forward, is that just simply because the available pool of loans that could drive this has shrunk so much or is it something else?","David Duprey","It is. When you look at the level of criticized assets, specifically in energy, you\u2019ll see that they are coming down significantly. So, yes, it\u2019s the decline of a pool.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Okay. Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Dave.","Dave Rochester","Good morning, guys. I appreciated the outlook on the loan growth for next year. Was just wondering if you expect that growth to be funded by deposit growth or if you think that might be more challenging to do if customers are using deposits? Any thoughts there would be great.","Ralph Babb","Dave?","David Duprey","Deposit growth is hard to predict. Again, we\u2019re beginning to see customers use more of that excess liquidity in their businesses. But remember our loan to deposit ratio today is at 85%. So if we have a considerable level of excess capacity, ready, willing and able to put in loan growth. So we await the opportunity. It will be a good problem to have and we also have ability to borrow as well.","Dave Rochester","Okay, great. And just switching to expenses real quick. As you guys look out to 2018 and just on your comments on the cost takeouts, are you guys hinting here that those cost takeouts could be substantial enough to limit that trajectory next year or are you thinking that with investments you\u2019re making, you could actually see that growth rate creep up to above the low single-digit growth range? Just any color there would be great.","David Duprey","Well, if you recall our GEAR Up forecast has an incremental expense reduction built into it of $50 million in 2018. And while I really don\u2019t want to get into much detail here in terms of our forecasting for 2018, as Ralph indicated we\u2019ll do that in January, we are completely committed to completing the GEAR Up process and achieving that incremental $50 million expense save.","Dave Rochester","And does that at all get eaten up by other investments to drive the expense growth into the positive category or expenses higher next year versus this year?","David Duprey","Well, year-to-date we\u2019re down $51 million even with as you call it items that eat into that because we will have increases in outside processing. We will have inflationary impacts of merit increases, inflationary impacts of occupancy there\u2019s no doubt, but on to the balance we would expect that expense trajectory to remain very muted and very controlled.","Dave Rochester","Great. All right. Thanks, guys.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brett Rabatin","Hi. Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Rabatin","Wanted to ask, it might be a little early, but just thinking about the upper bounds of a total payout ratio and being more aggressive with capital with hopefully less regulation, can you talk about your thoughts on that? And then just how you see the regulatory environment from your view potentially improving for your cost operations as well?","Ralph Babb","I think there are a lot of discussions going on right now that would potentially impact us from a regulatory standpoint if they get traction and move forward, especially on the CCAR process and the ability to manage capital. And I think if you look back in our history we\u2019ve always been fairly aggressive at returning capital to our shareholders and that would be one of our top priorities going forward. I hope that that happens and I know you see it a lot today in discussions going on in Washington. Dave, you want to add anything to that.","David Duprey","No. I think it\u2019s fair to assume even if all remains the same, we\u2019re looking at certainly challenging our level of capital and working to in our CCAR submission this coming year of being very focused on driving the capital levels downward to the extent possible as well as being very focused on increasing that dividend.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. And then just a follow up on that. Any thoughts on how much more incrementally aggressive you might be with either the buyback or the payout ratio on the dividend side?","David Duprey","We have not taken a position on that at this point. That was one of the reasons why I described it the way I did from the standpoint of we look to do the right thing and make sure we\u2019re at the right balance of returning capital to our shareholders. And historically, before the environment changed, I think you can see what we did.","Brett Rabatin","Okay, great. Fair enough. Thank you so much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","John Pancari","Good morning. Back to the loan growth topic, and I appreciate the color you gave us around what weighed on the balances for the quarter. But when it comes to getting to that GDP level, you\u2019re not there obviously when you look at the declines that we\u2019re seeing in balances on a year-over-year basis. What gives you that confidence that you can get to the GDP level first of all? Other peer banks are citing the macro factors as well the apprehension given the uncertainty in DC. So they\u2019re citing it as well. But we\u2019re seeing a little bit faster loan growth through your peers. So I\u2019m just wondering what gives you that confidence you can get to GDP. And then separately, is there anything with the GEAR Up initiative and the long-term investments that you\u2019re making in your franchise that can accelerate growth beyond GDP ultimately? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to take that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. John, this is important when you think about growth for our bank to keep in perspective sort of the portfolio of lending that we have. There\u2019s certainly some businesses that we\u2019re not in. We\u2019re not in the indirect auto lending space. We\u2019re not a big asset base lender. We really are sort of a core C&I commercial bank. And when you think about sort of the course we\u2019ve been over the last 12, 18 months in addition to just sort of the caution with our clients, there are a couple of larger portfolios that has been relatively flat for us by design. And so we have managed down our interview portfolio which was the right thing to do to get sort of a lower portfolio concentration now about 4% for us. And so as that has come down that has hurt our growth in our portfolio overall. And then secondarily, while we had nice growth in commercial real estate for a few years, we\u2019ve been a little bit more holding stable right now in the environment that we\u2019re in, not because we\u2019re seeing any increase in losses but just concern about sort of where we are in the stage of the cycle with CRE, especially multifamily, et cetera. And so you got a couple of portfolios that traditionally had been growth engines for us that are more flattish right now. When you look out kind of across the rest of the portfolios, I mentioned earlier some of the specialty lines of business and the growth opportunities there, the seasonality in our business and sort of what we would expect to see in the fourth quarter and the dealer business, for example, and then commitments to commit overall. When you think about kind of going forward, I do think GDP for us is a realistic goal. We\u2019re in three very good markets; Texas, Michigan and California primarily all of which are growing sort of at or above the national GDP level. Growing faster than that really is not something that we aspire to. We just have seen over time that sort of staying in line with GDP is sort of the right risk profile for us to take and certainly there will be some businesses through our specialty businesses that may grow faster or slower than GDP overall. We mentioned on prior calls the work that we\u2019re doing as part of GEAR Up overall that we call our Indian credit redesign which is really about looking at how we simplify some of the governance process, how we leverage technology and take more of a digital approach to some of our credit underwriting and really centralize them through our back office functions all around the idea of creating more capacity for our sales team to have more time to spend with clients both from an advisor standpoint and a sales perspective and improve the customer experience. And we do think that will bode well for us. We\u2019re nearing in terms of the final completion of the rollout of that initiative and really we\u2019ll start seeing some of the benefits in 2018 and beyond.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you. And then on that \u2013 do you have the line utilization number for the quarter and how that compared to last quarter?","Curtis Farmer","So the line utilization decreased a little bit. It tends to ebb and flow. It was 51.5% and 53% in the second quarter.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. Then lastly, on the noninterest income side, I know you don\u2019t have very specific guidance there. But I\u2019m just trying to think of how you think about that growing further out here when you factor in the GEAR Up, but also some offsets from the non-customer related income. Is there a low single digit annualized pace fair for overall noninterest income? Thanks.","David Duprey","For the full year we had previously communicated I think it was 4% to 6% overall that we still expect to be within that range when we close out our 2017. Remember that we are looking to push back the GEAR Up initiative from 30 million in 2017 to 40 million next year. And again, more color will come in January in terms of where our expectations for the balance of noninterest income for '18.","John Pancari","Okay. Thanks, Dave.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with FBR. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Moss","Good morning. I was wondering on the credit front with regard to criticized loans, excluding energy, they actually increased quarter-over-quarter. And I also noticed that your commercial real estate criticized loans have been increasing. Just wondering if you could give some color there.","Ralph Babb","Dave?","David Duprey","Yes. Ex-energy, the portfolio has been really performing at a level that\u2019s not sustainable really. We\u2019ve been bouncing around on what we call the bottom in terms of our criticized loans. So small increases here and there can have an impact on a percentage basis and look like they\u2019re growing, but we have not seen any noticeable increase in credit problems, ex-energy, outside of the energy portfolio at all.","Stephen Moss","Okay.","David Duprey","Specifically, Steve, on commercial real estate you mentioned, a good example there we got just a couple of deals that we moved to criticized. One was impacted by flooding in Houston and the other one had an entitlement issue that we feel it\u2019s going to be addressed fairly quickly here. So in both cases, we\u2019re not concerned about that being an indicator of what\u2019s going on with commercial real estate.","Stephen Moss","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And also what is the reserve for energy loans at this point?","David Duprey","We didn\u2019t disclose our allocation this quarter. I can tell you though that it is coming down and we expect that if we continue to see improvement in the energy portfolio that there\u2019s room for it to come down more in future quarters.","Stephen Moss","Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Peter.","Peter Winter","Good morning. I\u2019m just curious, was loan growth impacted at all from the hurricanes this quarter? And would you expect to see maybe somewhat of a rebound in the fourth quarter as the insurance money and rebuilding effort takes place?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. Peter, I would not say that the hurricane situation was a significant drag on loan growth for the quarter. It\u2019s pretty contained for us at the Houston market. While we have operations in Florida, that is a more traditional wealth management business for us versus traditional business bank or C&I lending. We do believe that longer term and as we look out the next couple of quarters that there\u2019s probably some opportunity in the Houston market as reinvestment occurs in the marketplace and many of our clients look at repairing facilities, reestablishing the inventory, et cetera. And so we\u2019ll be attuned to that and opportunities that might exist.","Peter Winter","Okay. Thanks. And just a quick follow up. If I look at the fee income and I look at it year-over-year and sequentially, the growth is kind of limited, it\u2019s basically flat. And granted you\u2019re having nice growth in the customer driven. But where is the pressure coming from? Because if \u2013 and the reason I ask is that if I look at the first quarter of 2016, you had a nice increase from 1Q to 2Q last year. But after 2Q, the reported fee income has been fairly flattish.","Ralph Babb","Dave?","David Duprey","Well, if you look in terms of where we are for the nine months of this year versus the nine months last year, we\u2019re up 38 million overall. 32 million of that we\u2019re attributing really to our customer driven fees, much of that the GEAR Up focus. Candidly, some of the other non-customer elements is really ebb and flow. The warrant income which can be quite robust, I believe we had a couple of quarters last year where we had some very nice foreign income recognition, we specifically didn\u2019t have that here in the third quarter, not really expecting to see much again in the fourth quarter, although very difficult to predict. Investment banking, while not a significant driver for us, it has very limited impact this quarter and we expect it to continue to have a limited impact. Derivatives were in fact up substantially in the second quarter. I think a lot of that was driven by the fact that one of the June rate rise became much more probable, customers began to lock in with swaps. Candidly, if we see the probability of a December rate rise increasingly dramatically, we\u2019re certainly hoping to see a surge in customer activity in December. But again, very, very difficult to predict.","Peter Winter","Okay. Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Tenner","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about commercial real estate. Obviously sequentially lower and you certainly attributed that I think to some loans moving into the permanent financing market. Can you talk about what you\u2019ve seen in terms of the velocity of commercial real estate transactions in your markets, maybe particularly comparing southern California to Texas?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, I think the market remains robust overall. We certainly are still getting a lot of looks at new CRE commercial real estate opportunities. As you know, we are primarily focused in that business in multifamily and in our footprint in urban and suburban markets and a lot of that is in the California and the Texas market. California is sort of strong both northern and southern California. The reason you\u2019re probably not seeing more growth in actual balances outstanding is while we\u2019re still doing a fair amount of new originations, it\u2019s moving to the permanent market relatively quickly still. And so the permanent markets still remains robust. But the deals we\u2019re looking at are well structured, they\u2019re well priced, they have a lot of equity in the deal on the frontend and they\u2019re in locations that we like. Texas is a little bit of a tale of two cities. And so if you look at northern part of the state and look at the DFW Metroplex, the market still remains robust and we\u2019re seeing a lot of looks at new opportunities and are booking new transactions with a lot of developers that we\u2019ve worked with for a long period of time. Houston remains a little bit still in a pause phase. We have not seen a lot of credit deterioration there with the portfolio that we have, but we\u2019re also not seeing a lot of new originations right now. And eventually that will change so to speak, but at least for the time being more of the opportunity is in the northern part of the state. And so it\u2019s just a more limited sort of geographic view that we have to work with versus California which is a little bit more robust across the entire footprint.","Gary Tenner","Thanks for that. And with respect to the California market, any changes over the last quarter, quarter and a half in terms of kind of yields on new production in the multifamily segment?","Ralph Babb","None.","Gary Tenner","No, okay. All right, thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","And I\u2019ll now turn the conference back over to Ralph Babb, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.","Ralph Babb","We appreciate everybody\u2019s interest and being on the call this morning. We\u2019re sorry for the disruption in the very beginning with the system and hope it went well after that. And hope you all have a good day.

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Brent. Good morning. And welcome to Comerica\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curtis Farmer; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile; and Executive Vice President of the Business Bank, Pat Faubion.","A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC\u2019s Web site, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, comerica.com. As we review our third quarter results, we will be referring to the slides which provide additional details on our earnings.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statements contained in the release issued today, as well as slide two of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our filings with the SEC for factors that may cause actual results to differ. Also the conference call will reference non-GAAP measures and in that regard, I\u2019d direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ralph who will begin on slide three.","Ralph Babb","Good morning. Our third quarter results demonstrate benefits of our geographic and business line diversity. Our trusted advisor approach to relationship banking continues to make a positive difference.","Today we reported third quarter 2015 net income of $136 million compared to $135 million for the second quarter and a $154 million for the third quarter of 2014. Earnings per diluted share were $0.74 for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $0.73 for the second quarter and $0.82 for the third quarter 2014.","Turning to Slide 4 and highlights from our third quarter results, average loans were up $1.8 billion or 4% compared to a year-ago. Average loans increased $139 million to $49 billion compared to the second quarter with increases in technology and life sciences and commercial real estate offset by decreases in corporate banking due to our continued pricing and structure discipline as well as seasonality in general middle market and the expected run off in energy.","Average deposits grew $4 billion or 7% compared to a year-ago. Relative to the second quarter, average deposits increased $1.7 billion or 3% to $59.1 billion driven by increases in nearly every business line led by general middle market, technology and life sciences and corporate banking.","In further comparing our third quarter results to the second quarter, net interest income remains stable, increasing $1 million to $422 million, while the net interest margin declined mainly as a result of having higher balances at the Fed.","Credit quality, overall, continued to be strong at 19 basis points net charge-offs, remain well below the historical normal level and gross charge-offs declined in the quarter. The provision for credit losses decreased to $26 million. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter that we have prudently increased our reserves for energy, a result of increased -- increasing criticized loans and sustained low energy prices.","Net charge-offs tied to our energy related exposure continue to be low and we had no charge-offs in the energy business line. While negative credit migration is anticipated any losses are expected to be manageable. We continue to feel comfortable with our energy portfolio.","Non-interest income was up $3 million to $264 million including increased card fees, an area we are focused on continuing to grow, as well as growth in several other categories. This was partially offset by decreases in investment banking fees and fiduciary income due to depressed market conditions.","Non-interest expenses increased $25 million to $461 million primarily reflecting a $3 million net release of litigation reserves in the third quarter compared to a net release of $30 million in the second quarter. We continue to tightly manage expenses while faced with rising technology and regulatory costs.","Our capital position is solid. Stock repurchases under our equity repurchase program combined with dividends, returned $96 million or 71% of earnings to shareholders in the third quarter.","Turning to Slide 5 and look at our primary markets, our most recent economic indexes have tracked data through July in each of our primary markets. Our Texas index continues to see lighter declines. Drilling rig count decreased and unemployment insurance claims increased. We expect the drag from low oil prices to continue into 2016. However, it is important to note that the Texas economy is very diverse. Average loans and deposits in Texas were each down about 2% compared to the second quarter both impacted by declines in general middle market and energy.","Our California index showed a small decline, the first since March. State exports weakened, however, the labor market components of the index are showing strength and we expect that to continue through the remainder of the year. We saw a broad-based average loan and deposit growth in California. Loans were up $360 million and more than 2% and deposits were up over $1 billion or 6% with growth in almost every business line.","Our Michigan index increased again fuelled by the auto industry as auto production continued to climb. In fact, auto sales on an annualized basis rose to a 10-year high of $18.2 million in September. Low gasoline prices continued to be a plus for Michigan's economy. Average loans in Michigan were down slightly, while average deposits where up 1% due to seasonality in general middle market.","In closing, we believe our geographic footprint is well situated and our relationship banking strategy can drive growth in loans, deposits and fee income. We remained focused on the long-term. Our conservative consistent approach to banking including credit management, investment strategy, and capital levels has positioned us well for the future.","And now I'll turn the call over to Karen.","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph and good morning. Turning to Slide 6, third quarter average loans increased $139 million over the second quarter. Technology and life sciences was the largest contributor to loan growth with $367 million increase driven almost entirely by equity fund services where we provide capital call or subscription lines to venture capital and private equity firms.","Loans in our commercial real estate business line increased $124 million primarily related to multi family. Mortgage banker loans were up $47 million reflecting our continued market share gain, as well as refinance volumes and a pickup in home sales, because mortgage banker outstandings tend to move up and down with the home buying season, we expect a decline in fall and winter. And in fact we saw that trend in period end balances. In addition we had modest average loan growth in several other business lines such as entertainment, private banking, retail banking, and small business.","Partially offsetting this growth, corporate banking loans declined $231 million in the quarter as we remain disciplined in this highly competitive environment. As expected, loans in general middle market declined $214 million in conjunction with the typical summer slowdown. And loans in our energy line of business declined $86 million from continued pay down.","Average dealer loans decreased $26 million. In fact each successive month in the quarter declined as our customers worked down their inventory prior to receiving new models. The decline was somewhat less than expected as manufacturers have continued to meet the strong demand along with the fact that we\u2019ve been expanding relationships.","Period end loans declined $799 million to $48.9 billion. This decline included a decrease in mortgage banker finance, reflecting the decline off the summer peak. In addition, we saw decreases in general middle market, corporate banking, national dealer services, and energy for the same reasons I just described. Increases in technology and life sciences and commercial real estate partially offset the decline.","Total loan commitments decreased $464 million with declines in general middle market and corporate banking as we remain disciplined on pricing and structure, as well as mortgage banker due to the expiration of temporary increases in conjunction with seasonality.","Energy commitments also declined. Technology and life sciences, national dealer, and commercial real estate commitments grew. Utilization decreased to 50% at the end of the third quarter from 51% at the end of the second quarter. Importantly, our pipeline increased.","Our loan yields decreased three basis points in the third quarter as shown in the yellow diamond. The benefit from a one basis point increase and 30 day LIBOR and the favorable impact from higher yields on loans related to energy was more than offset by lower loan fees due to decreased loan activity with the summer slowdown and a decline in portfolio spreads as a result of growth in high-quality lower yielding loans.","Turning to slide -- to deposits on Slide 7, average deposits increased $1.7 billion in the third quarter driven by a $1.3 billion increase in non-interest bearing deposit. Virtually every business line posted growth led by general middle market, technology and life sciences, and corporate banking. Period end deposits increased $508 million to $58.8 billion. We continue to prudently manage deposit pricing while remaining at 14 basis points.","Slide 8 shows our securities portfolio increased as we continue to position ourselves for compliance with the new liquidity coverage ratio or LCR. We tapped the market in July issuing $350 million in subordinated debt and an additional $175 million in senior bank debt, both of which we swapped to floating.","We invested a portion of the proceeds $350 million in a combination of five-year treasury and Ginnie Mae CMO. This strategy allowed us to minimize any impact to both earnings and our asset sensitive position.","As you know we are required to have an LCR of 90% by January 1, 2016 and 100% by January 1, 2017. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio meet that fully phased-in 2017 requirements reflecting our loan and deposit movement in addition to the debt issuance.","Any future funding needs for LCR purposes will depend on our balance sheet movement and strategies over time. Should we need to add HQLA, we continue to have several funding option, including our federal home loan bank line of credit, broker deposit, and the public debt market.","We continue to carefully manage the securities portfolio, maintaining an estimated duration under four years. In the current rate environment, we expect continued minor pressure on the average securities yield as you can see in the yellow diamond on the slide.","Turning to Slide 9, net interest income increased $1 million in the third quarter. One additional day in the quarter and loan growth were partly offset by lower loan yields which I discussed earlier. Increased expense from the debt issuance was mostly offset by higher securities and deposits at the Fed.","Our net interest margin decreased 11 basis points with more than half of that decline due to higher balances at the Fed. Compared to third quarter of 2014, net interest income increased $8 million largely due to loan growth. We continue to be well positioned to benefit when rates rise. Our standard asset liability case shows that a 200 basis points increase in rates over a one-year period equivalent to a 100 basis points on average, would result in an increase to net interest income of about $220 million.","We also share in the appendix several alternative assumptions to our standard case with changes to the pace of deposit decline, loan growth, and rate rises. And in all cases we remain well positioned for rising rates.","Turning to Slide 10, our overall credit picture remains solid. Net charge-offs were 19 basis points or $23 million derived mainly from technology and life sciences and energy related loans. Overall, net charge-offs remain well below what is historically normal for us. Gross charge-offs declined slightly while recoveries were down primarily due to timing.","Our criticized loans grew $537 million to $2.9 billion or about 6% of total loans which is well below our historical average. The increase was driven by a $480 million increase in criticized loans related to energy. Inflows to non-accruals declined from the second quarter and were $69 million, of which $25 million were energy related. Total non-accrual loans were stable at only 73 basis points to total loans.","Specific to energy, the fall re-determination process has just begun for our E&P customers, which comprise 69% of our energy business line. With continued low energy prices and reduction in rig count, we expect some pressure on borrowing bases. However, we do not expect widespread issues to arise as our borrowers overall continued to act prudently in this low price environment.","In fact utilization in our energy line of business remained flat at 48% at quarter end. As anticipated, we continue to see negative migration in the energy book which has resulted in an increase in criticized loans. However, non-accrual loans and charge-offs have remained low. As of quarter end, approximately 27% or $1.1 billion of the loans related to energy were considered criticized. However, this includes only $126 million of non-accruals equivalent to 3% of energy loan and is up only $7 million from the second quarter.","We had no charge-offs in our energy business line and modest charge offs in energy-related loan and as expected loans continue to decline with our energy business line down $66 million and energy-related down over $100 million to about $650 million at quarter end.","The $26 million provision for our total portfolio reflected charge-offs as well as slightly higher reserves. Reserves for technology and life sciences loans increased due to modestly higher charge-offs. And we not only added to our energy reserve due to an increase in criticized loans, but we also continue to maintain a healthy qualitative reserve. It is important to note that while we have continued to increase the reserves for energy, we believe that the charge-offs will remain manageable.","In summary, our consistent robust methodology resulted in a $2 million increase to the allowance for credit losses to $670 million and the coverage of our non-performing loans remains very strong at 1.7x.","Slide 11 outlines non-interest income which increased $3 million to $264 million. Card fees increased $3 million due to higher revenue from merchant processing services and interchange. We also had growth in foreign exchange and brokerage fees. This was partially offset by declines in investment banking fees and fiduciary income, which were impacted by the poor market environment.","We also had several items that are difficult to predict, specifically a $4 million benefit from hedges on recently issued debt, a $3 million increase in customer warrant related income and a $5 million decrease in deferred compensation, which is offset in non-interest expense.","As a reminder, the year-over-year view of both non-interest income and non-interest expense is not directly comparable. Each quarter this year reflects an accounting presentation that reports the gross revenues and expenses rather than net revenue for our cards program.","Turning to Slide 12, non-interest expenses increased $25 million. This included a $3 million legal reserve release in the third quarter compared to the $30 million release we recorded in the second quarter, resulting in a $27 million swing. Absent the change in legal reserves, expenses declined $2 million mainly due to items that are tough to forecast, including a decrease in deferred comp, a forfeiture of executive stock awards and lower staff insurance. As expected, occupancy expenses were seasonally higher and software technology related contract labor increased.","Moving to Slide 13 and capital management. As the chart indicates, we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way with a payout of 71% of third quarter earnings. In the third quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $59 million under the equity repurchase program. As you might recall, the Federal Reserve scenario in the stress tests incorporated a gradual increase in interest rate over the forecast period starting in the second quarter of 2015. While the rate rise has yet to occur, you can expect that any material increase in the pace of our equity repurchases will be linked to our net income performance which should improve with rising interest rates over time.","Turning to Slide 14, our outlook for full year 2015 compared to full year 2014 has not changed from what we outlined at the beginning of the year and reiterated on our call in July. Our expectations for the fourth quarter related to the third quarter shown on this slide are based on a continuation of the current economic and interest rate environment.","Starting with loans, we expect average balances to be relatively stable with a seasonal decrease in mortgage banker and continued decline in energy offset by growth in other businesses. We expect our net interest income to also be relatively stable. The positive effects from asset growth and a third quarter debt maturity should approximately offset the continued pressure from the low rate environment on loan and security yields.","With continued strong overall credit quality, we expect the provision to remain low similar to what we saw in the third quarter. As far as the energy portfolio, we expect continued negative credit migration, continued run-off in balances, and a very manageable level of non-accrual and charge-offs. Overall, we expect non-interest income to increase slightly. We expect continued growth in card fees and should markets improved return of growth in fiduciary and investment banking fees.","The quarter levels of warrants income, hedge and effectiveness and deferred comp all of which are difficult to predict, are not expected to be repeated. Non-interest expenses are expected to be moderately higher due to seasonally higher staff benefits, outside processing, marketing, occupancy, technology related and consulting expenses. Also litigation reserve release, deferred comp, and stock forfeiture levels, benefited the third quarter and are difficult to predict, therefore are not expected to be repeated. We continue to remain focused on controlling expenses wherever possible.","In closing, we are pleased with the continued loan and robust deposit growth, as well as increased revenue. Overall, our credit quality remains strong. We remain focused on the long-term and we expect that as rates rise our revenue picture looks even brighter. As always we believe our relationship banking strategy combined with diverse geographic footprint will continue to assist us in building long-term shareholder value.","Now operator, we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neil. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. First question maybe on energy, I expect to hear a bunch of them, I guess, but so the migration into non-accrual and certainly with no charge-offs has all been very, very good. I just wonder now that energy prices have at least kind of stabilized, does that give you guys any confidence that there is very low migration level from say criticized into non-accrual can continue to stay very low or is it still just the duration of softness in energy prices that will drive the ultimate migration performance?","Ralph Babb","Pete, why don\u2019t you take that? Pat, you can chime in as well.","Pete Guilfoile","Sure. Yes, Scott, I think the same pattern that we -- we\u2019ve seen over the past quarter will continue. We are seeing some migration in the portfolio still, but we\u2019re not seeing a lot of migration to non-accrual and we haven\u2019t seen a lot of charge-offs. That\u2019s been consistent with what our expectation has been right from the beginning and it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re seeing a lot of these credits get resolved before they go to non-accrual. In fact, we continue to get large pay-offs of substandard credits and we just got one I think a week or two ago. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. We think that\u2019s going to continue and I don\u2019t see any reason why it would change with energy prices where they\u2019re today.","Ralph Babb","Pat, something to add to that?","Pat Faubion","The only thing I would add to that, Scott, is something that\u2019s really helped us is that 97% of our portfolio was secured and we\u2019ve used the same engineers for years and years and that\u2019s holding up very well. So our borrowers are really behaving responsibly at this time in the market.","Scott Siefers","That\u2019s perfect. All right. Thank you very much. And then, if I can switch gears really quickly, Karen, a lot of movement within the balance sheet between some of your guys\u2019 issuances and then just the strong deposit growth and everything. Can you maybe just sort of encapsulate how much of the movement and I guess the resulting pressure on the margin was maybe transitory as funds were just sort of waiting to be fully deployed or its kind of timing within the quarter, what was the nature of some of those moves? In other words, could we expect maybe some relief on the margin even though there will still be net downward pressure? How do you see those things playing off one another?","Karen Parkhill","Sure. Scott, if you\u2019re talking about the net interest rate margin \u2026","Scott Siefers","Yes.","Karen Parkhill","\u2026 or actual rate NIM, obviously the biggest impact on that was the increased balances of the Fed, which on a period end basis were driven by increased deposit and decreased loans. And so that can move, so the balances that we have at the Fed can clearly more on a period end basis. The impact on the NIM from a securities yield and a loan yield perspective, securities yield continued to be impacted by the lower yielding on our prepay reinvestments and the fact that we\u2019ve added treasury to our portfolio. The loan yield has bounced around a little bit over the last several quarters up and down and really does depend on the movement that we have in our portfolio depending on the relative loan yield in the area that is growing or declining. So the overall impact on NIM is most impacted by balances of the Fed which you pointed out and little impact from securities yield and then hopefully continued somewhat stable impact from loan yield.","Scott Siefers","Okay. That's perfect. Thank you guys very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. I'm sorry to re-ask the question again, but in terms of your outlook for flat provision for the fourth quarter, will your fall re-determination process be completely done and captured in that fourth quarter results?","Ralph Babb","Pete?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, hello Erika. We expect that it will be through the re-determination process really by the end of November.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And Karen, just as a follow-up to the last question. Could you give us a little bit of a sense in terms of your decision tree with regard to keeping the cash at the Fed versus extending duration to protect the margin and given your comments that you are already compliant with the 2017 standard for LCR, I'm wondering what your thoughts were in terms of deploying that into HQLA more aggressively or are you waiting to see how much of this deposit growth sticks with you?","Karen Parkhill","You know anymore movement into securities would obviously dampen the upside that we would have as rates rise and we continue to remain very mindful of the fact that as rates rise we will have a mark to market on our securities portfolio which can impact our tangible capital. So we will continue to watch the environment and be fluid, but we remain mindful of the fact that investors are focused on our asset sensitivity upside.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just one final one from me Ralph, given your comments that some of this energy pressure is going to persist into next year, and the market seems to be less optimistic about the trajectory of the short end of the curve next year, I'm wondering how you're thinking about sort of the -- in case of emergency break glass plan for next year, are there further expenses to potentially improve the efficiency ratio in light of a more difficult revenue back drop, any sort of thoughts on how you're thinking about 2016 as the environment seems to be getting a little less friendly especially for a model like yours that's so tethered to the short end of the curve?","Ralph Babb","Well, we are constantly looking at that as you may remember from previous calls and we have been very focused on expenses and also growing relationships and I think the growing relationships especially in the footprint that we have is the largest opportunity for us moving forward. We will continue to look at expenses as we always have, but that in itself is one that will not offset by itself the expenses we need going forward especially on the regulatory and the compliance side. So growing the business and as we normally would and focus on is probably number one today.","Erika Najarian","Okay. Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Ken, good morning.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Maybe a question on the provision expense or at least how you\u2019re think about it as it relates to energy, trying to tie your comments that you're going to see further credit migration in the energy portfolio, and knowing that you do have to sort of mathematically hold higher reserves against loans that see deterioration in the risk ratings, is it fair to assume that that we should be expecting again further reserve build in the energy book, but then -- but to keep your provision as low as you\u2019re guiding it to be sort of in that mid $20 million range that you\u2019re actually relying on further credit improvements in other areas?","Ralph Babb","Pete, you want to take that?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes Ken, we\u2019re starting off the quarter with a healthy qualitative reserve and that reserve is in place, because we\u2019re looking at the fall re-determination process and we\u2019re expecting some migration to come out of that with energy prices being a little bit lower than where they were in the spring. We are also expecting with rig counts where they\u2019re that fewer borrowers will report higher energy reserves and that could put a little bit of pressure on borrowing basis, so we are expecting some migration, but we think our qualitative reserve that we\u2019ve will be -- will suffice to cover that migration.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. So it's almost just moving from one bucket to the next rather than increasing the total bucket?","Pete Guilfoile","We're trying to stay ahead of it.","Ken Zerbe","Understood. That totally makes sense. And then just more of a generic question, you talk about like your energy customers, obviously I know you know them, you know the credits, but help me reconcile, so I\u2019m going to say roughly $3 billion of your -- which is the vast majority of your energy loans are shared national credits. How many of those energy companies are like -- are you the primary bank for, that you have the core relationship for versus, I don\u2019t know someone like Wells Fargo or is there someone else that has the core relationship?","Ralph Babb","Pat?","Pat Faubion","We are the agent for less than 20% of our energy portfolio. But we do have a direct relationship with every single client in the book and many, many times that is a multi, multi year relationship.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, great. All right. Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. Regarding the pretty steep increase in the energy criticized loans, what was the main component of the driver, was it E&P or oil service?","Ralph Babb","Pete?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, I think the energy services segment of the business has been the most impacted. But bear in mind the energy services segment is much smaller than the E&P. So I would say that both were a factor this quarter. This quarter we moved some credits to criticize simply because of the expectation the energy prices are going to remain low and that for an extended period of time. And so if there was any operational weakness at all we move these credits to special mention and the thing I would say about that is, is that our feelings about these credits hasn\u2019t changed. Most of these credits have very strong balance sheets, we\u2019re well secured. We don\u2019t expect the risk of loss to increase as a result of us moving these credits. We just didn\u2019t feel like we could justify keeping the past credits given how long energy prices have been where they are.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then, I guess some of the quantifications would help a little bit more for example, the -- what was the size of the addition to your energy loan loss reserve in the third quarter?","Karen Parkhill","We don\u2019t give out that specific information. But what I would say is that we have increased our reserves to energy every quarter for the past four quarters since the price started to move down, and we -- I\u2019ve mentioned that we maintain a healthy qualitative reserve. And at the same time I think it\u2019s important to realize during that same timeframe that our energy balances have also declined.","John Pancari","Okay. And on that front, Karen is it -- can you help us with how to think about the incremental decline in energy loan balances over the next several quarters even if oil prices stay where they are?","Karen Parkhill","That\u2019s difficult to predict exactly, but in the appendix of the deck we do give quarter-by-quarter movement in our energy portfolio and you can see the last decline what it did on balances.","Ralph Babb","Pat, do you want to comment on that?","Pat Faubion","Yes, we do expect reductions as a result of the upcoming re-determination, but we\u2019ve also been advised from our clients of about $250 million in commitments today which would translate to $125 million in outstandings that we expect to confirm payoffs on based upon mergers or sales that are happening within the industry.","John Pancari","Okay. And then lastly, I know you indicated that the fall re-determination should be over by November. But what's also happening in the winter is the, the SNC exam which is now partly semi-annual I guess for large banks. Will you be part of that?","Pete Guilfoile","Well we\u2019re always a part of it because we\u2019re involved in Shared National Credit. So all the same credits are being examined. Our SNC exam will not be until spring of next year, but we\u2019re involved in the credits that will be examined in the fall and we don\u2019t expect any impact from that. Our regulators are looking at our energy book all the time, in fact they looked at it just recently. And I think we\u2019re on the same page as to where the risk rating should be on the portfolio. So I\u2019m not anticipating any issues coming out the SNC exam.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Pete Guilfoile","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Usdin","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, Ralph. A question just on kind of non-energy and just regular loan growth. Can you just talk to us a little bit about just the State of Affairs in non-energy Texas and also I noticed that just the kind of non-energy middle markets and corporate banking also look like they declined. So just some flavor in terms of just underlying borrower demand and what's going on at the core in Texas pleases?","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to talk about overall, and Pat you can talk in Texas.","Curtis Farmer","Yes, what I would say from an overall perspective, we continue to benefit while we\u2019re seeing some impact from energy more broadly in Texas that Pat can speak to. We continue to benefit from a diverse geographic footprint and as Ralph mentioned in his opening comments, the California market continues to perform well for us really across a variety of our core businesses as well as our specialized businesses on both the loan and deposit side of the equation and we\u2019re starting to see some nice improvement in the overall Michigan economy tied to the auto industry, the lower gas prices. But just in general improvement in unemployment, real estate values et cetera in the Michigan market. So we feel like we still have growth opportunities in both of those markets which is helping to offset some of the, what we hope is at least a near-term impact in Texas. But I would also say that from a longer term perspective we continue to be very bullish on the Texas economy at large.","Ralph Babb","Pat, do you have anything to add there.","Pat Faubion","Well I\u2019ll just add further that Texas is surrendering its lead growth within our company to California and we\u2019re already pleased to see what California has contributed. But also Michigan has come on very strong and many good things are going on in Michigan and including in Detroit. The Texas economy has a direct impact of about 15% from oil and gas but the hangover so to speak is affecting quite a bit of our businesses. And as noted our balances are down in Texas about 2% for the quarter and I think the best indicator for that is be our economic activity index which shows nine straight monthly declines, so it\u2019s just confirmed by the general economy.","Kenneth Usdin","Understood. And carrying a follow-up, can you help us understand on the expense side the -- kind of what was the magnitude of those non-repeatable benefits that you had in the third quarter and can you also help us understand what the step up -- seasonal step up might look like in the fourth from the -- all the lines that you mentioned?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, so outlined on our expense slide, the levels of expenses that may not be repeated would be the hedging ineffectiveness, the warrant related income and the deferred comp. In addition to that as we outlined just for the quarter-over-quarter outlook that we do expect increases in several other categories. Staff insurance is something that typically rises in the third quarter -- in the fourth quarter, occupancy expenses, marketing expenses, consulting expenses. We are continuing to invest in technology, so technology related expenses et cetera.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. So, I mean is it fair to say that kind of like that helper this quarter were about $10 million and then you get another $10 million on top of that?","Karen Parkhill","We expect our expenses to moderately increase quarter-over-quarter, and in moderate you can assume sort of mid single digit levels.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. Understood. Thanks, Karen.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Dave.","David Rochester","Hi. Good morning, guys. I just had a bigger picture question on credit. I was just trying to figure out how criticized loans increased by over $500 million but the reserve only increased by maybe a few million. Can you just talk about what your typical reserve is on special mention or substandard loans, and I realize NPAs were stable; it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve heard some pretty large reserve percentages out there that some banks have signed to criticize the assets?","Ralph Babb","Pete.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, we don\u2019t disclose specifically our reserves on particular credits, but bear in mind that our reserves come in two different forms, one is the side big [ph] reserves, which are very specific to our non-accrual loans and then the other would be our standard reserves which are what we assigned generally to different categories of special mention and substandard credits. So we did have migration in the portfolio, but the make up of that migration makes a difference on what our reserves are going to be. For instance our E&P credits are much better secured than some of our other C&I loans, and so we might not have the same amount of reserves assigned to those E&P credits, as we would say our energy services credits that are migrating. So it\u2019s difficult to exactly equate migration to the amount of reserves that we have.","David Rochester","Got you. Thanks for that. And then you mentioned you are just starting the re-determination process, so I mean just wondering how much you\u2019ve done at this point? And then we\u2019ve heard other banks with energy exposure talk about price tax coming down, somewhere in the high singles to mid-teens type of range for the fall re-determinations. Is that what you guys are seeing as well in terms of magnitude?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, I think we\u2019d be consistent with that. We\u2019re about 15% to 20% of the way through the process right now. And so far we\u2019re not seeing anything unusual. We\u2019re not seeing any wide spread deficiencies very similar to what we saw in the spring. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see more collateral deficiencies this fall than what we saw in spring because very frankly we didn\u2019t see a lot in the spring, but so far it\u2019s going well.","David Rochester","And how much have lines come in just on average for the credits you\u2019ve examined so far?","Pete Guilfoile","Do you mean how much foreign basis have shrunk?","David Rochester","Yes, exactly.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, its -- I\u2019m almost hesitant to generalize from what we\u2019ve seen so far. But we\u2019ve actually have seen a fair number of credits, their borrowing base is actually increased and our loan to values decrease. And we\u2019ve seen just about as many of those -- seen as many loan to value decrease as we\u2019ve seen increase. But it\u2019s still early and I\u2019m not necessarily sure that\u2019s going to hold through the whole process. It\u2019d be great if it did but I\u2019m not sure if it will.","David Rochester","And then I know last quarter you said you were still kind of going through the re-risk grading for the service portfolio. Is that segment done at this point and when do you typically, when will you look at that again?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, we\u2019re looking at it all the time, it\u2019s a continuous process. We\u2019ve been through the portfolio probably two or three times.","David Rochester","Okay, got you. All right, great. Thank you guys.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Terry.","Terry McEvoy","Hi, good morning. Just a small question. It looks like recoveries in energy happened in the third quarter, net charge-offs through the first two quarters were $10 million in energy and then it fell year-to-date to $3 million. Could you just talk about any recoveries and what was behind that?","Ralph Babb","Pete.","Pete Guilfoile","We didn\u2019t have any substantial recoveries in energy this quarter. We just had lower charge-offs. We did not have a lot -- we didn\u2019t have any charge-offs in the line of business whatsoever and we had just a hand full of energy related charge-offs. So we were encouraged by that.","Terry McEvoy","Okay. And then just on Michigan in middle market lending, do you expect to see or are you starting to see a pick up from the typical slowdown you see in that market during the summer months.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, you\u2019re correct Terry, we do see a dip in the summer but we also see a resurge in the fourth quarter and we do expect to see that.","Terry McEvoy","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Ramsey","Hi, good morning. A lot of my question have been answered and I hate to belabor energy, but out of curiosity, why don\u2019t you all disclose what the energy reserve is?","Karen Parkhill","Bob, we firmly believe that the allowance is there to cover any and all losses and so we think it might be misleading to give specifics around any one portfolio and that\u2019s the key reason.","Robert Ramsey","Okay. I know you all said that most of in that charge-offs this quarter came from technology and life sciences as well as energy. But I was just wondering if you could tell me what the dollar amount in that charge-offs was on the energy book this quarter?","Ralph Babb","Pete.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, I could.","Karen Parkhill","It came from the energy related.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes.","Karen Parkhill","Of the energy related.","Robert Ramsey","Energy related, okay. And maybe while you dig that number up, I\u2019ll ask as well, I know you highlighted 27% of the energy book is criticized today. Can you just remind me how that compares to the peak in the last cycle?","Karen Parkhill","I don\u2019t know if we have the peak criticized in the last cycle offhand. We can't answer your question for energy related charge-off, can't talk about that.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, our energy related charge-offs, sorry for the delay -- was about $9 million for the quarter.","Robert Ramsey","Great. If you don\u2019t have the exact criticized number, do you have any sense or any sort of outlook as to whether you expect this energy cycle to be similar in terms of where things peak or whether you think that the trajectory looks better or worse?","Pete Guilfoile","I would expect we\u2019re going to see continued migration but I think it\u2019s going to be at the slower pace. We\u2019re seeing somewhat of a bifurcation in the portfolio. There are certain credits that just are not migrating at all primarily because they have just such strong balance sheet and\/or they are more gas weighted than oil weighted. They don\u2019t expect to see those credits migrate. A lot of the higher levered more oily credits have already migrated. So you\u2019re not going to see any of that. So I think we will see more migration but I think it will be at a slower pace.","Robert Ramsey","Great. And then last question, shifting gears to capital. It looks like the pace of share repurchase is sort of running below what if I simply took your CCAR authorization and divided it by five quarters would come out to be. I know you all said the pace of buybacks is linked to performance and will be higher in a higher rate environment. But I\u2019m just curious is it not still your intent to fully execute on that CCAR authorization before it expires regardless of kind of what happens to rate and performance?","Ralph Babb","Karen.","Karen Parkhill","Yes, so in the stress test scenarios that were laid out by the fed, they did have a decent size interest rate increase over the nine quarter forecast which started in the second quarter of \u201915 and went on through 2016. Obviously as rates rise meaningfully that can have a good impact on our bottom line. And so you can expect that our share repurchase program going forward will be tied to both our strong capital levels and to our net income performance and so we will wait and see.","Robert Ramsey","Okay. But over the horizon of this CCAR authorization; if rates do not move during this authorization period, would you still complete the existing authorization or would you scale it back?","Karen Parkhill","Honestly it depends on earnings Bob. Earnings can be impacted by many things, but interest rates are one of the biggest drivers of growth and earnings.","Robert Ramsey","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Rabatin","Hi. Good morning, Ralph. I wanted to make sure I understood guidance, just thinking about the outlook for the fourth quarter in terms of average loans. I think given the mortgage banker seasonally lower and continued decline in energy and maybe thinking about the pipeline being lower. Can you maybe talk about the average balance being flattish or relatively stable I guess is the term you used in the fourth quarter kind of versus in the period being quite a bit lower than average in 3Q?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, so Brett I would say that important to know that our pipeline did increase at the end of this quarter going into the fourth quarter, so that is good times for our other lines of business. We did note that we expect continued declines in energy, we have talked about that. On mortgage banker finance we also expect seasonal declines. The amount of those declines are difficult to predict. You can see in our appendix the fact that we\u2019ve got quarter-over-quarter movement in our mortgage banker business and in the last couple of years we have seen seasonal declines, sometimes as large as $500 million, but again very difficult to exactly predict.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. And then just want to make sure I was understanding you\u2019re obviously very mindful of higher interest rates and the effect on the securities portfolio. Karen, what is your assumption for interest rates next year as you think about managing the balance sheet?","Karen Parkhill","That is anybody\u2019s guess. When we think about managing the balance sheet on securities we continue to have prepays on our securities portfolio that range in the $240 million to $250 million yield area and we are focused on reinvesting those prepays as best we can at yields at or above our current portfolio yield, but very difficult to say where those yields will be next year.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. Great. Thank you for the color.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Klock","Good morning. Good morning, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. So I wanted to kind of follow-up on the discussion about the pipeline and I guess your outlook. Thinking about, I came over the -- its been a while since we\u2019ve seen commitment then utilization rates drop and obviously there\u2019s a lot of energy related issues there and some maybe even like you said some of the seasonality that you see at mortgage banker finance. I guess I\u2019m just thinking about the guidance again about period end loans being down almost $800 million in the third quarter but average is expected to be flat. So, I guess my first question is, is that partially because you think that the dealer floor plan which usually has a good fourth quarter, is that expected to kind of come in and help to grow balances in the core C&I book for the fourth quarter, that\u2019s my first question.","Karen Parkhill","Yes, the answer to that is yes. Our dealer floor plan obviously does have seasonality, did see some declines in the third quarter and we do expect it to come back a bit from those declines.","Brian Klock","Okay.","Curtis Farmer","And then in the overall, I might just say that across the markets we do feel good about the pipeline in sort of general middle market and some of our smaller businesses, small business, private banking and even retail which we don\u2019t talk a lot about, but a few lock many consumer lending and so there are some other areas that beyond the decline that we\u2019re expecting in energy and mortgage banker finance, that I think will be contributors in addition to the normal seasonality and dealer financial services.","Brian Klock","Thanks for that, Curt. I guess I can follow-up on that with you, it seemed like even JP Morgan business bank their middle market line of business was down in the third quarter, it was down for you guys $364 million. I guess what are you seeing that makes you feel good about the fourth quarter in that line of business since it\u2019s about 30 year total loan portfolio?","Ralph Babb","Pat, do you want to add to that?","Pat Faubion","Sure. Our middle market business is historically down in that third quarter. We have looked at it for the last 15 to 18 years and it\u2019s a very repeatable trend and it does bounce back in the fourth quarter. How we feel good about that is, as we look at the pipeline and we manage that in every market and what we\u2019re hearing is that, we would expect new credits, new clients as well as increases to some existing relationships.","Brian Klock","Okay. Thank you for that, and just one last one for me if, Pete I don\u2019t think you gave it this quarter yet, I think you gave it to us last quarter. I guess what the oil and gas or energy related they are the $1.1 billion in criticized. Is the make up similar to the E&P in oil filled services in the outstandings or is it -- can you give us an idea of how that $1.1 billion is spread across those customers?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes. The segment that\u2019s been most effective has been energy services were a little over 40% criticized there, E&P is about 27%, mid-steam not been very much affected at all, its around 10% to 12% somewhere around there.","Brian Klock","Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Darst with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, David.","David Darst","Hi, good morning. So, I just want to a question on the technology and life sciences business, I mean that portfolio has had the largest kind of dollar volume of growth over the past year of same size synergy. Where could the relative size of that portfolio be and then is any other growth you\u2019ve seen also to fit [ph] the higher losses you\u2019ve seen this year?","Ralph Babb","Pat, do you want to?","Pat Faubion","The majority of the growth that we saw in our technology and life sciences business was in our equity fund services group where we provide capital call and subscription lines to venture capital and private equity and typically those are the less risky part of the technology and life science portfolio.","David Darst","And if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d attribute the higher loss rate through this year?","Ralph Babb","Pete.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, David this is Pete Guilfoile, its unusual for us to see all bigger charge-offs in TLS, they have been up for the last couple of quarters, they\u2019re above where we\u2019d like to see them frankly. But we\u2019re not seeing any systemic issues there, we\u2019re not seeing any patterns to the charge-offs. I really don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see further deterioration in the portfolio. But we felt it made sense to increase our reserves and we\u2019re watching it carefully. But we don\u2019t expect that deterioration to continue in subsequent quarters.","David Darst","Okay, great. And then Karen, just one quick question on the headcount increase this quarter. Is that related to some of the technology projects you got in place or those frontline sales?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, it is related to mostly the technology projects. On the frontline we are very focused on allocating our resources to our greatest growth opportunities but not necessarily adding in the headcount.","David Darst","Okay, great. Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, David.","David Eads","Good morning. Following up on the tax question you just got, did you give a little bit of color on how you guys think about protections and what makes you comfortable with the exposures in that portfolio, I guess particularly on the more risky side if we were to have a more sustained troubles hit the tech market?","Ralph Babb","Pete.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, there was a number of things David. We\u2019ve been in the business a long time, so experience is probably the most important thing. We have relationships with a number of venture capital firms that we\u2019ve been through ups and downs in the cycles many times before, so we understand how they react in downturns. We have a number of different businesses within the technology and life science. So its much more diversified than you might think, even within the technology sector we have a fair amount of diversification not just by industry but by geography and by investor group too. So I would say the main things we point to are experience, the partners that we do business with, we\u2019re very selective and then the diversification of the book.","David Eads","Great, thanks.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","David Eads","Just quickly on energy, a question, can you give any color; I know you guys have not wanted to give any kind of numbers around the reserve. But the relative size of the quantitative and qualitative reserves and any kind of trends, if we\u2019ve seen meaningful shifts from qualitative into quantitative over the last past couple of quarters?","Ralph Babb","Karen.","Karen Parkhill","Yes. So we don\u2019t give relative sizes either but we do maintain a healthy qualitative reserve as we look forward.","David Eads","Okay.","Curtis Farmer","I can just tell you that, we size our qualitative reserve based on events that we think have already occurred and our risk ratings have not adjusted to yet. So, we think that the migration that we\u2019re going to see this quarter as a result of re-determination processes are events that have already occurred. So we feel comfortable setting up a qualitative reserve to cover that aspect of the migration.","David Eads","All right. Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Moran with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, John.","John Moran","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-ups, the $125 million in outstandings that are expected to pay down out of the energy book, would that all hit in 4Q or is that kind of 4Q and then into \u201916?","Ralph Babb","Pat.","Pat Faubion","To the best of my recollection, John those are -- those should happen in the fourth quarter.","John Moran","Okay.","Pat Faubion","We\u2019ve already been -- that number is based upon information that borrowers have advised us on. So those opportunities are already in process.","John Moran","Got it. Okay, thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up on Texas generally, even ex-energy [ph] general middle market is sort of down, are you guys experiencing that, and it certainly it seems like different MSAs are experiencing this slowdown in different ways. So if you could give us a little bit of color in terms of kind of what you\u2019ve seen going on by market and then I know you feel good about the pipeline in general, but if you had any commentary around the pipeline as related specifically to Texas.","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to take that one?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments about Texas overall, while there is a general impact from the energy slowdown state wide. It definitely is being felt more in the Houston market sort of primary probably San Antonio is secondary, but if you look at the North Texas market, Dallas\/Fort Worth it is a more diverse economy less energy dependant. We are not seeing what I\u2019d call sort of broad impact as of yet in that part of the sector. But more impact is starting to creep in energy, energy related [technical difficulty], but just more broadly probably some longer term impact on home values, real estate values et cetera for example in the Houston market. They\u2019re the huge states, so there\u2019s a lot of diversity from economic standpoint.","Ralph Babb","And Michigan as you were talking about earlier with the auto industry rebounding and there\u2019s a real strength starting and momentum there.","Curtis Farmer","Right, yes. As well as the kind of broad spread growth we\u2019re seeing in California as the economy continues to chug along.","Ralph Babb","And the various specialized businesses that we have that are unique as well. Pat, do you want to add anything to that?","Pat Faubion","Well, just as it relates to Texas the competition for non-energy and non-energy services clients is pretty fierce. People are not trying to expand their book for that and they\u2019ve redirected their marketing activities towards non-energy companies. So that\u2019s also impacting our growth in Texas.","John Moran","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one other quick follow-up on the criticized energy and Karen, I don\u2019t know if it was -- we're not sure if we have this or we\u2019re not going to disclose it at this point, but somebody has asked where they peaked last cycle and I was wondering if you have tracked that down?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, we peaked at the high 20s overall in terms of the entire energy book. Bear in mind that we did not have energy related in that number back in the last cycle. So we just started reporting energy related in this cycle. Also the duration of that cycle was shorter. So it\u2019s not surprising that our criticized levels are a little bit higher this time around for those two reasons.","Ralph Babb","Pat, do you have anything to add?","Pat Faubion","I think we\u2019ve adjusted to say that we examine our book. We examine it more critically today based upon cash flow as opposed to an asset based book. The complexion of the portfolio has only gotten better since the last cycle. It remains secured but we are focusing more succinctly on depressed cash flow this time around.","John Moran","Got it. Thanks very much for taking the questions guys.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Steven.","Steven Alexopoulos","Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of follow-ups, no surprise, I guess on energy. Ralph, when I look at the energy criticized, you were up $329 million last quarter. This quarter, you are up $537 million. Last quarter was seemingly impacted by the SNC exam, borrowing base resets. I'm trying to get my head around what the catalyst was this quarter that we saw a bigger increase in criticized this quarter versus last quarter.","Ralph Babb","Pete.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, Steve as I stated before, we just decided to take the approach that given that energy prices have been down for an extended period of time that we had a number of credits that were kind of in that low pass category, we just moved them to criticized thinking that we\u2019re not going to see a turnaround in energy prices and if any of our credits are seeing any kind of operational weakness, we decided that we really could justify calling them past credits. But again, I don\u2019t feel any worse about those credits. I don\u2019t think we have a big risk of loss. Most of those credits have very strong balance sheets and most of those credits that we moved this quarter still are very, very well secured. So, we actually don\u2019t feel any differently about the energy book today than we felt one or two quarters ago.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, so you essentially changed your forecast for oil prices, essentially?","Pete Guilfoile","No, it\u2019s not based on really a forecast Steve as much as it is that, if you\u2019re seeing some operational weakness and you really don\u2019t expect that operational -- there\u2019s an impetus for that operational weakness to turnaround in the short-term which now we really don\u2019t. We just decided that we should move them to special mention.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. And in terms of not needing to put incremental reserves or at least any size, magnitude, were you already reserving at the new rating level? I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the lack of provision in the quarter.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, so we\u2019ve always had a qualitative reserve and that we have tried to stay ahead of this the whole way and so you\u2019re right, that qualitative reserve was available for some of the risk rating changes that we made.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay.","Karen Parkhill","And we did increase our reserves for energy in the quarter, Steve.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, right.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. And just a final one; so from a big picture view, we\u2019re roughly a third of the energy book now criticized, seemingly above the prior peak. What gives you confidence that losses are going to remain manageable? And by manageable, do you mean through earnings? What exactly do you mean by that?","Pete Guilfoile","Well, bear in mind that, the bulk of the migration has been in E&P. And the vast majority of those E&P credits remain extremely well secured, even the ones that are highly levered, most of the debt is below us and so our position in those credits remain solid even though the risk of default might be higher. The concern would probably would be more around our energy services book, but our energy services book is only 15% of the portfolio, it's not 50% of the portfolio and that's by design, its part of our strategy as to limit the size of our energy services book. And another thing we feel really good about our strategy around energy services in addition to limiting the size of it, we have really focused on companies with strong balance sheets, strong liquidity, and then another important consideration there is just diversification. We like to see companies that are not overly dependent on drilling activity. And I think because of the strategy that we have and the size of the energy services portfolio, we feel that our losses in the energy book are going to be manageable for that reason.","Ralph Babb","Pete, you must just reemphasize that we lend at a percentage of proven reserves \u2026","Pete Guilfoile","Correct.","Ralph Babb","\u2026 wealth is another.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes and we\u2019ve a very conservative approach as to most banks in the space on what we're lending against in terms of reserves. We are discounting them heavily, we're risking them, we\u2019re really focused on only the proved reserves and then we\u2019re taking a pretty big haircut before we apply the advance rate. For that reason, a lot of these credits have been resolved before they go to non-accrual, because many of the credits that need liquidity can actually sell their assets and generate liquidity because our advance rate against them is much lower than what they can realize in the sale. And that's why you are seeing a lot of these credits that are special mentioned and substandard not migrating to non-accrual charge-off.","Steven Alexopoulos","Maybe just one final one, is your view that losses remain manageable tied to an expectation that oil prices recover from here? I remember Lars maybe 18 months ago or so saying if oil was below $60, it was problematic and now we are $47, do you need to see a recovery for at $47 18 months from now, are losses manageable in that scenario?","Ralph Babb","I think it still be manageable even at today's prices. What's happened over the last several quarters its been great to see -- we see our customers reducing their cost structure, they\u2019re right sizing their balance sheet, they have hedging, that has allowed them to bridge themselves to a point where they can become profitable at lower energy prices and I don't know what the magic number is, but I feel like the majority of our borrowers will be able to adjust to prices where they are today.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Tenner","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just had one follow-up energy question. I wonder as we start looking at 2016, if you could give us a sense of kind of how your E&P customers are hedged, what percentage of their projected production is hedged and what kind of price levels?","Ralph Babb","You know Gary, we update our hedging statistics based on the re-determination process and so we are only up about 15%, 20% through that process, so the number I am about to give is not terribly different than the number I gave you last quarter. But right now 59% of our borrowers have 50% or more of their PVP hedge for a year or more. And about 35% of our borrowers have 50% or more of their PVP hedged for two years or more, which is very similar to where we were. Last quarter is very similar to where we were two quarters ago.","Gary Tenner","Okay, but only very early in the re-determination process?","Ralph Babb","Correct.","Gary Tenner","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliot with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Geoffrey Elliot","Good morning. You said a few times you kind of see energy as manageable. Could you give a bit more thinking on what you mean by manageable?","Pete Guilfoile","Well, I think manageable means that we are not going to see anything out the ordinary that we feel like our reserves are more than adequate to cover anything that comes up I guess.","Ralph Babb","And Pat, you may want to add to this, which is based on we\u2019ve a team that has 30 years of experience. We\u2019ve seen the ups and downs and we\u2019ve talked about various ways that these credits are managed, which is the portfolio in the particular segment. Pat, you want to add to that?","Pat Faubion","Well just to reinforce the fact that we\u2019ve been in the business for over 30 -- approximately 30 years. We have the same manager for that 30-year period. We have our engineers have been working with us for a long, long period of time. Energy is a very important business to Comerica; it's an important business to Texas, and an important business to United States. So and our credit policies have been adjusted over time to help manage through cycles and that's exactly what we are experiencing today.","Geoffrey Elliot","And then just to follow-up, you\u2019ve talked about rates as being an important factor in determining earnings and so on into be thinking about the buyback. I mean, would you kind of rank credit equally with rates, higher than rates, lower rates in terms of swing factors for earnings and ability to complete the full buyback that was approved under CCAR?","Ralph Babb","Karen, you want to take that?","Karen Parkhill","Sure. Obviously credit is an important piece of what we do. In terms of an outlook for next year we're not giving that yet. We will give it as we typically do on our fourth quarter earnings fall. We're still on our planning process, but for provision at least for the next quarter we expect it to be similar to what we had in the third quarter. So we are feeling comfortable on the impact that it could have on earnings through the rest of this year.","Geoffrey Elliot","Great. Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ralph Babb, Chairman and CEO.","Ralph Babb","Thank you and thank you all for being with us this morning and your interest in Comerica. We appreciate it and hope you all have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"6275":["Comerica Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. Good morning and welcome to Comerica\u2019s second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Participating in this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curtis Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, Dave Duprey; and Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile.","During this presentation we will be referring to slides which provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC\u2019s website as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement in today\u2019s release on slide two, which I incorporate into this call as well as our SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ.","Also in this conference call we reference non-GAAP measures in that regard I would like to direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation. ","Now I will turn the call over to Ralph who will begin on slide three.","Ralph Babb","Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.13 compared to $1.11 for the first quarter. Excluding restructuring charges and tax benefits from employee stock transactions, adjusted earnings per share was $1.15 compared to $1.02 for the first quarter, a 13% increase. ","Our results helped drive a double-digit ROE and efficiency ratio below of 59% and a 1.14% ROA for the quarter. Relative to the second quarter of last year, our earnings per share increased 95% and on an adjusted basis excluding restricting charges and tax benefits from employee stock transactions, our EPS increased nearly 50%. This was due to higher interest rates and improved product quality in our energy portfolio, as well as lower expenses and increased fee income resulting from the success of our GEAR Up initiative.","Turing to slide four and an overview of our second quarter results, average loans for the second quarter were up $823 million or a 2% compared to the first quarter. Seasonality, help drive increases in Mortgage Banker and National Dealer Services. Also middle market average loans were up 2% with growth in all three of our markets particularly California.","This was partly offset by decrease in energy loans however the pace of decline has slowed. As far as deposits average balances declined about 1% partly due to seasonality allowing very strong deposit growth in the back half of last year. In fact the average deposits are up over $600 million relative to the second quarter last year. We are carefully monitoring our deposit base and so far have made no changes to our standard deposit pricing.","Net interest income increased $30 million or 6% to $500 million, primarily driven by the benefit from increased interest rates and loan growth. Overall credit quality continue to be strong with declines in criticized and non-accrual loans and net charge-offs of only 15 basis points. ","This combined with our second quarter loan growth drove a 4 basis point decline in the allowance for loan losses to 1.43% of the total loans. The total reserve remained stable resulting in a provision of $17 million. Non-interest income grew 2% with increases in card and commercial lending fees, as well as customer derivative, fiduciary and brokerage. This largely reflects the traction we are gaining in several of our revenue focus GEAR Up initiatives. ","Excluding a $3 million increase in restructuring charges, non-interest expenses decreased 1%, salaries and benefits expense decreased $14 million following elevated annual comp expenses in the first quarter. This was partially offset by increases in advertising and operational losses, as well as higher litigation relates expenses due to a favorable settlement in the first quarter of 2017. ","Of note expenses decreased significantly relative to the second quarter last year, even excluding restructuring charges, as we continue to closely manage our expenses and reap the benefits from our GEAR Up initiatives. We increased our payout to our shareholders as we repurchased $139 million or 2 million shares and increased our dividend by 13%.","In addition, we recently announced our 2017 capital plan, which includes a further increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share which will be considered by the Board at the end of this month. The plan also calls for share repurchases up to $605 million, which is about a 40% increase over the 2016 plan. We expect to continue to gradually increase our total payout to shareholders as we progress through the year.","And now I will turn the call over to Dave, who will go over the quarter in more detail. ","David Duprey","Thanks Ralph, good morning everyone. Turning to slide five, as Ralph mentioned second quarter average loan increased $823 million compared to the first quarter, including a $123 million decline in energy loans.","Mortgage Banker loans were over $300 million, with a notable pickup in spring home sales, partly offset by modestly shorter time that mortgages are sitting in a warehouse, known as dwell time. Our portfolio continues to be heavily weighted to home purchases with approximately 85% purchase versus refi compared to the industry average of 68%.","Our auto Dealer Floor Plan portfolio also increased over $300 million, as a result of seasonal build up in auto inventory, as well as the addition of several new or expanded relationships. We had an increase of nearly $200 million or 2% in general middle market with good activity in all three of our markets particularly in California.","In addition we saw growth across a number of key specialty national business lines, including technology and life sciences, U.S. banking, international, environmental services and wealth management. Partly offsetting this growth was a decreased of energy loans. However as anticipated the pace of decrease in energy loans is slow, the decline in the second quarter was less than half what we saw in the first quarter. This is partly due to reduced assets sales and capital markets activity, which is a result of recent decline in commodity prices.","Total period end loans increased $1.1 billion with the largest attributions from Mortgage Banker and Dealers. Our loan yield increased 17 basis points, higher rates including a 23 basis point increase in average 30 day LIBOR added 19 basis points to our yield. This was partly offset by a lease residual valuation adjustment.","Our loan pipeline increased in the second quarter with the majority from new customer opportunities. Overall the sum is [ph] positive reflective of the improving economy and anticipated changes coming out of Washington yet customers continue to be cautious.","Average deposits decline modestly over the first quarter as shown on slide six. Middle market declined nearly $500 million due to the seasonality and customers utilizing their cash in their businesses to meet the increasing working capital needs. And we expect this may continue also municipal deposits declined as they typically do following tax correction in the first quarter. Energy balances were down due to slowdown in capital markets' activity. ","On the positive side, commercial real estate balances grew as certain larger customers have been accumulating cash as they access the market to take advantage of overheads. Also, as you can see by the increase in retail banking and wealth management, we had seasonal growth in consumer deposits, which comprised one third of our deposit mix.","Period end deposits declined $2.1 billion to $56.8 billion with middle market and municipalities being large drivers as well as corporate. Of note, our loan deposit ratio remained relatively low at 87%. We continue to prudently manage deposit pricing. We are closely monitoring our deposits as well as the markets.","Our securities book remains at above $12 billion as shown on slide seven. The total yield on the portfolio increased 4 basis points as we have been able to make purchases at slightly higher rates than the pay-downs. For example, we have seen MBS yields around 2.50 with only modestly longer duration than the portfolio average. The estimated duration of our portfolio is above 3.3 years and the expected duration under a 200 basis rate shock extends it modestly to 3.9 years. Finally, the portfolio is in a relatively small unrealized net loss position to $21 million. ","Turning to slide eight, net interest income increased $30 million, while the net interest margin increased 17 basis points to 303. Our loan portfolio added $32 million and 13 basis points to the market. Increased interest rates provide the largest benefit, along with higher loan balances one additional day in the quarter, and other portfolio dynamics. This was partly offset by lease residual adjustment of $4 million. ","As far as our deposits at the Fed, the increase in the fed funds rate added $4 million and was offset by a $1.2 billion decrease in average balances. This resulted in a net benefit of 6 basis points to the margin. Wholesale funding cost increased due to higher rates and this had a 2 basis point negative impact on the margin. In total, the increased rates contributed $23 million to net interest income.","Our overall credit picture remained strong as outlined in the slide nine. Total criticized loans declined over $140 million and are now above 5% of total loans at quarter end. This includes a $28 million decrease in non-accrual loans, which now represents 1% of our total loans. Net charge-offs were 15 basis points or $18 million. This included $39 million in gross charge-offs, which is a $5 million decrease in last quarter combined with strong recoveries of $21 million. ","Reflecting continued strong product quality, improving energy credit metrics, and second quarter loan growth, the allowance to loan ratio declined 4 basis points to 1.43%. Energy loans at quarter end were above $2 billion or 4% of our total loans. We expect balances will remain at approximately this level. E&P loans make up above 70% of our energy portfolio. ","Spring redeterminations are nearly complete and borrowing basis are up of above 10%. On average with increases in oil and gas reserves due to drilling activity and acquisitions, the recent decline in energy prices is not expected to have a significant impact on our portfolio. As overall our customers have lowered operating cost, reduce leverage and are appropriately hedged.","Criticized and nonaccrual loans as well as net charge-offs all decreased again in the second quarter, resulting in a decline in the reserve allocated for energy loss to above 6% of energy outstandings. Credits metrics is our commercial real-estate portfolio are very strong with criticized loans representing less than 2%, including only $8 million in nonaccrual loans. We are closely monitoring the portfolio and it continues to perform well under the stress test we have conducted.","Slide 10 outlines non-interest income, which increased $5 million or 2%. Overall, we are starting to see early success of our GEAR Up revenue initiatives. We have strong card fees as well as increases in customer derivative, fiduciary and brokerage income. In addition, commercial lending fees increased primarily due to higher syndication activity. And we had over $3 million in warrant gains, which are included in other income.","Finally, investment banking fee declined from a robust first quarter activity. Relative to a year ago, excluding a $3 million decrease in deferred compensation asset returns, non-interest income increased $11 million with growth in nearly every line item. As a reminder, changes in deferred comp were offset the non-interest expense.","Excluding the $3 million increase in restructuring charges, non-interest expenses declined $3 million as shown on slide 11. Salaries and benefits decrease $14 million following annual share based comp and higher payroll taxes in the first quarter. This was partly offset by annual merit raises and one additional day.","Advertising expenses, which were seasonally low in the first quarter combined with some strategic marketing opportunities in the second quarter increased $3 million. We had virtually no litigation-related expenses in the second quarter. However in the first quarter we had a favorable settlement, which provided a litigation-related growth. Software cost increased we continue to invest in product development, cyber-security, as well as efficiency opportunities.","Finally, operational losses were somewhat elevated, these are difficult to predict and are not expected to continue at this level. Overall, expenses remained well controlled and the realization of our GEAR Up initiative continue to be evident.","Moving to slide 12, as Ralph mentioned, we announced last month that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2017 capital plan, which includes equity repurchases up to $605 million. In addition, later this month our Board will consider increasing the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share. We fully executed our 2016 capital plan, which included equity repurchases of $440 million.","In the second quarter we again increased our stock buyback with $139 million of repurchases under our equity repurchase program. Together with a 13% increase in our dividend, we returned $185 million or 91% of net income to shareholders.","During the second quarter, employee option exercises added above 424,000 shares. This activity resulted in a credit to our income tax provision of $5 million or about $0.03 per share.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ralph.","Ralph Babb","Thank you, David. On slide 13, we\u2019ve highlighted two major drivers of our financial performance. As demonstrated again this quarter, our asset-sensitive balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from increases in rates. Over 90% of our loans are floating rate. Therefore, as rates rise our loan portfolio re-prices quickly. Also over 50% of our funding comes from non-interest bearing customers' deposits, which results in one of the lowest cost of funding among our peers.","We expect the December rate rise to contribute about $85 million to 2017 net interest income. Given that we were able to judiciously mange our deposit pricing we have updated our outlook for the March rate increase to now have $65 million. And our model indicates that the June rate increase assuming a 25% beta could add another $30 million to $40 million to our 2017 net interest income.","Of course the outcome depends on a variety of factors such as the pace at which LIBOR moves, deposit betas and balance sheet movements. We continue to be on track to meet our GEAR Up expense and revenue goals that we announced last July. With no consideration, given to the benefit from increased rates we remain committed to achieving our targets for an additional $180 million in pre-tax income in 2017 and $270 million in 2018 relative to when we kicked-off the initiative in the spring of 2016.","Recent rate increases have helped us reach our targets faster for an efficiency ratio of below 60% and an ROE in the double-digits. Many of our larger initiatives including a reduction in workforce and a redesign retirement program have been completed. We have now successfully completed our goal consolidating 38 banking centers with the final 19 closed in the second quarter.","Two of the areas we are currently focused on are technology and our credit process. On the technology front, we are rationalizing applications and designing ways to enhance efficiency. As far as our end-to-end credit design project implementation has begun and we are seeing increases in our relationship managers\u2019 capacity and enhanced customer satisfaction. This includes simplifying the governance process, introducing new technology to support a digital approach and pooling of back-office resources across all of our markets.","Finally on slide 14, we provide our outlook for the full year 2017, assuming continuation of the current economic environment, we now expect total average loans to increase about 1%. Included in this is a significant decrease in our energy loans, which are down about $900 million or 30% relative to the same period last year. We are adjusting our total loan growth guidance to the lower end of the range that we have previously provided.","While we had always anticipated a decline in Mortgage Banker due to falling refi volumes, the reduction in dwell times due to high investor demand has had a further impact. Also we remain focused on maintaining our pricing and an underwriting discipline in a highly competitive market and continue to be highly selective in certain segments, like commercial real estate and technology and life sciences.","As a reminder, we typically see seasonal declines in Dealer and Mortgage Banker in the second half of the year. In addition our customers continue to be cautious, given the uncertainty, regarding Washington based initiatives.","Aside from Mortgage Banker and Energy we expect the remainder of the portfolio to grow about 3%. As I mentioned a moment ago, the recent rate increases alone could drive of more than $180 million or 10% increase in our 2017 net interest income. In addition, we expect the benefit from loan growth and lower funding cost primary due to repayment of sub-debt late last year.","Credit quality in the first half of the year has been very strong, therefore we are reducing the upper end of our guidance and now expect the provision for full year to be between 20 and 25 basis points and net charge-offs to remain low. Our outlook for non-interest income growth of 4% to 6% has not changed. As far as our outlook for non-interest expense, we are narrowing the range for expected restructuring expenses to be $40 million to $50 million.","We expect the remaining expenses to decline about 1% as we continue to be on track to meet our GEAR Up savings. We are now guiding to the low end of the range we previously provided. As a result of increased revenue, expenses tied to revenue are expected to increase such as marketing expense, incentive compensation, as well as outside processing expense which is mostly tied to card fees.","Note that expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half are impacted by three additional days, as well as seasonally higher occupancy and benefits expenses. Also technology expenditures are forecast to rise as expected as we invest in product innovation, cyber security and our infrastructure in order to drive efficiencies.","In summary, our revenue increased 5% quarter-over-quarter, and 9% year-over-year. We have benefited meaningfully from increased interest rates, as well as our relationship banking strategy, which is driving loan and fee growth. In addition, credit quality continue to be strong, we remained focused on carefully managing expenses and are committed to delivering on the GEAR Up efficiency and revenue opportunities. ","Excluding restructuring charges and tax benefits from employee stock transactions, adjusted earnings per share increased 13% over the first quarter and nearly 50% from the second quarter of last year. We believe we are well positioned for the future to further increase shareholder value. ","And now, we will be happy to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Steven Alexopoulos ","Hey, good morning everybody. Ralph, looking at the sharp reduction in mid-market deposits that we saw in the quarter, historically we would have considered that a very bullish leading indicator for loan growth. Is this the case or something else going on?","Ralph Babb","We believe that a lot of that reduction is an indicator that the middle market customers are using their excess deposits to invest in their business. Curt, do you want to add anything to that?","Curtis Farmer","I think you said it well, Ralph. I think Steve that we are seeing and hearing anecdotally from clients that they are starting to pull down on deposits in their market, but across many of our other business lines as well really for investment in their business.","Steven Alexopoulos ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. In terms of businesses being more confident, which we saw from just about every bank post the election, given the gridlock that we are seeing in Washington on the flip side of them, investing in their businesses are you starting to see business confidence fade at all here?","Ralph Babb","I think what happens is our customers continue to be very cautious and especially in the way they invest and for the time that they invest in other words they may invest what they need per year to meet demand, but they are not going out as far as they used to go. Curt?","Curtis Farmer","Yes Ralph, I think that\u2019s correct and I would say we are not seeing a lot of CapEx spend that more spending to meet current demand, working capital, et cetera in for example core middle markets, small business, et cetera.","Steven Alexopoulos ","Okay, thank you. And then if I could just ask on the deposit side, you guys continue to assume a 25% beta now following the June hike. Do you just remain very conservative or you actually starting to see upward pressure on deposit costs?","Ralph Babb","At this point we\u2019ve made -- as I said in my remarks, we did not moved our standard pricing, we have not seen that deploying at this point, but we did plan for it at some point I guess is the right way to say it here. Curt, have you got anything different?","Curtis Farmer","No, we really are not seeing a lot of demand for any pricing exceptions and are not hearing anything from our competitors, but we stand ready to be competitive as needed and make sure our clients are taken care of.","Steven Alexopoulos ","Okay. I mean is it the expectation that as the Fed unwinds its balance sheet and liquidity dream that you will actually start to see betas move, is that part of it?","Ralph Babb","I wouldn\u2019t forecast that at this point, I think that\u2019s been discussed and we\u2019ve not seeing real impact at this point, let\u2019s see what happens when they actually begin the process and at what level it\u2019s being done.","Steven Alexopoulos ","Okay, okay, thanks for taking my questions. ","Ralph Babb","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Michael. ","Michael Rose","Hey, good morning, how are you. Just a question on the margin, it looks like you guys had a residual lease value adjustment that might have a negative impact on the margins, should we think about the margin being about 2 basis points higher than where it was?","Ralph Babb","That would be exactly right.","Michael Rose","Okay. And then just lot of talk and I know you guys aren\u2019t really too exposed, but a lot of talk over the past few months on retail lending, not sure if I missed in the prepared remarks, but any just kind of broader thoughts on -- your thoughts on lending to the retail space? Thanks. ","Ralph Babb","Our retail lending has been very focused and it\u2019s not mass market type of lending and we have no plans to really change that. Pete, do you want to add anything to that?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, I mean we only have about $700 million of C&I exposure in retail space Mike and it\u2019s very granular across a number of different businesses plus across geographies it\u2019s very granular on average about $1 million of borrower and it\u2019s -- so it\u2019s not big exposures to large department store chains or anything like that.","And then of course the other area that we touch retail would be on the commercial real estate side. Most of our commercial real estate retail exposure would be in the line of business, it\u2019s about $500 million and 70% of that would be what we call neighborhood shopping center. So I think about Starbucks to Panera Bread, a grocery store, a hair salon that type of thing. The patrons typically are within five miles of the shopping center and while those centers they are not completely immune from internet retailing, they typically do a little bit better and all of our projects are doing just fine. We have no criticized loans in the retail commercial real estate space. ","Michael Rose","Okay. And then just one more if I can on energy, where we would need to see energy prices fall to start maybe seeing some additional credit issues pop up from here? Thanks. ","Ralph Babb","Right now, the way we look at it is first of all, any new deals that we're looking at, we are very selective and making sure that those borrowers can be successful in a purely prolong low energy prices. So we sensitize their cash flow and their collateral it\u2019s typically a 20% to 25% reduction in right from the script that we're looking at.","So on the front end any new deals that we're extending we're being very selective there. With regard to the ones that still have some troubles most of them are really selling their assets right now. And if they cannot be competitive in a lower price environment they are really moving those assets is somebody who feels that they can.","And so I know that's not an exact question or exact answer for you, but we feel pretty good about the portfolio, but we're very mindful of the fact that these borrowers are not as well hedged as they were say three years ago. And so we have to be very selective.","Michael Rose","No, it's great color. Thanks for taking my questions guys. ","Ralph Babb","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Ken. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi good morning. This is actually Josh from Ken\u2019s team. ","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Josh. ","Unidentified Analyst","So, your outlook for average loan growth of up 1% year-over-year in 2017 implies a better growth for the second half of the year. Could you speak to the moving pieces here?","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to go through that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes I would be glad to. So Josh, we've talked earlier about the lift we saw in the second quarter from our seasonal businesses, Mortgage Banker Finance and Energy, those typically run their course in the spring summer season. And so we\u2019re starting to see sort of a slowdown in those balances and we've reflected that for the growth in those balances, we've reflected that in our outlook comment.","But the rest of the portfolio, we are expecting growth. And so core middle market our technology and life sciences business, private banking, we\u2019re seeing some growth in environmental services some of our larger businesses, our corporate banking U.S. banking for example.","So really across the majority of our business lines, we are expecting growth toward the balance of the year. And I think you saw that reflected in the second quarter results. We had growth across all three of our middle markets led by California. And as Dave referred to and Ralph as well kind of key leading indicator for us is commitments to commit, as well as pipeline and the commitments to commit area we were up another 11% after having been up about 44% in the first quarter.","So we feel like those kind of leading indicators will help us sort of sustain some growth into the second half of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And you still have a relatively large reserve on your energy portfolio. To what extend do you think you'll be able to continue to release or reallocate these reserves. ","David Duprey","Well, we've been releasing energy reserves really last several quarters, and we released some more this past quarter. That results in overall reserve release, because there were other things going on in the portfolio namely loan growth. I think the next thing with that will probably be the exam in the fall. We have a number of credit that we've gone through redeterminations that we feel very comfortable upgrading those credits. But we're going wait until we see the results of the exam.","And if we do there will be an opportunity to improve some risk ratings and perhaps review some additional reserves against the energy portfolio. Whether that translates into our release of reserves overall, is really going to be a function of what else is going on in the portfolio including loan book.","Ralph Babb","And we're about 6% today. ","David Duprey","Yes. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","John Pancari","Good morning. ","Ralph Babb","Good morning, John. ","John Pancari","Just two things on the guidance, I am sorry if I missed any clarification here. On the fee guidance, I know you generally came in better than expected this quarter and some of that was card and some of that was fiduciary. But you still maintained the full year guidance of 4% to 6%, why not change that?","Ralph Babb","Well John, it is a fairly wide range. So we've remained very comfortable, we are going to be within that range. ","John Pancari","Okay, alright. So, in terms of carry forward from the trends for the quarter there is no reason to them bump up to high end of that.","Ralph Babb","We are comfortable making the comment that we expect to be within that range of 4% to 6% overall for the year.","John Pancari","Okay, alright. Okay. And then separately, on the expense side, I know 2Q numbers came in better than expected. The big guide now you're looking for down 1% versus previously down 1% to 2% despite 2Q expenses coming in better. I believe on the call you had indicated that partly reflects revenue coming in better. Is that correct?","Ralph Babb","That is correct.","David Duprey","I would add largely reflective of revenue coming in better.","John Pancari","Okay. So if that's the case and revenue coming in better is partly tied to gear up. And gear up is on track, why therefore not move the expense guide. If things are on track and revenue is coming better, I'm just not sure why, expenses wouldn\u2019t follow suit as well?","David Duprey","Well expenses are still coming down Josh. What we have always done is again tightening the range. We had said overall ex-restructuring, 1% to 2%. And now we're simply saying if we think it's going to be closer to the 1%, because revenue is tracking better. So we've had higher outside processing cost because a lot of that non-loan revenue is processed by third-parties, it\u2019s very much volume based. And that volume also drives incentives.","And we've also taken advantage of some very opportunistic marketing opportunities, which we think will further advance revenue, not only for '17, but beyond. When you add all that up, we have now shifted our view still in that 1% to 2% we feel still it\u2019s going to closer to 1%. ","John Pancari","Okay. So it's more about the opportunistic stuff it sounds like then?","David Duprey","Absolutely. ","John Pancari","Got it, okay. All right. And then lastly, not sure if you mentioned efficiency ratio sticking to the expense topic, but just want to get your thoughts longer term into how you're thinking about where the efficiency ratio could trend in '18?","Ralph Babb","We believe we can continue to push that number down. Obviously rate rises we thought that even more. We'll have to wait and see what Fed does. ","John Pancari","Right, okay alright. Thank you. ","Ralph Babb","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robison Humphrey. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys. It's actually Steve on for Jennifer. ","Ralph Babb"," Okay. Good morning, Steve.","Unidentified Analyst","Just wanted to see what are you seeing in the Texas economy outside of energy business. What are kind of the opportunities there in terms of loan growth?","David Duprey","When you look at the overall Texas economy right now, and Robert Dye, our Chief Economist he is really looking at the U.S. being a GDP of about 2.4%. And Texas is going to be above that at about 2.5%. And as we've said before the economy in Texas is much more diverse than it has been in history. And energy is only about a 15% GDP. When you look at our Texas economic activity index, it's increased for the last eight months and through April. And so that's a positive sign that things are beginning to pick up and move in the right direction broadly. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with FBR. Please go ahead. ","Stephen Moss","Hi, good morning. I was wondering on the energy portfolio you could discuss where your customer hedging position these days and where customer leverage is?","David Duprey","We\u2019ve seen a fair amount of hedging activity first half of the year it was very similar in terms of the level as last year. And then we saw a significant drop off in June there was different prices. And now we\u2019re starting to pick that back up again. Overall, our borrowers are about as well hedged as they were a year ago or so. But again, the value of the hedges continues to come down.","Because more of a higher value hedges run-off with every quarter that goes by and are re-hedging at a lower level and that's why we mentioned earlier that focused on lifting cost becomes even more important today as we analyze borrowers and making sure that they can be successful not just with their hedging, but be successful because they have got a low cost structure.","Stephen Moss","Okay. And with regards to customer leverage just kind of wondering if you gave any metrics around that?","David Duprey","Leverage is definitely coming down and that's probably one of the start differences between what we saw in the portfolio three years ago versus what we see today. It\u2019s a good one or two turns lower in leverage. And so that\u2019s the real probably now difference between portfolios today and where it was three years ago.","Ralph Babb","You may just comment a little bit too Curt if you could answer this, but we\u2019ve seen a lot of our customers selling properties at very high values.","Curtis Farmer","So there continues to be some pretty good asset sales and in most cases when the sales take place it\u2019s fairly accretive to liquidity indicating that our borrowers are not very levered on their assets. And so they can continue to raise equity by selling assets.","Stephen Moss","Okay. And then I was wondering about National Dealer Services what is your thoughts around the outlook for the business there given the auto market?","Curtis Farmer","That business continues to be one we like a lot and we saw growth in the quarter, while we are seeing the overall slowdown in the SAR rate. I think you have to keep in mind that it still historically very high. We have not seen a lot of impact as far as reduction in our borrowing base with our dealers. We do work with a lot of stronger multi franchise dealerships. Many of those have been in a net acquiring mode as they have been strengthening their position overall.","Short-term a decline in the SAR rate actually helps as you see sort of a long rate days of the lot for the inventory obviously longer-term as SAR is continue to gear down you will see some decline in borrowings, but at least for the immediate future we still feel good about sort of the prospects and growth in the portfolio.","Stephen Moss","Okay, thank you very much.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Brett. ","Brett Rabatin ","Hey, good morning. Wanted to go back to the margin and just ask I guess first in the securities portfolio you mentioned MBS at 2.50, can you talk about how much you\u2019re investing, how much in cash flow you are getting off the securities portfolio in the next few quarter? And then just thinking about the margin aside the June rate hike, is it fair to assume that your pricing efforts are at a high yield than your current portfolio i.e. you are not giving us rate compression on new production?","Ralph Babb","Dave.","David Duprey","I\u2019ll comment on the securities and then Curt can certainly comment on what he is seeing from a comparative perspective on loan pricing. The securities portfolio the pre phase are coming in at $450 million to $475 million a quarter, we expect that to remain relatively constant here over the third and fourth quarter. And yes we have then replacing yield in the 2.20s with securities in the 2.40s we had an acquisition last week which I referenced in the narrative of 2.50. So obviously as long as that continues and we continue to purchase if 2.40 or north there clearly it\u2019s accretive to what sort of currently seeing them.","Curtis Farmer","And Brett on the competitive landscape and pricing we operate in some very attractive markets in some very attractive business lines. And so as you would expect, I mean, competition is always pretty strong and we just have chosen to stick to our discipline, which is really focused on long-term relationships where we can get appropriate returns in the business lines and markets that we like. And really no change in strategy there.","Brett Rabatin ","Okay. Great, thanks for the color. ","Ralph Babb","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead. ","Brian Klock ","Hey, good morning gentlemen. So to add a kind of follow-up question for Curt on the auto dealer floor plan business and I know the guidance you guys gave was for the typical sort of seasonal sell down that happens as we go through the summer and fall months. I guess considering like you said that there is carry those thing and the lots longer. Should we expect the sell down in the third quarter to be lower than what you've seen historically in the third quarter?","Curtis Farmer","Hard to anticipate I mean, normally the third quarter steps out pretty strong, we start to see the slowdown sort of in the second half of the third quarter and then leading into the fall. I mean you would normally start seeing a little bit of build as we get into the latter half of fourth quarter. So we're still anticipating that trend and it's just too early to say if we would see a change there.","Brian Klock ","Okay. And I guess Pete on the SNC portfolio, can you update us again on I guess the relative size of that quarter-over-quarter? And obviously the asset quality trends are strong, trends you have would have reflected the SNC exam from the spring, correct?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, so about 20% little less than 20% of our portfolio are shared national credit that would include deals that we agent about fifth of those would be deals that we agent. We very much use Shared National Credit as a way of not -- we don't use it as a way to grow the portfolio we use it as a way to diversify the portfolio particularly in businesses like energy, where we don't want to hold the large deal use our balance sheet and have a large exposure, yet still play in that market where we like to be, which is the upper middle market.","So in our view, it's a way of getting the diversity that we want without taking the risk at the balance sheet. And so that's really our focus on Shared National Credit. As far as credit quality goes, it's very strong ex-energy. Remember that most of our energy credits are Shared National Credits. So if you just pull those out the rest of the SNC portfolio is in terrific shape. ","Ralph Babb"," I mentioned as well Pete that those were underwritten just like we\u2019d underwrite the other credit. And as we focused on it we also look to build the new relationship even if we're not the agent with those customers.","Pete Guilfoile","That's right. We have a timeframe internally that if we don't have a full relationship with the borrower then we're typically looking at exit. And we do as Ralph said, we underwrite those credits just like we would any single bank deal. ","Brian Klock ","Great, you're right. On slide nine, the ex-energy the charge-off ratio still pretty low at 13 basis points so that's pretty solid performance in that portfolio.","Pete Guilfoile","Yes we felt all along that the charge-offs would be very manageable and so far they have been and we expect them to continue there.","Brian Klock ","Okay. And last question, just I know that you\u2019ve answered question earlier Ralph on the deposits, and it does seem like the draw down in the commercial money market deposits in that segment are starting to get pull through on the loan side. The end of period loan growth was stronger than the average, and I know you don't do the segment loan disclosures and deposit disclosures on an end of period basis. But it would seem that there could be that pull forward into the third quarter on the stronger loan growth.","I guess what I was wondering though is, so we\u2019re using it the deposit to snap back after the seasonal soft second quarter. So would you expect there to be that sort of a headwind to deposit growth, which in the third to fourth quarter because of that activity coming into being drawn into the strong loan growth?","Ralph Babb","That's part of the total equation, but also we've got the caution it\u2019s still out there too. And seeing what's going on in Washington and in the economy. So it's hard to really predict at this point. Curt, do you want to add anything to that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, I would echo what Ralph said, it is hard to predict, because we do feel like we're seeing a drawdown in deposits on the commercial side, which is part of the full equation leading to some growth in our loan portfolio as clients are starting to deploy those. But you are right, normally if you look at last year in the second half of the year we would see deposits starting to build some. And so it\u2019s hard to know what that mix might be, yes we\u2019re still too early into the third quarter we will be watching there and it\u2019s likely to be some mix of both.","I will say that, when you look outside of the commercial book the business bank deposits, we did see growth in sort of core retail and wealth management. And so those business lines have continued to grow for us. And the last thing I would say is that when we talked about deposit betas, as we just would remind you that the majority about 55% of our portfolio is non-interest bearing. So really not very rate sensitive overall.","Brian Klock ","Right. And then you guys have a pretty low deposit -- loan to deposit ratio still, so based off the ability to fund. Okay, thanks for your time guys.","Ralph Babb","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. ","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. ","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Scott. ","Scott Siefers","I think my first question is just I am trying to sort of square up the credit costs guidance. So all the numbers are all really good the energy portfolio is in pretty good shape and I think you referred a couple of times the potential upgrades on the SNC portfolio. So I am just trying to square what would cause such pressure on provision in the second half of the year. If I am reading the guidance correctly I think the provision would basically have to double or more in second half of the year relative to the first. So just trying to get your sense for the thinking behind that?","Pete Guilfoile","We\u2019re -- that\u2019s a full year guidance, so what we are -- what we put in there was the assumption that there would be a reserve release and that charge-offs will continue to be fairly benign, but in the lower end of what we would consider to be normal. And so assuming there is no reserve release and charge-offs remain at that level, I think that\u2019s really where we come out for the year. ","Scott Siefers","Okay, alright. And then if I can\u2026","Pete Guilfoile","Yes just bear in mind that that we gave out a fairly large reserve release in the first quarter and that made the first half provision quite low.","Scott Siefers","Yes, no that\u2019s a fair point. Okay, thank you. And then if I can switch gears little back to the cost and David I don\u2019t want to make you repeat yourself or anything, I am just trying to get a sense for the any underlying pressures on the expense side. So if I look at the guidance by the fourth quarter of this year, I think the quarterly expense run rate will be about where it was prior to when you started the GEAR Up initiative despite achieving quite a bit of cost savings. ","So I know a good chunk of the expense ramp seems to be related to revenues related to GEAR Up, I was just trying to get a better sense for sort of the any underlying pressures you are seeing that might be more than you thought are sort of what\u2019s going on there? ","David Duprey","I would refer to it as underlying pressure. When we came into the year we knew that we would have a higher level of expense in the back half, that was planned and that was all within that the overall expense reduction range of 1% to 2% that we are now seeing will be closer to 1%. ","A big part of that back half, well first of all you got three additional bet, but we did plan and we are continuing to plan for a step up in technology spend. We have projects that will drive customer enhanced interaction with the bank and we are spot on to make sure those projects on the lot that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive a big piece of second half.","Ralph Babb","And as you mentioned earlier too Dave the volumes are increasing, so on the revenue side the additional revenue with the expenses like in card and other things because of that.","David Duprey","And that\u2019s what\u2019s caused that drifting of the 1% to 2% to be closer to 1%.","Scott Siefers","Yes. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. ","David Duprey","Thank you. ","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Ralph Babb"," Good morning ","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. So with an 11.5% CET 1 ratio you have a lot of capital for your risk profile, even if we don\u2019t get reg reform and I am wondering Ralph, as you think about continuing to improve your ROE [ph]. We absolutely understand the clear planning and numerators side, but I am wondering over the next few years especially if CCAR becomes less stressful pardoned upon. How we should think about the payout ranges over the next two years? And also potential other uses of capital other than dividends and buybacks?","Ralph Babb","We have always through history, I would say been very active with returning capital that we don't have an immediate use for. And that would be one of the things that would be top of mind as things begin to change so that we could actually give more back whether it would be dividends or buyback from that standpoint.","And we always look for other opportunities; growth would be the best to use that capital. And I would say and we usually get the question as well on acquisitions, but that\u2019s something that has to be very focused for us and hit very well. I think we've done two acquisitions over the last 20 years from that standpoint. But we certainly view the management of capital as one of our top priorities. Dave you want to add anything to that?","David Duprey","No, I completely agree with those comments Ralph. I mean obviously the regulatory environment will have to monitor that very closely hopefully. We'll see a continued improvement in the tone relative to the whole CCAR process. ","Erika Najarian","And the follow-up question on that the tertiary proposal indicates they'd like to lift the LCR restrictions on bank your size. And as we think about longer term rate sensitivity of your balance sheet. How much liquidity could be released if you don't longer have to be compliant with LCR?","Ralph Babb","It's an interesting question, quite frankly I look forward to the opportunity to pursue [ph] that. Off the top of my head I would suggest to you that that is a multi-billion dollar number.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just one last one Ralph, your chairmanship according to your proxy ends in 2018, what is your message for your long-term shareholders in terms of succession planning from here? ","Ralph Babb","We continually look at succession planning and discuss that at the Board level. And when decisions are made we make the appropriate announcements.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you, sir. ","Ralph Babb","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. ","Geoffrey Elliott ","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. You have had close to 40 basis points of NIM expansion over the last couple of quarters. At what point do you start to think about pairing back the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet and locking in some of the benefits from higher rates?","Ralph Babb","Dave, that's the one we discuss a lot.","David Duprey","Yes, Geoffrey we talk about at least once a week. And it\u2019s something that we monitor on a regular basis. It is a constant discussion of our asset liability committee meetings. We have watched it very closely quite frankly, one of the things we look at is what the opportunity would be on a four year slot, because that is what we would look to do when we start to do some synthetic of the asset sensitivity. That rate to-date just simply is not all that attractive, a four year slot we could pick up about 50 basis points.","And while the direction of the Fed fund rate maybe in question here at the moment in terms of whether or not we'll see another increase in '18. When you look at the dot slot over the course of a four year periods it certainly moves much more than 50 basis points. So while there continues to be some downside risk relative to what rates could do if they were to move down we don't see that today as really a high probability.","So as a result we continue to monitor and when we think that it's appropriate we will begin a hedging strategy. ","Geoffrey Elliott ","Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up, the lease residual adjustment, can you give any more color on those leases what you want sort of lease was driving that.","Ralph Babb","We still have I mean we exited in terms of new transactions years ago, we exited this business. But years ago we did have some transactions where we used leverage leases. So fairly large asset, single asset fairly large we have two of those remaining those assets have I believe six years and eight years yet to run. We annually challenge the expected residual value, we did that this quarter and we made an adjustment on those two respective assets given the expected market condition.","Geoffrey Elliott ","Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Valentin with Compass Point. Please go ahead. ","Scott Valentin","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just with regard to the TLS business potential changes in healthcare, are there any concern are you guys monitoring the portfolio for any potential pressure where we\u2019re seeing some banks report I think some hospital issues but just wondering is there any exposure in the TLS portfolio?","Pete Guilfoile","We have not seen any negative migration with regard to the life science portion of our technology and life science book so far. The most of the businesses that are in technology and life science that are connected with healthcare are relatively unaffected by changes in the healthcare law. And so the -- we\u2019re cautious about it and careful about that, but it doesn\u2019t really come into play in a big way in that business.","Scott Valentin","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just getting back to the kind of provision and reserving, it sounds like provision expense, I mean, I guess with the guidance you\u2019ve given overall reserve level should remain about where they are for the portfolio, I am just wonder you guys have a pretty healthy reserve level compared to appear, if there is room for that to come down over time or if that\u2019s just where you guys feel comfortable operating given historical performance of the portfolio?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes we look at it quarter-to-quarter and there has been times that it\u2019s been lower than it is today and has been times it\u2019s actually been higher. And so we look at again at the end of this quarter obviously energy is a driver, but there are other factors that we have to look at as well.","Scott Valentin","Okay, thanks very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. ","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Peter.","Peter Winter","My question is on commercial real estate. If I look at end of period loans, the commercial real estate portfolio has been trending lower. And then secondly criticize loans in commercial real estate have increased the last two quarters. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about both of those.","Pete Guilfoile","As far as the credit quality within commercial real estate has been pristine. And so we have one relatively large credit that we did downgrade and this past quarter we have absolutely no concerns about the ability to repay. But there is certain things that have happened on it that require us to downgrade it, but we feel very good about the asset, we feel very good about the sponsorship and we do not feel there is any risk or loss there.","And as far as the strength of our commercial real estate portfolios, it\u2019s performing extremely well. When you think about our commercial real estate book, first of all we have -- we are overweight with regard to owner occupied real estate which performs more like C&I. And then we\u2019ve got kind of underweight with regard to true commercial real estate most of that has been in line of business and most of our commercial real estate risk in the line of business is Class A multifamily construction.","And we didn\u2019t really like of Class A multifamily construction for a number of reasons but one of which is how well it perform in downturn. And Houston is a perfect example of that right now. We are -- multifamily is outperforming office and retail down there and that's why we focus on it. But we feel very good about the commercial real estate portfolio because of its heavy -- we are heavy weighted toward owner occupied and heavy weighting toward multifamily construction we think it\u2019s well positioned in the event of the downturn.","Ralph Babb","You might mention how the equity portions are going up?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, this is pretty much true of most of the products in a lot of the business, but in particularly in multifamily we\u2019re getting 35% to 45% equity in those deals. And so you've got lot of rooms for rents to move against you when you have that much equity in the project.","David Duprey","I might just add Ralph that the production levels have remained pretty consistent in that business, but most of it\u2019s moving to the permanent markets fill pretty quickly. And so you will see balances fluctuate a little bit I wouldn't read too much into that overall. So we were down a little bit in the quarter, but a lot of that is less about production and more about just how quickly given that we really do construction financing how quickly is moving to the permanent market. ","Peter Winter","Okay, great. And just one quick follow-up, just going back to the deposit betas with the impact to net interest income with the June rate hike. If the deposit beta remains at zero, what would be the impact to net interest income?","Ralph Babb","I think you would be looking for range, which obviously move into the higher end of the range at which I think is about 55-60\u2026","Peter Winter","30 to 40\u2026","Ralph Babb","30 to 40 I'm sorry yes I am thinking of the March revise I apologize. ","Peter Winter","Okay. So the 25% deposit beta is really the $30 million impact, but zero would bring it to $40 million.","Ralph Babb","That's directionally correct. ","Peter Winter","Okay, great. Thanks. ","Ralph Babb","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Ralph Babb","Good morning Ken. ","Ken Zerbe","Good morning. Just trying GEAR Up, is there any way for us on the outside of the bank to know that you've actually achieved like $180 million of GEAR Up pre-tax this year. Because I'm trying to -- I'm having a hard time separating out sort of the GEAR Up versus the impact on earnings from higher rates and from loan growth. Like how do we know or how do we see that ourselves. Thanks.","David Duprey","Well if you focus on expenses, you can easily back out the effect of the rate rises, in terms of if you just go in and use last year's NIM, versus this year's, then look at the difference in terms of pre-tax earnings there is a dramatic reduction in expense. Albeit relatively modest increase in revenue GEAR Up is much more focused on expense reduction than it is revenues. And remember this year we said $150 million in expense reduction, $30 million in revenue focus on the expenses.","We're focused on both, but if you're trying to get the map to line up to support the statements focused on expenses. Look at that efficiency ratio, and compute that efficiency ratio even without the rate rises it's down. That's the best way I think I can articulate that we are achieving what we expected to achieve with GEAR Up. And internally we track it in extreme detail.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay that helps out a lot. And then last question I had, when you do ultimately see customer demand for exception pricing. How willing are you guys going to be to accept that? Like versus just saying no and letting the customer walk away if that's what they choose.","Ralph Babb","We have a lot of numerous, numerous outstanding customers that have been with us a long time. We are very focused on taking care of our customers. And yes quite frankly, when they approach us about the potential for an adjustment, we look at it and sometimes we\u2019ll have discussions in terms of a little bit of give and take, but we're here to serve our customers.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. And the reason I ask is because some other banks talk about having lot of excess deposits and that's one of the reasons why deposit betas may remain low is because they're willing to let those customers kind of walk away. But if I understood you right, it sounds like you're on the opposite end that if they ask you they will get it.","Ralph Babb","We are focused on relationships is the total. And that's very important for the long-term benefit of not only the customer, but for us. ","Ken Zerbe","Okay, great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Ralph Babb","Good morning Dave. ","Dave Rochester ","Hey, good morning guys. Sorry if I missed this earlier, but how do you guys think about changing the earnings credit rate, have seen any competitors do it? And when do you think if you haven't done that we might start seeing you adjust those in terms of additional rate hikes coming up how many more do you think you would need to see before you start doing that?","Ralph Babb","Well this is -- it's very similar to deposit pricing. We have seen very few request and I do mean very few request on ECA, because quite frankly until the credit fully utilized it doesn\u2019t really matter. And our utilization while it moves up it\u2019s not 100%, but again we will watch that, we will be competitive. I think if we do continue to see rates rise we likely just as we would expect to see continued expectation on deposit betas you can expect some relative adjustment on ECA. We just have not seen it to-date.","Dave Rochester ","Okay. And then I guess how do you think about the cash balance going forward that declined and help the NIM out a little bit, we are just wondering how much more you think just with LCR in the background there you think you can actually invest in loan growth going forward if the deposit growth doesn\u2019t necessarily materialize?","Ralph Babb","We continue to have an excess level of cash, it well in excess of what would be required even to maintain LCR with an appropriate cushion. So we are well positioned today.","Dave Rochester ","Okay, great. Thanks guys. ","Ralph Babb","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Terry ","Terry McEvoy","Hi, thanks good morning. I have just one question, earlier in the call you mentioned shorter dwell times in mortgage warehouse, I am wondering if you could just shed some light on this year what you\u2019ve seen maybe versus last year? And then your updated outlook for 2017 loan growth, does that assume shorter dwell times within that business?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, Terry on the dwell time side, I would say it\u2019s down a few days year-over-year. So if you look at sort of first half of 2016 versus where we are on a year-to-date in \u201817, so it is having an impact on the outstanding in the portfolio overall that coupled with slowdown in the refi business. ","Now positively for us we wage more towards the purchase side and that has remained relatively strong and we are in the season right now of heavy purchase activity and MBA forecast while refi is down MBA still are forecasting for purchase volume to be up for the full year.","And then secondly I think helping us there they sort of all set that decline in refi and the dwell time is the fact that we continue to be in a net acquiring position in terms of new customary relationships in fact we brought in two very nicely relationships in the second quarter.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene P. Persons - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Regina. Good morning, and welcome to Comerica's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curt Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, Dave Duprey; and Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile.","Ralph will provide an overview of recently launched revenue and efficiency initiative as well as a summary overview of the quarter. Dave will then go to the quarter in more detail. Finally, Ralph will provide an outlook for full year 2016, and then we will open up the call for questions.","Through this presentation, we will be referring to slides which provide additional details. The presentation slides as well as our press release are available on the SEC's website as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website comerica.com.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. In that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","I refer you to Safe Harbor Statement contained in the release issued today as well as slide two of this presentation, which are incorporated into this call, as well as our filings with the SEC for factors that can cause actual results to differ. Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures, and in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now, I'll turn the call over Ralph, who will begin on slide three.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. To strengthen our competitive position, and ensure that we remain a strong partner and trusted advisor to our customers, with the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, we are fundamentally changing the way we operate in many areas of our business.","Today, we are announcing actions we are undertaking through our transformational, enterprise-wide initiative that we referred as GEAR Up. To-date, we have already identified efficiency and revenue opportunities that are expected to drive at least $230 million in additional pre-tax income. Moreover, we are pursuing additional opportunities that will further enhance our profitability.","This slide highlights some of the key components of the initiative so far. Through our comprehensive review and analysis over the past several months, we have identified more than 20 work streams focused on enhancing revenue and reducing expenses. We are moving expeditiously, and have already begun the implementation process. We will measure our progress through tangible financial targets. We expect to increase profitability with the end result being a meaningful improvement in our efficiency ratio, and return on equity. I will provide further details in a moment.","We currently estimate that through 2018, total pre-tax restructuring charges of $140 million to $160 million will be incurred. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded about one-third of these charges totaling $53 million, primarily related to severance. A significant portion of restructuring charges over the next few quarters is expected to be related to real estate consolidation.","Our review demonstrated that our strategy of being a relationship-based commercial bank, with a unique geographic footprint, strong industry expertise and superior risk culture positions Comerica for short and long-term success. Specifically, our footprint is well-situated as it provides diversity and significant growth opportunities within our dependencies that make each market valuable to our entire portfolio.","Finally, I along with our executive team, own this initiative and we are committed to providing quarterly updates on our progress. We will hold ourselves accountable to achieving our goal of improved profitability. And as you know, our compensation is well-aligned with our shareholders as it is tied to the Bank's financial results and the stock's performance.","Comerica along with the industry has been managing through a difficult environment with prolonged low interest rates, slow economic growth as well as rising technology and regulatory costs. Over the last several years, we have been diligently working to reduce cost by judiciously renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing our real estate exposure and rationalizing operations.","While these efforts were effective and meaningful in their own right, we recognize that we need to do more to meet the mounting challenges, which is why we launched this transformation initiative. As I have indicated previously, our board and management team are committed to evaluating all opportunities to enhance shareholder value, and doing what is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. If there are strategic alternatives that are realistic, achievable and will maximize shareholder value, they will be fully considered. We know we must earn our right to remain independent. That said, we are doing what is within our control to proactively position ourselves as a stronger, more competitive and profitable organization.","Turning to slide four, and a closer look at the financial targets, our initial analysis has identified that we can drive approximately $140 million in additional annual pre-tax income by the end of 2017, and $230 million in the run rate by the end of 2018. Approximately, 30% or $70 million is associated with revenue enhancements. The expense savings of $160 million represents nearly 9% of fiscal year 2015 expenses.","Looking at our efficiency ratio, you may recall that our 2015 efficiency ratio of 67% was impacted by a change in accounting presentation for a card program that added over two percentage points, but had no impact to our bottom line. Without any increase in rates, we believe the actions we are taking will drive our efficiency ratio to the low-60%s by the end of 2017, and at\/or below 60% by year-end 2018.","By adding on an expected 200 basis points to our ROE, these revenue and expense actions take us a long way towards achieving a double-digit return on equity. While we are focused on implementing these actions, management continues to identify further opportunities, which will assist us in reaching a double-digit return on equity.","On a pro forma basis, the initial actions are expected to drive our ROE well-above the 2015 peer average. I firmly believe that as we deliver on this plan, we will increase shareholder value, and achieve the level of returns that our shareholders deserve.","Turning to slide five, we have outlined some of the key actions identified to-date that we are undertaking. Of note, this does not include business growth in the normal course, and we expect the initiative to drive further run rate benefits beyond 2018. Our planned revenue enhancements, which equal approximately $30 million through 2017, and $70 million by year-end 2018, include increasing the customer penetration of our products and services, and accelerating growth in middle market banking. To this end, on customer penetration, we are expanding product offerings, enhancing sales tools and training as well as realigning employee incentives.","In addition, we recently began using improved customer analytics to identify opportunities, which should increase cross-sell products per customer relationship. We also have simplified leadership in both Wealth Management and Treasury Management to support speed, simplicity and agility in taking action, as well as bring renewed vigor and focus to both areas.","On the next slide, I will discuss the Treasury Management initiatives in more detail. As you know, Middle Market banking is our largest business line, but has been slow-growing in this economic cycle. In order to help drive growth in this segment, we have formed a team to create a national standardized process for sales, training and performance management. We expect this will leverage best practices across our geographies. Of course, our well-regarded approach to local relationship management will not change.","Turning to the expense reductions, we currently expect $110 million in annual run rate cost savings by year-end 2017, and $160 million in total by year-end 2018. Over the next year, we plan to reduce our total workforce by approximately 9%. We are eliminating management layers in order to get closer to our customers, and accelerate decision-making. This includes consolidating functions and responsibilities, while taking care to ensure we maintain our high standards for customer service and deep expertise and experience. While many of these actions are difficult, particularly for our employees, we must be proactive to overcome the challenges of the continuing low-rate environment. This is not an easy process, and we're being thoughtful and deliberate in our approach.","In addition, we will increase capacity by obtaining better productivity in core operations through automation. Streamlining our credit process is a great example. Through further centralization and digitalization of our credit process from application to approval to documentation, we will enhance data collection and analysis, shorten the duration of the process, allowing for us for an improved customer experience. That said, as we execute this process, we will not compromise our strong credit culture.","We will enhance our technology capabilities, while reducing our overall spend by optimizing our infrastructure and substantially reducing the number of IT applications across the Bank. In doing so, we will continue to make technology advances, such as enhancing our fraud protection capabilities, expanding online and mobile capabilities for customers, elevating the quality of that data and information management, and further modernizing our suite of customer-focused technology.","Regarding our footprint, with the advancement of technology and broader application of alternative work arrangements, we need less real estate to operate our business. Therefore, we expect to reduce office and operation space, as well as consolidate approximately 40 banking centers or about 8% of our total network over the next year or so. These actions are in line with industry trends as an increasing number of customers prefer to utilize alternative delivery channels, such as mobile banking.","Turning to slide six, an additional detail on our opportunities in Treasury Management, which is a meaningful contributor to our revenue initiative. While our Treasury Management product offering is robust and part of our high-caliber commercial banking franchise, we believe we can increase revenue through three opportunities.","First, within our existing customer base, we intend to increase our share of wallet. Naturally, this has always been a goal for us, but through the focus on selling new products at higher margins, and a new data-driven assessment tool, we are aiming to make significant progress in identifying new opportunities. We have already had success with the pilot program using this analytical tool in our California market, and we began rolling it out to all of our markets in June.","Secondly, we are realigning sales channels to increase efficiency and productivity. This includes further utilizing mobile applications to deliver and document services even faster than we do today. In addition recalibrating our customer service coverage, we are ensuring our most valuable clients receive dedicated resources.","Finally, another major contributor is expected to be our Merchant Services offering. Through our recent partnership with an industry-leader, we have expanded our product suite and have increased our client penetration by 5%. This has resulted in tremendous growth with revenue more than doubling since second quarter of 2015. We are gaining momentum and the prospects are vast with more than 20,000 of our clients currently processing with other vendors.","In summary, we are implementing meaningful changes that we expect will allow us to operate more efficiently, and lower expenses as well as increase revenue. And while rising rates can be a significant benefit to us, we are neither waiting nor relying on that to drive improved returns. We believe this initiative will drive enhanced value for our shareholders through increased profitability.","Now, turning to our second quarter results on slide seven. Our overall results were solid, and reflect the underlying resilience of our business model. Second quarter 2016 net income of $104 million or $0.58 per share included after-tax restructuring charges of $34 million or $0.19 per share.","Slide eight provides further detail on our results. Average loans increased $1.1 billion or 2% to $49.5 billion. We saw growth in Commercial Real Estate, Mortgage Banker Finance and National Dealer Services partially offset by the expected decrease in Energy. The increase in Commercial Real Estate is driven by well-structured attractive opportunities with existing customers. This includes a mix of drawdowns on construction commitments, and term loans on stabilized properties.","Our average total deposits declined slightly to $56.5 billion. Non-interest bearing deposits grew over 1%, but were offset by a decline in interest-bearing deposits as we continued to maintain our pricing discipline.","Net interest income declined $2 million to $445 million. The benefit from loan growth was offset by non-accrual loan activity; and an adjustment to the residual value of a lease. We had slightly higher funding costs due to an increase in wholesale debt to opportunistically pre-fund an upcoming debt maturity and support loan growth.","Overall, credit quality was solid and reflects declines in criticized and non-accrual loans as well as net charge-offs. This was a result of the improved credit performance of our Energy portfolio. Energy loans have declined $356 million or 11%, and commitments have declined over $600 million or nearly 11% since the end of the first quarter as our customers continue to take the necessary actions to reduce their bank debt.","We have completed 88% of the spring redeterminations of our E&P customers, and borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average. Criticized Energy loans have declined $281 million as of the end of second quarter.","Energy charge-offs remain manageable and declined from the first quarter. While the performance of this portfolio has improved, and oil and gas prices have increased since the first quarter, we remain cautious and believe we are adequately reserved with our reserve allocation at over 8% of Energy loans as of June 30.","Non-interest income increased $23 million with growth in nearly all customer-driven categories. The largest increases were in card fees, fiduciary income, customer derivative income and commercial lending fees. In addition, results benefited from a $10 million swing in deferred comp, which is offset in expenses. We continue to tightly manage expenses. Non-interest expenses include the $53 million restructuring charge that I just discussed. Excluding this, expenses increased $6 million.","Our capital position remains solid. As far as our second quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, revenue is up over 5%. This reflects the benefit from the increase in short-term rates, as well as growth in fee income as we continue to drive for deeper customer relationships.","Expenses were impacted by the $53 million in restructuring charges we incurred this year, as well as the net release of litigation reserves of $30 million in the second quarter of 2015. Putting these two items aside, you can see that expenses have been very well-managed.","And now, I will turn the call over to Dave, who will go over the quarter in more detail.","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide nine, as Ralph mentioned, second quarter average loans increased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter, including a $356 million decline in Energy loan. We continue to see solid growth in our Commercial Real Estate business with construction draws and term loans primarily with existing customers.","The projects, predominantly multifamily in primary markets within California and Texas with proven developers have favorable credit profiles that include significant equity content as we continue to be cautious and selective. Also, auto inventories are seasonally high, resulting in increased line utilization in our National Dealer business.","Finally, summer home sales combined with the decline in mortgage rates made June a record month in our 50-year history in the Mortgage Banking business. Likewise, quarter-end loans were up $1 billion over the first quarter, with all the same drivers.","As of June 30, increased commitments in Mortgage Banker, Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer were offset by the large decline in Energy. Line utilization increased 1.5 percentage points to 53%, mostly driven by the seasonal increases in Mortgage Banker and National Dealer, and our strong pipeline increased further.","Although interest earned on loans was unchanged quarter-over-quarter, our second quarter loan yield decreased seven basis points. The benefit from loan growth was offset by a decline in interest recoveries on non-accrual loans, a full-quarter impact from the increase in non-accrual loans in the first quarter and a lease residual valuation adjustment.","Turning to slide 10, average deposits were basically stable quarter-over-quarter. We had typical seasonal growth in both interest-bearing and non-interest bearing Retail Banking deposits. This was offset by a decline in commercial deposits, primarily due to seasonal weakness in municipalities and our relationship banking strategy and purposeful pricing in large corporate.","Our deposit costs remain stable at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing. We are closely monitoring our deposit base, as well as the market, and we believe we are well-positioned with predominantly operational relationship-oriented deposits.","Turning to slide 11, we maintained our securities book at about $12.5 billion. The estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about three years, and the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it to modestly to 3.9 years.","In the current environment, we expect to see prepays increase moderately from $490 million in the second quarter to this $550 million to $650 million range in the third quarter. The minor pressure we saw in our security portfolio yield may increase slightly due to reinvestment of larger monthly prepays at a lower rate.","To help combat this, we are selectively purchasing securities with modestly longer duration. For example, a couple weeks ago, we were able to place $100 million Ginnie Mae purchase at 1.68%, which had a duration of about 18 months longer than the current portfolio average, but had similar extension risk. As of quarter-end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus a buffer.","Turning to slide 12. Net interest income declined $2 million, while the net interest margin decreased seven basis points. As I discussed earlier, all loan-related impacts netted to zero, but had a four basis points negative effect on the margin. The benefit from loan growth was offset by the previously-mentioned non-accrual activity, a lease residual valuation adjustment, as well as slightly lower accretion.","Wholesale funding costs increased $3 million as we added $2.8 billion in FHLB loans at very attractive terms to prefund a $650 million November debt maturity, as well as support loan growth. This was partly offset by income earned on higher balances at the Fed.","Turning to slide 13, our overall credit picture remains strong and performance of our Energy portfolio improved in the second quarter. Our allowance for credit losses increased $2 million to $772 million, and our allowance for loan ratio was 1.45%.","Total criticized loans declined $377 million to $3.6 billion or only 7% of total loans at quarter end. Non-accrual loans decreased $76 million, and net charge-offs declined to 38 basis points or $47 million. Energy accounted for over two-thirds of the net charge-offs, and total net charge-offs for all our business lines combined was only 13 basis points.","As far as our Energy portfolio, outstandings declined 11% to $2.7 billion at quarter end, and now comprises 5.4% of our total loans. E&P loans make up 70% of our Energy portfolio. And as Ralph mentioned, the spring redetermination process is nearly complete. So far, borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average, and the number of efficiencies has been relatively stable since last quarter. Energy services has been significantly impacted this cycle, yet loan outstandings declined 15% to $363 million, and now comprise less than 1% of our total loan portfolio.","Total criticized Energy loans decreased $281 million due to decline in outstandings and a small number of risk rating upgrades as our customers have reduced expenses, sold assets, and tap the capital markets.","Also noteworthy is that, 100% of these non-accrual loans are fully current on interest payments, including the nine loans we have in bankruptcy. The reserve for Energy loans is over 8%. And remember, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. Further detail on our Energy portfolio can be found in the appendix.","Slide 14 outlines non-interest income. We had broad-based growth, with total customer-driven fees increasing 5% over the first quarter. Our cross-sell efforts have helped drive increases in card fees and fiduciary income. Customer-derivative income saw robust activity in conjunction with the Brexit vote and commercial lending fees grew with a pickup and syndication activity following a first-quarter low.","Foreign exchange and brokerage fees were also low. In addition, we had a $10 million increase in deferred compensation which is included in other non-interest income, and is offset in non-interest expense.","Turning to slide 15. Aside from the $53 million restructuring charge, Ralph, discussed, non-interest expenses increased $6 million. This included the $10 million increase in deferred compensation, which was partly offset by an $8 million gain on the sale of leased assets. The remaining increase was due to higher outside processing and advertising expense, which is connected to our revenue growth along with higher FDIC insurance premiums.","Salaries and benefits was down $1 million. The increase in deferred compensation, as well as annual merit, seasonal 401k contributions, as well as slightly higher incentive comp, which is related to revenue growth, were offset by decreases in share-based comp and payroll taxes following seasonally high expense in the first quarter.","Moving to slide 16 and capital management. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way. We completed our 2015 capital plan, which included equity purchases, repurchases of $290 million under our equity repurchase program over the five quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares and increased the dividend 5% to $0.22 per share. Our 2016 capital plan includes share repurchases up to $440 million.","The pace of our buyback will be dependent on balance sheet movements in our financial performance, which can be impacted by market factors, particularly interest rates. The plan also includes a further increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, which will be considered by the board at the end of this month. Our tangible book value per share increased to $40.52, and has been steadily increasing over the past several years as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value.","Turning to slide 17. While the outlook for a rate increase continues to fluctuate daily, I'll remind you that our balance sheet is well-positioned to benefit from an increase in rates. The benefit to full-year 2016 net interest income from the rate rise that occurred in December is expected to be about $90 million, assuming deposit pricing continues to remain stable.","The table on this slide gives some estimated additional upside to net interest income over the annual period following a rate rise. For example, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move with that rate rise at a 25% beta, we believe, we would gain above $70 million more in annualized net interest income.","Of course, deposit pricing in only one assumption in our interest rate sensitivity modeling. Other key variables include loan and deposit behavior in a rising rate environment. Our standard modeling in the list of assumptions we use are included in the appendix.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Ralph.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Dave. Turning to slide 18 in our outlook for the full-year 2016 relative to 2015, we have not changed our outlook for loans. We expect our average loan growth to be in line with U.S. GDP growth. We expect to see the typical third quarter seasonal declines in Dealer, Mortgage Banker and general Middle Market to be followed by a rebound in the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate the decline in Energy outstandings to continue, but perhaps at a more moderate pace than we saw in the second quarter.","Our expectations for net interest income also have not changed. As far as credit, we expect continued solid credit quality with metrics absent Energy to remain better than historical norms, with a significant reserve build we established in the first quarter if the Energy outlook remains stable, we would expect the provision for the rest of the year to reflect net charge-offs between 35 basis points and 45 basis points. This is a modest reduction from the outlook we provided last quarter as a result of better than anticipated performance of our Energy portfolio including the spring redeterminations, and decline in loan balances.","Movements in the Energy reserve from here will depend on many factors; the biggest being oil and gas prices, as well as Energy customers continuing ability to cut costs, raise equity, sell assets and reduce debt. Our expectations for non-interest income have not changed. Of note, as I mentioned earlier, we have begun to implement initiatives to drive more fee income, and we expect we will start to see results early next year.","We have also updated our non-interest expense outlook, which now includes total restructuring expenses of approximately $90 million to $110 million for the year. Partially offsetting this will be savings derived from GEAR Up of about $20 million to be achieved primarily in the fourth quarter. Expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half are impacted by two more days, the full impact of merit increases and an expected increase in the FDIC expense as a result of the surcharge.","Finally, outside processing expenses are expected to continue to grow with increased card revenue. Our tax rate for full-year 2016 is now about 30%, which is a reduction from our prior guidance as a result of the impact from the restructuring charges.","In closing, Comerica is dedicated to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting client relationship. We operate Comerica for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, and all of our actions are directed to maximize value, while not compromising our commitment to our clients, the communities we serve, regulatory standing and a strong risk management.","As I previously stated through GEAR Up, I am confident that we can enhance shareholder returns through improved financial performance.","And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, Ralph. Just on the cost program, I just want to make sure we understand, when you're talking about getting to some of these targets by the end of 2017, end of 2018, that's a fourth quarter run rate type of comment as opposed to full-year? Just making sure everyone understands that the right way.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, it is.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So, the way to think of it is, kind of a gradual build in, or will there be kind of lumpiness that you expect? Or these things kind of come in ratably over time?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It will be gradual over time.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And, Ralph, also my follow-up is just there's been a lot of change in the management team over the last couple of quarters or so. And I just wonder, if you could just talk to culture in the executive suites, what this program means to that underneath, and how that also just builds into your bigger picture strategic thinking?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The executive suite is, as I mentioned earlier, fully involved in this project and fully supportive in moving it along. And we are very consistent in doing it along with the culture we have, which will not change, especially that relationship orientation to our customer base.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, Ralph.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Please go ahead.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey. Good morning.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So, with the improvement in the net charge-off outlook in the back-half of the year, is it really just Energy that's driven that reduction or are there other factors in there as well?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's continued strong performance of the whole portfolio, and Energy has been, what I would call, a highlight here, in that it has gotten better, quicker than we expected. Pricing is part of that, that has gone up. Pete, do you want to add anything to that?","Peter W. Guilfoile - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Bob. Obviously, Energy is the big story this quarter with the big reduction that we had in the portfolio and reduction in the criticized there, but the rest of the portfolio is really performing well.","We only had 13 basis points of charge-offs ex-Energy and our criticized ex-Energy is down to about 4.2%. So, if you look at those numbers, those are extraordinary strong numbers for this late in the cycle. So, the rest of the portfolio is performing very well.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. Do you have handy, the amount of provision-related just to the Energy book in the first half of the year? You may have given it, but I don't have the number handy.","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sorry, Bob. Say again?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Energy provision for the first half of the year.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yes.","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The Energy provision for the first half of the year?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. You don't have that with you?","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. All right. Not to worry. Thank you very much. I appreciate the time.","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Ralph, I wanted to start, looking at the timing of the $160 million of cost saves. Can you give color on why it will take until 4Q 2018 to deliver on those, which is essentially about a year-and-a-half?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It is part of the process, and we always will be looking for appropriate opportunities to speed up. But the key was to look at it from the standpoint that a reasonable, attainable time period is there. In addition, I would underline that, we are looking for other opportunities as well. The process hasn't stopped here, and we're moving forward with that also. Dave, you want to add anything to that?","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The only thing I would add, Steve, is that, on the real estate that Ralph mentioned, clearly the banking centers, we have an excellent line of sight on that. The operational and corporate real estate is under study. Keep in mind, this whole program is only 120 days since its launch.","While we have built in estimates, we have targeted certain facilities; the amount of time it will take to plan and exit or downsize those facilities requires that additional runway, as well as some of our information technology. The applications consolidation process is extremely complex. We're working through that, and it will take time, and we're going to do it correctly.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Is reducing the level of asset sensitivity part of this plan?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It is not. I will make clear that we look at that on a weekly basis. But it is not part of this GEAR Up strategy.","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And we have not substantially changed it.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have not, right.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just finally, Ralph, as you did this review. Is it possible for this company to get to a double-digit ROE over time without help from rates? Thanks.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We think we're going to get as we said earlier, this puts us close to double-digit. And as I mentioned, we're still going down the road on the process and looking for other opportunities to help us go forward to our goal.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for all the color.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Scott.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Morning, guys. Ralph, I was hoping, you could just perhaps expand a bit on your thoughts on \u2013 kind of what makes such a substantial reduction in costs appropriate for you guys. And I guess the context in which I asked that is, one, I've never really perceived Comerica as having a cost program per se. It's been more revenues that have been depressed due to the low-rate environment.","And then second, other guys who have announced cost programs have really had a hard time seeing the gross amount fall to the bottom line without the need to reinvest a substantial portion of the savings into things like mobile offering, digital, et cetera. So, as you guys went through the program, what in your mind made such a large cost reduction kind of the appropriate way to go?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As we go through the program, and as you mentioned, it has been a long time since we went through a comprehensive program like this. We did do it back in the mid-1990s. And a lot of our team had experience from that experience, and understanding that over time, things get built in that you need to stop and relook at and challenge.","And that's one of the reasons that we did it. And we had a partner helping us with laying things out as to what others were doing, and we compared with that. But all decisions were made by our management team because the very important thing to us is our culture and our relationship approach to our customers in all the markets that we serve.","And the things that we found are things that over time tend to creep in, and we're going at those with full support, as I mentioned earlier, of the management team and our people down in the various business lines.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. That's perfect. Thank you. And maybe as a quick follow-up, as you think about sort of the normal course of business, just given that there'll presumably be a lot of disruption with the head count reduction, for example, can you speak to sort of thoughts on what controls will be in place to \u2013 just to make sure there's not too much disruption in the normal course of business while you undergo the plan?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One of the most important things that we do and have already started to do is communicate very openly down through our organization. And these changes are not taken lightly. We're deeply committed to helping our employees through this transition, and will do so with the utmost dignity and respect. And that communication and approaching it as a total team is what I believe will really bring the success of the total approach.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, David.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Maybe just following-up on the last one. Just to be clear, are you assuming any kind of headwinds to loan growth or other revenue items associated with implementing the cost plan?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We will do our forecast and budgets as was mentioned earlier, as we always do, this will be incremental to that approach. And so, we will evaluate the plan as we do from the standpoint, and as Dave, and I were talking earlier as to where the economy is, and what our appropriate expectations to drive that growth on top of the growth from the GEAR Up strategy. David, you want to...","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","So that's \u2013 go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I was going to say, Dave, you want to add anything?","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As we looked out over the next two years, we really looked at using very conservative assumptions. We have the loan growth remaining very similar to this year, in line with G&P. We assume that G&P (44:05) would remain at 2%, as an example.","We've built in continued, albeit, declining NIM pressure from loans. We know we're going to continue to have yield pressure coming from that securities portfolio, as I mentioned earlier. And quite frankly, we know we have ongoing headwinds with expenses. Ralph already mentioned, the FDIC surcharge as an example, ongoing merit, the challenges of the technology implementation and building in the costs associated with that.","So, we have attempted to take a very realistic, very conservative approach in this walk, in terms of our normal income over the next two-and-a-half-year period.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","And can you give us any color \u2013 I mean, so is that basically a modest amount of core earnings growth, and then layering in the $230 million of pre-tax improvement on top of that?","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's an appropriate way to look at it, yes.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, can you give any color regarding CCAR, and basically, the threshold for the use of the approved buyback, what kind of rate environment we needed to use the entire amount, or what kind of a good baseline assumption if we kind of see no more rate? How do you \u2013 is there any way to kind of frame the sensitivities of what we're likely to see there?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dave?","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it's very difficult to give you any kind of an accurate statement on that sitting here, today. Clearly, as we've said that the $440 million is going to be looking at financial performance. I would submit to you that, if we can continue to see the continuing stable, if not, yet improving prices in oil, that certainly takes a lot of pressure off the provision going forward over the course of the next four quarters. That could in essence help offset the headwind if there's a complete lack of rise in interest rates.","So, quite frankly, my view is we're going to continue to do this as expeditiously as possible, recognizing all the constituencies that are in play here, whether it's the shareholders or our regulators. We need to make sure we're balanced in our approach.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the \u2013 you indicated that you were reviewing further opportunities to improve returns further out 2017 and after. What is left to do beyond that in terms of \u2013 I mean, does it include levering up the balance sheet ultimately? Is that something you're considering that you're alluding to here or exiting certain markets or anything, like, what is left that will drive an incremental upside opportunity for you beyond what you've already announced? Thanks.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We are not looking at leaving markets that we're in or changing the basic model that we use every day. Dave, you want to talk about some of the...","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. As I mentioned on the corporate real estate, our office space, we have built in very little in terms of savings assumptions. We have built in the cost to exit. And quite frankly, we still do not yet have complete clarity on the reinvestment it's going to take to reposition office space to be much more, I think, in line with today's open office space environment. We're still studying that. We have also been extremely conservative on our assumptions in terms of the benefits, the savings from our information technology investment.","We're looking at that benefit to help drive the efficiency in credit, help drive efficiency in other operational areas as, Ralph, spoke to you, the whole digitalization effort. But what we haven't built in is any real significant amount of savings. We do think they're there. We need more time to study. I think we'll have a clear line of sight on a number of those as we get to the end of the third quarter and report out with Q3.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. So, based on that, none of this really incorporates any plan to lever up the balance sheet anyway?","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. All right. And then lastly, Ralph, I know you mentioned earlier on the call that you would weigh everything when it comes to looking at strategic alternatives, and you indicated that if it is, I believe, indicated meaningful and realistic importantly, how do you define that? How do you define what's realistic? And then what situation, what economic and the financial situation, would you think that it would make sense to pursue a sale of the Bank? Thanks.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What you have to look at is the long-term return to the shareholder. And we evaluate that looking at current markets and what's happening, what's going on, and that is a discussion topic that's looked at, often including with the board and appropriate discussions are taking place. We have a focus on doing the right thing for our shareholders.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Could you talk about the economic dynamics you're seeing in Texas outside your Energy portfolio right now? I guess, your loans are flattish this quarter from the prior-quarter and specifically what you're seeing in the Houston market versus Dallas?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Curt, you want to take that?","Curtis Chatman Farmer - President","Yeah. I would say that, overall from a Texas perspective, as we've said in the prior calls, it really is a scenario where you sort of draw a line down the middle of the state. There are really two economic factors at play or two economies at play. The Northern Texas market continues to be more diverse, more robust from a growth perspective with still net new jobs being added, much more diverse economy overall, less Energy dependency. And we are seeing still good opportunities really across all of our lines of business, Middle Market, Small Business, Commercial Real Estate, et cetera.","When you look at the Houston market, certainly more impact from Energy overall, and Energy-related exposure. We continue to be a little bit more cautious there in terms of new originations, but really have not seen a lot of deterioration outside of Energy in that portfolio.","We continue to watch CRE, but have not seen a lot of deterioration there either, and so, in balance, the Texas economy, much more diverse than it was during the last Energy cycle. About 15% of the economy overall is Energy-dependent right now. And I would say that, we continue to see opportunities in Northern Texas a little bit less so in Southern Texas.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You might comment on, our economist and his view, slightly negative at the moment for this year, but he sees a rebound next year, not completely back to the U.S. number, but just underlying what Curt said, too, and Pete, you may want to chime in here. We've seen good resiliency in real estate, and all of the various areas where we lend, and have business in Houston.","Peter W. Guilfoile - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. As Curt mentioned, we've seen just a little bit of migration in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio, but nothing significant. Rents are down about between 10% and 15%. We've stressed that portfolio up to 40% decline in rents average. Stress has been about 27%, and we don't see any losses there.","And then the rest of the book outside of Commercial Real Estate, Middle Market, Small Business holding up exceptionally well. Zero charge-offs in Houston this quarter. So, credit quality remains very strong.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The other thing I'd point out on the economist side is, when you look at where our GDP is with \u2013 and expected to be in California and Michigan, both are expected to exceed the U.S. projection. So, it's good from the footprint, and how we have the counterbalance when there's ups and downs in various areas.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just in terms of the GEAR Up, like what is \u2013 what's the constricting factor? Let's say, you don't get the revenue growth you assume, is the efficiency ratio kind of the end-all, be-all; that by the end of 2018, no matter what happens, we should expect a 60% efficiency ratio? Or is getting to the expense savings revenue targets more important that the efficiency ratio on a net basis?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dave?","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They're both important. Obviously, one will drive the other. Again, we continue to look for more opportunities. We fully expect we can implement on both the revenue and the expense save. And quite frankly at this point, we're comfortable with our trajectory.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. I guess the reason I asked is, because we've seen in the past other companies announce big expense cut programs, and they achieve it all, and their efficiency ratio may or may not go down as much. I'm sure, I'm confident that you guys can achieve both, but I guess, what I'm asking, if there was a number at the very end of the day, that you'll hold yourself to, which one would it be?","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I guess, in my opinion, I'm more focused on achieving the revenue and expense. The efficiency number is the efficiency number. As I said, as we built the walk to get us to that, the approximate 60% or below 60% by the end of 2018, we were incredibly conservative, we believe in building that walk. And then of course, the GEAR Up initiatives on top of that; and again, let me emphasize, we're not done yet with what we're looking to do with GEAR Up.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just another question, on slide nine, you talked about the lower loan yields down seven basis points. Just want to be really clear, is that a \u2013 sort of an usually \u2013 sort of a one-time negative in terms of the non-accruals, and the other lease residual value adjustments or is this a sort of a more of a stable loan yield run rate? Thanks.","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, there's two pieces to it that \u2013 certainly, the non-accrual in terms of the loans that went into non-accrual at the end of the first quarter, which were fully current on interest when they were placed on non-accrual, that will remain in the run rate. And by the way, those loans remain fully current on interest. Obviously, the interest is being applied to principal.","Having said that, we did also though have that lease residual adjustment of $2 million. And then on top of that, we also had a surprisingly high amount of interest recovery in the first quarter on non-accrual loans. This quarter is much more normal, much more average.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got you. Okay. Thank you. That helps.","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Brett.","Brett D. Rabatin - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Good morning, Ralph. Wanted just to, first, go back to the expense reduction from a perspective of your reducing workforce, 9%. Can you talk about how you're going to make sure that you don't lose relationships and revenues or function of that, and may be how much of the workforces is front-facing versus back-office and that sort of thing?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Curt, why don't you give an example of how you've been going through that (57:07)?","Curtis Chatman Farmer - President","Sure. Yeah, Brett, we are very focused on making sure that we're minimizing any impact to customers, and certainly to employees who are directly involved in generating revenue. One overall sort of arching theme for us is, trying to make sure that we're getting the leadership even closer to clients","And so over time, as most of the organizations do, we've had a tendency to build up sort of our leadership ranks, and we've been looking for opportunities to increase spans of control and look for some consolidation from a management standpoint, while minimizing impact to employees who are directly interfacing with customers sort of day-in and day-out.","I'd also say that, the second part of this, and part of the theme around revenue is making sure we've got the right sort of customer delivery mechanism, and employees aligned against the greatest opportunities that we might have.","And so we've been looking at opportunities to centralize some lower value services that we provide for customers and centralize some smaller accounts that could be handled more in a call center format so that our highest-valued customers and our most skilled employees are aligned against the greatest opportunity in the market.","Brett D. Rabatin - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And then these 40 offices you're closing, can you maybe give a little more color on which markets \u2013 is there one that's more affected than the others or maybe a little more color on the locations of these?","Curtis Chatman Farmer - President","No, they are spread out amongst all of our geographies. So, there's not a concentration in any single market. And we've tried to look at opportunities as you'd expect where we've got offices close by to each other, and minimize any impact from a consolidation standpoint.","Just like the whole industry, the trend for us had been down in terms of transaction volume. And so, this is a natural sort of pruning process that we felt like we could accelerate and take a larger tranche of banking centers out at this time, but we are not anticipating a great impact to our customer base.","Brett D. Rabatin - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Curtis Chatman Farmer - President","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Terry.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I guess, as you think about the revenue enhancements and deepening customer relationships, is there a specific region that's lagging the company as a whole? And then, as I look at the line of business, is most of the upside going to come in that general Middle Market or should we see this plan have an impact in, say, Small Business, Corporate Banking, et cetera?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Curt, do you want to talk about that?","Curtis Chatman Farmer - President","Yeah. There's not a specific region that I would say that we are more focused on than others. Certainly, we are newer still from a great perspective in California and Texas than we are in Michigan where we have number two deposit market share. Having said that, we are looking broadly across the company at all markets and all markets are important to us from a growth perspective.","The focus really is around what I'd call sort of core Middle Market and Small Business. But there'll be learning opportunities that we can apply across all of our businesses around data analytics, customer assessment type tools that we're going to utilize, we're looking at training, iComp (01:00:51) or incentive compensation, et cetera, to make sure we've got the right sort of tools, training, motivations for our team out in the field, but primary focus on Middle Market and Small Business across all the geographies.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Then just a \u2013 I'm sorry.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I'm just going to say, and as I mentioned earlier, the tests that have been \u2013 being done in those areas have come out very positive.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks, Ralph. And then just as a follow-up, the $800 million increase in loans and other markets, could you just talk about, is that where some of the Dealer finance or the Mortgage Banker Finance comes through or is that maybe out-of-market CRE?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It is not out of market CRE. It is the Dealer and the Mortgage Banker, which are national footprints.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thanks for clearing that up. Thank you.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jack.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning. Going maybe a little bit different direction, talking about loan growth, your seasonal businesses, the Mortgage Banker and the auto finance, I guess the simplest way to ask the question; is your customer base growing faster than your outstandings or vice versa? And if you could put any numbers around that, just trying to figure out, if you're taking share and how to think about that business if volume, in say, auto sales slows or declines, that sort of thing?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Curt?","Curtis Chatman Farmer - President","Yeah. I would say in both of those businesses, both of which we've been in for a very long, long time and the Mortgage Banker Finance business, we've been at that business for 50 years, and the Dealer business for probably 65 years. And we've got, I think a great customer base with continued great opportunities from a cross-sell perspective. For example, in the Dealer business, there continues to be roll-ups occurring and M&A activity across that industry which provides additional opportunities for us. The majority of the growth is coming from our existing client base. But in both spaces, we continue to have opportunities to selectively add new clients that are well-priced and well-cross-sold.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you. And then you've been in Tech and Life Sciences, for I guess, over 20 years. If the IPO drought there continues as valuations come in further, how does that portfolio \u2013 what are the puts and takes in the movement in that portfolio? How did that react back in the 2000s? Any color you can help us with there?","Ralph W. Babb - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dave?","David E. Duprey - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. The book that we have today is so much different than it was back in 2000; it'd be hard to make the same comparison. Back in 2000, you had so much of it was in the Internet vertical. And today, that portfolio is so much better diversified. There's a lot of different verticals within the Tech sector. And then also, we have more on the Life Science side today than we had back in 2000. So, I don't think it would react as harshly as the industry did back in 2000, when the Tech sector went down. We feel the portfolio is pretty balanced and it's by design that we have it that way.","And then the other aspect of it that is different from 2000 is Equity Fund Services is now 40% of our outstandings there, and Equity Fund Services, as you know, is a very well-secured portfolio of capital call and subscription lines.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. Good morning and welcome to Comerica's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curt Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, Muneera Carr; and Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile.","During this presentation, we will be referring to slides that provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC's website as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website comerica.com.","This conference call contains forward-looking statements and in that regard you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement in today's release and slide two which I incorporate into this call as well as our SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ.","Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures and in that regard I direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph who will begin on slide three.","Ralph Babb","Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Today we reported fourth quarter earnings of $310 million or $1.88 per share. Excluding restructuring charges, earnings per share was $1.95. Our results reflected continued, careful management of loan and deposit pricing as well as expense control.","In addition, our credit metrics remained strong and we repurchased 6.3 million shares. Altogether, this drove an ROE of over 16% and an ROA of 1.74% for the quarter.","As far as full-year 2018 earnings per share, increased 74% to $7.20. A major contributor was our ability to drive revenue growth as we skillfully navigated the rising rate environment. In addition, we produced strong credit quality, successfully executed our GEAR Up initiatives and meaningfully reduced excess capital. We also benefited from a lower tax rate due to tax reform.","On slide four, we have provided details on the adjustments related to certain items. This includes restructuring charges related to our GEAR Up initiatives. Of note, there will be no further restructuring charges pertaining to this program.","Also, as you may recall, in the third quarter we realized $23 million in discrete tax benefits primarily related to the 2017 tax reform law. The bulk of the proceeds were used to reposition a portion of our securities portfolio which was shown as a loss on the securities sold.","Turning to slide five and our full-year 2018 results, growth in net interest income of 14% helped drive revenue to an all-time high. This growth combined with the execution of our GEAR Up initiatives resulted in an efficiency ratio of under 54%. Our provision benefited from strong credit quality with 11 basis points of net charge-offs and the continued decline in criticized and non-accrual loans.","Our pretax net income grew to $1.5 billion, a 24% increase over 2017. In addition, earnings per share benefited from our active capital management and a lower tax rate. In summary, we achieved strong net income and earnings per share as well as substantially higher returns with an ROE of nearly 16% and an ROA of 1.75%.","Slide six provides an overview of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter average loans increased $248 million from the third quarter, a seasonal increase in National Dealer Services was mostly offset by the typical fourth quarter decline in Mortgage Banker. Overall, recent trends are positive with loan growth in December particularly strong and total loan commitments at period end of nearly $1.3 billion.","Average deposits were relatively stable. With rates rising, deposit costs remained in line with our expectations as we continued to focus on our relationship approach to manage deposit pricing to attract and retain customers.","Net interest income increased with a net benefit from higher interest rates. Our net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 3.70%. We continued to have strong credit quality as evidenced by 9 basis points in net charge-offs. Excluding the loss on securities in the third quarter and a decline in returns on deferred compensation assets in the fourth quarter, non-interest income increased $6 million. The largest contributor was a $3 million increase in card fees.","Expenses benefited from lower deferred comp and FDIC surcharge. Also, we have maintained our expense discipline and our efficiency ratio continued to improve to just under 52%. We purchased 6.3 million shares and our estimated CET1 capital ratio decreased 56 basis points to 11.12%.","And now I will turn the call over to Muneera who will go over the quarter in more detail.","Muneera Carr","Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide seven, fourth quarter average loans increased $248 million compared to the third quarter with growth trending positive through the quarter. Our auto dealer portfolio increased $363 million as dealers took delivery of the 2019 models and we added and expanded customer relationships.","Average energy balances grew $220 million due to reduced capital market activity as well as higher loan demand due to expanded borrowing basis and increased CapEx. We continued to support our energy customers who are generally well-positioned to withstand recent price volatility as they have reduced leveraged annual cost base since the last downturn.","In addition, they are appropriately hedged. Average energy loans remained just below $2 billion or about 4% of our total loans.","We also drove loan growth in environmental services, entertainment and private banking. Partly offsetting this growth was a decline in Mortgage Banker following that summer home buying season. Also declining were corporate real estate, commercial real estate as well as technology and life sciences, particularly equity fund services which rebounded in December.","Total period-end loans were over $50 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion over the third quarter with growth in most business lines led by seasonal increase in dealer services. Loan commitments increased $1.3 billion to over $53 billion at period end with growth coming from almost all our business lines.","Utilization increased 100 basis points to 51.4%. Our loan yield increased 16 basis points. Higher short-term rates added 21 basis points. This was partly offset by a decrease in loan fees from an elevated third quarter level, which reduced the yield by 3 basis points.","In addition, other portfolio dynamics had a two basis points impact. This included growth in dealer loans which carry lower spreads as well as lower average yields on energy loans due to continued credit quality improvements.","As you can see on slide eight, average deposits were relatively stable in the fourth quarter with decreases in large corporate, retail banking, and technology and life sciences, mostly offset by the growth in general middle market and wealth management.","This modest decline is a departure from our typical fourth quarter increase in deposit. As rates drive and economic expansion continues, we are seeing customers funding growth, acquisitions and capital expenditures from their cash balances and somewhat choosing off-balance sheet offerings. Through our relationship banking model, we stay close to our customers and aim to provide the best solution to meet their financial goals.","As we expected, in conjunction with rising short-term rates, our deposits in rates increased 11 basis points as we remain focused on our relationship approach to manage deposit pricing. Slide nine provides detail on our securities portfolio.","The yield on the portfolio increased 18 basis points, which primarily reflects the repositioning of $1.3 billion of securities as we executed at the end of the third quarter. In addition, we were able to reinvest the $415 million in paydowns that we received in the quarter at an average yield of 3.67%.","Turning to slide 10, net interest income increased $15 million, which drove a 10 basis points increase in the net interest margin. Our loan book portfolio added $23 million and 12 basis points to the margin. Increased interest rates provided the largest benefit along with loan growth to a lesser degree. This was partly offset by a decline in loan fees and other portfolio dynamics that I previously discussed.","Deposits of the Fed added $1 million and 3 basis points, reflecting the benefit from the higher Fed funds rate on the moderately lower balance. Higher yield on our securities book added $5 million, including a $4 million from the portfolio repositioning. The total benefit to the margin was three basis points.","On the funding side, deposit costs rose with increased pay rate as well as a minor mix shift in balances, which together had an impact of $8 million or four basis points. The increase in short-term rates as well as the full quarter impact of the $850 million in senior debt we issued at the end of July added $6 million in wholesale funding costs which had a 4 basis points impact to the margin.","In summary, the net benefit from increased rates was $18 million or 11 basis points to the margin. Credit quality remained strong as shown on slide 11. Our net charge-off ratio was 9 basis points, gross charge-offs remained low at $21 million. Total criticized loans declined $122 million and now represents 3.1% of our total loans at quarter end. This included a decrease in non-accrual loans which comprised only 44 basis points of our total loans.","Energy criticized and non-accrual loans continued to decrease. Loan growth, partly offset by positive credit titration resulted in a small increase in the reserves and a reserve ratio of 1.34%. We remain vigilant, closely monitoring our portfolio for signs of strength. However, at this point we are not seeing any concerning trends.","Turning to slide 12, excluding the impact from the $20 million loss from securities incurred in the third quarter as well as a decline of $10 million in deferred comp which is offset in non-interest expenses, non-interest income increased $6 million.","Employer's customer activity, card fees increased $3 million and commercial lending fees, specifically syndication fees increased $2 million. Service charges on deposit accounts increased [ph] $2 million, which was impacted by one net business day in the third quarter. Expenses remained well controlled and our efficiency ratio dropped below 52% as shown on slide 13.","Excluding the $10 million decrease in deferred comp, salaries and benefits increased $6 million, mostly due to higher contract labor associated with technology project. FDIC expenses decreased $5 million with a discontinuation of the surcharge.","This was partly offset by minor increases in several line items such as equipment, other professional fees and occupancy expense. This is the final quarter for GEAR Up restructuring charges which were $14 million, an increase of $2 million from the third quarter. The benefits derived from our GEAR Up initiatives will continue into 2019 and thereafter.","We have achieved and in many respect surpassed the expectations for revenue enhancements and efficiency opportunities that we laid out for our GEAR Up initiatives when we first launched in mid-2016. This success is clearly evident in our efficiency and return metrics.","Turning to slide 14, in the fourth quarter we repurchased a record 6.3 million shares under our equity repurchase program, which equates to nearly 4% of our total shares. Together with dividends, we returned $599 million to shareholders.","Our estimated CET1 ratio declined to 11.12%. We are focused on reducing our robust capital ratios to a level that is reflective of our business strategy. Our goal is to move forward at a measured pace to reach a CET1 ratio of 9.5% to 10% by the end of 2019.","We will continue to give careful consideration to earnings generation, capital needs and market conditions as we determine the pace of the share buyback. Turning to slide 15, our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from increases in rates.","Approximately 90% of our loans are floating rate with the bulk tied to 30-day LIBOR. Also, we have a favorable deposit mix with the majority being non-interest bearing. Combine this with careful management of pricing and we have been able to drive cumulative loan beta of 89% and a cumulative deposit beta of 25% since the beginning of this rate cycle.","In conjunction with the December Fed action, we increased our standard deposit rates on select products. We believe average deposit costs will increase approximately 12 basis points to 15 basis points in the first quarter. We are closely monitoring our deposits as well as the market. In total, we estimate that the full year benefit of the 2018 rate increases alone will add approximately $130 million to $150 million to net interest income in 2019.","Of course, the outcome depends on a variety of factors such as LIBOR movement, deposit betas and balance sheet dynamics. Based on the Fed's dot plot, rates are expected to continue to increase, albeit at a slower pace. With recent market volatility, we continue to evaluate the appropriate time to begin moderating some of our asset sensitivity by adding hedges.","Our asset liability committee regularly assess acquisitions and determines the appropriate half given our balance sheet movement, our outlook for rates and the market prices for hedges. We don't believe a decline in short-term rates is imminent and expect to gradually layer in hedges over time.","Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph to provide an update on our outlook for 2019.","Ralph Babb","Thank you, Muneera. Assuming continuation of the current economic environment, we expect average loans to grow approximately 2% to 4% in 2019 relative to 2018. We anticipate growth in most business lines, which is supported by positive trends in December and the increasing commitments we have seen over the past three quarters.","We will maintain our relationship focus as well as loan pricing and credit discipline. Economic conditions are good, yet customers remain somewhat cautious given economic uncertainty, market volatility and lingering trade talks. As far as deposits, we expect the current trend to continue with average deposits declining about 1% to 2% as customers use cash in their businesses and more efficiently manage their cash position in this higher rate environment. We believe we will have some seasonality through the year. Our goal is to offer superior products and services, along with the appropriate pricing to attract and retain long-term customer relationships.","We expect our net interest income to increase 4% to 5%. As Muneera indicated, the full year net benefit of the higher short-term rates is estimated to be about $130 million to $150 million. Also adding to interest income is the contribution from the securities portfolio repositioning that we completed at the end of the third quarter as well as expected loan growth. We anticipate headwinds in the form of higher wholesale debt to help fund our share repurchase program. In addition, nonaccrual interest recoveries are expected to decrease about $10 million to $12 million from the elevated level we saw in 2018.","And while we are well positioned for any rate increases, we have not included this in our outlook. We believe our portfolio will continue to perform well and begin to migrate towards a normal credit environment in the back half of 2019. Therefore, we expect a provision between 15 and 25 basis points, and net charge-offs to remain low.","As far as non-interest income, we expect growth of about 2% to 3%. We believe we will continue to drive growth in card and fiduciary fees. This is expected to be somewhat offset by lower derivative income and deposit service charges, as increases in underlying services may be more than offset by higher earnings credit allowance.","Keep in mind that the fourth quarter included elevated syndication fees and derivative income which are dependent on market conditions and difficult to predict and therefore may not continue at these levels.","Expenses are expected to decrease approximately 3%, which will help continue to drive our efficiency ratio lower. Excluding restructuring costs incurred in 2018, expenses should be stable. We expect total compensation to decline with lower incentives as we reset the annual targets and a $10 million pension expense benefit resulting from a higher discount rate.","Also with no more surcharge, FDIC expense should be about $16 million lower. We expect to see a rise in outside processing tied to revenue and increasing technology investments as we execute on our Tech Vision 2020 initiatives. In addition, we expect inflationary pressures on items such as occupancy, staff insurance and annual merit and marketing.","Recall the first quarter includes elevated salaries and benefits expense due to annual share compensation and associated higher payroll taxes. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%, excluding any discrete tax benefits, which totaled $48 million in 2018. As far as capital, we expect to reach our target of 9.5% to 10% CET1 by year-end as Muneera indicated. Altogether, we believe our bottom line will continue to grow despite credit cost rising from very low levels as we continue to drive revenue higher and achieve positive operating leverage as well as actively manage our capital.","In closing, our 2018 results demonstrate our ability to drive substantial revenue growth while maintaining favorable credit metrics and well controlled expenses. Through a significant increase in our share repurchases and dividend, we were able to achieve an all-time high for capital return to our shareholders.","Going forward, we expect to maintain our return of capital while properly managing our capital base to support growth and investment in our businesses. Our return on assets, return on equity and efficiency ratios clearly demonstrate our commitment to enhancing shareholder value.","Now we'll be happy to take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey, good morning, Ralph. Just a question on your loan growth outlook, 2% to 3% on an annual average basis. Certainly last years or last couple of years has been tough to get that growth overall and obviously we've seen some improvements in the recent industry data and as well as your period end.","I know you talked a little bit about this, but can you talk about your level of confidence about the direction of the pipelines and where you expect the incremental growth to be coming from this year? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to take that?","Curt Farmer","Yes, Ralph. Thank you. Ken, we did see some encouraging trends in the quarter, both in average balances, but more importantly where our period-end loans finished up about $1.2 billion with growth really across most of our lines of business. And as we said in the script, we also had growth in loan commitments of about $1.3 billion as well as an increase in utilization rate.","So if we look at the outlook we have for 2019, the 2% to 4% growth, again, I'll get back to some of those encouraging trends and we are expecting growth really across most of the business lines that we're in today, with the normal seasonality that we would see in Mortgage Banker, Finance and dealer, which is somewhat cyclical in nature in particular in the first quarter, Mortgage Banker finance is usually down.","So our pipeline is pretty strong across most business lines, across most of the markets. We've been very focused on new client acquisition, which was up about 40% for us for the year in terms of new production. So we think many of things that we've been working on our positioning us well for growth.","Having said that, I would say that we've got the same caution that we would have had on prior calls around the overall economic and political backdrop that's going on right now and that customer sentiment still remains somewhat mixed around near tariffs, government shutdown, labor constraints et cetera.","So we've got to sort of factor that into the equation overall, but I do think we feel good about the trends we saw really kind of building in the second half of the year and how we finished the year and the fourth quarter. So we feel overall, I think positive about the prospects.","Ken Usdin","Got it. And then one follow-up just on the mix of the balance sheet noise, as loans grow and deposits shrink, obviously loan-to-deposit ratio will be moving up, you still have plenty of room in the upper 80s getting towards 90, what's your comfort zone with where you're willing to kind of let the loan-to-deposit ratio settle out?","Ralph Babb","Muneera?","Muneera Carr","Ken, we're comfortable if the ratio will be less than 100, we're comfortable but letting it go up to that point. Just as a reminder, that's the bank level we are talking about. And so we do have a lot of very efficient attractive sources of funding we can tap market index deposits, FHLB etcetera. So we're pretty comfortable with the loan-to-deposit ratio at this point.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Okay, thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Thanks. Good morning. I guess in terms of the share buybacks, is there any -- obviously I'm glad you guys don't have to comply with the whole CCAR process for getting approval there. But is there any other regulatory factors or any other external factors that go into your planning about the buyback schedule or is that completely your discretion.","I'm asking just in terms of, is there anything that's stopping you from getting little more aggressive earlier on in the year with buybacks, given how much the stocks have come down? Thanks.","Curt Farmer","I think we are very much in line with what our thoughts are and what our plans are as far as the buyback and we do regularly meet with our Federal Reserve and discuss that buyback and get their approval. But I think it will depend on where we're headed from a overall balance sheet standpoint. Muneera, you want to add anything to that?","Muneera Carr","We will maintain flexibility as we to go through the year. We have all year to get to that 9.5% to 10% target. We've not trying to time the market and front-load our share buyback. We have to see how the year goes for us as I said.","We look at loan growth and that clearly will be the biggest demand on capital that we have to evaluate and we will triangulate as the year progresses. You should expect us to make a steady measured progress through the year.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Understood. And do you have to or do you -- are you planning on issuing any say Tier 2 debt or any preferred stock to help fund the buybacks and if so, is that already included in your guidance for the next year? Thanks.","Muneera Carr","We will first try to get to that target that we've established for ourselves and then look out other options.","Ken Zerbe","Other options to -- sorry, the options to fund the buybacks themselves?","Muneera Carr","So, just to clarify, as we get to the 9.5% to 10%, we will be issuing debt as necessary to our buyback and then beyond that, once we get to our 10% target, we will evaluate where we are from an economic standpoint et cetera and then decide any actions.","Ken Zerbe","Got it, understood, okay and then -- but the debt issuance, that interest cost is included in your net interest income guidance for the year, correct?","Muneera Carr","Yes, it is. Yes.","Ken Zerbe","Perfect, okay. Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Dave Rochester","Hey, good morning guys. On your deposit growth guide, it's maybe a little bit better than what you saw in terms of average growth this past year and it sounds like some customers may be using deposit funds for CapEx and other things. Is there just a risk that we end up seeing maybe a little bit more run off in this if activity picks up this year, just wanted to get your thoughts on that?","Ralph Babb","Muneera?","Muneera Carr","So overall, I think we've done a really great job of retaining our deposit at the light of 8 rate rises in the last two years, especially when you look out at given our low deposit beta of 25% cumulatively and our high proportion of non-interest bearing deposits.","This past year we did see a run off in municipal deposits and I want you to sort of keep that in mind. Overall, we see the economy as being healthy. Our customers are continuing to make investments. They are likely to continue using their cash that they have with us.","You'll probably see some residual impact of the December rate rise and you have to look out the absolute level of rates in the mid-twos and all of that will clearly continue to influence customer behavior. And so we've looked at all of that and come up with our projections for the 1% to 2% decline that they are giving. If it happens to be more than that, I've mentioned before, we do have a lot of efficient sources of funding.","Dave Rochester","Okay. And just back on the capital front, how much cash do you guys have at the holding company right now that you can allocate to buybacks at this point?","Muneera Carr","There is lot of different variables that go in. We have a fair amount of cash, but we also have liquidity policies and what we need to maintain. So, it's a bit more complicated than simply giving you the overall cash level.","Dave Rochester","Right. I think you'd like to allocate a certain amount to cover buyback or buybacks or dividends for the next year or two, right, 6 to 8 quarters, something like that.","Muneera Carr","Yeah. Our policy is 6 to 8 quarters. We also need to look at debt service at the holding company. So there are a variety of different factors.","Dave Rochester","Yeah. Just trying to back into when you might need to actually do that debt issuance, you're looking sometime in the first half of the year, is that what you're baking into your NII guidance at this point?","Muneera Carr","We are going to be flexible on that. We have to look at market conditions and determine what's the best time frame for us. Like I said, we've tried to include that in that net interest income guidance that we provided to you.","Dave Rochester","Yeah. Okay. And then just in terms of the cash on the balance sheet right now, I saw that was down a bit this quarter. I was just wondering if we'll see more of that this year as deposits run off and loans continue to grow, if you are going to shift more of that into funding loans and what -- what level that you'd actually be comfortable with moving that down to over time, what's a good minimum level for that?","Muneera Carr","Yeah. So given our outlook, where we're staying in multiple loans and that we expect the cost to run off 1% to 2%, clearly both those will bring our overall excess liquidity down. It will definitely be accretive to margin.","I've just talked about the fact that the loan-to-deposit ratio, you know, we are comfortable with it being below 100 and the fact that we can if necessary fund it through a lot of sources, including our securities portfolio by the way and that will overall increase the efficiency of our earning assets.","How comfortable are we, I mean, we like to maintain good levels of liquidity. So, yeah, I'd say $2 billion, $3 billion odd is something you just expect from us, from an overall liquidity stand point.","Dave Rochester","Okay . Great, thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. On the -- back to the NIM, Muneera you had indicated previously that you could see the NIM achieving a four handle in 2019, assuming -- and that I know assumed two rate hikes initially in 2019. Now that you're looking for less than that, one hike in September. What type of -- what is that new expectation. Where do you think the NIM can get to in 2019 just purely on that? Thanks.","Muneera Carr","So, I do expect that our margin will continue to improve in 2019, even if we don't get any additional rate rises. Clearly we'd love to see one to two additional rate hikes in 2019. I think we have a really good starting point at 370 basis points.","The December rate rise will be a benefit to us as we start out in the first quarter. We are estimating that that will be about $15 million a quarter and just as a reminder, we did pick up $2 million to $3 million in the fourth quarter, in the month of December.","And then when I think about the other puts and takes on margin, interest recoveries were really strong for us in 2018 and so that's something that we think we will see some headwind.","And then we've talked about the funding for the buyback being another factor. But overall I expect our margin to continue to improve and at some point we will go ahead and hedge it and lock that benefit in.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then the CET1 target of 9.5% to 10%, it's still a relatively robust level, even at that 9.5% to 10% and how do you view the potential that that target could actually move lower and is it something that if it does move lower that that can happen as we look -- as we move through '19 or would it be something that happens after 2019?","Ralph Babb","That's one of those things that we'll be looking at as we move along, and there's a lot of moving pieces to it whether it be the economy and the growth that's out there and the environment that we're in when we approach that level and we will be looking at that as to whether we are comfortable with it and -- or not. And we could very well be comfortable with it at that level for the time being.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. I mean, if I could just ask one more on the credit side, I know you said that you expect the credit to again normalize in the second half, any -- can you give a little bit more color behind that comment in terms of -- are you seeing anything specific, where do you expect that normalization to materialize first? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Pete?","Peter Guilfoile","Sure. So we're giving an outlook, 15 to 25 basis points provision, that's coming from a standpoint of really zero this year with charge-offs of only 11 basis points, that for us is even a low level. So we would expect even in a good credit environment for our charge-offs to be a little bit higher than that. And so that was baking that in.","We also this year had a pretty good sized reserve release. We come into 2019 with our criticized actually at a record low level. So the opportunity for a reserve release in 2019 is certainly less. And then we would also in a normal credit environment expect some good healthy loan growth and we have that in our plan.","So when you factor those three factors in, net charge-offs moderating a bit, less of a reserve release and then some loan growth. That's where we get the 15 to 25. I'd say that's still in the low end of what we would consider a normal environment.","John Pancari","Okay, great. Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, good morning everyone. Just to start on the deposit side. So we saw another sharp drop in non-interest-bearing even though normally it's stronger because of window dressing. Do you guys now have a clear sense as to the non-operational deposits sitting in non-interest-bearing which could migrate out?","Ralph Babb","Muneera?","Muneera Carr","So on the non-interest-bearing side, I mean in my prepared remarks, we did talk about the fact that customers are being more efficient with their cash. They are managing it in different ways. We do see that specifically in our corporate banking business line, that activity is quite obvious.","In some instances, we do have our non-interest-bearing deposits, remixing on interest-bearing side, some customers by taking advantage of the off-balance sheet product offerings. And then separately on the interest-bearing side, we do have new money coming in given the pay rates that that we're willing to offer.","So there is some independent movement and a little bit of remixing transpiring which is not really unexpected given that we are in the rate cycle.","Steven Alexopoulos","Muneera, the way you model it, could we see another -- like your own model, could we see another $3 billion of outflows of non-interest-bearing this year?","Muneera Carr","Given that rate, you know, this whole specifications phenomenon that we have going on and that we might be pausing a little bit. All of that also has an influence, how the economy performs has an influence, on how people choose to use their money.","So I would say that in times past that deposits are really difficult to predict. Now I was after that, but in our standard models we do include some pretty aggressive function of run-off. So that's one indicator if you wanted to get a sense for what could transpire.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. And then on the loan side, the period-end loan growth was very strong and you guys were calling out December. Can you give more color what drove such strong growth in December and is that sustainable?","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to take that?","Curt Farmer","Yeah. Steve, we started the quarter -- the fourth quarter with a pretty strong pipeline. So we were anticipating kind of as the quarter built that we would see growth across a number of our businesses. We always have growth in dealer in the fourth quarter and that was strong as we anticipated and we have kind of working against Mortgage Banker, Finance to that sort of seasonal phenomenon.","But we also had growth in a number of the key businesses for us, environmental services, entertainment, lending business, private banking and the energy business and we were anticipating most of that as sort of based on our pipeline and sometimes it takes a while for to work its way through the quarter and it just happens that a lot of it hit during the month of December.","But we still have a good solid pipeline kind of going in to the first year and when you look at some of the other dynamics, increase in commitments, some increase in utilization, etcetera, we feel good about the prospects that said earlier.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, that's helpful. If I could squeeze one more in for Muneera, I may have missed this. In your outlook for 2019, do you assume any rate hikes in that outlook or is it flat on the Fed funds rate?","Muneera Carr","It's flat.","Steven Alexopoulos","Flat. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning. Peter.","Peter Winter","Good morning. Muneera, just on the net interest income forecast for rate hikes, you tempered it a little bit from the mid-quarter update in December. I'm just wondering if you could talk about that?","Muneera Carr","Yes, so the estimate that we gave in early December was an initial estimate. We wanted to know how LIBOR would be moving in the first quarter. And given all the Fed's speak sorry, in December, the pace of LIBOR movement had been slow.","And then in my remarks I mentioned that we did make a standard pricing adjustment in early January and we did that based on what we saw in the competitive environment. So when you combine those two things, the slightly higher deposit costs along with slower moving LIBOR, that was the reason why we sort of brought our range back a little bit to the 130 to 150.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then just one more question. You also mentioned on the call a little bit about the Fed dot plot and you're still not ready to put on swaps. I'm just wondering if you can give a little bit more color about some of the mechanics behind when you would put some interest rate swaps on the balance sheet?","Muneera Carr","So I mentioned a lot of things including the fact that this is obviously item that is discussed very frequently. And we all know that in the fourth quarter there was a lot of market volatility, which again gives us pause and you know, causes us to evaluate what the right time is for us to begin moderating our asset sensitivity.","When we look at the US economy, I do think that the economic metrics looks still positive, the labor data is good, the IFS indices are positive. And while the Fed commentary has shifted towards patient, it is with the backdrop of an improving economy.","I said in my comments that there is no an imminent danger of short-term rates dropping. And so we do think that we'll have enough time to be able to execute our hedging program and gradually layer on hedges. We are just being patient and disciplined.","Peter Winter","So it's basically you need to see where rates drop, is when you -- is really the thinking of the timing?","Muneera Carr","No, not really. We're not looking really for that, no, not at all. We're not waiting to see that. We're just waiting for market conditions to settle down a little bit.","Peter Winter","Got it. Okay, thanks very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Rabatin","Hey, good morning. I wanted to first ask on, just still going back to the loan growth and energy and the mortgage warehouse in particular. You've been talking about keeping energy around 4% and it actually ended up being a little higher than that at the end of the year.","Did a lot of the pipeline just kind of book in 4Q in energy and would the mindset beta restrain that going forward, maybe a little color around what's going on with your energy book?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curt Farmer","Yeah. Brett, we have said consistently that we're going to take care of our existing clients in our energy portfolio. We have some great long-term relationships. And as you know, for us that's primarily an E&P book-of-business.","And so I think the growth you saw in the fourth quarter was really the kind of accumulation of a lot of things that we've been saying along the way that eventually energy would be less of a headwind that a lot of our clients are in a much healthier position as they've reduced costs, deployed hedging and have started to increase rig count in drilling and so we saw some increased CapEx.","The expansion in borrowing base led to that increase in borrowing as well, as well as the fact that the capital markets dried up some in the fourth quarter. And so we felt some demand related to that.","We're not necessarily expecting that level of growth to replicate itself every quarter going forward, but we believe just with normal pay-downs in the portfolio, some new production that will continue to be sort of in a relative range of 4%. But again, it would be less of a headwind than it's been for us in the past.","Brett Rabatin","Okay.","Ralph Babb","I was going to add, in my comment little bit on the E&P portfolio in the credit through the downturn is now well in --","Curt Farmer","You want me to take that?","Ralph Babb","Yeah.","Curt Farmer","Yeah. So when we take a look at the last downturn, the E&P portion of our portfolio and the midstream portion of our portfolio performed actually really well. Going into the downturn, we had 15% of a much larger portfolio with energy services that's now shrunk to less than 5%.","So now our portfolio is over 95% E&P and midstream, and we have really good results with that portion of the portfolio in the last downturn. I would also say though that the E&P portion of our portfolio today is even stronger than it was going into the last downturn.","Our borrowers are less levered and they have a lower cost structure, so that we would expect them to perform even better in a lower price environment next time around.","Brett Rabatin","Okay, that's great color. And then I wanted to ask just around the syndicated book, what would you have in there that would look like leverage lending or can you give any color around, you know, there's some concern as we go through earnings so far about syndicated credits. Just maybe what you're seeing in syndications. And then just what you have -- might have that might look like leverage type loan portfolio.","Ralph Babb","Yeah, so we specifically avoid leverage deals and share national credit market. We view leverage lending is the middle market based relationship focused activity and we would avoid the large syndicated covenant like deals.","We like to stick with deals, the people we know, the management we know, the sponsors we know, the typical is one and\/or two, maybe three bank deals, but we specifically avoid the large syndicated market and we would expect that our leverage portfolio will perform better than the broader syndicated leverage market well in a downturn.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. And how much would that total be?","Ralph Babb","Our total leverage using the FDIC definition of high risk borrowers is about 5% of our portfolio.","Brett Rabatin","Okay, great. Appreciate all the color.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Muneera, when you talk about the margin continuing to improve in '19, I was hoping you could put a little more context around that.","In other words, are you talking full-year '19 versus full-year '18 or are you suggesting that the margin would continue -- would or could continue to improve after we get the favorable benefit of the December rate hike fully baked into like the first quarter margin.","In other words, I'm just trying to understand exactly what happened to the margin and why after we've gotten all the rate benefit is baked in.","Muneera Carr","Yeah. So from the 370 point, the margins have improved for the December rate rise as well as for the loan growth that we are signalling in our outlook. So, both those growth will be contributors.","Scott Siefers","Yeah, okay. So there is, I guess a little more flexibility for the margin continue to go after we get to a steady state with the rate environment, the short-term rate environment.","Muneera Carr","That's right.","Scott Siefers","Okay. And then separately, just as you look at the complexion of the overall base of earning assets, I mean the loan growth outlook is very good and substantial from your fourth quarter performance, but I'm thinking just to get into your full year net interest income guide that would be very little growth in the total base of average earning assets.","Can you talk just a little bit about that complexion of non-loan earning assets and what would happen. I mean, I imagine a portion of it at least to with deposits coming down, you know, that base comes down a bit as well, but just curious to hear your thoughts.","Muneera Carr","Yeah, you are right in the way of thinking about it, that generally given that we're saying our deposits will come down that earning assets will more or less remain stable. But overall, we will have a better mix in the earning assets because loans will be higher and then depending on how the loan growth is funded either through our liquidity or through our potentially reducing the securities book, either way, overall the mix will be higher from an earnings standpoint.","Scott Siefers","Okay, that's perfect. I appreciate that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Thank you for answering all the questions. I wanted to follow-up on Ken's line of questioning about the pace of buybacks. I mean, you've been pretty consistent over the past two quarters and here you are loud and clear that we're looking for average loan growth in 2019.","But I'm wondering, given that the stock price is below the average quarterly price of both third quarter and fourth quarter, if you would be open to perhaps more accelerated pace, given that your stock price doesn't seem to be reflecting your ROE potential for the year.","Ralph Babb","Muneera?","Muneera Carr","Yeah. So generally when you are thinking about the size of the buyback, we will -- you should think about a) the strong earnings we have each quarter, and then beyond that, the fact that we will be marching from a CET1 ratio of 11.12% and 9.5% to 10% that we've mentioned.","Now, as we march towards that target we have to think about the uses of capital, clearly loan growth would be the best use of it. We do have some impact coming from accounting standards that we will be adopting, there will be some employee activity. So we will have to triangulate between all of those variables and we've talked about the fact that we want to go with a measured pace.","In the past we have done some front-loading and ASRs and those types of things. So that was more about execution for us. So we are keeping our options open. We want to maintain flexibility and we have all year to get to the target. So all of that is baked in into how we think about our progression there.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thanks for taking my question.","Muneera Carr","You're welcome.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the Direct Express government card program. I know the contract is up for renewal and there's been a little bit of press about it recently and a little bit of political attention.","Maybe first, can you help us understand the contribution of Direct Express to both non-interest-bearing deposits and card fees?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curt Farmer","Yeah. Geoffrey, thank you for your question. I might start by saying that beyond the Direct Express program, we are in the government card program more broadly. We have 49 distinct state programs that are separate from the US Treasury Director Express program and we've been in this -- working in this area for a long time.","We've had a relationship on Direct Express line since 2008. It is primarily a -- from our revenue driver standpoint, it is primarily a depository revenue source for us, non-interest-bearing deposits. There is some fee income, but all the fee income is offset by our third-party processing arrangements that we have in place. And so in terms of sort of revenue source, it is primarily a deposit in nature.","I think a couple of things I would point out to you, we are in the middle of the rebidding process, so we really can't share more details with you at this point around the specifics of the relationship. But if we -- for whatever reason if we're not successful in the rebidding process, we would retain our current cardholder relationships, which is about 4.5 million dollar card.","So even in a worst-case scenario, if not successful in rebidding we believe that we would still have a similar deposit base and revenue source, but it may -- could -- maybe [indiscernible] over time. It would not necessarily -- it wound't be one sale sweep scenario.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you. And then in light of some of those issues that have come up over the last year, is there anything that you've changed operationally around the card program either to try to reduce some of the fraud risk or to make sure that the customer service is at the level you need it to be at?","Ralph Babb","Well, I would tell you that we pride ourselves on how we serve that customer base and the service that we deliver and the protection that we afford those clients. We do some annual surveying of the clients and we continue through a third-party to receive very high satisfaction results from those customers. And then we are very focused on the fraud protection and, detection and protection side of it and worked very hard to remediate any fraud issues that might be out.","There has been some press around fairly limited set of issues that we had around one component of the program that has to do with when a card is lost and getting immediate access to clients -- for clients who otherwise may not have a permanent address and for whom that funding is critical.","And so we've worked to remediate that and have really made sure that all those that have been impacted by that have had funds remediated and restored to them. And so we did not see this as a broader issue, but fairly limited in scope. But as you said, got some press along the way, but we continue to feel like we are delivering very high level of service and with a lot of work around security and fraud associated with that.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Moss","Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about just the competitive environment for loans in particular, if you're seeing greater pricing competition for a mortgage banker loans?","Ralph Babb","Curt, you want to take that?","Curt Farmer","Just from a competitive side, it's always a competitive market. I don't believe that it\u2019s necessarily on the pricing side any more competitive today than normally it has been. We work really hard to keep our focus around relationship banking to make sure that we're keeping our underwriting standards up and leveraging sort of our long-tenured colleagues that we have in the field and the deep expertise that we believe we bring to many of our lines of business and we have pricing models that we deploy that really are built sort of one customer at a time looking at lots of different factors including the overall risk profile, profitability of the relationship.","In the mortgage banker, finance side, I would say it increasingly has been a more competitive environment. Coming out of the financial crisis, there was only a handful of lenders that were in that space. We were one of them. Today that number is probably close to 100 different institutions that provide some level of mortgage banker, finance services.","Having said that, we've got a great reputation in that field. And we've been in that business for over 50 years and we continue to expand relationships and acquire new relationships as well. So we think we're able to remain fairly competitive in that space.","Steve Moss","Okay. And then turning to credit, I hear you on credit cost been higher, given how low charge-offs and a benefit from recoveries. Just wondering, are you increasing your unallocated reserves these days to just kind of keep the loan loss reserve ratio closer to 1.34\/1.35?","Ralph Babb","Pete?","Peter Guilfoile","We do look our qualitative reserves every quarter and there are certain aspects of the economy that obviously we have concerns about that we will address qualitatively if we don't think that the impact of those is fully reflected in our risk ratings.","And we do that from time to time and we do look at it, particularly now where our risk ratings are really at, you know, really, really low levels, yet we see some signs in the economy that would concern us trade for one will be one where we would address qualitatively.","Steve Moss","All right, thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning.","Marty Mosby","Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the hedging in the sense of not the timing of it, but use of inter-affiliate swaps, have you thought about floors that kind of look at the convexity of your deposit pricing with the gammas as you get lower, you have less flexibility to push rates lower, just was trying to think of the duration of the swaps and the types of things that you might use to hedge the balance sheet?","Ralph Babb","Muneera, why don't you talk about the different products we're looking at, as well as the --","Muneera Carr","We keep our options open, so to speak. So we do look at collars and floors and caps and swaps and we look at different durations, three years, four years. This is all part of a dashboard that we evaluate on a regular basis. I would say that keeping our flexibility there and we'll do whatever we think gets us to the best profile for our balance sheet.","Marty Mosby","And what do you think kind of fits that profile, given what's your profile looks like right now, what is the type of insurance that you'd like to try to buy?","Muneera Carr","To be honest with you, even in the last few months, I would say our choices have evolved. It just depends on how the market is pricing some of these instruments. And so, I would say that this is something that changes.","If you'd asked me the same question few months ago, I'd have given you one answer, today is the different answer. And so providing something specific does not make a lot of sense because ultimately we might execute differently depending on how the market is evolving.","Marty Mosby","And then in your securities portfolio, you had the gain, which you know, the benefit that you then offset with a lot of the restructuring costs. Would you look at just in your extra capital that you have, getting down to your target levels, being able to look at using a little bit of that capital to restructure any more capacity in your securities portfolio?","Muneera Carr","Well, I would say at this point we are generally happy with both the profile, the duration that we have in our securities book. To the extent we needed for loan growth we can use some of that capacity in that regard.","We are not actively thinking about any type of additional repositioning. It doesn't mean that we won't be opportunistic, but if long-term rates looks like they're moving up, then we might potentially look into it again, but not at the present time.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Tenner","Good morning. Just had the question regarding, I thought your initial comments suggested that VC lending was a little weaker in the fourth quarter. Hopefully, I heard that correctly. But if so, anything beyond kind of seasonal slowdown there or are you seeing anything in that market that raises any eyebrows?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curt Farmer","Yes, the average loans decreased in our broader technology life sciences space about $80 million for the quarter. And that was some decline in our core TLS business as well as equity fund services and some of that was just timing related. I don't think there was anything thematic going on in the portfolio.","We had a couple of larger DC funds that we're closing out one fund and then launching another fund, and so we were just sort of between a number of facilities and reinforcing that we actually saw a strong December and pipeline grow at the end of the quarter.","So we're expecting continued growth in that segment, specifically the equity fund services component. And again, I would think the month of December was a little bit of an anomaly. I mean, the fourth quarter is a little bit of an anomaly.","Gary Tenner","Got it. Thank you. And then just a credit question. I think you addressed this to some degree. Given your outlook for provisioning. it doesn't certainly suggest any meaningful reserve release of anything you're -- you've talked about some qualitative factors that give you -- that you are increasing because of some concern. I'm just wondering as you're looking out through '19 into 2020 and CECL, kind of any early indications that you have from what you -- you know, from the study and research you've done internally.","Ralph Babb","Pete?","Peter Guilfoile","Yeah, Gary, we're not ready to release anything on CECL just yet. We want to have -- we are looking at internally and we want to have discussions with our auditors and our regulators before we say any specific about the impact of CECL, but I would say this that all things being equal, given the fact that our portfolio has a much shorter duration than most of our peers, we would expect the impact of CECL on us would be significantly less as well.","Gary Tenner","All right. Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brock Vandervliet","Thanks for the question. Prior question on CECL covered it.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Michelle. Good morning and welcome to Comerica's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curt Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, Muneera Carr; and Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile.","During this presentation, we will be referring to slides that provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC's website as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website comerica.com.","This conference call contains forward-looking statements and in that regard you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement in today's release and slide two which I incorporate into this call as well as our SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ.","Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures and in that regard I direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph who will begin on slide three.","Ralph Babb","Good morning. And thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported first quarter earnings of $339 million, or $2.11 per share. Our earnings per share increased 12% over the fourth quarter and reflected solid loan growth, continued careful management of loan and deposit pricing, as well as expense control. In addition, our credit metrics remain strong and we continue our share buyback program repurchasing 5.1 million shares. Altogether, this drove an ROE of over 18% and an ROA of 1.97% for the quarter. ","Relative to the first quarter of last year, our earnings per share increased 33% and pretax income is up 27%. This is primarily due to higher interest rates, good credit quality, and successful execution of our Gear Up initiatives along with active capital management. On Slide 4, we have provided details on the adjustments related to certain items. In the first quarter, we realized $11 million in discrete tax benefits primarily related to employee stock transactions. These tax benefits provided the opportunity to reposition $1 billion of lower yielding treasury securities resulting in an $8 million pretax loss. ","This action will increase interest revenue by approximately $1 million per quarter. Prior period rates have been adjusted for restructuring charges related to our Gear Up initiatives. ","Slide 5 provides an overview of our first quarter results. First quarter average loans increased to $845 million from the fourth quarter. This growth was broad based and is particularly noteworthy as seasonality typically hampers loans in the first quarter. In part, we believe this is a result of the efficiency benefits of our end-to-end redesign of our lending process. This initiative has reduced turnaround time for loan requests and produce greater marketing capacity for our relationship managers. As far as deposits, we saw the normal seasonal decline in noninterest bearing deposits. ","Also, we are seeing customers funding growth, acquisitions and capital expenditures from their cash balances and some are also choosing our off-balance sheet offerings. We continue to closely monitor our deposit base and have adjusted standard rates for certain products as we continue to manage deposit pricing to attract and retain customers. Net interest income benefited from higher interest rates and loan growth. This was more than offset by two fewer days in the quarter and lower balances at the Fed.","Our net interest margin increased 9 basis points to 3.79%. We continued to have strong credit quality as evidenced by 8 basis points in net charge-offs, as well as a decline in non-accrual loans. This led to a reduction in our allowance for loan losses and a negative provision of $13 million. Excluding the $8 million loss on securities, noninterest income decreased $4 million from seasonally strong fourth-quarter activity. Netting out fourth quarter restructuring costs expenses were stable. An increase in salaries and benefits expenses in conjunction with annual stock compensation was offset by decreases in most categories.","We have maintained our expense discipline and our efficiency ratio continued to improve to 51%. As I previously mentioned, employee stock activity resulted in a credit to our income tax provision of $11 million and added approximately 550,000 shares. We repurchased 5.1 million shares and our estimated CET1 capital ratio decreased 36 basis points to 10.78%.","And now I'll turn the call over to Muneera who will go over the quarter in more detail.","Muneera Carr","Thanks Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. First quarter average loans increased $845 million or 1.7% compared to the fourth quarter and the trend was positive through the quarter. With growth in the bulk of our business lines, we outpaced the industry's average commercial loan growth based on the Fed H.8 data for the first quarter which was one of the best the industry has seen in years. Our order dealer portfolio increased $434 million as dealers built their inventory of 2019 models and the added and expanded customer relationships.","Average energy balances grew $317 million due to reduced capital market activity throughout most of the quarter, as well as higher loan demand due to expanded borrowing bases and continued CapEx. We remain committed to supporting our energy customers who are generally well positioned as they have reduced leverage and their cost base since the last downturn. We also drove loan growth in general middle market in all three of our primary geographies, as well as equity fund services, US banking, commercial real estate and retail banking, partly offsetting this growth was the seasonal decline in mortgage banker of $322 million with the normal winter slowdown in home sales.","Loan commitments were relatively stable following strong year end growth, as well as timing of activity in equity fund services. Total utilization increased to 52.7% and the pipeline remains strong. Our loan yields increased 17 basis points in conjunction with the increase in short-term rates. As you can see on slide 7, average deposits decreased in line with our normal seasonal pattern. Average noninterest bearing deposits declined $1.7 billion, while interest bearing deposits were stable. As Ralph mentioned, with higher rates and continued solid economic conditions, we're seeing customers use their cash in their business and some are seeking other investment offerings through Comerica securities.","We stay close to our customers and aim to provide them the best cash management solutions to meet their financial goals. Starting this quarter, we started seeing a rebound in deposit balances which is consistent with trends and prior years. Average March balances were $1 billion higher than February. Of note, period and deposits decreased primarily due to the timing of monthly federal benefit activity in our government prepaid card business which had a $1.2 billion impact.","We remain focused on our relationship approach to manage deposit pricing. In conjunction with the increase in short-term rates, late last year our deposit cost increased 16 basis points in the first quarter. In mid-March, with the backdrop of solid loan growth, we made pricing adjustments to certain deposit categories. We expect our second quarter average interest-bearing deposit rate to be in the low 90 basis points range. From there the pace of increase is expected to moderate for the rest of the year as we believe we are well positioned competitively.","Of course, we are closely monitoring our deposits, funding requirements, short-term rates, as well as the competitive landscape. Slide 8 provides details on our securities portfolio. The yield under portfolio continues to trend up. While yield on MBS securities came under pressure in the first quarter, we were able to make purchases at incrementally higher yields than the securities that have paid down contributing $1 million to net interest income .In addition, as Ralph mentioned, we repositioned $1 billion of treasuries at the end of the quarter.","The higher yield on the purchase securities will result in an additional $1 million in net interest income per quarter. The four-year duration of the new securities will help extend the duration on the overall portfolio, which was a little under three years at the end of the first quarter.","Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income decreased $8 million, while our net interest margin increased 9 basis points to 3.79%. Our loan portfolio added $17 million and 14 basis points to the margin. Increased interest rates provided the largest benefit along with loan growth. This was partly offset by two fewer days and a small impact from a mix shift in the portfolio. Higher yields on the securities book added $1 million and one basis points to the margin. As far as Fed deposits, the higher Fed Funds rate was more than offset by a $2.1 billion decline in balances.","The net impact was a $12 million reduction in net interest income which added 5 basis points to the margin. Deposit cost rose with increased pay rates, as well as a minor mix shift imbalances which together had an impact of $9 million or 7 basis points. As far as wholesale funding cost, the increase in short-term rates, as well as the effect of the $350 million in senior debt issued on February 1st, cost $5 million and had a 4 basis point impact on the margin.","In summary, the net benefit from increased rates was $11 million or 6 basis points on the margin. This benefit combines with loan growth was more than offset by two fewer days in the quarter and lower balances at the Fed. As we indicated last month, when we presented at an Investor Conference, we have begun our program to moderate some of our asset sensitivity by gradually adding hedges. We continue to closely assess our position and determine the appropriate path given our balance sheet movement, our outlook for rates and the market prices for hedges.","So far we have added $1.7 billion in interest rate swaps with an average tenor of 3.3 years and an average rate of 228 basis points. Based on current rates, the impact our net interest income of the swaps we've added is expected to be nominal. Additional information can be found in the appendix. Credit quality remains strong as shown on slide 10. Our net charge-offs remained very low at $11 million or 8 basis points. Non-accrual loans declined and now comprise only 38 basis points of our total loans.","Total criticized loans increased slightly from a historically low levels and represent 3.6% of total loans as of quarter end. Sustained, strong performance of the overall portfolio and continued solid economic conditions across our geography and within industry exposures resulted in a small release in the reserve and a reserve ratio of 1.29%\/ We remain vigilant, closely monitoring our portfolio for signs of stress. However, at this point we are not seeing any concerning trends.","Coming to noninterest income on Slide 11. Excluding the $8 million loss from the repositioning of the securities portfolio, noninterest income decreased $4 million. Fiduciary income declined $2 million mostly due to lower financial markets data buyers. In addition, we had small changes in several other categories such as card, commercial lending and letters of credit which were impacted by seasonality including two less business days in the quarter.","Of note, fee income in the second quarter is typically stronger including seasonally high card and fiduciary income. Expenses remain well controlled as shown in slide 12. Salaries and benefits increased as a result of annual stock compensation which was partly offset by lower executive incentives and fewer days in the first quarter. Pension expense was lower as a result of the increase in discount rate and legal cost declined mainly due to the recovery of legal expenses previously incurred. ","Both of these items are included in other expenses. Software cost declines and equipment costs benefited from unusually low maintenance and repair expenses. Typical seasonality was apparent in reduction in several line items such as advertising, outside processing and occupancy.","Looking forward to the rest of the year, expenses typically reflect lower stock compensation, partly offset by merit and additional days, as well as higher technology, outside processing expenses, advertising and occupancy.","Turning to Slide 13. In the first quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million or 3% of total shares under our equity repurchase program. Together with dividends, we returned $530 million to shareholders. Our estimated CET1 ratio declined to 10.78%. We are on track to meet our goals of CET1 ratio of 9.5% to 10% by the end of this year. We continue to give careful consideration to earnings generation, capital needs and market conditions as we determine the pace of the share buybacks.","Now I will turn the call back to Ralph to provide us updates on our outlook for 2019. ","Ralph Babb","Thank you, Muneera. As usual our outlook assumes a continuation of the current economic and interest rate environment. We continue to expect total average loans to increase approximately 2% to 4% in 2019 relative to 2018. We anticipate growth in most business lines which is supported by positive loan trends in most of our businesses over the past few quarters. Conditions in our markets remain good yet customers remain somewhat cautious given more uncertainty regarding the path of the economy and lingering trade talks. Coincident with loan growth, customers are using cash in their businesses and this is reflected in our deposit levels.","In addition, customers are more efficiently managing their cash position in this higher rate environment. On a year-over-year basis, we continue to expect average deposits to decline about 1% to 2%, increasing gradually through the remainder of the year. We believe the mix shift into interest-bearing will continue at a moderate pace. Our goal is to offer superior products and services along with appropriate pricing to attract and retain long-term customer relationships.","As a result of the recent pricing adjustments we made on deposit products along with lower LIBOR rates. We now expect our 2019 net interest income to increase 3% to 4% over 2018. We continue to expect to benefit from solid loan growth, as well as the completed securities portfolio repositioning. This is expected to be somewhat offset by higher wholesale debt to help fund our share repurchase program, as well as lower non-accrual interest recoveries.","Incorporating the strong credit quality we achieved in the first quarter, we have lowered the forecast to our provision to 10 to 15 basis points. We believe our portfolio will continue to perform well and begin to migrate towards a more normal credit environment as the year progresses. Taking account of the $8 million securities loss incurred in the first quarter, we have adjusted our outlook for noninterest income growth of 1% to 2%. There is no change in our outlook for expenses, the tax rate or capital target.","In closing, our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to drive loan growth while maintaining favorable credit metrics and well controlled expenses. We remain committed to appropriately managing our capital base, returning excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way, while we support growth and investment in our businesses. Our return on assets, return on equity and efficiency ratios continued to clearly demonstrate our ability to enhance shareholder value.","Now we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open.","JohnPancari","Good morning, gentlemen. On the NII guidance change, I guess if you could just talk through a little bit more of the rationale behind the change. I mean wasn't the higher deposit pricing already factored into your expectation when you presented a conference this quarter? And then also want to get some color around the interest recoveries. And I wouldn't believe that your -- I didn't think that you will be modeling expected recoveries going forward as you look at the years guidance, but I'm just trying to understand how much of an impact that had that change. Thanks.","MuneeraCarr","Good morning, John. So you're right from the last time we presented at the conference the one big change was the standard pricing changes that we made in mid-March. And so while we had factored some increases, it wasn't quite to the extent of the changes that we made beyond that the levels of 30-day LIBOR has been fairly variable. So that's another component and then even though it's nominal, some of our hedging activity that we've done so far to date is the third aspect of the change.","And then I think you also asked about non-accrual interest recoveries. And so you're right. We typically don't include, we have a normal level of $1 million to $2 million that we forecast for those types of recovering and in the first quarter those recoveries were elevated. I would expect them to come down from what we have posted for Q1.","JohnPancari","Okay. All right. Thanks. And then I know you also adjusted your NII expectation a bit on the fee side as well as your fee expectation as well as the net interest income. Why not any type of expense offset to that?","MuneeraCarr","So the only change we made on fees was for the $8 million loss that we picked up on the securities portfolio. And for that reason there isn't -- it's not like other fees are coming down. And that's why we left our expense guidance alone. And that's flat outlook I think that they're doing really well on the expense front and we remain fairly well disciplined.","Operator","Your next question will come from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","ErikaNajarian","Hi, good morning. So I just wanted to make sure that we are interpreting some of the color on the net interest margin correctly. Muneera, and just sort of plugging in some of the major assumptions like deposit cost and the securities restructuring. I'm getting to a base on net interest margin of about 374 for the second quarter. I'm wondering if that's the right ballpark to think about the second quarter. And if the rate outlook persists what you expect for the quarterly trajectory of the net interest margin from there?","MuneeraCarr","Good morning, Erika. So that was some fast math there. We typically don't provide guidance on the net interest margin. I can generally talk with in terms of net interest income and what I expect there. For net interest income, I do expect that for the remainder of the year we will see net interest income to be stable to slightly improving from the first quarter level. That is mainly because of the loan growth that we are expecting, as well as the incremental five days for the rest of the year. And offsetting that generally will be our higher funding cost.","And in that regard, I have provided our deposit cost guidance. And also the fact that the senior debt that we issued was in February 1st. So you have an incremental month at least in the second quarter for those costs. And other than that I've mentioned the fact that our non-accrual interest recovery should come down from the elevated levels that you saw. And then LIBOR --variability in LIBOR as well as the hedging activity that they're doing. So all of that should help you triangulate to the margin that you're trying to get to.","ErikaNajarian","Got it. And on slide 18, thank you for giving us updated interest rate sensitivity analysis. And as we think about --now it's funny the market is looking to the part of the chart that says down 50 basis points which is down $65 million. And I'm wondering as we think about that current down 50 basis points scenario. In your model what are you assuming for --how you could ease funding costs or how much deposit competition remains?","And what can you do for the rest of the year from a hedging program perspective to perhaps narrow the sensitivity?","MuneeraCarr","So the information that you're providing on net interest rate sensitivity slide is to give people idea of what things would look like if rates come down really to use the down 50 on average that is an instantaneous shock of 25 basis points. We are looking at where our deposit costs are today and doing that calculation. We are factoring in the floors that we would have on some of our deposits. And so it's based on what we could really manage if we had to come down 25 basis points, what would that really look like. It's not factoring additional increases that we will have in deposit cost because this is an add-off calculations based on quarter end. We will continue to on the hedging side, look at our overall balance sheet, and look at what's happening in the interest rate environment.","We'll continue to make good, gradual measured progress on that front to ensure that we are protecting ourselves from downside risk. On that front, I will tell you that we continue to have a positive view on the US economy. We are not expecting a recession in the near future. And we are fairly confident that we can get our hedging program completed in a gradual, systematic manner.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","KenZerbe","Great. Thanks. I guess maybe starting up with the negative provision expense in the quarter. Like, obviously I know you guys have a fair amount of discretion in terms of when you think about the reserve broadly speaking. But given, so that the dialogue is about is the economy weakening? And there is some concern there. Can you just talk about how much discretion you did apply to the reserve release this quarter? And does it make sense to be a little more conservative in terms of keeping the reserve going forward?","PeterGuilfoile","Well, we do give a lot of discretion to it. We're very patient when releasing reserves. We want to see our credit metrics being very strong over a sustained period of time. And that's exactly what we saw. We didn't see just good credit metrics over the past quarter or two. They've been really exceptional. Net charge-offs of an 8 basis point, our non-accrual inflow we believe is a record low level right now. Our non-accrual loans are extremely low and our criticized remains very low. So that's the reduction in our reserves this quarter is a reflection of what we've seen over the past few quarters.","KenZerbe","All right, fair enough. And then actually just if we can go back to slide 18, down the very bottom we talked about the hedging that you have no additions modeled. Can you just talk about that a little bit in more detail? Because obviously you're still very asset sensitive. There is the potential the rates do decline. I understand that the Fed Funds expectation is that we do get a couple rate cuts going forward. Is -- are we at a point right now where it just doesn't make sense to hedge unless you're even more negative than the Fed Funds futures curve? I'm just trying to figure out the dynamics of when you would want to add additional hedges or not.","MuneeraCarr","Okay. So slide 18 is based on 3\/31 and where we were but our hedges and what our balance sheet looks like on that date. So it's not adding future projections or where the program will go and you can see that in the second quarter we continued to make progress on the hedging front. Overall, just high level thoughts on hedging, as I said we remain positive and constructive on the US economy. We feel fairly confident that we will get to July and see the longest expansion in US history.","I would say that since the fourth quarter there has been a lot of volatility in the financial markets. A lot of news on the global economy. And so what we're trying to do here is ensure that we are protecting ourselves from downside risk, as well as maintaining some of our asset sensitivity to benefit should momentum pick up in the US economy. And so the best way to do all of that is to have a systematic balanced, measured pace and making sure that we're positioning our balance sheet appropriately.","Operator","Your next question will come from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","StevenAlexopoulos","Good morning, everybody. Just one -- I want to follow up on cash management what you're seeing in your commercial customers. And if we look at the guidance for interest-bearing deposit cost to move to 90 basis points and then moderate in 2Q. I don't think you're getting a lot of pushback, I think we get it that they'll likely move up. But what gives you confidence that deposit cost will then moderate giving you'll be at around 90 and many of your customers could get 2% plus, trying to understand where deposit cost ultimately go to?","MuneeraCarr","So, Steven, the way we're looking at the cost side of the equation, our commercial customers have remained fairly current as we've gone through the rising rate cycle. And then on the retail front, we've been pretty deliberate and we've done about four standard pricing changes when rates have gone up 8x in the last two years. Clearly, we continue to monitor the competitive landscapes and we're making the right changes that we think will help us to be well positioned for the future and our cost outlook that we're providing to you is based on all of those conditions, all of those positioning.","And so I feel that because of that deposit pricing pressure will level off. Now having said all of that, deposit pricing for the industry is driven by the need for liquidity. And as the economy gets stronger, as loan growth gets stronger, we will look for funding and that in turn could put some additional pressure on the deposit pricing front. We will continue to monitor the competitive landscape. I see all that is being a net positive because of things are going really well.","I will say that when I look at our deposit cost at 78 basis points for the first quarter and even the 90 that we are projecting, I would say that we are generally in line with or better than our peers. We'll have to wait and see sort of how things progress as the year goes on.","StevenAlexopoulos","Muneera, are you seeing pressure ease at all yet in terms of customers looking for exception pricing?","MuneeraCarr","I would say on the commercial side, yes, we are seeing a little bit of easing there. And on the retail side we are well-positioned at the current time.","StevenAlexopoulos","Okay. And then on the hedges, just given the shape of the yield curve, can you walk us through the economics to put on new swaps here? What rate are you giving a variable? And then what are you receiving fix?","MuneeraCarr","So variable, we're doing 30-day LIBOR swaps. So I --our received fixed is that average rate that I mentioned in my comments 220 basis points on average. And if you go to slide 19, we've tried to provide you greater transparency into what we've executed so far.","StevenAlexopoulos","Okay and relative to the $900 million you added this quarter, is that about the quarterly pace you expect moving forward?","MuneeraCarr","I think that will depend. We will maintain our flexibility and we'll see how things transpire in the economy and in the market, and we'll try to be as opportunistic as we can.","Operator","Your next question will come from Brett Rabatin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","BrettRabatin","Good morning, Ralph. Wanted to start with credit. I realize it's very strong and charge-offs are pretty minimal. You did have a bit of an increase in criticize this quarter. And I know a small piece of that was energy-related. Can you talk maybe about industries that impacted criticize loans this quarter? And if there were any underlying trends and what you saw?","RalphBabb","Sure. Yes. So, Brett, bear in mind we were coming off of a record low level of criticize at year-end at 3.1%. And we really didn't feel that that level of criticize was sustainable even if credit quality remains excellent which it has. So I would describe the modest increase that we saw in criticize this quarter to be more bouncing along the bottom, if you will than any trend. And there were no lines of business that we saw that were stressed at all this quarter. There was some distant modest level of increases in a number of lines of business including energy.","But if you take a look at that increasing the energy criticize, it was pretty modest and it was fairly normal in the scheme of things.","BrettRabatin","Okay. And then the other question I wanted to ask was just around technology and life sciences. If you could give any color around the trends there? And I guess I thought maybe that might grow a little more this quarter especially the capital line of credit business. Can you maybe just help us with what was underlying trends in the quarter for them?","CurtisFarmer","Yes. Brett, so on the core technology, life sciences business, we did see a slight decrease about $30 million for the quarter. Actually loan production for us remains pretty strong through the quarter with a lot of emphasis for us continuing to be around new to new relationships. We do feel like the pipeline and momentum there starting to build a little bit. I think the challenge for us in technology and life sciences continues to be our strategy of staying early-stage and sticking to a very granular strategy. ","So all the deals that we are booking are smaller in nature. So we're doing a lot of $1 million, $2 million, $3 million type transactions, and just to share volume associated with those, it takes a little bit more to move the needle, but we do feel like we've got the right strategy overall that continues to be a very attractive business for us from an overall relationship perspective especially on the depository side and the fee income side associated with the business.","So we're not concerned about for the longer-term growth trajectory around the business, but shorter term we have seen a little bit of the business kind of moving sideways. We continue to see nice growth in the equity fund services component that we mentioned on previous calls. And we were up about $93 million in that business line. We see activity and a new front creation continues to be strong.","Operator","Your next question will come from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.","KenUsdin","Thanks. Good morning, Ralph. Thank you. Good morning. Question on capital. So I know you reiterated your commentary that you would expect to get into the 9.5% - 10% CET1 range this year. But just after you took you had the $500 million buyback for a couple quarters then you went to 475. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the pace of capital return from here? And then the pacing in terms of getting into that range and is there any reason why you wouldn't eventually head to the lower end? Thanks.","MuneeraCarr","All right. Good morning, Ken. So the way we see it we have all here to get to our target of 9.5% to 10%. We are being measured. We want to take a look at how loan growth does for us this year. Clearly that would be the best use of our capital. And then beyond that we want to wait and see how the economy does. And I think that we're making good progress. I mean with the 10 handle and being at the 10.78%, clearly, I would say we are moving in the right direction. And we'll continue to make adjustments as we approach the end of the year.","KenUsdin","Okay, so all right and then a follow-up question just on the loan side. It's interesting to hear about the customers using cash but yet you also saw one of the best middle markets growth quarters in some time. So can you talk about just what you're seeing across the customer base then? Is it -- the people are using the deposits why you're even seeing the loan growth? And when you're seeing the loan growth is it not taking away from deposits? Just I guess the question is more about the loan to deposit ratio and where you'd expect that to kind of settle out if there's a usage on one side but an expansion still on the left side of the balance sheet? Thanks.","PeterGuilfoile","Ken, there's just kind of two parts to that question. One is about loan growth overall and where we're sitting at and the deposit utilization. And then secondly, where we think LDR, loan deposit ratio might be sort longer-term and are we concerned about it. So on the lending side; we are seeing pretty broad-based loan growth. First quarter is usually a soft quarter for us, so that was nice to see that we saw growth across a number of businesses, energy, all three of our general and middle-market, markets in Texas, California and Michigan. Equity fund services, US banking, commercial real estate, retail banking, all we mentioned previously, you saw on the slide.","We didn't have the normal seasonality in both dealer increasing and the decline in mortgage banker finance. And we saw some I think some good momentum or we feel like we've got some good momentum heading into the second quarter. Period end loans were up over $50 billion or about $140 million for the quarter. And then sort of the moving average $625 million above the quarter and pipeline feels pretty good heading into the second quarter.","I don't have a perfect answer for you as in terms of why are we seeing loan growth and also feel like deposits are being utilized as well. But it's more anecdotal in terms of the feedback we are getting from customers. I think they are pushing on both leverage right now and feeling pretty good about the economy despite some of the longer-term outlook considerations. And some of the concerns whether it's around global issues, trade, Brexit, China and the kind of list goes on. But I think for right now most of our customers are in a net borrowing mode. And we're starting to see a little bit of CapEx occur as well.","So we think it's really dipping into both buckets, both utilizing credit facilities, originating new credit facilities as well as tapping into deposits they have sort of both levers being pulled. And then I might shift and talk a little bit about the loan deposit ratio. We do feel like that with where we are today at 93% and that we still have capacity for growth in the loan portfolio. The first quarter is a seasonal loan period for us. We are forecasting as we said earlier that the second quarter would be relatively stable. And then down sort of 1% to 2% for the full year, but a lot of that is because of the activity we saw in Q1. So we're expecting some growth trends for the rest of the year really based on sort of seasonal patterns.","We do, and Muneera said early, we think we're well positioned on the rate front. We continue to take relationship based approach to serving our clients whether those are retail clients or commercial clients. And then we've been in a net customer acquisition mode. And so over 40% of our new loan production in the last months has been to new customers. And with almost all these new customers comes to depository relationships. We gain the core operating funds, treasury management, services et cetera with those clients.","And so we feel like that we're well positioned from a longer-term perspective, and do not have any sort of near-term concerns about loan to deposit ratio.","Operator","Your next question will come from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust. Your line is open.","JenniferDemba","Thank you. Good morning. And just question on M&A interest at this point in the cycle, Ralph. And I was wondering what you think the transactions announced earlier this year mean for the industry in general? Thanks. ","RalphBabb","Well, in general, we have the same stance we've had for a long time. When you look at where we are located in the growth potential that we have in the three large markets of Michigan and California and Texas. And that doesn't say we wouldn't look at the possibility of an acquisition, but it would be in those markets and it would have to fit from a number of different ways. And that is very important and I would underline again we've got the right people and the right locations now in the markets and continuing to grow.","They will be very important for us and I think when you look at the economy especially right now it's slowing down just a little bit, but on the other hand when you look at Texas and when you look at California is still moving quite well. Michigan is slowing just a bit because of the car industry is slowing down just a bit. But overall we are very well positioned for growth and to create value over the longer period of time with the markets we are in today.","JenniferDemba","Okay. And you feel that Comerica is large enough to make the necessary technology investments it needs to stay competitive in your market segments at this point?","RalphBabb","We do and especially today when you have the ability to use vendors and bring in the products and services to be very competitive. And I'll ask Curt to give you a few examples of that that are very important and that are positioning us very well today. ","CurtisFarmer","Yes. Jen, I would echo what Ralph said around leveraging key vendor relationships. A lot of technology that's being developed feels like it's fairly ubiquitous across the industry, and easily accessible through key vendor relationships. We've done a lot to leverage cloud technology. We've moved over 150 of our applications to the cloud in the last 12 or 18 months. And we've done a lot to sort of rationalize various applications and legacy platforms which has freed up capacity for us in terms of our expense base to continue to invest in additional capabilities, whether they're on the cyber front, whether they're on the side of customer enablement or colleague enablement.","So there are a lot of tools that we've been putting in place for more digital oriented, leveraging robotics, artificial intelligence, again leveraging cloud capabilities. And so we feel like we're well positioned. A lot of the work we did through GEAR Up allowed us to create the efficiencies and reorient our technology spend overall to some rationalization that we did and then coupled with some shifting away from increase in regulatory spend on the technology front. So all that sort of coupled together we feel like we're well positioned.","Operator","Next question comes from Gary Tenner from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","GaryTenner","Thanks. Good morning. I just want to talk about the loan growth guidance for the year unchanged from where it was last quarter but despite what was really the best first quarter you guys have had in four or five years with most loan categories really moving very well. If you think of what looks to be at least a mildly resurgent mortgage market going into the second quarter maybe helping warehouse. Can you talk about why there were no changes to the guidance? What your outlook is for the back half of the year and just provides some detail there. Thanks. ","CurtisFarmer","Yes, Gary. So I'll go back to what I said earlier. The first quarter for us is normally a flat to down quarter because the seasonality across the number of businesses, but primarily mortgage banker finance. And so to come out with a very strong quarter that was very broad-based including some businesses like middle market, commercial real estate, equity fund services. Some of the businesses that I mentioned earlier to see some resurgence in local energy activity.","All that we think bodes very well for us heading into the second quarter which is typically one of our stronger quarters from a growth perspective with the mortgage banker finance and dealer being net positive contributors in the quarter. But we're still early in the year and so we feel like the range that we've given a 2% to 4% makes sense for us with a number of unknowns that are out there. I mean overall sentiment seems to be positive, but there's still some caution out there. And so there's a notable level of uncertainty around the number of things. Whether it's the overall economic, a political backdrop that I mentioned earlier, and you can go through the list. Trade policy, some labor constraints and some of the markets, Brexit et cetera. ","We're continuing to see some deleveraging with some clients and while we are seeing some CapEx spend, it's not necessarily broad-based continues to be a pretty competitive landscape. We've talked about that previously with both bank and non-bank lending and -- activity is pretty high. And we can be on the net a positive side of that or the net negative side of that depending upon the transaction. So there are some things that don't give us sort of a clear picture longer-term, but for the near term we feel good about the growth projection of the lending side of the business. And that's why we're sticking sort of in that 2% to 4% range.","As the year goes on, certainly if we see a loan growth that accelerating we'll have chance to revise that --revise that forecast but right now we feel good about the range that we've indicated.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","DaveRochester","Hey, good morning, guys. So quick follow-up on the buybacks. Given your expectations on earnings and buyback activity for the rest of the year, I was just wondering how much more debt you think you'll need to issue to cover that cash need at the holding company? Or if this last issuance covers you for the rest of the year? ","MuneeraCarr","Okay. So, Dave, for the most part the last issuance will cover us. We do have a maturity that's coming up in May. And so we will replenish that maturity of $350 million in the back half of the year.","DaveRochester","Okay. So another $350 million but that's going to cover the maturity in May, right?","MuneeraCarr","Yes. That's right. ","DaveRochester","Okay, got it. And then on the NIM, you mentioned you think that mix shift into interest bearing deposits will continue. Are you expecting that shift to continue to drive deposit cost higher even if the interest bearing deposit cost stabilizes near that 90 basis points level you were talking about, just given that migration?","MuneeraCarr","I think, yes, I do think that our-- we want to make sure that we are taking care of our customers particularly at the rate front. So that we can retain the relationship and from what we see there are still some customers who continue to seek yield and hence my statement that we do think that sort of that activity will continue in the back half of the year. The good news there is that we are able to retain our customers.","DaveRochester","Yes, got you, thanks. And then if deposits continue to decline next year is the thought that borrowings should grow to fill the funding gap? Or can you still shift cash over to fill that gap? And, if so, how much excess cash do you think you have at this point where you can shift it over?","MuneeraCarr","I think looking -- I mean you're asking about next year. And overall deposits are difficult to predict. I mean I'll tell you generally that for this year our outlook that we provided the 1% to 2% decline. I think we feel generally pretty good about that. We've given you all our historical trends. We do think we'll see a rebound in the seasonal deposits that flow out in the first quarter. On the retail side, we feel good as Curt mentioned with the rates that we have and investments we're making in the digital retail platform. So we do think that we will be able to attract retail customers, but have less of the headwinds from municipal deposits that have been flowing out just given the absolute level at which we --those municipal deposits are today.","And then, of course, as we continue to grow loans that will help us overall on a deposit front as well. That's what we can see for this year. As far as next year is concerned, we'll just have to wait and see how things evolved. That's a little bit difficult for me to predict.","DaveRochester","Sure, sure. I appreciate that. I guess just an overarching question, if there are any funding gaps to deposit growth or deposit run-off is stronger than you expect, do you have excess cash where you feel like you can ship that over to fund loan growth or is it more of where you expect an increase in borrowing sort of what you had this quarter?","MuneeraCarr","Oh, absolutely. So, yes, particularly at the bank level which is where we would fund loan growth? We do have a lot of efficient sources of funding. The securities portfolio remains a reservoir of liquidity for us and then beyond that our ability to get efficient, attractive funding both from market index deposits and FHLB advances remain. So we should be able to fund any loan growth that we generate without too many issues on the funding front.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","ScottSiefers","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I think most of my questions have been answered, but I mean I just wanted to ask one more follow-up on the deposits. And I think you touched on it a bit in the response to the last question, but when we look at the typical back half rebound in deposit balances what in your thinking would cause that to continue to hold true in sort of a higher rate environment where there's seems to be more potential use of those funds i.e. using deposits, your customers using their deposits to expand that kind of stuff. There's like --what would cause that typical rebound to continue to hold true in this type of environment?","MuneeraCarr","So, on that front I mean we are -- the reason we showed our last four year trends on that slide was to reflect and show, represent what the seasonality has been in our portfolio. And when we do a granular analysis of the deposit movement, we do see that a fair amount of the decline in the first quarter was for the typical seasonal trends. And also in the last four years when you think about the fact that we -- two out of the last four years have been in a rising rate environment. That the decline in municipal deposits is included in those trends, all of that makes us feel better about what the rest of the year will look like.","We also did some comparisons of our deposit base with how we saw depositors react in '04 and '07 cycle and for the most part this cycle is on par with what we saw then. And so all of that goes into the outlook that we provided. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","ErikaNajarian","Hi. Good morning. I just had one follow-up question, if I may. You spoke a little bit about the impact of interest recoveries to your margin, but the actual recoveries on a dollar basis loan recoveries didn't really change much quarter-over-quarter. And when you're --I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of the impact of interest recoveries in the first quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018?","MuneeraCarr","So interest recoveries in the first quarter were about $4 million or so and we normally expect $1 million to $2 million, Erika. So when you're thinking about the future and you're trying to model out the rest of the year that's approximately the decline that I'm expecting about $1 million to $2 million on the non-accrual interest recoveries.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Moss from B. Riley FBR. Your line is open.","SteveMoss","Good morning. Just following up on Erika's comments around loan yields. One -month LIBOR has come off a couple of basis points and you guys are seems to be gradually hedging over the course of the year, which should pressure your loan yields incrementally. Just kind of wondering where you think if LIBOR stays stable here, one-month LIBOR especially, around 248, do you think we see maybe we continue to see five handle by year-end on average loan yields or does that -- do you assume in your model, in your NII guide that goes below 5%?","MuneeraCarr","Okay. So in the first quarter our loan yields were 5.07% and rate rise is clearly the biggest driver of loan yield. And so as the Fed pauses, at least that particular benefit by the time being is also on a pause. But we are maintaining our cycling discipline and so I don't really expect any compression from a Fed standpoint. And then beyond that you've got the small impact of non-accrual interest recoveries that I just mentioned. And portfolio mix as the year goes on; we'll have a minor impact on loan yields as well. But generally I would expect them to be more or less stable.","End of Q&A","Operator","I have no further questions in queue.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Brent. Good morning. And welcome to Comerica\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curt Farmer; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile; and Executive Vice President of the Business Bank, Pat Faubion.","A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC\u2019s Web site, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, comerica.com. As we review our fourth quarter results, we will be referring to the slides which provide additional details on our earnings.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements.

Babb Jr.","Good morning. Today, we reported fourth quarter 2015 net income of $130 million or $0.71 per share and full-year 2015 net income of $535 million or $2.92 per share. We remain focused on the long-term and executing on our relationship banking strategy as we navigate our way through a modestly growing U.S economy and increasing regulatory and technology demands.","Turning to Slide 4 and highlights from fiscal year 2015, we had good broad based loan and deposit growth in 2015, average loans increased $2 billion or 4% to $48.6 billion, most notable were increases in technology and life sciences, mortgage banker finance, national dealer services and commercial real estate.","Our average total deposits grew $3.5 billion or 6% to a record $58.3 billion. This included a $3.1 billion or 12% increase in non-interest bearing deposits as well as a $474 million increase in interest bearing deposits. We saw growth in all business lines and all three of our major markets as our customers have a lot of liquidity and choose to hold it at Comerica.","We generated close to $1.7 billion of net interest income in 2015, an increase of $34 million or 2%, primarily the result of our solid loan growth. Overall, credit quality continued to be strong with net charge-offs of $75 million or 15 basis points of average loans for the full-year which remains well below normal historical levels.","The allowance for loan losses increased $40 million compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in reserves related to energy and technology and life sciences, partially offset by improvements in credit quality and the remainder of the portfolio. This resulted in the provision for credit losses increasing from the 2014 cyclical low of $27 million to $122 million for 2015.","Year-over-year non-interest income was stable, excluding the change to the accounting presentation for a card program. We had increases in card fees, deposit service charges and fiduciary income. This was offset by lower investment banking income primarily due to less activity in the energy market as well as decreases in certain categories impacted by regulatory changes such as letters of credit.","Excluding the impact of a change to the accounting presentation for a card program, non-interest expenses increase $38 million, primarily due to increases in technology, regulatory and pension expenses as well as outside processing fees tied to revenue generating activities. This was partially offset by the release of litigation reserves and cost savings realized in 2015 from certain actions taken in the second half of 2014.","We repurchased 5.1 million shares and 500,000 warrants in 2015 under our equity repurchase program. Through the buyback and dividends we returned $389 million or 73% of 2015 net income to shareholders. This reflects our strong capital position and solid financial performance. Our tangible book value per share increased 4% over the past year to $39.41 as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value.","Turning to Slide 5 and an overview of the fourth quarter, average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter. And average deposits increased $596 million driven by a $1 billion increase in non-interest bearing deposits.","Revenue increased more than 2% compared to the third quarter. This was a result of growth in net interest income which benefited from higher non-accrual interest recoveries and the rise in rates late in the quarter, as well as an increase in fee generation particularly commercial lending and card fees. Technology and regulatory costs drove non-interest expenses higher as anticipated.","Negative credit migration in our energy exposure continued as expected, while overall our customers have been acting prudently as evidenced by declining loan balances. The remainder of the loan book continues to perform well. Finally, we benefited from lower taxes as a result of the early termination of certain leverage lease transactions.","Turning to Slide 6, most U.S economic data at year-end showed ongoing momentum, which we expect to continue through 2016. Looking at economic conditions within our primary footprint of Texas, California, and Michigan, we continue to see the advantages of our geographic diversity. While Texas is facing headwinds from the energy cycle, California and Michigan provide an important counterbalance.","Average loans in California were up 8% compared to 2014, while deposits were up 10%. California continues to be a leader in bringing new technology to market. Housing market should remain strong. Low regional unemployment rates will contribute to wage growth, supporting the states large consumer sector. We expect the California economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2016.","Average loans in Michigan were relatively stable compared to 2014, while deposits were up 4%. Michigan\u2019s economy has benefited from the recovery of the U.S auto industry. We expect ongoing job growth to keep labor markets tight and wages improving.","Average growth slowed in Texas with loans up 2% and deposits relatively stable compared to 2014. The overall Texas economy should feel the weight of reduced oil and natural gas drilling activity through 2016. However, the states economic diversity and business friendly environment aided by a healthy U.S economy should support economic growth through 2016 albeit at a slower pace.","As we look forward to the year ahead, we remain keenly focused on growing loans and deposits along with managing expenses as we make necessary investments. With the Federal Reserve increasing its benchmark rate, 25 basis points in December, our revenue picture looks better as our balance sheet remains well positioned to benefit from potential rising rates.","With oil prices at a cyclical low, we\u2019ve been closely monitoring our energy customers and have increased our reserves in each quarter of 2015. Well into the cycle we continue to feel comfortable with our energy portfolio and believe charge-offs will remain manageable.","In summary, we\u2019re committed to providing high quality financial services and building lasting customer relationships which combine with our diverse geographic footprint will continue to assist us in building long-term shareholder value.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Karen.","Karen L. Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, fourth quarter average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter. We had strong loan growth in our commercial real estate business as well as our national dealer business which typically rebounds in the fourth quarter. This was more than offset by a seasonal decline in mortgage banker loans along with declines in general middle market and corporate banking, as we remain disciplined in this highly competitive environment. In addition, energy continued to decline as expected.","Positive growth trends through November and December resulted in period end loans above the average for the quarter. As you can see the quarter ended with loans at $49.1 billion. Total loan commitments were relatively stable and utilization was unchanged at 50%. Importantly, our pipeline remains strong.","Our fourth quarter loan yield increased 7 basis points as shown in the diamonds. We had higher interest collected on non-accrual loans and benefited from a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rate late in the quarter as the Fed raised its benchmark rate on December 16.","Turning to deposits on Slide 8, average deposits increased $596 million in the fourth quarter, from a $1 billion increase in non-interest bearing deposits. The primary driver as a large increase in corporate banking which was partly offset by declines in technology and life sciences along with general middle market, as we adjust pricing on municipal deposits to reflect the impact of the liquidity coverage ratio.","Period end deposits also increased $1.1 billion to $59.9 billion. We continue to prudently manage deposit pricing and have not instituted any standard pricing adjustments in response to the increase in short-term rates. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market and we believe we\u2019re well positioned with predominantly operational relationship oriented deposits.","As we discussed at a recent investor conference during the fourth quarter, we deployed a portion of our excess reserves into securities as shown on Slide 9. Given our continued deposit growth and the likelihood of rate increases occurring in small increments over a longer period of time, in the fourth quarter we added almost $2 billion primarily in treasury security. This strategy generates an additional income while maintaining our asset sensitive position.","At this time we expect to potentially and modestly add to our securities portfolio based on the movement of our balance sheet and interest rate along with market opportunities. By carefully managing the overall portfolio, we\u2019ve maintained an estimated duration of under four years.","As you can see in the diamonds on the slide, our portfolio yield was stable, resulting from a small decrease in the MBS premium amortization, offsetting the mix impact from adding lower yield in treasury securities.","Going forward, assuming no change in the rate environment, we expect continued minor pressure on the average securities yield primarily due to the mix shift. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the phased-in 2017 requirements plus a buffer.","Turning to Slide 10, net interest income grew $11 million or 3% in the fourth quarter. The biggest driver came from the loan portfolio which contributed $5 million. Higher interests received on non-accrual loans and an interest in loan yields due to the rise in rates was only partially offset by the decline in lower loans and lower accretion.","Our largest security portfolio, lower funding costs and higher interest earned on short-term investments including higher Federal Reserve deposit balances, each added $2 million. The decline in our wholesale funding cost was driven by debt maturity late in the third quarter along with lower interest paid due to the decline in interest bearing deposits.","Our net interest margin increased 4 basis points with higher loan yields offset by higher balances at the Fed.","Turning to Slide 11, our overall credit picture remains solid. Net charge-offs were 21 basis points or $26 million derived mainly from loans related to energy and to a lesser extend technology and life sciences with strong recoveries in a number of our business lines.","Our criticized loans grew $295 million to $3.2 billion which is less than 7% of total loans and continues to be below our average historical levels. The increase was driven by a $372 million increase in criticized loans related to energy. Total non-accrual loans were relatively stable at $367 million or 75 basis points of total loans.","With energy comprising a $161 million, up from a $126 million in the third quarter. The fall re-determination process is essentially complete for our E&P customers, which comprise 69% of our energy business line. Borrowing bases have come down about 10% on average as a result of lower energy prices. About 45% of our customers have improved or stable loan to value ratio and there have been few new collateral deficiency since the prior re-determination.","Overall, our borrowers continue to act prudently in this environment. They\u2019re aggressively reducing costs, cutting back on capital expenditures, reworking their hedging contracts to provide more runway and preserving liquidity. In addition, they\u2019re paying down bank debt through the sale of assets. As a result, our loans and our energy line of business declined by $173 million this quarter and are down approximately $700 million from the peak at the end of February. And utilization remained essentially unchanged at 49% as of the end of the third quarter.","Importantly, we have virtually no second lien exposure and our energy services portfolio is a relatively small amount of our total loans. However, given persistently low oil and gas prices, we continue to see negative migration in the energy book, which has resulted in an increase in criticized loans, non-accrual loans and charge-offs.","As of quarter end, 38% of the loans related to energy were considered criticized, including 4% on non-accrual. We have $27 million in charge-offs and our energy business line and $6 million in energy related loans.","The $35 million provision for our total portfolio reflected charge-offs as well as an increase in our energy reserves in conjunction with the negative migration and preserving a healthy qualitative reserve.","As of quarter end, our reserve allocation for energy loans increased and is now greater than 4% of our total energy and energy related loan. Overall, our allowance for credit losses increased $9 million to total $679 million and our allowance to loan ratio increased to 1.29%.","Slide 12, outlines non-interest income which increased $6 million or 2%. The biggest driver was an $8 million increase in commercial lending fees due to robust year-end closing activity, particularly in our syndication area. We also had increases in card fees due to higher revenue from merchant processing, along with letter of credit and foreign exchange income as we continue to focus on cross-sell opportunity.","We did see declines in service charges on deposits due to five fewer business days in the quarter, as well as fiduciary and brokerage income which were impacted by poor market environment.","In addition, we had several items that are difficult to predict. Specifically, a $6 million increase in deferred compensation which has offset a non-interest expense, a $4 million decrease in customer related warrant income and a $3 million benefit in the third quarter from hedges on our debt that wasn\u2019t repeated in the fourth quarter.","As a reminder, the year-over-year view of both non-interest income and non-interest expense is not directly comparable. Each quarter this year reflects an accounting presentation that report to both revenues and expenses, rather than net revenue for our card program.","Turning to Slide 13, non-interest expenses increased $28 million. Included in the increase were $6 million in benefits in the third quarter that were not repeated. From legal reserve releases and forfeiture of executive stock awards. In addition, deferred compensation expense increased $6 million and is offset in revenue as mentioned.","Staff insurance and consulting expenses were seasonally higher and salaries expenses increased with higher technology and regulatory related staffing, including contract labor. Also of note, outside processing fees declined with vendor credit an unusually large collection of customer reimbursement.","Moving to Slide 14 and capital management. As the chart indicates, we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way with a payout of 79% of fourth quarter earnings. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $65 million under the equity repurchase program, reflecting a moderate increase from the $59 million repurchased in each of the past six quarters.","Turning to Slide 15, as typical we provide our outlook for the full-year based on a continuation of the current economic and interest rate environment. Overall, we expect our average loan growth to be inline with GDP growth. We expect loan growth in most businesses led by commercial real estate, auto dealer, and technology and life sciences.","If oil and gas prices remain at low levels, we believe energy loan should continue to decline. Also keep in mind competition remains stiff, particularly in corporate banking and we fully intend to maintain our loan pricing and credit discipline.","We expect our net interest income to increase. Assuming current rates do not change, our model indicates that the full-year benefit of the recent increase in short-term rates should increase our net interest income by more than $60 million. And while not included in this outlook we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from any further rate increases which I will discuss on the next slide.","We also expect the growth in loans and securities net of funding costs to have a positive effect. We expect continued solid credit quality with net charge-offs remaining below historical norms. As far as provision, we expect an increase in reserves in conjunction with loan growth and potential further deterioration in overall credit quality, including an increase in net charge-offs from cyclically low level.","If energy prices remain at these very low levels, we would expect to see further reserve build and ultimately higher charge-offs. But remember our energy business strategy is underwritten to withstand typical volatility in the sector. So we continue to expect the credit impacts from energy to be manageable.","Overall, we expect non-interest income to grow modestly primarily due to growth in merchant processing services, government card, and commercial card fees, as we continue to focus on cross-sell opportunities. And assuming that the market conditions improve, we expect an increase in wealth management related income, such as brokerage service fees and fiduciary income where we continue to see a strong pipeline from our trust alliance program.","Non-customer category such as warrant income, hedge and effectiveness and deferred comp are difficult to predict, but are expected to have a small negative impact. As far as non-interest expenses, we\u2019ve been and will continue to manage through to near-term expense headwinds.","2015 benefited from a $33 million legal reserve reversal that will be essentially offset by an equal decline in our pension expense, primarily due to a rise in long-term rates. As we\u2019ve indicated, we expect technology projects and regulatory expenses will continue to rise and together increased by about $25 million to $30 million in 2016 as we continue to invest to meet increasing industry compliance and regulatory demand as well as enhancements in our cyber security.","Outside processing expense is expected to increase inline with growing revenue, particularly card fees. Also a recent regulatory proposal for an FDIC surcharge may drive that expense up. And a forfeiture of restricted stock and leverage lease terminations that benefited 2015 are not expected to be repeated.","Finally, we expect to see typical inflationary pressures on several line items, including annual merit, staff insurance and occupancy. Rest assured that as we continue to navigate through this low rate environment, and even as rates rise, we\u2019re focused on maintaining our expense discipline, carefully managing our workforce and driving efficiency for the long-term through continued review of processes, judiciously negotiating contracts, and leveraging technology when possible. We expect these efforts will be apparent in several line items, such as consulting, telecom, travel and entertainment, and legal fees. Lastly, well not on the slide, I\u2019d point out that we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 32% of pre-tax income.","Turning to Slide 16, as I mentioned our outlook assumes the current rate environment and no rise in rates. For illustrative purposes, we run a simulation using the implied forward curve for 30 day LIBOR, the rate to which we are most sensitive. On the left side of the slide we show the forward curve that assumes 30 day LIBOR reaches about 100 basis points at year-end or 90 basis points on average in the fourth quarter. In this case which incorporates a dynamic balance sheet assuming historical relationships, our net interest income could increase a further $55 million to $60 million for the full-year.","The right side of the slide provides our standard asset liability case and shows that a 200 basis point increase in rates over a one-year period equivalent to a 100 basis points on average would result in a benefit to net interest income of about $210 million. There are also several alternative assumptions to our standard case including the pace of deposit, loan and rate changes and in all cases we remain well positioned for rising rates.","In closing, we are pleased with the increase in our revenue and continued deposit growth. And our overall credit quality has remained strong as we\u2019ve been navigating the energy cycle. While remains a challenging environment for us and the industry, given the persistently low rate and energy price environment combined with increased regulatory requirements and technology demand, we will continue to be keenly focused on the long-term and the things we can control. And with the first rate increase behind us, our revenue picture looks better.","Now operator, we would like to open-up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neil. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. Good morning. I think first question I was hoping you could address the energy reserve in a little more detail. So the 4% reserve could certainly prove sufficient, but just given that others are now disclosing higher reserves than I think the credit markets are suggesting, even higher loss potential just would be curious to hear your expanded thoughts and then I think the second part of that question is just that there is of course now an enormous mismatch between what it might cost to -- cost you guys to beef up the reserve even more materially versus the market cap that that\u2019s been lost on concerns about the reserve. So if you can just sort of address both of those that would be great please.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Okay. Pete, you want to start?","Peter W. Guilfoile","Sure. So every energy portfolio is unique and I think it would be inaccurate to say that every bank has allocated the same amount of reserves to the energy portfolio. So for instance, Scott, when you take a look at our portfolio, as Karen mentioned, we don\u2019t have any second lien debt in our portfolio. For the most part it\u2019s well secured E&P credits. We don\u2019t have much in the way of energy services and the portfolio continues to contract and is throwing out a fair amount of reserves. The other thing I would mention that\u2019s important is that when we\u2019re calculating that allocation including the denominator is all of our energy related exposure, which includes investment grade credit, it includes middle market credits that may or may not be impacted all by energy prices. And then, I guess the last thing that we look at is we have $680 million of reserves in total and because we don\u2019t have other issues going on in the portfolio, we look at that entire reserve is available to address any issues that come up in energy.","Karen L. Parkhill","And I\u2019d add Scott, that remember our reserve at year-end of over 4% does continue to include a healthy qualitative reserve. And we recognize that prices have dropped a decent amount since year-end. It is really difficult to say with any degree of certainty what that impact could be, because prices are only one component on our reserve. There are lots of other components that impact our customers\u2019 performance. They would include continued reduction in cash costs and ability to sell assets, extension of hedges and access to the capital markets. But know that because prices have dropped precipitously, particularly since year-end, we have done an analysis with oil prices remaining at $30 for the entire year. And based on that analysis and conservatively assuming a static portfolio, we\u2019d estimate that the impact to our energy reserves could be $75 million to a $125 million, which we still believe remains manageable. And I\u2019d also want you to keep in mind that ultimate losses could be much less than that amount. Our energy business line is very granular and we do expect energy loans to continue to decline which does free up reserves. Plus our allowance is also impacted by the performance of the remainder of the portfolio which does continue to improve.","Scott Siefers","Okay. That\u2019s all perfect color. Thank you very much.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning.","Ken Zerbe","Thank you. Good morning. I want to make sure I heard the number right, did you say that from the December rate hike you expect $60 million of increase in NII in 2016?","Karen L. Parkhill","That is correct. We said, we expect more than $60 million next year.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, perfect.","Karen L. Parkhill","And keep in mind that that\u2019s based on the fact that 85% of our loans are floating rate. And we\u2019re assuming deposit assumptions fairly similar to history, because we\u2019ve seen minimal deposit impact both on the amount and on pricing with the initial part of the rate rise, there could be upside to that number.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. And then the question I have on that was if you look at Slide 16, you went through on the LIBOR, if LIBOR goes up I think it was 90 basis points by the end of the year and I\u2019m going to annualize your fourth quarter \u201916 number I think that\u2019s $25 million higher in NII. Just help me understand, so $60 million from 25 basis points, but then a 100 million annualized from 90 basis points in LIBOR. Is that just because you expect deposit [indiscernible] up, or what\u2019s the offset there that would make that disproportionately smaller increase in NII?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, so keep in mind that the model is dynamic and some of the key drivers are the deposit assumption. So according to our standard model, we do assume that as rates rise we would see a moderate decrease in our deposit balance or could see a moderate decrease and that deposit pricing goes in line with history. Because of small increments on this rate rise, perhaps the deposit impact may be less than what we\u2019ve assumed. So it is a dynamic model.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Okay and then just one more question for you. Just in terms of Page 11, when you talk about the energy loans, just want to make sure I think about the energy exposure correctly because you break it out separately. You\u2019ve the $3.1 billion of energy loans, but then a $625 million of other business or other loans that are related to energy that I think you say could be disproportionately negatively impacted. What do you think is structurally different with that $600 million of other energy related loans? I mean from our perspective should we just be lumping the $3.1 billion and the $600 million together in terms of your total exposure?","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Pete?","Peter W. Guilfoile","Yes, that $650 million is actually performing better than the line of business. It consists of a lot of credits that are really not impacted by energy prices. We include in that number any one of our borrowers that drives 50% more of the revenue from the energy sector, some of which is really not impacted by energy prices, so included in that $650 million are investment grade refineries and really just other middle market companies that are fairly not that impacted by low energy prices. So it\u2019s actually performing better than the energy book.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. Thank you.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliot with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning.","Geoffrey Elliot","Good morning. The Shared National Credit Report talked about banks showing flexibility in working with auditors by relaxing leverage covenants and allowing time to curtail borrowing base over advances. Could you talk about how that process works in practice at Comerica?","Karen L. Parkhill","The SNC process [ph].","Geoffrey Elliot","Yes, it was just out of the SNC report from November, and I wondered if you could talk about how that process works at Comerica?","Peter W. Guilfoile","As far as the Shared National Credit exam?","Geoffrey Elliot","As well as -- no, more in terms of showing flexibility when you are working with oil and gas borrowers who are coming up against covenants and where the borrowing base needs to come down.","Peter W. Guilfoile","Yes. So we work very closely with the rest of the bank group when in going through the re-determination process. We are all reviewing the same information of we\u2019ve our own separate engineers that review the engineering reports, but there is the sharing of information that takes place on that analysis. We each do our own risk ratings and so we all determine independently what we think the appropriate rating should be. But I can tell you that we talk a lot and so I think we\u2019ve a good feel for where the other banks are with regard to their view of those credits and they\u2019ve a good view of where we\u2019re -- what our view is. Does that answer your question?","Geoffrey Elliot","I guess partially. And then the follow-up would be, if you are kind of thinking about how you are sharing flexibility with borrowers this time versus in prior cycles, say in 2008, 2009, do you think there are any differences in how you and the other banks are behaving?","Peter W. Guilfoile","No, I think we\u2019re working together with our borrowers to give them flexibility of course. But at the same time, we\u2019re -- I think we\u2019re acting prudently to make sure that we\u2019re protecting on credit losses. I think what\u2019s been really remarkable throughout this downturn is just how well the borrowers are working with the banks as well. And if you take a look at it, Geoffrey, last spring when prices were dropping the access to capital markets proactively to make sure they were not in violation of borrowing bases. In the fall when the capital markets were largely close, they sold assets to reduce their loans outstanding to make sure they\u2019re in compliance with the borrowing bases. So it\u2019s a two way street. I think the borrowers are working well with the banks to make sure they\u2019re staying in compliance and the banks are working with the borrowers to make sure that there -- they\u2019ve the liquidity they need to operate their businesses.","Geoffrey Elliot","Thank you.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. My first question is just a clarity on the expense guidance for 2016. Karen, could you take us through what the puts and takes are relative to the $489 million fourth quarter expense base as we think about the quarter ahead? And also, Wells Fargo gave us a pretty significant dollar number for the estimated quarterly FDIC expense base and I was wondering if you could similarly share your projection with us?","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure. So on expenses we talked about the fact that 2015 did benefit from the legal reserve release and we will have lower pension expense that is pretty much equal to that legal reserve release. We talked about the fact that we got increases in technology and regulatory expense about $25 million to $30 million and outside processing aligned with growing revenue along with typical inflationary pressures and the potential for the FDIC increase. Relative to the fourth quarter, I\u2019d say the fourth quarter is a decent guide, but keep in mind there is lots of moving pieces, particularly on a quarterly basis. Number of days impact the quarter, the first half typically has higher stock and incentive comps and higher seasonal payroll taxes. The second half is impacted by merit raises and increasing staff insurance costs, plus the fourth quarter had items that are not expected to repeat like deferred comps and we continue to manage expenses everywhere that we can. On the FDIC expense in particular, as you know that FDIC did put a proposal out there to increase their deposit insurance bond per Dodd-Frank mandated standard by increasing the rates to the larger banks. While that proposal has -- the comment period has just ended on that, so it\u2019s uncertain what the timing or ultimate impact could be. A good rule of thumb would be approximately maybe $10 million to us in the year.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And as I just put your guidance together, there is clearly a little bit more hesitation by the market to think about rising rates given what\u2019s been happening to the economy outside of the United States. And as I think about your guidance for higher revenues and higher expenses for this year, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re committed to generating positive operating leverage even if -- even outside of the potential impact of any further increases to the short end of the curve?","Karen L. Parkhill","So we\u2019re always very focused on generating positive operating leverage. We\u2019ve been very focused on managing our expenses as prudently as we can while we need to invest in increased regulation in technology. That said, our ultimate performance, particularly in 2016 will be dependent in part on where rates go. Keep in mind that we have a good benefit from the rate rise that has already occurred and will ultimately depend on the energy sector. But regardless we remain very focused on positive operating leverage, particularly over the long-term.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Alexopoulos","Good morning, everybody. I wanted to start looking at the $1.2 billion of criticized energy loans; could you give us the breakdown of that into E&P, midstream, and services?","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Pete?","Peter W. Guilfoile","Sure. Steven, its 45% E&P, about 9% midstream, and 48% services. And then there is 30% that\u2019s in the related category.","Steven Alexopoulos","Related, okay, perfect. That\u2019s very helpful. I wanted to talk about hedging for a second. Could you just looking at your customers, talk about what level of production was hedged in 2015 and how that\u2019s going to change in 2016?","Peter W. Guilfoile","Right now we\u2019ve 59% of our borrowers that have 50% or more of the revenue hedged out one year and then drops off to 30% after that. And so those percentages really haven\u2019t changed a lot over the last several quarters. Now the value of those hedges has dropped as borrowers rework their hedges to get extend the runway, but the -- I think the good thing here is that borrowers are actively working to extend the runway and as they extend the runway they\u2019re making good progress on reducing their cost structure.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. So you are saying 50% in 2015 and then that falls to 30% in 2016 -- that\u2019s what you are saying?","Peter W. Guilfoile","I\u2019m sorry, say that again please.","Steven Alexopoulos","Did you say 50% was hedged in 2015 and that\u2019s falling down to 30% in 2016?","Peter W. Guilfoile","Yes. So 30% -- no, 30% two years out beyond 2016. Yes beyond 2016 30% have 50% or more of their revenue hedged. So that -- those percentages I just gave you are the -- are only customers that have 50% or more of their revenues hedged. We are not counting in those percentages companies that have less than 50% of their revenue hedged and a lot of them do.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Just one other question. Looking at the technology life sciences business, it looks like balances were down sequentially both loans and deposits. Can you talk about the impact that sector is having on that business? Thanks.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Pat?","J. Patrick Faubion","Steve, this is Pat. We\u2019ve seen a bit of a softness in the BC market, that\u2019s because firms are exercising more cautious following several years of really strong investment and high valuations. There had been some challenging verticals like cyber security ad-tech, but -- so we\u2019re watching that carefully that we do expect a good year in 2016 in our technology vertical [ph].","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Thanks for all the color.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. Back to energy; want to get a little bit more detail on the reserve adequacy. Can you give us the breakout of the reserve as it pertains to E&P versus oil service?","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Pete?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, we don\u2019t typically give that kind of detail. We have talked about we got greater than 4% of reserves against those energy and energy related. And that we believe that reserves from here could be manageable.","Peter W. Guilfoile","Maybe I could give a little bit of color depending on John what you would like to understand better, but obviously while we\u2019re doing the re-determinations this fall, energy prices were dropping. And so the price decks that we were using on a regular basis to do that re-determinations ultimately ended up being higher than were prices ended up at the end of the year. And so we made up that difference with a qualitative reserve at the end of the quarter to adjust for the fact that prices had dropped from the time we\u2019re doing the re-determinations to the end of the quarter.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And do you break out the qualitative versus the specific?","Peter W. Guilfoile","No.","Karen L. Parkhill","No, we don\u2019t give the specifics on that, but again we do maintain qualitative reserve.","John Pancari","Okay. And then another thing, I know you mentioned this in your comments, or you referred to it, but do you\u2019ve what percentage of your energy book is investment grade versus non-investment grade borrowers?","Peter W. Guilfoile","That we would say most of the investment grade borrowers would be in the energy related and many of those borrowers don\u2019t borrow a lot of money. And so in terms of the actual dollars outstanding, I don\u2019t have a figure for you, but its not a huge amount.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. And then lastly, thanks for the sensitivity on oil remaining at $30. However, since we did see oil break into the 20s for a little while there, what if oil drops and remains in the 20s? Can you give us that sensitivity because that\u2019s where you get a big change for a lot of these producers where they really have a problem with the production costs, etcetera? Thanks.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, our reserves and our pricing analysis take into account the forward curve which typically upward sloping. So the number that we gave you on the $30 for 12 months have a flat curve, not upward sloping. So keep that in mind. These are rough numbers, so I\u2019m not going to give you one that\u2019s in the 20s, but you can assume slightly worse than the one we gave you if it\u2019s in the 20. So keep in mind this is a very dynamic equation and very typically the price environment forward curve is going to be upward sloping.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. If I can ask one housekeeping, non-energy. On the loan balances at the end of period came in a good amount above the average, which is a better one to work off of?","Karen L. Parkhill","We focus on average more than we focus on end of period mainly because that\u2019s what drive our financial statement. We do see end of period activity in both loans and deposits and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we don\u2019t focus on it. But I do think it\u2019s a good thing that our end of period balances are above our average for the quarter that bodes well for the start of this quarter.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning, Terry.","Terry McEvoy","Good morning. Just to take a step back and a question for Ralph. In the past when there has been some weakness in Comerica\u2019s business, the Company has moved resources and capital to some other markets or other lines of business. So you were in Michigan, you moved to Texas, when commercial loans were a little soft you talked more about wealth management, etcetera. So my question is, strategically if Texas continues to contract, how do you fill in that hole in terms of where or potentially some additional products?","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","I think you described it well. We are always looking at where our resources are and we move those resources and where we invest based on what\u2019s going on partly because of the economy and the short-term, but also on the longer term. And when Karen was talking about expense management earlier, a lot of that\u2019s built into that and we\u2019re looking all the time where we need to be, where we need to add people, at the same time where we don\u2019t need additional people as an example. And we got a very tenured good team and that\u2019s very important and that\u2019s the reason they\u2019re movable as well. Pete, you\u2019ve moved around a couple of times as an example.","Peter W. Guilfoile","Yes, all three markets, yes.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Yes. Curt, would you like to add something to that?","Curtis C. Farmer","Just maybe to reinforce what you\u2019re saying there Ralph, the California market is continuing to do well overall. Real estate value is firming in both the north and the south, a diverse economy. Technology is still doing well despite a little bit of softness and so some of our resource reallocation is to California right now. As we continue to round out the large urban markets there, but we also beyond just line of business continue to focus on the fee income businesses within the corporation, so we\u2019ve been a net investor in wealth management adding additional advisors, especially in the trust and brokerage area. We\u2019ve been adding resources in some of the card areas, merchant added a new vendor there. So we\u2019re looking at it all of the time. It is a constant process of reviewing our lines of business. The ROEs that are being generated by the respective businesses and where we think we\u2019ve the greatest growth opportunity, but also where that matches up with where our greatest customer needs are as well.","Terry McEvoy","Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, you did release reserves in the non-energy portfolio and based on your outlook today for \u201916, do you foresee additional reserve releasing outside of energy really to help offset that potential $75 million to $125 million incremental reserves in energy that Karen identified earlier on the call?","Peter W. Guilfoile","Yes, we continue to see really great results outside of energy and as you mentioned about one-third of the migration in energy was offset by improvements elsewhere in the portfolio. The far that you go in the cycle, the harder and harder it is to get those [indiscernible] dividends, but the rest of the portfolios is really strong and I do expect to continue to see some improvement there.","Terry McEvoy","Thank you.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Eads with UBS. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning, David.","David Eads","Hi. Good morning. Maybe just one kind of question on NII and NIM. Just in thinking about the outlook and a starting point for heading into next year, is the right way to think about it that you kind of back out some of the benefit from the non-accrual interest in 4Q and then you would add in the benefit from the first rate hike, which very little of that was seen in 4Q and then you would have the day count impact in 1Q? Is that kind of the right puts and takes to think about starting off next year?","Karen L. Parkhill","Those are the right high level for puts and takes, yes.","David Eads","Okay. And then for the share buybacks, should we think about the 4Q level as kind of the right run rate for the first two quarters of the year, or could there be a little bit of increase related to the income from rate? And then I guess do you have any flexibility on when you could do the buybacks in the last two quarters of this cycle?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, so on share repurchase we have said that we will be monitoring that on a quarterly basis. And that it will follow our financial performance and our balance sheet movement including our capital levels. So it is something that we will be looking at and monitoring every quarter. As you know we\u2019ve $393 million not objected to in the last capital plan. We obviously did increase our share repurchases this quarter and we will be looking at each quarter in isolation, but against our performance.","David Eads","Okay. And then just finally, there was this fall SNC review for the largest banks. Were the results for that included in 4Q results and -- was there anything interesting coming out of that?","Peter W. Guilfoile","Yes, they were included in the fourth quarter and now there was really no major impact on our portfolio at all.","David Eads","Great. Thanks.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Ramsey","Hey, good morning. Just a few follow-ups. One, I know you talked about how strong credit has been outside of the energy book of business. I\u2019m just curious, are you seeing any signs of softness or any areas where there might be signs of any sort of concern?","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Pete, Pat?","Peter W. Guilfoile","Go ahead.","J. Patrick Faubion","Bob, this is Pat. We are always on the look out for hot pockets or deterioration. I can tell you that we have thoroughly reviewed our commercial real estate portfolio, particularly with multifamily. We feel very, very good about that. We reviewed our technology sector. We feel good about that despite a bit of increased credit costs. Middle market is really, really performing quite well, dealer superlative. I can go down the list. We have a really, really strong credit culture here and we work very well between our credit partners and the line.","Peter W. Guilfoile","And if I could just add one of the reasons why we\u2019re very proactively moved our number of credits from other business units into this energy related portion of the book is that we expect that some of those credits might show some deterioration as energy prices decreased and so we lumped those in with our energy exposure. And so everything outside of that ex-energy, if you will, is really not been very impacted.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. On the share repurchase question, I know you guys said you look at it relative to the balance sheet every quarter. Just curious if trading below tangible book, if that in any way affects your appetite to put something in one quarter versus another, or if that is one of the bigger determinants of when you decide to buy?","Karen L. Parkhill","Clearly we like buying our stock back at these very low prices. And that said, our capital plan is done on a quarterly basis and any changes to timing or amounts would require regulatory approval.","Bob Ramsey","Okay, got it. Last question, back to margin, just want to be sure I understood correctly the numbers you guys break out on Slide 16 of the slide deck, that is on top of the $60 million benefit that you already expect to achieve from the one rate increase that\u2019s already taken place, correct?","Karen L. Parkhill","That\u2019s correct.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. And is it fair to take that $60 million and sort of just run rate it at $15 million a quarter and we should see a $15 million lift here in the first quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, you could think about the $60 million or more than $60 million that we have from the rate rise that is already occurred to be fairly even in each quarter. Obviously, we would expect the biggest impact quarter-over-quarter to be in the first quarter given that we will have a full quarter impact of the rate rise as opposed to just a few week impact.","Bob Ramsey","Sure. Okay, great. And then I\u2019m just curious how you all are sort of thinking about rates from here. If you could maybe share your interest rate forecast through the end of the year?","Karen L. Parkhill","It\u2019s very difficult to predict rates and we don\u2019t have a crystal ball, just like you don\u2019t. And that\u2019s the reason that we give our outlook assuming rates don\u2019t rise, because its not really something that we can predict.","Peter W. Guilfoile","Right.","Bob Ramsey","Okay, great. And last question around rates, for the next 25 basis points if we get another 25 basis points, I know you\u2019ve given sort of the LIBOR scenario on that Slide 16, but do you see something similar to that $60 million benefit from the first on the second, or does it start to diminish? I get there are moving pieces with deposit assumptions.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, there are moving pieces with deposit assumptions and our model that we\u2019ve shown on that Slide 16 does include deposit decline and betas moving inline with history. So who knows how it will actually go, but we do expect less pressure on deposits in the early rate rises, particularly this first rate rise and perhaps maybe the second 25 could be.","Bob Ramsey","Okay, great. Thank you very much for taking the questions.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning, Brett.","Brett Rabatin","Good morning, Ralph. Wanted just to circle back to Texas and I think last quarter you kind of talked about recession and some of the markets in Texas not doing as well. Can you maybe give us an update on kind of how you feel about the markets in Texas? And then just thinking about the loan growth guidance that you\u2019re giving for this year, obviously energy is a downdraft, would Texas in general also outside of energy be a headwind or can you give us some thoughts on how you see that market?","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Pat, you want to start that?","J. Patrick Faubion","Sure. Texas has tempered somewhat with respect to the robust growth that we experienced a number of years ago. We were seeing 10% loan growth year-after-year. We saw 2% last year and deposits were stable. But Texas is still experiencing positive population growth, business friendly environment, low cost housing, clinical labor, so don\u2019t count Texas out of the equation. And I would like to say we still have positive loan growth in the fourth quarter from our other businesses, had it not been for energy. Regarding the specific geographies, Houston will be the most impacted. Dallas has a very robust economy as does Fort Worth. Austin is a technology oriented city and government being the capital city. They\u2019re not immune, but other than Houston we\u2019re seeing really relatively less impact compared to Houston.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Overall looking at a positive GDP for the state, even though its going to be significantly lower from where its been was the last numbers I saw from our radar \u2026","J. Patrick Faubion","Yes.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","\u2026 our economists.","J. Patrick Faubion","And the direct percentage of energy impact attributed to energy is about 15%. Obviously, the ripple effect is much larger than that.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. And then just wanted to go back to energy for a second. I know you guys don\u2019t have that much exposure on second lien type facilities, but as we\u2019ve seen change here with the Company\u2019s underlying fundamentals in the credits where you are SNC related, has there been efforts to keep those companies from dealing those type of credits, or are you guys letting those facilities increase? And maybe give us some thoughts on how you view leverage at your client base on the energy portfolio.","J. Patrick Faubion","Pete?","Peter W. Guilfoile","So when you go through the re-determination process with the E&P companies, if there is a violation at the borrowing base, the loan agreement typically requires that they get back within that borrowing base within six months. And so far with very few exceptions that has happened. And so we\u2019re not seeing the bank being asked to take on any kind of second lien piece or something like that. Having said that, in addition to the half dozen or so companies that have collateral deficiencies right now, we probably have another \u201910 or so that have what we\u2019d call elevated loan to values. And so those we might be fairly comfortable with, because there is other mitigating factors, but I wouldn\u2019t call them second lien pieces at all, they are just higher loan to values for a variety of reasons.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Darst with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning, David.","David Darst","Good morning. Could you comment on the dealer finance business? Looking at the past year, what percentage of the growth has been market share versus your dealers holding more inventory?","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Okay. Pat?","J. Patrick Faubion","Well, we clearly benefited in dealer, because of our dealership for growing. I don\u2019t have a breakdown of new credit relationship. With auto sales reaching a record in 2015, that clearly fairly buoyed our loan production.","David Darst","And do you have a perspective from talking to your dealers on what they might hold in inventory the next 12 months and where we\u2019re in the audit cycle?","J. Patrick Faubion","The outlook for the [audit] cycle continues to be very strong. So we\u2019re expecting a good year in \u201916. The dealer business overall is a consolidating business and hopefully we will be on the positive end of the consolidation as well.","David Darst","Okay, got it. And then just in your technology investments, is the government card program requiring any larger level of investment than it has in the past for cyber security?","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Curt, will you take that?","Curtis C. Farmer","Yes, I think it would be the same as we\u2019d see across all of our businesses and our businesses are card related.","David Darst","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Holland with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Holland","Good morning. Actually, my questions have been covered already so I\u2019m all set. Thank you.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Sterne, Agee CRT.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning, Peter.","Peter Winter","I just had a couple questions on the loan growth. Commercial real estate including residential construction was very strong, first time in a while. And I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s going on there and if it\u2019s sustainable? And then conversely, general middle market continues to be a little bit weak, but you\u2019ve got nice growth in the California and Michigan economies.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Pat?","J. Patrick Faubion","Yes. On commercial real estate, we\u2019re finally seeing some good growth in the portfolio as the projects burn through the front-end equity and get into the drop period and we hope to benefit from that in 2016. What we experienced is a tremendous amount of churn in the portfolio. Our approvals and fundings have remained at a very high level, but previously projects have been paid off just assume as they reach to stabilization point. So our visibility into the CRE line is pretty good and we do expect good fundings for the year. Regarding middle market, you are correct that California really did lead our growth across all the markets. We had great growth in middle market in California as well as in deposits. What we\u2019re seeing across the portfolio is a very competitive environment and we\u2019re holding to our credit standards and our credit pricing.","Peter Winter","Got it. Thank you.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laurie Hunsicker with Compass Point. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning.","Laurie Hunsicker","Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on where Bob Ramsey was going and I just wondered if you could help us think more broadly, Karen, about potential contagion and maybe if you can just put some numbers around your $3.8 billion of commercial real estate. How much of that is operating in the oil patch areas, and maybe what reserves you see or how you see that going if oil stays at $30? Thanks.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Pat, you want to start that? Pete and Karen can \u2026","J. Patrick Faubion","Our commercial real estate portfolio is not in the oil patch, except [technical difficulty] consider Houston in the oil patch. Houston is obviously a large urban market. We do have a number of multifamily projects in the Houston market. We\u2019ve taken a very good look at that. They\u2019re on plan. They\u2019re with proven developers, well located. We have seen some amount of rent concessions, but our projects are really on track. With respect to the rest of the portfolio, it\u2019s in densely populated areas with proven developers with lots of equity in front of us.","Peter W. Guilfoile","And if I could just add a little bit of that more to what Pat said, we did a pretty extensive stress test on the Houston commercial real estate portfolio this quarter and we\u2019re quite pleased with the results. And we stressed it under three different conditions. The worst, the severely adverse case under conditions that we\u2019ve never seen before and even under those conditions we didn\u2019t see any credit losses in the portfolio. So that commercial real estate portfolio in Houston is really been dealt to withstand the ups and downs to the oil and gas cycle. And then, again as we mentioned before, any credits at all that we were concerned about that could be impacted by lower energy prices, we are moved into that energy related book. And so that we count that in our energy exposure, even though a large number of those credits have not been impacted, we were concerned that they could be. So I think that\u2019s why we are not -- you\u2019re not seeing a lot of contagion outside of that energy exposure that we report.","Laurie Hunsicker","Got it. And I guess to that point, so how much of your $3.8 billion in CRE sits in Houston? And then of the $625 million of related loans, how much of that is commercial real estate?","Peter W. Guilfoile","Yes, so our commercial real estate book in total is about $3.8 billion in loans outstanding. About $300 million of it is in Houston and as Pat mentioned the vast majority of it is multifamily. In Houston, we\u2019ve virtually no office in Houston. Its primarily an apartment construction book.","Laurie Hunsicker","Great. Okay. And then of your $625 million in related loans, was there any from that $300 million Houston bucket?","Peter W. Guilfoile","No, we -- our definition of energy related is the borrower has to generate 50% or more of its revenue from the energy sector and by definition commercial real estate really doesn\u2019t fall into that category. That\u2019s why we stress test the commercial real estate both in Houston, because it kind of sell outside of that energy related piece and that\u2019s the one piece outside of energy related that we have our eye on and so we wanted to just satisfy ourselves that there weren\u2019t issues there.","Laurie Hunsicker","Okay, great. And then just one last point of clarity, so your call at $1.1 billion of total Texas commercial real estate exposure, the rest of that is Dallas, Austin -- it\u2019s outside of oil patch?","Peter W. Guilfoile","Correct.","Laurie Hunsicker","Okay.","Peter W. Guilfoile","About third of it is Dallas, 25% is Austin. We don\u2019t have any exposure in West Texas.","Laurie Hunsicker","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of John Moran with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Good morning, John.","John Moran","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick kind of ticky-tack one for Karen on the securities that were added, were all $2 billion [technical difficulty] evenly spread through the quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, the vast majority of that was added in the month of December more towards the end of December as opposed to the beginning.","John Moran","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then one other one just on the taxes and I understand that the leverage lease termination had an impact. Was there an offset elsewhere in the P&L there, anything on OpEx?","Karen L. Parkhill","No, the leverage lease termination did have an impact of about $5 million on a gain and there are other offsets based on the numbers that we reported.","John Moran","Okay. Thanks very much.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ralph Babb, Chairman and CEO for any closing remarks.","Ralph W. Babb Jr.","Thanks for joining our call today and your interest in Comerica.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the call over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. Good morning, and welcome to Comerica's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Participating on this call will be our President and CEO, Curt Farmer; interim CFO, Jim Herzog; Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile; and Executive Director of our business bank, Peter Sefzik. ","During this presentation, we will be referring to slides which provides additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC's website as well as on the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. This conference call contains forward-looking statements, and in that regard you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to materially vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Safe Harbors statement in today's release and Slide 2, which I incorporate into this call as well as our SEC filings for factors that can cause actual results to differ. ","Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures, and in that regard, I direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within the presentation. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Curt, who will begin on Slide 3.","Curtis Farmer","Good morning, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $292 million or $1.96 per share. Our third quarter results demonstrated our ability to drive strong returns with an ROE of 16%, an ROA of 1.6% despite declines in interest rates. Relative to the second quarter, broad-based fee income growth, solid credit quality, the benefit of discrete tax items and continued active capital management were positive contributors to our performance. In addition, our careful cost control helped keep our efficiency ratio low at under 52%. ","Historically, volumes in the third quarter are seasonally weak. This year, average loans were stable compared to the second quarter. Mortgage Banker benefited from robust refi activity along with the normal increase due to summer home sale activity. However, this was offset by the seasonal decline in National Dealer as our customers reduced inventory in anticipation of delivery of 2020 model as well as a difficult summer slowdown in middle market. ","Overall, customer sentiment remains positive, and our pipeline is solid. We are also seeing advancement in a number of initiatives we have undertaken over the past year or so. This includes a new enterprise-wide customer relationship management tool, enhanced marketing analytics and greater efficiency resulting from our credit process redesign. ","Average deposits grew over $700 million relative to the second quarter, including an $850 million increase in customer money market balance and CEs. We have a favorable deposit mix as nearly half are noninterest-bearing, and we believe we will continue to have the lowest component of noninterest-bearing deposits amongst our peers. As we have throughout the cycle, we are carefully managing deposit rates in order to attract and retain relationships. We are closely monitoring the competitive environment and expect to continue to modestly rely on competition in adjusting our rates. Our strategy is working. The growth in relationship deposits allowed us to reduce fire wholesale funding that helped reduce our loan total funding cost to 78 basis points. Also, our loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 91%. ","As far as net interest income, over 80% of our loans are floating rate and primarily tied to 30-day LIBOR, which declined 37 basis points during the quarter. This impact, combined with the growth in interest-bearing deposits, resulted in net interest income of $586 million and a net interest margin of 3.52%. ","We were able to add to $1 billion in swaps in September at relatively attractive rates. Our strategy is to build our hedging program over time, closely monitoring the market and taking advantage of market opportunities as they arise. Credit quality remains solid with net charge-offs at 33 basis points. Similar to the second quarter, charge-offs primarily consisted of valuation impairment on select energy credits as capital markets for this sector remain soft. Nonperforming assets declined and were only 44 basis points of total loans and the provision decreased to $35 million. ","A broad-based increase of $6 million in fee income helped offset the more challenging rate environment. We had good growth in commercial lending, cards and fiduciary income. As expected, increases in salaries and benefits along with higher occupancy and technology costs resulted in $11 million increase in expenses. This is in line with the outlook we have provided for full-year expenses to remain flat, excluding 2018 restructuring cost. We reached our 10% CET1 target at the end of the third quarter. We returned $467 million in capital to shareholders through our dividends, which hereby provides over a 4% return and by repurchasing 5.7 million shares under our share buyback program. ","Relative to the third quarter of last year, our results reflect our ability to generate solid loan growth of nearly 5%, drive fee income growth and maintained our expense discipline. Last year, very strong credit quality resulted in no provision, while this quarter, our provision was more in line with our historical norm. Through active capital management, we have reduced our share count by 13%. Altogether, earnings per share increased 5% year-over-year. ","And now we'll turn the call over to Jim Herzog, who assumed the role of interim CFO last month. Our search process to identify a permanent CFO is underway. Jim has a wealth of knowledge with over 35 years' experience at Comerica and has been our Treasurer for the past 8 years. Jim?","James Herzog","Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4. As Curt indicated, average loans were stable in the third quarter with seasonal decreases in National Dealer and general Middle Market offset by an increase in Mortgage Banker, which also benefited from strong refi volumes. In addition, we had growth in Commercial Real Estate with the largest contribution coming from multifamily activity in California. ","Total period end loans were also stable, essentially reflecting the same activity we saw in the average balances. On a year-over-year basis, we have grown loans $2.3 billion with increases in general Middle Market in all 3 of our markets as well as in many of our specialty areas such as Mortgage Banker, Energy, National Dealer Services, Commercial Real Estate and Environmental Services. Our loan yields were 4.83%, a decrease of 17 basis points for the second quarter. This was a result of lower interest rates, primarily 1-month LIBOR, partly offset by an increase in loan fees and a lease residual adjustment we took in the second quarter that was not repeated. Of note, our full interest recovery remains slightly elevated during the quarter, contributing $4 million. ","Slide 5 provides details on deposits. Average balances increased over $700 million with growth across the majority of business lines and in all 3 of our markets. Noninterest-bearing deposits were stable, while customer interest-bearing balances increased over $800 million. ","The growth in balances and mix shift to higher-yielding products drove a 5 basis point increase in our interest-bearing deposit costs. This is at the lower end of the guidance we'd previously provided. With the decline in interest rates, we've begun to take action to adjust the deposit rates, which I'll discuss further in a moment. ","Now as you can see on Slide 6, our MBS portfolio is stable. The yield on the portfolio held steady. The full quarter benefit of higher-yield in securities reinvested throughout the second quarter was offset by $600 million we reinvested in the third quarter on yields that were mostly lower to portfolio average. Yields on recent purchases have been in the 240 range. The current rate environment has not had a significant impact on our duration or on unamortized premium, which remains relatively small. ","Turning to Slide 7. Net interest income was $586 million and the net interest margin was 3.52%. Loans had a negative impact of $16 million or 13 basis points to the margin. The major factor was lower interest rates, which had a $26 million impact and 15 basis points on the margin. This was partially offset by 1 additional day in the quarter as well as other factors, which I previously outlined. Higher balances of the fed added $2 million but were offset by the lower yield, and combined, had a 2 basis point impact on the margin. Growth in interest-bearing deposits, particularly in higher-yielding products, increased cost by $6 million or 3 basis points of the margin. ","Lower rates reduced wholesale funding costs by $5 million and added 3 basis points to the margin. In summary, the net impact for rates along with higher interest-bearing deposit balances was partially offset by 1 additional day in the quarter. Credit quality remains solid, as shown on Slide 8. Our net charge-offs were $42 million or 33 basis points, which is well within our historical norm of 20 to 40 basis points. ","Excluding Energy, net charge-offs for the remainder of the portfolio were only 6 basis points. This included strong recoveries of $19 million. While total charge-offs were higher, we do not believe this is a trend. The increase in charge-offs was primarily due to the impairment of select energy loans. As we indicated last quarter, valuations of a few liquidating energy assets have been impacted by volatile oil and gas prices and weak capital markets. Nonaccrual loans remained low at $220 million or 43 basis points of our total loans. Criticized loans represent less than 4% of total loans as of quarter end. As far as energy, nonaccrual loans decreased $10 million while criticized loans increased $10 million. We increased our reserve for Energy, which remains at a very healthy level. ","Our reserve ratio held steady at 1.27% and resulted in a provision of $35 million, a decline of $9 million from the second quarter. As far as our adoption of CECL in the first quarter of next year, we are running parallel tests and remain on track for a successful implementation. Given the relatively short duration of our commercially weighted portfolio and expectation of a fairly benign economic environment, we expect the change in reserves will be plus or minus 5%, and therefore, have little impact on our capital ratios. ","Turning to Slide 9, noninterest income, which increased $6 million. Our continued focus on lowering card fees resulted in a $2 million increase. Commercial lending fees also increased $2 million primarily due to strong syndication income. Fiduciary income increased $1 million mainly due to tax preparation fees and higher asset values. We also had small increases in several other categories including letters of credit and foreign exchange. Derivative income declined $1 million due to the impact of lower rates on the credit valuation adjustment. Deferred comp asset returns which were offset in noninterest expenses were $3 million compared to 0 in the second quarter. ","Expenses were well controlled and our efficiency ratio remained low at 52%, as shown on Slide 10. Salaries and benefits increased $8 million as a result of the increase in deferred comp that I previously mentioned as well as seasonally higher health care expense and 1 additional day in the quarter. Also, technology initiatives drove a $2 million increase in software expense. Occupancy expense increased $2 million mainly due to seasonality. ","Turning to slide 11, in the third quarter, we repurchased 5.7 million shares under our share repurchase program, which is nearly 4% of our total shares. On a year-over-year basis, our share count is down 13%. ","Together with dividends, we returned $467 million to shareholders in the third quarter. Our goal is to provide attractive returns to our shareholders by way of the buyback as well as a healthy dividend, which currently has a yield of over 4%. ","Turning to slide 12 and the rate environment. We expect more rates in isolation to have a $35 million impact to fourth quarter net interest income. This includes the full quarter impact from lower rates in the third quarter as well as an anticipated December of fed rate high, which is consistent with our economist view. In swaps, we've added provided $1 million to $2 million benefit. Also, we're expecting interest-bearing deposit costs to decrease 3 to 5 basis points with minimal deposit mix shift. ","While recent economic data has been mixed, the markets are expecting the fed to cut rates again. We've run our standard model with a 25 basis points reduction in rates and a few different deposit beta scenarios as deposit rates are a major variable and will depend on the competition and our need for funding. The estimated impact on net interest income under these scenarios ranges from $65 million to $95 million over a 12-month period. The ultimate outcome for our net interest income depends on a variety of factors, such as the pace at which LIBOR moves, balance sheet movements, and the competitive environment. ","As Curt mentioned, we added $1 billion of interest rate swaps since September. Together with the $2.8 billion in swaps we put on in the first half of the year, the average remaining term of the swap book now sits at 3.3 years with an average received fixed rate of 204 basis points. We continue to closely monitor the market. As we previously shared, our strategy is to make steady progress involving our hedging program over time. Slide 13 provides our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect average loans to remain stable on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Seasonality in the fourth quarter typically drives an increase in National Dealer Services and general Middle Market, and a decrease in Mortgage Banker. While sitting near 70% of our Mortgage Banker volume is tied to purchase activity, we expect to slow it down our refi volumes and further reducing mortgage banking loans. Otherwise, we anticipate growth in several businesses and a small decrease in Energy. ","Given the strong loan performance so far this year, we anticipate reaching the upper end of our previous projection of 3% to 4% growth in full year average loans relative to 2018. We also expect deposit levels to be stable. We remain focused on attracting and retaining relationship deposits, and our strategies are working. As core relationship deposits grow, we plan to manage down brokered deposits. ","As I discussed a moment ago, lower rates are expected to have about a $35 million net impact on net interest income. In addition, we believe the strong third quarter loan fees and nonaccrual interest recoveries are unlikely to repeat. As far as credit, we expect the provision to be between $25 million and $45 million, which includes some potential additional rate of migration in the Energy book. We believe we will continue to have a strong performance in the remainder of the portfolio. ","Excluding deferred comp income of $3 million, which was offset in expenses, it is difficult to predict. Our noninterest income is expected to be relatively stable. We expect modest growth in a number of customer-driven categories, which will likely be more than offset by our reduction in syndication fees and fiduciary income from elevated third quarter levels. With the benefit of the strong third quarter fee income growth, we expect to exceed our previous outlook for noninterest income to grow 1% to 2% on a full year-over-year basis. Expenses are forecasted to increase modestly. We expect to see higher technology costs primarily related to investments in our retail bank, and higher outside processing expenses tied to revenue-generating activities. In addition, seasonal inflationary pressures impact certain expenses, such as occupancy, employee benefits and marketing. On a full-year basis, we expect to continue -- the year's expenses to remain stable, excluding the restructuring charges we incurred last year. ","Finally, we are targeting our CET1 ratio to remain at about 10%. As we determine the pace of the share buybacks, we carefully consider our expected earnings generation, capital needs to fund future loan growth and market conditions. ","Now I'll turn the call back to Curt to provide some closing remarks.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you, Jim. In our 170-year history, we have managed through many different economic, credit and interest rate cycles. The tone of recent conversations I've had and I have had with customers and colleagues across our markets is optimistic, and we continue to see slow, steady economic expansion. With this backdrop, we expect to see loan growth in line with or slightly better than GDP next year as well as modest core deposit growth and continued solid credit quality. ","Yes, with much uncertainty on several fronts, the market is currently pricing in rate cuts. The impact from a profitable reduction in interest rates on our net interest income and pension expense, combined with the inflationary pressures and continued investment in technology, provides headwinds, but we believe they are manageable. In addition, our share repurchase program has allowed us to return excess capital and lower our share count, providing a meaningful benefit to our EPS. ","With our efficiency ratio in the low 50s and an ROE of 15%, we are better positioned to weather changes in the economy or interest rate environment. We remain focused on controlling the things we can control and maintaining our strong performance. We plan to provide a more detailed outlook for 2020 on our next earnings call in January. ","In closing, we believe our Q3 has provided a foundation to drive profitable growth and enhance long-term shareholder value. Specifically, our geographic footprint, which includes faster-growing diverse markets, combined with our relationship banking strategy, is expected to result in growth of loans, deposits and fee income over time. We continue to maintain our prudent expense discipline as we invest for the future. Also, our conservative, consistent approach to banking, including credit and capital management, has positioned us well. ","Now we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Kenneth Zerbe","I guess my first question, just in terms of Slide 12, you provided a $35 million NII impact for a December rate cut. Now I just checked this morning, it looks like the future's curve is building in a 78% probability of an October rate cut. Can you just provide us the sensitivity? If we do get the October cut instead of December, what does that imply for your NII in fourth quarter?","James Herzog","Yes. Thanks, Ken, and good morning. We do feel it is highly probable we will get a rate cut before the end of the year. It is a little less certain that we will get one in October. And the path of LIBOR that would correlate that is also a little less certain. And so we'd likely to go with our economist forecast of a December rate cut. And I would point you to Slide 12 in terms of some of the sensitivities and in total, an October should be somewhat proportional to that. But at this point, we're not providing specific guidance on the October cut just due to the uncertain path of LIBOR.","Kenneth Zerbe","Got you. Okay. I understand. I guess I was just thinking because the future's curve -- like the probability of a rate cut is actually very high. It might make sense to do that, but I appreciate your answer. I guess maybe a different question just in the same slide. The interest-bearing deposit cost going down 3 to 5 basis points, can you just comment like what are you seeing in terms of deposit cost competition? I know you're going to lag peers, but is our peers -- from so far what you see in the fourth quarter, are they only down in the high single digits? Or like how far are you lagging? I'm just curious on overall deposit competition.","Curtis Farmer","Kenneth, this is Curt. I will take that question. We talked about before that on the way up, we lagged in increasing our deposit costs. And as we have said, we believe we will lag a little bit on the downside. We do believe that we probably have reached some inflection point, and that -- hence why we gave the guidance that we believe deposit costs will come slightly down some in the fourth quarter. It still remains a fairly competitive environment. We have seen some reduction in CD pricing, and we've taken actions on reductions in the CD pricing as well. And we're probably starting to see a little bit of reduction in standard pricing with where -- and we're continuing to evaluate.","Kenneth Zerbe","Okay. Great. And if I could squeeze in one last one. Just in terms of the Energy portfolio, obviously, higher charge-offs this quarter. Can you just talk about where the stress points are? I mean it sounds like your provision guidance does include the probability of additional sizable Energy charge-offs next quarter. Can you just talk about what are the stress points? What are you seeing? Is there reason to be concerned, more broadly by Energy?","James Herzog","Sure. So our provision forecast assumes that energy charge-offs remain a little bit outdated for the next quarters or 2 and that we would see some migration in the Energy portfolio. But at this point, we're not expecting any widespread migration in the Energy portfolio. There is some impact, obviously, from the weak capital markets, the credits that are in our workout area. We expect some of that to result in additional migration in other weaker credits in the portfolio. But overall, we are not expecting this to be a very significant change in credit quality.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray.","Brett Rabatin","I wanted to just go back to Energy for a second and just talk about the additional weakness that you're anticipating? Is that a function of redetermination season? Did the SNC review have any impact on the portfolio? And then I know some lenders are changing their reserve based lending tests, does that have a factor in what you're seeing in terms of 4Q as well?","James Herzog","Yes. Well, first of all, the SNC exam really did not have any impact there. What we're seeing is there are certain credits that are, from a liquidation standpoint, very weak part before. We -- because of that weak market, the synergy assets are showing at very tough, big discounts. We felt the need to take some additional charges to bring the book value of those assets in line with what we expect those -- the asset sales to actually realize in -- probably in early 2020. And so just like last quarter, we took some additional charges there. Again, we're not expecting to see a lot of migration here, most of our E&P portfolio are very strong credits. We have very strong balance sheets, lower average, good liquidity. And generally speaking, those credits are less reliant on the capital markets. So it's really the credits that are more dependent upon the capital markets that we're seeing migration in.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. Appreciate the color there. And then the other thing I just wanted to ask about was expenses. You're -- looking at this year versus 2020, I know you haven't given guidance for 2020, but given the rate pressures on the margin, it would seem like your expense focus would be the same or heightened possibly in 2020. Can you give us any high-level thoughts on how you're going to react to margin pressure? And does that mean expenses in 2020, if we're just thinking about operationally, you kind of keep things pretty tight and try and manage expenses flattish again? Or can you give us any additional color on an outlook there?","Curtis Farmer","Brett, you're correct in the fact that we'll not be giving a more formal guidance on expenses until we get to the end of the year and the fourth quarter earnings call in January. Thought what I did say in my prepared remarks is that there are a few headwinds that we're aware of in 2020 that primarily would be interest rate related. And so just from a pension accounting standpoint, we'll have some pressure on the pension expense side of things. And then you have sort of the normal inflationary items, mirrored occupancy, et cetera. But as I've said on prior calls, we remain very focused on the expense side of the house, and we will continue to employ the strong expense discipline that we demonstrated in the last several years. So that remains a high priority for us. And the GEAR Up the work that we did, I think, proved our focus on expenses, and I think has positioned us well even in a declining rate environment and even with maybe some normal expense pressures that we can manage well even in an environment that we might experience in 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","On the loan growth outlook, I know, Curt, you had indicated for 2020, the loan growth could be in line or somewhat better than GDP. So if we're -- GDP is in that 2% range, does that imply that you could -- that you're expecting some potential moderation in loan growth when you look at 2020 versus the 4% level that you're looking at for 2019?","Curtis Farmer","I'm going to turn, just at the moment, to Peter Sefzik to give some more specific core commentary, but what I would say is that we saw very strong growth in the first half of the year and in the third quarter. We alluded to the fact that Mortgage Banker Finance volume coupled with refi activity there helped towards free, stable growth in the third quarter. But at some point, we were sort of anticipating if there is going to be recession or a slowdown that, that might start translating some into loan growth overall and sort of hint the slightly more moderate forecast we're giving for 2020. We'll revise that again at the end of the year when we give a more formal outlook for 2020 where we're going to give you little sense of where we think things are headed right now. Peter, I'll let you go ahead and add to that.","Peter Sefzik","I think I would just add, you referenced GEAR Up. And I think that some of the work that we've done over the last two years on the efficiencies for our business has helped us with the loan growth you've seen over the last several quarters here. And we're encouraged that, that would continue. We feel like the pipeline is still solid across most of our lines of business, and are -- feel real good about how things are for the fourth quarter, and I think along the lines of what Curt said for 2020, we're encouraged we'll be able to continue that growth. So...","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then separately on the expense side, I appreciate the color you gave in terms of your efforts to remain disciplined on that front in light of the revenue backdrop, can you help us in terms of how to think about either operating leverage for when you look at 2020 versus generally where you're coming in for '19, or more specifically, the efficiency ratio, how we could think about that trend through 2020 versus what you saw for '19?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. What I would say is that we haven't given any guidance around efficiency ratio or operating leverage for 2020 yet. What we did say at our last conference is that we still believe that overall, given the work that we've done that we can perform well on the relative basis to our peers both in efficiency ratio, ROE, ROA, et cetera, given the positioning we did relative to GEAR Up. But certainly, continued rate decline would have an impact on efficiency ratio and on overall returns for the company. But we do believe that we can perform well on a relative basis.","John Pancari","Okay. And then lastly, do you have the Energy loan loss reserve, where it stands?","James Herzog","Yes. We didn't disclose anything on the Energy or allocation to Energy. I can say though that we have amongst the strongest reserves in the industry and when you consider, John, that we don't really have any issues in the portfolio ex Energy. I would say that all those reserves are available to address whatever issues we have in Energy. But I could tell you that we do have a healthy amount of those reserves allocated to Energy at this time. And we probably would've seen a much larger reserve at least this quarter except to the fact we did allocate a fair amount of reserves to Energy this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","Curt, I was looking at Slide 12, just going back to that. With the addition of $1 billion in swaps, when I look at the impact estimated net interest income, it's a little bit worse than the second quarter. So I was just wondering, can you just talk about the impact from the swaps and a little bit more details about the plans to reduce asset sensitivity?","Curtis Farmer","I might talk a little bit first about the plans to reduce asset sensitivity, and then I'm going to turn to Jim to talk more specifically about the impact of the swaps that we added in the quarter. What we have said, really on all the calls this year, is that we are working towards getting to a larger swap or hedged position over time and that we're going to take a programmatic and measured approach to get there. There is a real impact to current earnings for adding swaps at the levels or adding hedges at these levels. And so we have to be careful how we do that and try to recognize the trade-off between forecast on either rate declines or potential rate increases in future years. But our objective is to get to a larger portfolio. And so we have a couple of days there where trading was favorable, and we were able to move in a larger fraction and add $1 billion worth of swaps. But we will not necessarily add that level every quarter and will be sort of measured as we go along. But over time, we only get programmatically back to a larger position and nothing has changed there. ","And Jim I'll turn to you around the quarter specifically.","James Herzog","Yes. We did add the $1 billion from swaps. That will take for a 25 bp shock. About $2 million off of that is sensitivities. As you know, we did have an increase over the second quarter reported sensitivities, and that was largely driven by the fact that we had an increase, a significant increase, in deposits for customer deposits, which does add to our asset sensitivity. So the net of those did result in a $5 million increase to that 10% deposit beta scenario that you see there.","Peter Winter","Got it. And then just separately, this quarter, you hit your target on the CET1 ratio, and I'm just wondering, any updated thoughts on maybe issuing preferred stock? And then using those proceeds to buy back stock?","Curtis Farmer","The preferred continues to be an option that we would consider, and it's certainly something that is not only our decision but is a discussion we would have with the Board. But this time, we are not issuing any preferred stock, and we continue to stay focused on the capital stack that we have. We had said all along that we were going to manage down to sort of the guidance we have given is to manage down to a 10% level. We came in slightly below that. It's hard to kind of get to the exact number at quarter end given a number of moving variables, and we'll continue to evaluate for the right capital level going forward. And we'll share targets on the fourth quarter earnings call. As we said previously, there are a number of constituents that we've taken into consideration, obviously, our shareholders, and we want to return capital in a meaningful way to our shareholders, rating agencies, regulators et cetera. But also, just making sure that we have that appropriate capital for growth in the company especially on the lending side, and we continue to be bullish on loan growth opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Kind of wanted to start so as NIM continues to drip lower, ROE and revenue are both under sustained pressure here and even once the fed rates stabilizes, it could be years before rates will be higher again, and you start to get paid on your deposit base. From a big picture view, how do you think about driving shareholder value in this prolonged environment of low rates?","Curtis Farmer","Steve, I'm not positive that we're going to have a prolonged low rate environment, and so I think we could debate sort of the forward look there. I do remain very positive on the U.S. economy overall on what we're hearing both from consumers and businesses, even though there is some caution out there. And so my sort of perspective on this may differ a little bit from yours from a longer-term perspective. But having said that, what we have said previously and I have reinforced is that we do not anticipate any change to our strategy. We've been, as I said in my comments, around for 170 years, and we've managed through a lot of different fight holes over time, both on the credit, interest rate, and economic perspective. We did some really good work with GEAR Up that I think has positioned us well and has allowed us to perform well on a relative basis to our peers. And I believe that we can continue to perform well on a relative basis to our peers. So we're focused on the things that we can control, and part of that would be continued focus on organic growth that we're in some great markets and some great lines of business. ","We've been very focused on new customer acquisitions and continue to be so. To driving long growth -- deposit growth in fee income is sort of job one. And then secondly, as just -- as I said earlier, we will continue to work to manage expenses appropriately, keep our expense discipline in place. Pete talked earlier about our credit position, and we believe that we continue to have a very conservative approach to credit. And that has served us well through lots of cycles. And if we do hit a period of recession, we believe we can perform well on a relative basis and maintain strong credit discipline and credit performance. And then I think we've done a very good job in managing our capital that remains a top priority in both using a capital to fund growth, but also to return appropriately to our shareholders. But in the same we talked about earlier we continue to make progress on the hedging front, which I think which will help over time. And as you alluded to, at some point, we do believe that we're kind of on the verge of that. We'd be able to manage down our deposit costs and reach an inflection point there. So those are things that we can control, the things that we're focused on as a company.","Steven Alexopoulos","That's helpful. In terms of the CFO search now underway, it's still not clear to many of us, me included, why Muneera left the company. Is there any color you could share on this?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. I think as we shared in the filings that we did, obviously, Muneera is no longer with us. She did make up a very a lot of valuable contributions to our company, both in the CFO role. And I think you know prior to CFO, she was our Chief Accounting Officer for a number of years. I am in the process, as you would expect, as a new CEO, establishing my leadership team. We're very fortunate to have Jim Herzog, who has a lot of experience with our company in the interim CFO role, and we have launched a national search for a new CFO. And the last thing I would say on Muneera just to reemphasize what we said in our of filing that there's nothing related to Muneera's departure that was any issue, I mean no concern or disagreement with our company, nothing that you put in the financial, operational, policy violation, nothing of that nature whatsoever. And so we wish her well and remain very appreciative of her service to the bank.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Was your CET1 now at your floor. And you noted that you want to work with your current capital stack at this time, how should we think about buyback power from here relative to what you've repurchased in the past?","Curtis Farmer","Jim?","James Herzog","Yes. We are pleased with -- that we did hit the 10% target at the end of the third quarter. And from this point forward, our share back is really going to be driven purely by function of supporting the dividend, the capital needs its support loan growth and our earnings capabilities, and if you put all those in the model, I think, you can back into what our share repurchase are going to be. We are kind of in a steady state right now in CET1, so it does make our share repurchase activity a little more predictable. But it's going to be a function of those 3 factors that I just mentioned going forward.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And as a follow-up to that, is there a way that you could give us guard rails in terms of if rates go down, what the impact is to the pension expenses? And is that the long end of the curve that we have to be more sensitive to?","James Herzog","Yes. It is the long end of the curve, and we do peg it to double-weighted rated bonds. There's a little bit of credit spread in there. And of course, at the end of the year we remeasure. So even though interest rates are the biggest factor, there are other factors that go into it, such as various actuarial assumptions, assumptions on asset returns, how the equity markets formed during the last year, but interest rates are by far and away the biggest determinant. And I think, if you look at our published financials from January and the quay, we state that there's about a $7 million impact for every 25 basis points of yield movement or discount rate movement. And if you look at the 10-year, that's a pretty good proxy. The duration of our liabilities are a little bit longer than 10 years and there's a little credit spread in there but the 10 years is a pretty good proxy for that. And you'll know we are down almost 100 bps since the last remeasurement date, last December 31. So we'll remeasure again at the end of this year, and we'll put all those factors under consideration, and we'll have our new pension expense come January 1. But until then, there's still a lot of movement that can occur with all those different variables.","Erika Najarian","I see. And just if I could flip one last one in here. Curt, I thought Steve asked the question that all your shareholders have been asking us and I'm sure you too in terms of what you're doing to offset the cyclicality. And I'm wondering if I took away the right thing. So loan growth in your vibrant market, continued efficiency gains, if you will, that have been the result of GEAR Up. And I'm wondering if that's all of what you've mentioned is enough to keep earnings stable because, obviously, part of the underperformance is that the expectation for earnings in 2020 is that earnings are going to be down mostly due to cyclicality and nothing to do with how you're running your business. And I'm wondering if there's -- the response is, is there enough in the till to offset that cyclicality in 2020?","Curtis Farmer","Okay. We'll give more formal guidance at the January fourth quarter earnings call, but I'll dare back and just reemphasize the things that we mentioned previously. This not the first time that we have managed through an interest rate cycle or even an economic slowdown. We do have to take into consideration lots of factors, including the value of our franchise, the markets that we operate in, our long-term growth perspective, balancing quarter expense reductions, coupled with investing in the franchise longer term and sort of the technology evolution that's occurring across the industry. And we also take into consideration with this long credit management and so all of the things will be things that we continue to weigh a factor in, but you know that as an institution that we are asset sensitive, and sort of late downward rate environment puts more pressure on us from a topline revenue perspective and then it's our goal to manage around the expense side, the credit side, other factors that we can control, and certainly, we remain very focused on the topline revenue growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon Arfstrom","Question for you, I guess, maybe it's for Pete as well, but just to talk about the general Middle Market outlook. You talked a little bit about a slowdown in the prepared comments, and I guess overall view is has it changed at all since what you saw in the summer? Or do you feel like that's getting better? Do you still feel like it's pretty cautious environment?","Curtis Farmer","I'm actually going to let Peter answer that all of your -- Peter, if you don't mind.","Peter Sefzik","Yes. I think that it still feels pretty good. And Since it's been out there, it may be still positive, but maybe not as positive as it was 90 days ago. But our pipeline still looks really good. Our year-over-year growth for middle market is solid, and we did see in the third quarter like we typically see some seasonality, but maybe not as much as we have historically, and we're encouraged with what we see going forward. But there are a lot of macro things going on in the world that customers ask questions about. When you talk to the general Middle Market company, they're busy, and we continue to see opportunity.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. And then, Curt, you used the phrase optimistic conversations, maybe help us understand that a little bit as well?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. I think it's really a mirror of what Peter just said that, in general, when I'm out in the market, or any of us are out in the markets with our customers, they're, as Peter said, busy. And I think business, in general, are well in many of the markets and business lines that we serve. A lot of borrowing is still to meet current working capital. We haven't seen a lot of CapEx spending, but we haven't seen a lot of CapEx spending for the last several years, so nothing really has changed there. There is more probably conversations that are occurring about sort of where things are going from a macro perspective, whether it's trade-related peer perception or just global political issues. But in terms of sort of day-to-day operating, I mentioned our customers are very busy. In fact some of them are having challenges for example right now around labor and just having enough staff to meet current demands, and not a lot has changed there but maybe a little bit more foreshadowing of the concerns about the future which part of why reflected that in my comments about 2020 growth.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. That's helpful and then just one quick one. When you were talking about expenses, you talked, you flagged investments on the retail bank, and could you maybe talk about the magnitude of the expenses there? And some of the key areas where you're spending?","Curtis Farmer","As we have said previously, a lot of our GEAR Up initiative allowed us on the technology front to reorient and reallocate where we were spending money. And it's been less on sort of core platforms as we chat and send some of our aging technology to more all and into a new customer and colleague enablement. And we have a very strong retail banking franchise today, and we've had certainly a lot of strong digital capabilities in terms of mobile banking. We were one of the early banks to adopt the Zelle platform that is going very well. But there are some things that we're doing on the retail front that just continue to make sure that we are relevant to our customers and that we can be focused on new customer acquisition. On the digital side, you'll see us roll out a new onboarding platform that will be easier for clients to sign up for capabilities of Comerica across a lot of different fronts and, so to speak, to revenue and customer onboarding, so to speak. So that's forthcoming. ","We've done a lot of work around our call center and some new technology there that supports primarily our retail bank, but not exclusively. And then just within the retail center as well to continue to adopt new digital capabilities. For example, we are rolling out a tablet capability for all the bankers and the regional banks to make them more mobile and interfacing with their clients and sort of just easier interface within the banking center itself. All of these are the things that we had on the road map, and we are working hard to manage within sort of our overall current run rate on technology but some of those do create a little bit of pressure for us, but they're the right thing for us to do on a longer term to make sure we remain relevant and competitive for our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.","Gary Tenner","Just had kind of question on your CECL disclosures on the Slide 15. I'm curious on the commercial side where you're forecasting flat down 5% on the reserve. How much volatility is there in that number from the Energy portfolio? Particularly if you were to think about the commercial portfolio ex Energy, where do you think that kind of CECL adjustment would shake out?","James Herzog","Yes. So a couple of things. First of all, from the season is very dependent upon credit quality and make up all of the portfolio as well as economic forecast. Energy is just 1 segment of that, and it's a relatively small segment of the entire loan portfolio. So it would be a factor, but overwhelmingly, it would be the remainder of the portfolio, the almost $50 billion of other loans that we have that would drive more both from an economic forecast and from a credit quality, but Energy would have some impact, obviously.","Operator","And I will now turn the call back over to Curt Farmer, President and Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks.","Curtis Farmer","We appreciate everyone's interest in Comerica. Thank you for joining our call today. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's call. Think you all for joining.

My name is Valerie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Persons you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Valerie. Good morning and welcome to Comerica's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Vice Chairman of the Business Bank, Lars Anderson; Vice Chairman of the Retail Bank and Wealth Management, Curt Farmer; and Chief Credit Officer, John Killian.","A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC's website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. As we review our second quarter results, we will be referring to the slides which provide additional details on our earnings.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause future results to vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement contained in this release issued today, as well as Slide 2 of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our SEC filings. Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures and in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph Babb","Good morning. Today we reported second quarter 2014 net income of $151 million or $0.80 per share compared to $139 million or $0.73 per share in the first quarter and $143 million or $0.76 per share one year ago. It was a solid quarter with broad-based loan growth contributing to increased revenue. Together with strong credit quality and our continued drive for efficiency, we had a 10% increase in earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2014.","Turning to Slide 4 in additional highlights, compared to the first quarter, average loans were up $1.7 billion or 4% and period-end loans were up $1.4 billion or 3% with notable growth in virtually every business line. Loan commitments grew by more than $1 billion. We attribute these results to continued improvements in the economy, reflected particularly in the loan growth in Texas and California as well as our expertise in faster growing business lines and our consistent focus on relationships. On a year-over-year basis, we had average loan growth of $1.8 billion or 4%, with growth in every business line except Mortgage Banker Finance, which was driven by the overall industry decline in mortgage volumes. The largest increases were in technology and life sciences, national dealer services, commercial real estate and energy.","Average deposits were up $614 million or 1% compared to the first quarter, while period-end deposits were up $420 million to $54.2 billion. Compared to a year ago, average deposits increased $1.9 billion or 4%, almost entirely driven by an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits.","Turning to the income statement and comparing our second quarter results to the first quarter of 2014, net interest income increased $6 million to $416 million, primarily due to an increase in loans and one additional day in the quarter, partially offset by a decrease in loan yields, accretion and nonaccrual interest collected. Credit quality continued to be strong with the provision for credit losses and net charge-offs still at low levels consistent with the last several quarters.","Noninterest income increased $12 million to $220 million with a $9 million increase in customer-driven fee income, which included increases in a number of categories. Noninterest expenses decreased slightly by $2 million to $404 million. Our strong capital position supports our growth and enables us to return excess capital to shareholders. We repurchased 1.2 million shares under our share repurchase program in the second quarter. Together with dividends, we returned $95 million or 63% of second quarter 2014 net income to shareholders.","Turning to Slide 5 and a quick look at the performance of our three primary markets on a quarter-over-quarter basis, Texas posted the largest percentage increase in average loans in the second quarter. Average loans in Texas were up slightly over $600 million or 6% with increases in all business lines. Texas deposits were down $150 million as middle market companies used their excess cash to invest in their business. Payroll employment growth in most metropolitan areas of Texas continues to be strong. Residential construction activity is picking up to meet the strong demographic demand and drilling activity continues at a robust rate.","Average loans in California were up over $600 million or 4%, largely driven by growth in national dealer services and commercial real estate. Average deposits were up 4% with the biggest lift from general middle market and corporate banking, partially offset by a decline in technology and life sciences. Payroll job growth in California remains above the US average, fueled by gains in high tech industries and strengthening housing markets.","Average loans in Michigan were stable across all our business lines. Deposits were also stable with a modest increase in retail deposits offsetting a small decline in commercial deposits. There has been some improvement in housing market statewide, but payroll employment in Michigan has been flat over the past year. Looking ahead, national macroeconomic conditions appear to be favorable. The marketplace is competitive, but we are confident in our ability to add new customer relationships and expand existing ones, while maintaining our credit, pricing and structure discipline.","In June, we received word that out of 25 largest US commercial banks, Comerica is ranked number five among customers and number four among non-customers in the 2014 American Banker Reputation Institute Survey of Bank Reputations.","In closing, we had a solid quarter, given this competitive and persistently low rate environment. We continue to be focused on growing the bottomline by carefully managing the things we can control such as expanding customer relationships, maintaining expense discipline as well as credit quality, all the while taking a prudent conservative approach to capital.","And now I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6, quarter-over-quarter total average loans increased 4% or $1.7 billion, following a $1 billion increase in the first quarter. Commercial loans were the major driver, increasing $1.5 billion or 5%. Our total commitments grew over $1 billion to $54.3 billion, driven by increases in virtually all businesses. Line utilization was 49.3%, up from 48.3% at the end of the first quarter. Importantly, our pipeline remained robust.","Our loan growth trends remained strong and broad based through April, then slowed in May and June, similar to the commercial loan trends we've seen in H.8 data reported by the Fed. Our average commercial loan growth outpaced the industry, which grew about 2% based on the Fed H.8 data for US commercial banks from April 2nd to July 2nd. ","Compared to the first quarter, we saw average loan growth in almost every business line. The largest increases were noted in mortgage banker with $433 million, national dealer services $330 million, energy $254 million, technology and life sciences $205 million, general middle market $158 million and commercial real estate $149 million. Of note, period-end balances of our Shared National Credit or SNC relationships grew less than 2% or approximately $150 million, a fraction of our $1.4 billion in total period-end growth.","Finally, loan yield, shown in the yellow diamond, decreased 8 basis points in the quarter, of which 4 basis points can be attributed to lower accretion and lower interest collected on nonaccrual loans. Much of the remaining decrease is due to amortization and payoffs of older higher yielding loans, a mix change in customer usage and competitive pressures.","Turning to deposit on Slide 7, our total average deposit increased $614 million or 1% to $53.4 billion, reflecting an increase in noninterest-bearing deposit. Period-end deposits grew $420 million to $54.2 billion. As shown by the yellow diamonds on the slide, deposit pricing was stable at 15 basis points.","Slide 8 provides details on our securities portfolio, which primarily consist of mortgage-backed securities that averaged $9 billion for the quarter. The estimated duration of our portfolio still sits at four years and the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it slightly to 4.7 years. The yield on the MBS book dropped $2 million or 7 basis points to 2.35%, mainly due to a decrease from the retrospective adjustment to the premium amortization recorded in the first quarter. While there was a decrease, the second quarter still had a small amount of retrospective adjustment, which is not anticipated to happen every quarter and contributed 6 basis points to the yield.","And while our goal is to reinvest prepaid at or above the current portfolio yield, the yields on the securities that are prepaying are typically above the portfolio yield and therefore anticipated to put continued modest pressure on the average yield.","Based on the current rate expectations, we believe that the pace of prepays will be about $400 million to $500 million in the third quarter, slightly higher than the past few quarters due to an increase in mortgage volume around the summer moving season. In light of the fact that Fannie and Freddie-backed securities are subject to a haircut and a cap under the proposed liquidity coverage ratio or LCR, we continue to reinvest the prepays in Ginnie Mae securities.","As far as the proposed LCR, given our loan growth and debt repayment in the quarter, we did see a decline in our excess liquidity balance, which had an impact on our LCR estimate. However, we continue to feel comfortable that we will meet the proposed phased-in threshold within the required timeframe and reinvestment of the prepays in Ginnie Mae securities will assist us in meeting the requirement without being subject to cap and haircut. As and when needed, we have ready access to the federal home loan bank lines and the debt markets, which will allow us to fund additional high-quality liquid assets or HQLA. When and how much will depend on our own balance sheet dynamic and the final rule. As we discussed at a recent conference, the impact on our asset sensitivity and earnings depends on how any additional HQLA is funded and initially invested.","Turning to Slide 9, net interest income increased $6 million and net interest margin increased 1 basis point. Strong loan growth added $12 million and one additional day in the quarter added $4 million. These positive effects were partially offset by a $3 million impact from lower loan yield due to the portfolio dynamics I discussed a moment ago, a decrease of $2 million in interest collected on our nonaccrual loans from an elevated first quarter amount and lower accretion of $2 million. And as discussed on the prior slide, interest earned on investment securities decreased $2 million. All of these decreases combined negatively impacted the margin by 5 basis points and were more than offset by a decline in excess liquidity, which added 6 basis points to the margin.","Just to note, we expect accretion for 2014 to be $25 million to $30 million. And as you can see in the bars on the slide, $22 million has been realized year-to-date. The remaining accretion on the full portfolio is only about $22 million, which we expect to realize in small increments each quarter over the next few years.","As stated before, we believe our balance sheet remains well positioned for a rise in short-term rates. At a recent investor conference and in our 10-Q, we shared our standard rate sensitivity model as well as alternative scenarios with varying assumptions. In all cases, as of June 30th, our asset liability model, which calculates a dynamic balance sheet assuming historical relationships, shows that a 200 basis point increase in rates over a one-year period equivalent to a 100 basis points on average results in a benefit to net interest income from about $180 million to about $240 million depending on the assumption.","Turning to the credit picture on Slide 10, net charge-offs decreased to $9 million or 8 basis points of average loans and included $19 million in recoveries. Our criticized loans, nonperforming loans and the allowance coverage ratio were all relatively stable. Our allowance covers our trailing 12-month net charge-offs over 11 times. Our solid credit metrics combined with loan and commitment growth resulted in a slight increase in the provision for credit losses to $11 million and a small reserve build. Of note, we received our annual SNC exam results last month. They are reflected in our second quarter results and were not significant.","Slide 11 outlines noninterest income, which increased $12 million. Customer-driven fees increased $9 million, including a $3 million increase in commercial lending fees from low activity in the first quarter as well as a $3 million increase in foreign exchange income due to a few large transactions and good volume. We had smaller changes in several other areas such as increases in fiduciary and investment banking fees. The $3 million increase in non-customer-driven income included a $2 million increase in bank-owned life insurance or BOLI and a $2 million increase in customer-related warrant income, offset by a $1 million decrease in deferred compensation plan asset return, which was completely offset in noninterest expense. Non-customer-driven income is difficult to predict. Elevated BOLI and warrant income in the second quarter may not be repeated in the back half of the year.","Turning to Slide 12, noninterest expenses decreased $2 million. Salaries and benefits expense decreased $7 million, reflecting seasonal declines in share-based compensation and payroll tax expense, partially offset by the impact of one more day and a full quarter of merit increases. We had small increases in several other categories such as software expense, operational losses and outside processing. While the expense is relatively stable while we grow revenue, we were able to drive the efficiency ratio down to 63% from 66% last quarter.","Moving to Slide 13 and capital management, as Ralph mentioned, we repurchased 1.2 million shares under our share repurchase program. Our 2014 capital plan includes share repurchases up to $236 million over the four quarters ending first quarter 2015. Combining shares repurchased with the dividends paid, we returned 63% of net income to our shareholders in the second quarter. Our 2014 capital plan also includes the redemption of $150 million subordinated notes at par, which we called effective today, July 15th. These notes have a carrying value of $182 million, which will result in a $32 million gain. Due to the non-core nature of this gain, we have not included it in our outlook.","Our access to liquidity was clearly demonstrated when we issued $350 million in senior debt from the holding company in May. The five-year security has a coupon of 2.125%, which we swapped to floating at six-month LIBOR plus 42 basis points. This is the first debt issuance we've done in almost four years and we were very pleased with the outcome. Our capital position remained strong with a tangible common equity ratio of 10.4% and an estimated Basil III tier 1 common capital ratio of 10.2% at June 30th on a fully phased in basis excluding the impact of AOCI.","Finally, turning to Slide 15, our outlook for full year 2014 compared to 2013 remained essentially unchanged from what we outlined on our call in April, with the exception of loan growth. We had previously indicated we anticipated 3% annual growth in average loans in 2014, consistent with 2013. However, given the stronger growth we have had in the first half of the year, we now expect moderate annual growth of about 4% to 6% in average loans.","As you know, we typically see seasonality in dealer and mortgage banker in the second half of the year. Average dealer loans increased $330 million in the second quarter and much or more of that growth can be offset by seasonality in the third quarter. As far as mortgage banker, we have indicated that we expect this to average about $1.1 billion for the year. For the rest of the loan portfolio, we expect continued growth. However, keep in mind that the pace of growth slowed through the quarter and we continue to expect persistent headwinds from owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgages with normal amortization. This competition continues for loans across all of our businesses. And while we fully intend to maintain our loan pricing and credit discipline, we do expect further portfolio yield decline.","It is important to note that where we could land in a 4% to 6% range will depend on the level of seasonality in dealer and mortgage banker along with whether or not the recent slower pace of growth continues in the rest of our businesses. We believe it would take less seasonality than we've seen historically and more robust loan growth than we've had recently in the rest of our businesses to reach the top end of the range.","We continue to expect our net interest income to be modestly lower year-over-year, even with stronger loan growth, primarily due to lower accretion. We had $49 million in accretion in 2013 and expect $25 million to $30 million in 2014, with $22 million already reported in the first half of the year. And while we are pleased with the growth in our loan portfolio, which is helping net interest income, we do expect continued pressure from the low rate environment to approximately offset the positive effects from loan growth.","We continue to expect lower noninterest expenses primarily due to lower litigation related expenses and a reduction in pension expense. As a reminder, in the second half of the year, we expect slightly higher outside processing, occupancy and advertising expenses. Finally, our share count should reflect both the execution of our capital plan as well as the dilutive impact from our warrants and employee options on our stock price increases. Our rule of thumb is that for every $1 increase in average stock price for the quarter, warrants and option dilution is about 250,000 shares.","In closing, we are pleased with the loan growth and expense control we've had in the first half of the year. We continue to focus on the things we can control, deepening and expanding customer relationships, while carefully managing expenses. We remain focused on delivering growth to our bottomline.","Now, operator, we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Second quarter loan growth was strong, but did it change the way you're viewing the potential for growth in the second half or is the new guidance just reflective of a strong April?","Karen Parkhill","Steve, as I mentioned, we did see good growth in the second quarter and we did change our outlook to 4% to 6% based on that growth in the first half as well as looking into the future. Where we land in that range does depend on the seasonality that we could have in both our dealer and our mortgage banker business as well as continued growth in the rest of our businesses.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","But, Karen, if you take this seasonality, those two businesses out of the equation, what you saw in the second quarter, did that make you any more optimistic for the back half of the year?","Karen Parkhill","We are optimistic for the back half of the year, but we are mindful of the recent monthly trends that we've seen, where we saw more robust growth in April, followed by a slowing in both May and June. And we are mindful of that. That's why we have a broader range on our outlook for the rest of the year, 4% to 6%, because it depends on whether or not those trends continue and the amount of seasonality that we see in the rest of our businesses, in mortgage and dealer.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","The auto sector continues to get better and you could see that pretty clearly in your dealer finance numbers, but the loan growth in Michigan has been pretty flat. Why are you not seeing any pickup there?","Lars Anderson","A big part of our portfolio in Michigan, Steve, is related to the auto industry and a big part of that is suppliers to the industry. Those suppliers who are running at very high capacity rates have not yet really turned to make significant CapEx and expansion. They're running three shifts. They're very productive, but we've not yet seen that kind of significant CapEx turn that you would sometime see in a recovering industry. However we have continued to see no commitments increase over a period of time and we think we're very well positioned with some excellent customers to capture that growth once we see investments begin.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Maybe just one final one regarding the reinvestment of MBS into Ginnie Mae's, Karen, what's the average yield you're adding to Ginnie's?","Karen Parkhill","Today, it would be between $220 million and $230 million. We do remain focused on trying to add securities to our portfolio at or above our current portfolio yield.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari - Evercore","It's a follow-up to Steve's question. Can you maybe help us a little bit how to think about this slowing that you're seeing that you saw in May and June, can you give us a bit more color what portfolios and can you help kind of give us a little bit of quantification around how much of a slowing you're seeing in that pace of growth in certain portfolios?","Lars Anderson","The growth that we did have, John, as we headed out of the first quarter into the second was very broad across all of our lines of business. And I would say that there's been a similar kind of slowing of activity levels. However, we are continuing to hear from our customers slightly more optimistic comments about future investments. We also saw an increase in commitments across virtually every business that we have, and that was pretty steady throughout the quarter. So frankly, I can't put my finger on exactly an industry or a group that would be a key contributor. But we think that we're well positioned, given that we can control what we can control. The business activity and fundamentals do pick up in the second half of the year. I think we got the right businesses, whether it's technology and life sciences, it's energy, general middle market and others that can benefit us, but we're going to have to see how the economy responds.","Ralph Babb","In prior quarters, we've kind of seen that up and down as well, that\u2019s not the first time.","Lars Anderson","We have. There's a bit of a seasonality and oftentimes in the third quarter. A piece of that is obviously linked in the third quarter to our dealer finance business. But also, the third quarter does tend to be a little bit softer and then we get stronger into the fourth quarter. So I'm optimistic. I think we've got some great colleagues with very deep industry expertise and are out there very active in the market and we're going to drive the growth that we can do without overreaching in a very competitive environment, staying very disciplined on pricing as well as structure.","John Pancari - Evercore","And is it too early to get a sense of July?","Karen Parkhill","I think if you follow the H.8 trends, that's what we've been seeing so far at least.","John Pancari - Evercore","And then lastly, just around the excess liquidity, just to confirm, so the decline in the excess liquidity balance, is the 40% decline in end of period excess liquidity, Karen, that should not necessitate a material change in your approach in how you're positioning for LCR, is that correct?","Karen Parkhill","Yeah, we did see a decline in excess liquidity and that was driven by loan growth and debt paydowns that we did in the quarter. We have been repositioning the paydowns and prepays of our securities portfolio into Ginnie Mae securities. And we are on a glide path towards the end of the year to be more positioned in Ginnie's, so that we hopefully are not subject to any caps and haircuts. That will obviously help us with the required rule. The rule is not yet final, as you know. Much could change. And so what we ultimately need to do will depend on our balance sheet at the time and the ultimate final rule.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","A follow-up on the balance sheet mix and structure. So, Karen, the extra liquidity has kind of gotten down and you did a really good remix in this quarter without a meaningful increase in the securities size of the book and with loan growth still looking pretty good, if not a little bit high versus the seasonality stuff that's coming. Loans are still outgrowing deposits. You still have some room. How would you start to think about your overall balance sheet growth if your loans continue to outgrow deposits? What's your first choices for filling that gap on the right side of the balance sheet? Would it be to issue more sub-debt? Is it sub-advances? I think we're at this kind of period where the banks might start to have to think about that little bit differently.","Karen Parkhill","Yeah, so we have said that as loans grow and our excess liquidity decreases, according to the proposed LCR rule, we will need to be adding high-quality liquid assets. As I said, when and how much depends on balance sheet dynamics and the final rule. To be compliant, high-quality liquid assets can be several types of securities as well as just extra cash on your balance sheet. And we do have ready access to the FHLB lines that we've got as well as the debt markets to be able to quickly add should we need to.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","So whatever funding mechanism is most attractive at the time?","Karen Parkhill","That would be correct. Most likely, it would FHLB when and if we need it.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","And then secondly, so the seasonality that you're very clear about, I know you're still talking about mortgage banker averaging $1.1 billion. But can you just give us a little bit more flavor for just the underlying trends beneath both the floor plan business and mortgage banker in terms of is normal seasonality expected to hold versus the differing trends we've seen in both of those respective businesses about lower mortgage originations and higher auto originations, how is that different than perhaps your original thoughts at the beginning of the year?","Karen Parkhill","So on mortgage banker, we did say as part of our outlook that we expect the full year balances to average $1.1 billion, where they were at the end of the year. We do see seasonality through the year. We saw decline in the first quarter. We saw an increase of more than $430 million this quarter. And when you look mortgage banker, you typically see the peaks in the summer months and the troughs in the winter months aligned with the selling season. So we do continue to expect seasonality. That business can be very volatile. And if you look at history, the seasonality can be anywhere between 15% and 25% in the winter month.","Lars Anderson","I may also just mention in particular on the mortgage banking finance business that we are very much positively adept towards the purchase market, and that's been a deliberate strategy to try to capture the recovering national housing market. And in fact, if you look at the second quarter, our production was about 83% purchase versus industry at about 59%. So we think we've positioned ourselves well for the future.","Ralph Babb","And we're also increasing market share.","Lars Anderson","Yeah, we're absolutely, Ralph, increasing market share. We're continuing to see a very robust pipeline. We're adding new customers. We're expanding with existing ones. And I think it's an industry that our reputation continues to strengthen and I think is well positioned for the future.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","And could you just comment on the floor plan side?","Karen Parkhill","Yeah, on the floor plan, we mentioned that we had a $330 million increase in our dealer business this quarter. The seasonality in floor plan typically happens in the third quarter, a little bit into the fourth quarter. But if you look at typical seasonality, it can go down between 5% and 10% of floor plan financing. So that $330 million or more could go down as part of seasonality.","Lars Anderson","I may just add on one additional issues. We look back, say, over the last 10 years, I think Karen gave the range very nicely in terms of what we would typically expect. However, there are outlying years where we do not see the seasonality. And we'll just have to kind of see how that plays out. And obviously with annualized sales, its 17 million units, if that continues to rise, that can certainly have some impact.","Karen Parkhill","And that's close to the high before the downturn.","Lars Anderson","Yes, it is. It's the highest level in many years.","Karen Parkhill","And that again is why our loan outlook for the rest of the year is a larger range between 4% and 6% depending on what happens with that alternate seasonality.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","First question, you mentioned that the SNCs were up about $150 million end of period, which seems like a little bit slower growth. Was that by choice given stronger growth in other areas or is there something specific to that segment that actually led to the lower or slower growth?","Lars Anderson","No, there was nothing deliberate about it. And frankly, there is nothing deliberate about our SNC strategy. It is simply a conservative risk management took that we use to manage our credit exposures. All of our business has originated through the lines of business that we've been in for a long period of time. It just happened to be that we actually did not see much increase this quarter. And in fact, the increase we did see was really due to the two largest areas, general middle market and mortgage banking finance that continues to do very well and we were spreading some of our credit risk.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","And then, Karen, a question for you. You said you swapped the $350 million, it was like 2% fixed-rate debt into floating. I guess my question is why? I mean you guys make a big deal of being very asset sensitive, but this seems to be a move that would reduce that asset sensitivity.","Karen Parkhill","Actually keeping it swap does not change our asset sensitivity. That is one of the reasons, but we also recognize that we have significant upside just based on our own balance sheet. And so keeping that asset sensitivity with swapping it, we decided, was not a bad strategy.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","So when you said it doesn't change, you mean it doesn't change it meaningfully or it doesn't change it at all?","Karen Parkhill","It doesn't change it meaningfully.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James","Just a question on the growth and commitments utilization continues to go higher. Any discernible trends either by geography or business type?","Lars Anderson","Yeah, frankly, obviously as you can see from the numbers that we are up about 100 basis points in utilization of 49.3%. But if you take out mortgage banking finance, which is an end of period measurement, utilization rates were flat. There was really no significant pattern there or changes in terms of utilizations.","Michael Rose - Raymond James","Okay. And then on the change in the reserve methodology, obviously I wouldn't expect much change in the near term, given credit trends are so strong. But how would it potentially impact provisioning methods or methodology or levels, once we get it to another credit cycle?","John Killian","Most importantly, we have to remember that the enhancements to the approach were largely neutral to the total allowance for loan losses for Comerica overall. What we did actually was enhance the approach used to determine our standard loss factors. And in short, that has the effect of capturing certain elements in the quantitative component of the reserve that had previously been captured in the qualitative. Simple as that. It did cause some changes in reserve allocations to some lines of business and some markets as more of the reserve was allocated based on risk ratings rather than on simple loan balance totals. But in overall picture, the allocation changes there were modest as well. So no overall change to the Comerica picture because of this.","Michael Rose - Raymond James","So in a credit cycle, you wouldn't expect any changes in the overall kind of provisioning levels relative to what you had before if you applied this retroactively.","John Killian","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Sterne, Agee.","Terry McEvoy - Sterne, Agee","If I look back at the first quarter, the energy portfolio was $3 billion and the energy segment of the SNC portfolio was also $3 billion. And then in the second quarter, energy loans up over $250 million, but the SNC portfolio up just $100 million. I know you commented on the SNC exam and the impact there. What's going on within energy? Are you looking in different areas, moving down-market for those numbers to move in the opposite direction?","Lars Anderson","Energy was up over $250 million or 9%, but that was not a significant contributor to our shared national credit portfolio, represents less than 7% of our overall bank's portfolio. I can't tell you that there was any specific strategies around that. Energy credits do tend to be syndicated heavy just because the agent banks end up having a whole large positions, which would be outside of our conservative credit discipline. But there was really nothing unusual. I would say that you may have seen some declines in some facilities that were agented and a few credits that were booked or advances that were not shared national credits during the quarter, but nothing unusual there.","Terry McEvoy - Sterne, Agee","And then as a follow-up, digging into the specialized businesses, where are you seeing the least amount of spread compression? And just some overall comments on the competitive trends within national dealer services, tech and the mortgage banker book.","Lars Anderson","I'd say energy continues to be obviously a business that we get a decent margin in, given our long-term expertise in that area. We also see that in our technology business. We frankly get nice returns in our general middle market business where we have been operating for many, many decades. And frankly, we add a, I think, different proposition to the customers, a premium service experience. And that's what we focus on doing. But whether it's environmental services, entertainment, a number of other businesses, we are continually reallocating our resources to those higher-yield businesses to try to capture the growth, as it's available on the marketplace and we're going to continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","I've got a couple of questions on rising rates and deposits. We hear kind of different messages from different banks on how they expect rates to impact deposits, which obviously if you look at a system level, there has been a lot of growth, particularly in noninterest-bearing deposits. So I'm interested in your take on that. And then specifically on the guidance you gave us on what happens to net interest income when rates rise, you say that's based on historical patterns in customer behavior, but obviously we've not had a period in recent history where rates have been this low, so curious as to how you extrapolate from the historical patterns to such a low rate environment?","Karen Parkhill","Geoffrey, at a recent investor conference in early June, we did share various scenarios around our rate sensitivity. In our standard scenario that we talk about in our 10-Q, we do expect in a 200 basis point rate increase or 100 basis points on average and in annual period, we do expect deposits to decline and we do expect on deposit pricing that the deposit pricing is in line with historical experience. But that said, we don't know if that will be the future. So we did provide some sensitivity scenarios of what if deposits decline more, what if pricing increases more than it has over history, what if loans grow faster, what if rates rise faster. And depending on those varying assumptions, we showed that we are still very well positioned to benefit when rates do rise. And that range can be between $180 million and $260 million.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Just more broadly, JPMorgan, for example, have talked about system deposit outflows of $1 trillion in the second half of 2015. When rates start moving up, that clearly puts them at very high end of the range in terms of expectations for system outflows. Other banks kind of say that deposits almost always keep rising. So just thinking about the system as a whole, how would you position yourself on that spectrum?","Karen Parkhill","Yes and in fact one of the sensitivity analyses we did can be reflective of that scenario. So that $1 trillion outflow that JPMorgan has talked about is about 10% or slightly more outflow in the system. And on one of our sensitivity analyses, we said what if deposits declined $3 billion on average, more than what we had assumed in the base scenario, and keep in mind that would be $6 billion point-to-point, and that would be more than the deposit outflow than JPMorgan has talked about in the $1 trillion scenario.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","So the base case is $3 billion of outflows and then you're adding $3 billion on top?","Karen Parkhill","We don't disclose the exact amount of our standard case, but we do expect deposits to decline in that standard case and the sensitivity is what if they decline another $3 billion on average or $6 billion point-to-point on top of that. That was one of the scenarios we showed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Karen, can you talk about the interplay between LCR and your excess capital? From a capital perspective, stronger loan growth will give you the opportunity to put more of your excess capital to work. But I thought, Karen, I heard you say that you'd need to add high-quality liquid assets as your loans grow. So just trying to kind of understand that interplay. Any perspective around that would help.","Karen Parkhill","Yes, we did say and we have said all along that as loans grow and excess liquidity does decrease, we will need to add high-quality liquid assets. But we remain mindful of the fact that the rule is not final and that if we were to add securities today on a proposed rule, not a final rule, those securities are marked-to-market in a rising rate environment. And the numerator on the LCR equation is a marked-to-market numerator. So we remain mindful of that. When and how much high-quality liquid assets we need or will need really depends on our balance sheet dynamics at the time that we do need it and depends on what the ultimate final rule will be. So there is a lot of unknowns at this stage.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Broadly speaking, is there a general scenario where you would find yourself with a fair amount of excess capital on the right-hand side of your balance sheet, but on the left hand side of your balance sheet, you're not necessarily able to return that given that the level of high-quality liquid assets that you need, you're somewhat constrained by LCR in your ability to be able to draw those down to return that excess capital? Regulatory approvals aside, I'm just kind of trying to understand the dynamics of the balance sheet.","Karen Parkhill","So we have and have had over the last couple of years more excess liquidity than we've had in history, and that's been driven by the dynamics of our balance sheet where we've had great deposit growth than we've had loan growth. It's not typical for us to be having that much excess liquidity over a long period of time. So we will operate with less excess liquidity over a long period of time. Our excess liquidity balances at the end of the second quarter reached $2.5 billion, have increased a little bit since then. So we recognize that they decrease because of loan growth and because of debt paydowns that were purposeful. But our excess liquidity over time is not necessarily going to be that large. And over time, depending on the final LCR rule, high-quality liquid assets are needed and whether or not we keep that in cash on the balance sheet or invest it in securities is a decision that we'll make at that point in time.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities","Switching gears, just one other question on the LCR disclosures that you gave recently. Could you also just give us some perspective on what percentage of your deposit base you consider non-operating?","Karen Parkhill","The proposed rule, as written, is very thinly written, particularly around operating account deposit. So we will be looking to more clarification of that in the final rule. It's very difficult for us to give you a number on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital Markets.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Just a couple of questions. The provision for credit losses on your lending-related commitments increased by about $4 million from the last quarter. Now, I would assume part of that increase is just because the absolute size of your commitments grew from Q1 to Q2, but the magnitude of the increase still seems a little larger compared to the overall increase in your commitments. I was just wondering if there is anything going on in there in terms of the mix of commitments or anything else that might account for that increase in that provisioning?","John Killian","No, there is nothing, Sameer, that's unusual going on there. I think what you're seeing to some extent is the law of small numbers causing what looks like an outsized change when it really isn't. But there is no underlying change in the portfolio or what's going on within.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","And then on a different note, I know you did talk about the competitive environment and you gave some perspective in terms of the different businesses, but I was wondering if you are able to quantify, if you look at your total middle market business and you try to look at yields on new business booked this quarter versus last quarter, could you give a sense for what the actual yields were, because what I'm really trying to get a sense for is your margin and your yield on average may be coming down because of where yields on new business are. But are we seeing that yields are stabilizing on new business, because at least we'll get some sense of where those could stabilize and then be actually less of a putting downward pressure on the margin. So could you give us a sense for that yield on new business within the middle market segment?","Karen Parkhill","Sameer, when you look at our overall portfolio yield, that has been coming down. It's been more reflective of mixed shift in our usage on our portfolio and higher yielding loans, while we don't have many fixed rate loans on our book, we do have some and those higher yielding loans that mature and run off have an impact on the portfolio, less around new business booked, because we are very focused around maintaining spreads at our current separate business portfolio yields for all new and renewed business.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","So, I'm sorry, from a competitive standpoint, would you characterize the environment as being competitive, but stable, or do you see still further competition driving yields lower on new business? That's what I was trying to get a sense for. I may have missed it in your comments, but that's what I'm trying to get at.","Lars Anderson","Sameer, I don't think that we have seen the competitive environment get relatively worse or more competitive over the past quarter or two. But it is very, very competitive. We don't give specific yields on new production by line of business, but I would tell you from a loan spread perspective, we actually did see loan spreads in general middle market do well over the past quarter. And part of that is we're trying to stay very focused on the parts of the market where we can deliver value to customers that are willing to pay for the Comerica value proposition. So I guess in summary, a stable competitive environment, but we think that we're well positioned to be able to compete in the marketplace.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","And then just a question on operating expenses. I mean this 2014 CCAR was the first one that Comerica went through. And I was trying to get a sense for costs that you might have incurred in going through that process and whether those costs should come down, not only over the course of this year, but perhaps into 2015 as maybe there were some consulting fees and other things you might have paid for that you may not need to incur going forward. So could you give us a sense for that? I don't think I saw it explicitly mentioned in your outlook.","Karen Parkhill","We have talked about the fact that increased regulation from CCAR, Dodd-Frank in general has had increased expenses by over $20 million annually. Most of that is in our run rate. And most of that is related to the stress test. We have been less focused on using consultants in the stress test, so I wouldn't anticipate that we could see benefits in the future on that expense.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Jason Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities","Hey, good morning. Actually this is Jason Harbes from Matt's team. So just a follow-up on the credit question that was asked. I guess I was just a little bit surprised that the net charge-off guidance didn't change considering that you're running it basically 40% to 50% below last year's levels. So I'm just, I guess, curious why you would kind of maintain that net charge-off guidance for the full year.","John Killian","Again, it might be a reflection of the law of small numbers. But if you take a look at our net charge-offs for the past several quarters, they've all been pretty close during a period where I would call a relatively small stable range, and that's what our outlook expects as we go forward through the rest of the year.","Jason Harbes - Wells Fargo Securities","And then just switching over to the fee income line that was a little better than we were expecting, but it sounds like there were some episodic trades on the FX side that may not recur. Is that fair? Did I hear that correctly?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, we did benefit from a few larger trades on the FX side this quarter. We did also see some good volume as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Really only one quick question. You've talked a lot about the loan growth and how that has affected the LCR positioning. Just curious if the LCR requirements in any way affect your appetite for loan growth as we go into the back half of this year?","Karen Parkhill","So on LCR again, because the rule is not final, we are not going to have any major reactions around it at this stage. We are focused on prudently growing our balance sheet with the right assets and we will continue to focus on that.","Ralph Babb","Yeah, it depends on the final rules as to what effect it may have on specific businesses.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","And so then once you sort of have the final rules in place, I know you had talked early in the call, but would be willing to borrow or sort of do what you need to do to purchase whatever liquid assets are necessary?","Karen Parkhill","That's correct. We feel confident that no matter what the final rule is, we'll able to easily handle it.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI","On page 19 of the press release where you give the detail on asset yields, just scratching my head a little bit. Looks like the yield on loans, yield on securities, both declined sequentially, but the total yield on earning assets went up. Could you just give me the back and forth of the dynamic behind that?","Karen Parkhill","Sure. Our loans and security yields did decline in the quarter. Yes, our asset yields did go up. And the key reason for that is our excess liquidity. Our excess liquidity declined. That had been earning 25 basis points. So as that declines and is put into assets that are earning higher, that's what impacted our overall asset yield.","Keith Murray - ISI","And then you've talked before about if the 10-year yield doesn't pick up as we head to the end of the year, pension expense might creep up in 2015. Are there any potential expense areas you guys look at and think that they could somewhat offset a potential increase next year in pension expense?","Karen Parkhill","Yeah, we're not giving guidance for 2015. But what I would say is that we have a culture of maintaining focus on self-funding wherever we have an expense increase to try to find ways to self-fund that increase to keep expenses as flat as possible.","Keith Murray - ISI","You mentioned the total deposits declined a little bit in Texas as corporations use some of their money and put it to work. Are you seeing a dynamic like that anywhere else? Any change in deposit behavior anywhere else?","Karen Parkhill","We did see deposits decline in mostly middle market in Texas and it's due to the phenomenon that we talked about. While we have seen smaller declines in some other areas, they were not notable. And so we're not seeing any big trends.","Ralph Babb","There's not robust growth either in the commercial side, so that it is an indicator as well.","Lars Anderson","Yeah, we did see some gains in deposits in the state of California in several businesses where we had some growth which was positive.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ralph Babb.","Ralph Babb","I'd like to thank you all for being on the call today and for your interest in Comerica.

[Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. Good morning and welcome to Comerica\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curt Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, Muneera Carr; and Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile.","During this presentation, we will be referring to slides which provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC\u2019s website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com.","This conference call contains forward-looking statements.

Today we reported first quarter earnings of $281 million or $1.59 per share. Adjusted net income was $271 million or $1.54 per share after excluding restructuring charges, tax benefits from employee stock transactions and a small deferred tax adjustment. Earnings per share on an adjusted basis increased 20% over the fourth quarter. Relative to the first quarter of last year our earnings per share increased significantly, and pretax income is up 25%. This is primarily due to higher interest rates as well as continued successful execution of our GEAR Up initiatives. Note that in the first quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard for revenue recognition which net certain expenses against the related fee income. This change in presentation has no impact on net income. The adjusted non-interest income and expense figures are reflected on the slide for comparability. ","On slide 4 consistent with the previous quarter, we are outlining adjustments related to certain items including restructuring, impacts from the new tax law and the tax benefited related to employee stock transactions. The adjusted return on assets was 1.56% and adjusted return on equity was 13.85%. ","Turning to slide 5 and an overview of our first quarter results as a result of typical seasonality and mortgage banker finance as well as a decrease in corporate banking, average loans for the first quarter decline. A part of each two business lines, average loans increased $327 million are nearly 1%. As far as deposits, we saw the normal seasonal decline in non-interest-bearing deposits following strong growth in the fourth quarter. We continue to closely monitor our deposit base and recently adjust to standard pricing for certain products in conjunction with the fed\u2019s rate increase last month. ","Starting to mid-quarter, we began seeing the rebound in loan and deposit balances, which is consistent with trends in prior years. Net interest income increased $4 million. The net benefit from increased interest rates was $27 million as we continue to prudently managed loan and deposit pricing. This was partially offset by two less days in the quarter and lower loan balances. Our provision for credit losses decline $5 million in conjunction with decreases and non-accruals and criticized loans. ","Net charge offs were 23 basis points remain below our historical norm. On an adjusted basis, non-interest income decreased $7 million, this included a $4 million decrease in commercial lending fees due to decline in syndication fees following a strong fourth quarter and relatively weak first quarter market activity. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses decrease $1 million and increased in salaries and benefits expenses in conjunction with annual stock compensation was more than offset by decreases in outside processing and advertising as well as business tax refunds. ","During the first quarter employee stock activity added 1.2 million shares and resulted in a credit to our income tax provision of $19 million. We continue to actively manage our capital and repurchased and $149 million or 1.6 million shares. As you know, we have submitted our annual CCAR plan and expect to receive the response from our regulator towards the end of the second quarter. We are encouraged by the progress been made on the regulatory front including recent bipartisan legislation and the fed\u2019s proposal to simplify capital requirements. ","And now, I will Muneera, who will go over the quarter in more detail. ","Muneera Carr ","Thanks Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 6. Loan growth across the industry is weak in the first quarter and typical seasonality further hampered on loan growth. Average mortgage banker loans declined over $400 million with the normal winter slowdown in home sales. However, balances began to rebound this quarter and are expected to continue to grow as spring\/summer home sales pick up. Following a strong fourth quarter corporate banking declined about $400 million partly due to seasonality and repayment of relatively large bridge facility and client exits. Average energy loans declined as a result of capital market activity due to [premise] commodity prices partly offsetting these declines, there was seasonal increase in dealer floor plan loans as well as growth in general middle markets. We also have smaller increases across many of our specialty and national [ph] business lines including technology and life sciences, environmental services, commercial real estate as well as entertainment. Total period-end loans were stable and went above the average for the quarter in the period with the positive trend in the back half of the quarter. In addition, loan utilization has increased and our loan pipeline is up significantly. Overall, customer sentiment has remained positive. ","Our loan yield increased 22 basis points primarily due to the increase in 30-day LIBOR. recall, the bulk of our LIBOR-based loans repriced at the beginning of the month so the impact of the most recent rise in short term rate has not been fully captured yet. This was partly offset by other portfolio dynamics primarily a decrease in loan fees as well as decline in normal non-accruals interest recoveries to more normal level. ","Seasonality also impacts deposits in the first quarter as you can see on slide 7. Average deposits declined $1.6 billion, following strong deposit growth of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. However, the decline in deposits this year has been less than we have seen in the past two years. Also indicating a positive trend, period-end deposits of $57.6 billion was well above the average. ","Deposit rates increased 6 basis points, to rely on a relationship model to stay close to our customers and help ensure there are offering competitive inappropriately priced products. As Ralph mentioned, in conjunction with the Fed accident marks we adjusted our standard rates of certain products. Our primary objective is to retain and attract deposits while managing our total costs. ","Our securities book remains at above $12 billion as shown on slide 8. That portfolio unrealized loss position of $270 million had a minor impact on the carrying value. The yield on the portfolio continues to transact modestly. Recent securities purchases have been in the low-3 which was above the average rate of two and a quarter on the $450 million decline and paydowns each quarter. The estimated duration of our portfolio remains short at about 3.3 years and the expected duration under 200 basis points way sharp extends the commodity to 3.9 years.","Turning to slide 9. Net interest income increased $4 million and the net interest margin was up 14 basis points. Our loan portfolio added $11 million and 17 basis points to the margin.","The increase in interest rates provided 32 million or 20 basis points benefit to the margin. This was partly offset by two less days in the quarter and lower loan balances. As a reminder, in recent quarters being benefited from higher loan fees, which we include in other portfolio dynamics as well as elevated non-accrual interest recoveries, those returns to more typical levels in the first quarter. Balances of the fed contributed 1 million and 3 basis points to the margin. ","On the funding side, deposit costs were up 2 million, primarily due to increased pay rates on certain products. Also, wholesale funding costs increased 5 million as a result of the increase in six months LIBOR along with some additional funding that was added at attractive rates. In summary, the net impact from increased rates contributed 27 million or 17 basis points to the margin. This included the full quarter benefit of the December rate rise, the faster pace of LIBOR increasing during the quarter and the March fed rate rise. ","Turning to credit quality on slide 10. Total criticized loans declined 111 million and now represents less than 4.3% of total loans at quarter end. This includes a 76 million decrease in non-accrual loans which comprised only 70 basis points of our total loans. Net charge-offs were 23 basis points or 28 million. As far as energy loans, total balances, criticized and non-accruals loans all decreased. Well credit quality remains strong we remain vigilant and continue [indiscernible]. At this point, we are not seeing any concerning trends. However, we are maintaining a conservative stance regarding trade, economic and market conditions.","Turning to slide 11. As Ralph mentioned, non-interest income and expense included the effect of the new accounting presentation whereby certain expenses are netted against the corresponding income mainly in card fees. The blue bars provide the competitive figures excluding this change. On this adjusted basis, non-interest income decreased 7 million with a 4 million decline in commercial loan syndication fees and a 3 million decrease in bank-owned life insurance. Both are difficult to predict and are thus typical levels. Customer derivative decline 2 million from the higher run rate we had in the second half of last year. ","First, this partly offsets, this increases in fiduciary and brokerage fee income. We remain on track to achieve our GEAR Up revenue targets. To highlight our progress, you can see the growth we achieved on a year-over-year basis in card, fiduciary and brokerage. Adjusted expenses decreased 1 million as shown on slide 12. This excludes the change in presentation, a 3 million increased in restructuring charges and the 5 million one-time employee bonus received in the fourth quarter. Outside [ph] processing decreases 4 million, after adjusting for the accounting and advertising expense decreased 2 million. ","In addition, we received business tax refund of 5 million, which are not expected to be repeated. And increases in salaries and benefits resulted from annual stock compensation which was partly offset by the $5 million onetime tax bonus paid in the fourth quarter as well as fewer days in the first quarter. Of note, we have adopted new accounting rules as requires the portion of the pension costs to be included in miscellaneous expense in higher periods have been adjusted. More detail can be found in the appendix. Expenses remain well controlled with helped from higher interest rates and capital management of loan and deposit pricing as well continued achievement of our GEAR UP initiative, our efficiency ratio has declined to 56%. ","In the fourth quarter, we've repurchased $149 million or 1.6 million shares under our equity repurchase program as you can see on slide 13%. Together with dividend, we've returned over $200 million to shareholders. Also, during the first quarter, employee stock activity added about 1.2 million shares. This activity resulted in a credit to our income tax provision of $19 million or $0.11 per share. ","Slide 14 outlines the positive impact of higher rates. As we have previously indicated, the full year 2018 benefit of the 2017 rate increases is expected to be $125 million. In addition, as a result of LIBOR moving up at an accelerated pace in the first quarter, we have added $20 million to our full year expectations. This is reflected in our first quarter run-rate. Furthermore, we have increased our estimates for the March fed actions to $60 million to $70 million which now includes a sustained higher LIBOR comfort somewhat by an expected higher deposit beta. ","In total, we believe this will give benefits from higher rates to be $205 million to $215 million of our full year 2017. Recall that we realized $27 million benefit in the first quarter from rising rate. Of this benefit, $5 million relates to the loss actions. The ultimate outcome depends on a variety of factors such as the pace at which LIBOR moves, deposit betas and balance sheet movement. Our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to benefit from increase in rates. Approximately 90% of our loans are floating rate with a majority type with 30-day LIBOR. Also, the bulk of our deposits are non-interest bearing, and the majority of our interest-bearing deposits are retailed. This benefit of our asset sensitive balance sheet is illustrated by our cumulative loan and deposit betas which is the increase in our loan yields or deposit costs expect as a percentage of the increase in the Fed's real fund rate since the beginning of the rate cycle in the third quarter of 2015. Our cumulative loan beta was 84% while our cumulative deposit beta was only 8%. We have not added hedges to change our asset sensitivity. Our asset liability committee continues to assess our position to determine the appropriate path given balance sheet movements and our outlook for rates. ","Now, I will turn the call back to Ralph to provide an update for our outlook for 2018.","Ralph Babb","Thank you, Muneera. We have been furnished our outlook for 2018 by incorporating the March rate increase into our expectations for net interest income.","Our outlook for all other categories is unchanged. As usual, we are assuming a continuation of the current economic and interest rate environment. We continue to expect total average loans to increase in line with GDP. We believe we can drive growth in most businesses somewhat muted by energy and corporate banking, which should be stable. We expect to see the typical second quarter seasonal rebound in most areas, particularly mortgage banker as wholesales pick-up in the spring. ","Overall customer sentiment is positive and activity is picking up. As Muneera indicated, we expect net benefit of $205 million to $215 for the full year from the 2017 rate increases combined with the recent drives in short-term rates. As far as a second quarter, we expect an increase from the full quarter benefit of the March short-term rate increases partly offset by somewhat higher deposit costs along with the return of loan growth. And while not included in this outlook, we are well position to benefit from any further rate increases. ","We continue to expect the provision to be between 15 and 25 basis points as credit quality remains strong. Following a relatively low provision in the first quarter, second quarter provision is expected to be higher. With the contribution from our GEAR Up initiatives, we continue to expect 4% growth in non-interest income excluding changes in deferred comp a 1% increase in expenses excluding restructuring charges. Fee income in the second quarter is typically stronger with seasonally higher card and fiduciary income. Second quarter expenses should decline modestly from the first quarter primarily due to lower compensation expense. ","We\u2019ve adjusted the 2017 base for the effect of the new accounting presentation which was discussed earlier. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 23% excluding any impact from employee stock transactions which are difficult to predict. ","In closing, our [related shift] [ph] banking strategy is serving as well. It is helping us prudently manage loan and deposit pricing as interest rates have increased as low as maintain strong credit metrics. The result has been significant increase in our returns and helped drive our efficiency ratio to 56%. ","The year after a good start, our pipeline is strong and we expect loan growth to return with typical seasonality in the second quarter. We believe, the continued achievement of our GEAR Up initiatives will assist in growing fees and controlling expenses. Furthermore, we are well position to benefit from additional rate increases favorable changes in regulation and economic growth. ","Now, we will be happy to take any of your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Just a couple of questions on the net interest income side. First of all, you give in fed that solid 426 loan yield outlook in February and it ended about the same. And I just want to understand, can you help us just understand the way that variable rates move through the quarter. And how you'd expect that March hike to move through as you look forward?","Muneera Carr","As far as the loan yields are concerned that 426. I talked about fees that for elevated in the fourth quarter and non-accrual recoveries. A lot of that impact was felt in the month of March. And essentially negated some of the benefits that we otherwise would have seen for the month of March. From a go-forward basis, as we have said the March rates will provide $60 million to $70 million benefits and clearly a substantial portion of that benefit will be in loan yields. You can see that in the first quarter we picked up about 20 basis points coming from $32 million as a result of what was happening on the loan side of the equation. So, I would expect that loan yield will benefit nicely, should be about I don't know 59 basis points. ","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then, the March hike that you say is going to be 60 to 70 benefits. If we were to get the next one whether it's June or any other month. Would that 60 to 70 still hold? And what will be the offsets that you might be thinking as far as the deposit beta side, thanks.","Muneera Carr","Well I mean as you well know deposit betas are increasing and as time passes, we'll have to see that's happening under competitive tranche. And make sure that we adjust accordingly. So, the $60 million and $70 million and invest continue to change depending on what transpires in the environment outside. ","Ken Usdin","Okay, but you will never thought -- ","Muneera Carr","So, what I'll tell you, Ken is, just remember that we have $42 billion of loans that are variable rates. And so, then rates go up and the asset side is seriously sensitive and the benefit of that will obviously far from anything that\u2019s happened on the deposit side. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. ","Peter Winter","Good morning. I'm just wondering you've maintained the forecast for average loan growth for the year in line with GDP. And I hear you that the loan pipelines are good, sentiment is good. But what gives you the confidence that you're going to hit that target of GDP type loan growth?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. Thank you, Peter. In the first quarter for us it's typically a slower quarter just based on seasonality. And we certainly saw that in with respect to finance for the quarter. But also, the seasonality impacts other businesses for us as well middle market, corporate banking. I mean Muneera talked about some of that in her comments. If you exclude mortgage bank finance and corporate banking as we mentioned already, we really were up about 1% for the quarter as well as up about $500 million on average Q for an '18 versus Q'17. What I would say is that we saw some very encouraging signs in the quarter. The results were really backend loaded. And as the quarter went on we saw momentum building and pipeline building which I think bodes well for us setting into the expected quarter which usually is a much stronger quarter for us based on seasonality and mortgage banker finance. ","When you look at a number of businesses across the board, we had growth in dealer financial services, growth in general Middle Market across all three of our markets which we have not seen in a while growth in commercial real estate CLS, environmental services and entertainment. So, I feel good about the cross-expert growth for the balance of the year. Obviously, there is still some mixed news out there in the economic front. And we are yet to see helping translate for us in terms of tax benefit with our clients, but at least I think all that is positive. When we look at some of the times we had just in terms of the increase in pipeline at the end of the quarter, the fact that period end loans were above the quarterly average for us and we saw some increase in utilization. I think all of that bodes well for us in terms of the ability to meet a GDP growth in line or growth in line with GDP for the full year. ","Peter Winter","Just on a separate question. With regards to CCAR. Can you just talk about how you view dividends versus share buybacks?","Ralph Babb","Well, we look at the total as what the paid out is. And then dividends obviously we want to have in the quarter with a sustained ability to pay dividends over a longer period of time. And then the difference being on the share buyback. ","Peter Winter","Do you have a target for a payout ratio?","Ralph Babb","We do not at this point. ","Peter Winter","Okay. Thank you. ","Ralph Babb","But if you go back in history, we have traditionally been aggressive at returning to our shareholders whether it be dividends, and over the buyback, which is important to us as we move forward. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Alexopoulos","Ralph, I wanted to start following up on the expectations for improved loan growth in the second quarter. If you just look at the size of the commercial loan pipeline heading into 2Q. Is it a fairly typical seasonal increase on tap? Are you seeing more meaningful improvement in the pipeline given the recent improvement in business confidence?","Ralph Babb","I think you\u2019re seeing more improvement in the pipeline because of confidence. Curt, do you want to comment on that?","Curtis Farmer ","Yes. Steve, I think Ralph said it well. Obviously, the normal seasonality, which you already alluded to that really across a number of our businesses, we do feel like pipelines are healthier. And traditionally, for the last like 2 years or so, most of our conversations with clients have been about borrowing to meet the current working capital needs. And we\u2019re starting to have some conversations with clients about CapEx and expansion opportunities. So, I think, some of the things that we\u2019re feeling from a macro and micro economic perspective out there is starting to expand some into actual demand from our clients. So, I don\u2019t want to give the wrong impression that necessarily we gained investors at this point, but do you feel like that there is a stronger pipeline heading in the second quarter and what we saw for example last year. ","Steve Alexopoulos","Or will you still looking at the commitments to commit as a good leading indicator. Are you see in the material build up in the commitments?","Curtis Farmer","We have not put [indiscernible] this report Steve, we do look at values and we look at pipeline overall and try to look at actually the pull-through rate associated with both. We feel really good about the pipeline heading into the quarter as I mentioned earlier and it grew throughout the first quarter really across on the [indiscernible] business lines.","Steve Alexopoulos"," I just have one question on the tax spend. How much you guys like to spend on technology this year? and do you think you can compete at this size in the digital age of banking? Or do you need the drive to more scale to ramp that spend? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","One of the things you need to be focused on when you're thinking about that is going back to our GEAR Up, which part of the whole process of Europe was putting efficiency but it was also reinvesting. And technology being one of the biggest reinvestments both from a product standpoint and an internal standpoint to provide our people with the kind of tools they need to take care of our customers. So that is very important on top of the normal if you would see in investing. Curt, you might go through a few of the things that have been changed here recently. ","Curtis Farmer","I think one thing that's changed of the technology front is that a lot of technology today is becoming more ubiquitous. And we have really work worked on moving away from heavy customization and building things ourselves to really leveraging keys under relationship and leveraging more cloud-based technology. And that's allowed us to be more agile and move faster to deliver both enhancements through our customer experience and also delivering tools that improve our colleague's ability to serve our clients and fill any products and services. ","So, in 2017, we will now an enhancement to our mobile application and basically in ongoing process probably every six months or so we're adding to our consumer mobile platform. We've rolled out a new consumer loan and mortgage platform which helps both from a customer and an employee standpoint. We've made a lot of enhancements to our treasury management capabilities specially to finance sort of digital delivery of treasury management. And just this year, we're rolling out the [indiscernible] platform in the month of April we've done a lot around the commercial lending process, like [indiscernible] about the review we've done around the NDN [ph] and credit approval process. And along with that, we're rolling out a new CRM platform as well as commercial loans for credit processing platform which again helps better from the customer and employee perspective. So, we have a lot of things in the pipeline. We feel like we're able to stay current and again leverage all the key vendor relationships as well as some leveraging off of more cloud and agile type of delivery. ","Ralph Babb","And on top of that we were rationalizing our applications to making sure that our systems were more efficient at building the things that Curt was talking about. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Michael Rose","Hey good morning. Just going back to the capital questions. Have you guys had a chance to study some of the proposals in Washington and potentially how that would impact your capital levels? It seems like it would free up some capital for return to shareholders. Any overall thoughts there, thanks. ","Ralph Babb","We are studying those. And it is very positive that both from a legislative standpoint and from as you said a regulatory standpoint the position that's being taken. And the most important thing to us in the future we'll be able to manage our own capital. And historically as I mentioned earlier, we have always been aggressive at returning capital our shareholders as appropriate. Whether you want to talk about any of the individual pieces of that Muneera?","Muneera Carr","Sure, Ralph. I do believe that [indiscernible] propose we made is a step in the right direction. It's still a proposal so a not good change. And the effective data is out there in the third quarter of next year. But having said that some of the proposals that they are suggesting which include not including rise in risk weighted assets and including buybacks in a period of stress, seem to be a step in the right direction, it will allow us, as you say, Ralph, the opportunity to right size our capital, which was always our plan, but we\u2019d be able to do a little bit sooner with the proposal that we have out there. So, looks good. ","Michael Rose","Just as a follow-up to that, I mean do you guys have a targeted capital ratio you guys will ultimately like to be at or proceed if you want?","Ralph Babb","We have not put out a public statement on the proposed where we are. And part of that is will be relooked at as we go through what Muneera was just talking about the regulations as well. And we have always been traditionally at an appropriate point we feel for our institution. And that has served us well when we have a chance to be able to control what the amounts are.","Michael Rose","And maybe just one more on a separate topic. Energy has been a big drag for you guys in terms of headwinds to loan growth. It looks like non-performers are still 25% of the book, the oil has been about 16 for nearly a year. Any sort of commentary on what would cause some upgrades in that portfolio? And would that actually translate into further reserve releases moving forward? Thanks. ","Ralph Babb","Pete, do you want to address that?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes. Michael, we\u2019re pretty optimistic that is going in the right direction, we are right in the middle of redetermination process about 40% the way through. And my guess is by the time, we get through it, we\u2019ll make a substantial dent in that 25%. All the factors there that we\u2019re looking are positive and so we\u2019re pretty optimistic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Can you just talk a little bit about the conversations you guys are having with customers about, let\u2019s call it normal flows out of non-interest-bearing just given the rising rate environment. I saw that you mentioned that some of it was driven by normal seasonality, but I\u2019m actually curious about the other part of it, where you actually have customers explicitly saying they\u2019re in search of higher yields? Thanks. ","Curtis Farmer ","A lot of the funds that we have for our client obviously, we have a very large commercial oriented deposit based and with those clients, a lot of those funds are used to offset from an ETA perspective and\/or general operating accounts totally some of our clients have had excess cash. We are having quite conversations with them about alternatives in terms of raise and we\u2019ll make appropriate exceptions where we need to do so. But I would say thus far, those conversations have continued to be limited, we continue to watch and our goal is to try to be competitive as much as we possible can, as we see rates continue to increase like kind of across the board, but we\u2019re managing it right now for customer-by-customer primarily. ","Ken Zerbe","And then the other question is just in terms of the employee stock comp tax benefit that you guys are getting. Do you have any outlook in terms of how this might progress over the next year or two or three? And I guess what trying to know is, were there any part of the benefit that actually were sort of front end loaded over the last year or so?","Ralph Babb","I think you just see, I think what I will call a bit of a catch up with the strength of the markets. And people having the opportunity to execute what they've been given. ","Muneera Carr","Typically, first quarter is the quarter in which employees [indiscernible] becomes available to them. So [indiscernible] in the first quarter. In the remaining quarters it's pretty difficult to predict, but generally tends to be lower. And if you compare that having from first quarter last year to first quarter this year you can see that some of the activity level is coming down. And that's sort of there that pent-up demand for the employee base is coming down clearly overtime as well. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. ","Scott Siefers","I just wanted to make sure I understand the NII guide correctly. So, it sounds like the only change to the prior guidance is the higher benefit from the March increase. Did I hear you correctly say that the LIBOR increase is already baked into the first quarter number?","Muneera Carr","Some portion of the LIBOR increase is based into the -- let me break it in pieces. The $60 million to $70 million, of that $60 million to $70 million, $5 million is baked into the first quarter so as we analyze that $20 million that's in the run-rate. So, if you take the midpoint of 60 to 70 which is 65 and 20 is in the run-rate and about $50 million per quarter is the benefit. Does that help you Scott?","Scott Siefers","Yeah it does. Thank you. And then just on that LIBOR increase. I mean obviously get higher LIBOR done. I tend to think if you guys are most sensitive to one month, whereas most of the, I guess the most pronounced move was in the 3-months. Are there any other benefits that you guys get beyond just the simple 1-month LIBOR? In another words, are there benefits from the asset side to you guys from the movement in the 3-month LIBOR as well?","Muneera Carr","We have a small portion of our loans that are indexed at 60-day LIBOR as well. So, you can see that on slide 14. So yeah, there is a little bit of a lag in the reset. Different loans reset at different times and then we also have some of that have that 60-day taxation. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the lie of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Erika Najarian","Good morning. I wanted to follow up on Ken's question about non-interest-bearing deposits. So, as we think about this is clearly underpin the net interest margin strength for Comerica in a rising rate environment. And as we think about the commercial non-interest-bearing deposits, is there a way that we could ball park what percentage of those balances are attributed to operating accounts versus excess cash as we think about potential mix shift or lack of mix shift going forward?","Muneera Carr","So, Erica, we have said that if you look at our overall non-interest bearing, 90% of that is commercial. And of that 90% about 80% of the balances are utilized towards the fee management products that's a pretty high utilization. So hopefully that gives you a sense for what we're looking for?","Erika Najarian","No, that's terrific. Thank you. And just as a follow up question, you've gotten a lot of inquires of capital management as regulations and legislations hopefully change for the better. I'm wondering, if you could give us some insight on what could change in terms of your liquidity management. You clearly have a lower yielding securities portfolio, especially relative to peers. And I\u2019m wondering, if the legislation did pass on the SIFI definition, how, if any, differently you would manage your securities book from here?","Ralph Babb","We will have to see how the rules get laid out, but the size might be different. And there could be length of maturity. But it wouldn\u2019t be substantial in my opinion at this point. Muneera do you agree with that?","Muneera Carr ","I agree with that Ralph. We like the 20 billion size that we have right now. Where we go with the securities book is going to depend on what happens with loans and growth there, what happens with deposits. So, beyond regulation, there is managed liquidity prudently in line with what happens on that front.","Ralph Babb","And as expense grow and move forward, there will be a time when, and we\u2019ve mentioned many times that we look at it regularly as to whether we should be putting on hedges and how do we manage where we are in the rate cycle. As well as longer term, in history, we have been very careful and very conservative at managing the risk there, which I think we\u2019ll go back to a point of time when we feel like we\u2019re starting to get rates at the normalized level. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Pancari ","Regarding the loan growth, I know you mentioned that you saw pickup late in the quarter. And so, is it fair that we can use the end of period balances as a base as we grow the loan portfolio here just given that they came in well above the average balances for loans?","Curtis Farmer","Yes. I will get back to you, John, what we said earlier is that our outlook is for growth or the loan portfolio in line with the GDP range. And so, when you look at for the full year guidance, we would say with that. The balances in the month of March for the period end balances, I think, are reasonable for the baseline to use from a go forward perspective. But remember that we do see some additional seasonality in the balance of the year in the third quarter. We see some additional seasonality in our dealer portfolio. And so, it\u2019s not necessarily a straight-line scenario. So, when we talk about growth in line with GDP average growth for the year, that\u2019s for the full year view and not necessarily tied to any one quarter.","John Pancari ","And then separately on the rate size. On slide 14, I know you mentioned the loan beta that you\u2019re running around 84%. I know peers from our work, looks like they\u2019re around 35%, well below the 50% that we\u2019ve seen in the past. How do you feel about that 84 and your ability to maintain that? Are you starting to see spread compressions? Because I know that the industry is. Thanks.","Curtis Farmer ","Yes. I think it remains at highly competitive environment. It\u2019s been very competitive really for the last several years or more. And we work really hard to remain competitive with our client base, but at the same time, we\u2019re very relationship focused. We price every individual client relationship one client at a time and that's our pricing model of deal based on client overall relationship with us and the risk profile of the customer. And we're not want to sacrifice our pricing just to chase transactions, but where we've got existing relationship or can build the relationship we're going to make sure that we are being competitive. But we're not saying at this point that it feels me any more or less competitive that it has been it's been a very tough environment now for several years and that continues. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. ","Brett Rabatin","Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask about the earnings credit rate and just what's you're expecting from that regard and how you see that competitively changing?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, we look as you would expect the very hard at the ECA rate. I would say in general, that we've made some exceptions there where appropriate. But again, remember, that our clients are leveraging the ECA rate from an offset standpoint to cover treasury management calls and services. And so just like we view on deposit side, we do a lot of surveying at the market to see where ECA rates are. I would say in general, that we have not seen a wholesale lift across the board as it relates to ECA rates that we'll continue to watch and monitor on a go-forward basis. ","Brett Rabatin","Okay. And then as a follow up you just mentioned that you haven't see any environment more or less competitive. I'm curious will that be kind of across the board or are maybe a few industries where you are seeing things get a little more competitive in terms of people been aggressive with pricing?","Curtis Farmer","No, there are certainly pricing dynamics in our portfolio. And to know, we are in different markets and we have different industry verticals and within those industry verticals and within those markets at times different pricing dynamics at the play. But I would not single out a single line of business for us where we feel like that the environment has changed significantly. I would just say across the board with all of them it remains a very competitive environment. ","Brett Rabatin","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead. ","Steve Moss","Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked, but just wanted to touch based on the CCAR example for 2018. Wondering how we should think about the payout ratio for 2018 versus 2017?","Ralph Babb","Well we will hear the results of the CCAR process will come out last month of this quarter. And that's what we will at that time know where we are.","Muneera Carr","So, Steve, if you look at our history, you will see that with every subsequent CCAR we have increased the dollar amount and the percentage of our payout. That's the sense that we hope to continue. And then as Ralph mentioned the fact that we want to focus on the dividend components of that payout. And so that's sort of what you should expect out of this CCAR. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliot with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. ","Geoffrey Elliot","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. You talked about standard deposit pricing increases in response to the Fed rates increase in March. Can you elaborate a bit on what you've been doing there and how that compares with the action you took after the December rate increase?","Muneera Carr ","So yes, we did talk about some of the standard pricing changes that we made in a very strategic and targeted with a differentiated in different market. So too much details to go through her. But what I would tell you is that we have included the impact of all of those changes in the 60 million to 70 million guidance that we are providing for the benefit of the March rate rise. Beyond that, I\u2019ll tell you that the changes we have made make us through good about our overall competitive position that we have in each of those markets. ","Geoffrey Elliot","And specifically, on the 4Q call. I think you talked about increasing rates on money market deposits 10 million and over by 20 basis points and rate on certain of the higher balance retail products by 15 basis points. Can you give us a sense? Is it a broader set of products you\u2019ve increased this time? Is it the same sort of magnitude of rate increase? Can you give us kind of compare and contrast on this December rate increase and the March rate increase?","Muneera Carr ","Yes. It\u2019s going to typically be a combination of either customers we believe to be rate-sensitive or where we see competition adding a little bit of pressure if that helps. I mean, it\u2019s going over specific will just, it\u2019s going to be too many changes, some of them small, some of them slightly bigger. But like I said, all folded into the estimate that we have provided. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vinning Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","I was going to kind of follow-up on the deposit. But more from a sense of, if we are looking at commercial customers, the pressure may be coming from market rates that they can actually utilize. On the retail side, I was curious, if you\u2019re seeing most of the pressure coming from community banks or where is that kind of -- so where do you kind of sale commercial and retail side, who are the biggest pressures to push those deposit base higher?","Ralph Babb","Sure. And one of the things that make our franchise unique is that we do have a unique set of competitors in almost every market we\u2019re in today. So, you have the larger national banks and more regional banks and we have all of the community banks. And so, we do benchmark ourselves against a broad basket that is somewhat unique market-by-market. So, when we\u2019re doing surveying and shopping, so to speak the competitors we take all of that into consideration. And we try to, in some markets, you\u2019re always going to have an outlier. But we try and look at more what\u2019s happening kind of across the board from an average perspective. And I wouldn\u2019t say that, I think the increases we\u2019ve seen have been really across all 3 buckets. So, you\u2019ve seen some increases with community banks, some increases with regional banks and some increases with the larger national banks. And again, what we\u2019re trying to do is strike the right sort of medium balance between all of those and do the right thing for our customers, where we think we have some price sensitivity. ","Marty Mosby","And then the second question is, if you think about liquidity that you\u2019ve built on the balance sheet through this LCR requirement and all the things that have kind of regulatory wise held you back incrementally, how do you envision, if we\u2019re just growing loans at about the GDP rate to be able to actually ever kind of call that liquidity and deploy it? Or is it something that we\u2019re probably just going to carry through the next downturn and maybe use that in the next expansion?","Muneera Carr ","At some point, I mean, when we feel that the long-term rates are appropriate, we might deploy that securities, I mean, those, that cash balance into securities as an example. But clearly, first, we\u2019ll move liquidity towards loan growth. And then beyond that think about of the best that would be. ","Marty Mosby","Are there still if you had any initiative or thoughts about incrementally taking advantage of that and doing something with it to get some better yields from it?","Muneera Carr","I mean that's just something like I said, it depends upon opportunities that present themselves in the future. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Lana Chan","Hi, good morning. Just a question on slide 14 again on the benefit from the rate increases. I think in the last couple of the quarters, the assumptions, the deposit betas have been in the 20% to 40% range. And I calculate this first quarter, the deposit beta was only 24%. So, could you give us an idea of what you have embedded in the go forward guidance?","Muneera Carr","So, you're right historically and we've talked about where deposit beta will be going to be with every single rate rise and just every single rate rises we've actually done better than what we've said. What I'll tell you is then rate rises start coming at a faster frequency the December launch it becomes really difficult for us to start isolating betas towards specific rate rise and say, and you can just do the math and you said 24%. And you have to do that till December. And what is December, what is March it's sort of intermingling. And so, for those reasons and the fact that LIBOR and what's happens on the asset side has side has such a large impact on our numbers, we decided it was just simplistic to put dollars out there instead of putting our deposit betas, talked about the fact that we made certain pricing changes. We've talked about the fact that we used a relationship approach to retain our deposits. And so, all of that generally don\u2019t mean that deposit beta is going to start moving up. Is that help you?","Lana Chan","Yeah that's helpful. And then just to clarify on that slide again. The assumption on the estimated net interest income impact benefit. Does that include your assumption on loan growth expectations for this year, or is that on a static balance sheet from 2017?","Muneera Carr","That is on a static balance sheet. Loan growth was actually at low dollars there. ","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe Bruyette Woods. Please go ahead. ","Brian Klock","I think everyone asked questions on loans and deposits. So, I guess I'll ask a combination question on both. On the loan side first, it seems to me that you guys have strength of the franchise is in your middle market loan based and customer base which again brings a lot of those DDA deposits with it. And it looks like from your segment data that the average balance has been picking up some obviously in the general middle market. And the larger corporate is still where the average reduction was. Can you just remind us say with some of the things you saw during the quarter it felt like during the quarter you guys talked about larger corporate pay downs or things that are happening earlier in the quarter. Maybe those headwinds are abating. But it feels like the general middle market and small business part of your portfolio is where there is really the momentum might be picking up. So maybe you can talk about that dynamic within the loan portfolio by that product type?","Curtis Farmer","Yes Brian. So, I'll talk about corporate banking first and then I'll come back to middle market small business as you mentioned at the end of your question there. On the corporate side, I think it's important to remember couple of things. One, we did have a strong fourth quarter and corporate banking. And then secondly in the first quarter, we do typically have seasonality in that book of business. You think about sort of buildup in cash with larger corporations in the fourth quarter and then normal distributions that occur for a number of different reasons in Q1. So, we always expect some seasonality in the first quarter. ","And then we pointed to somewhat a unique situation, where we have done some financing for one of our best clients in that business line, that was unique in nature. It was a short-term bridge financing about half of the declines was related to that. And we knew a payoff was coming. We were anticipating a payoff. We didn\u2019t know whether it would occur in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter. So that\u2019s not a repeatable item. So, when you look at a more normal run rate for corporate banking, I would say that we\u2019ve got we opportunity in that business line. Our pipeline remains pretty healthy heading into the second quarter. I think there were some anomaly in results, in corporate banking for the first quarter. ","And then secondly when I talked earlier about sort of pipeline strength, utilization and what we were solving towards the end of the quarter heading into Q2 that covered our new market and small business segments as well. And I mentioned earlier that we saw growth from a general middle market standpoint, all three of our markets average growth as well as period end growth for the quarter, which we have not seen in a while, so California, Texas and the Michigan market. And I think the dynamics of all of three there is economies bode well, I think, for growth for the balance of the year in those three markets. ","Brian Klock","And I guess my last question, on the deposit side, there is a seasonality in the first quarter that you guys have talked about, I think just looking at end of period for the total deposits or so down. Interest barking deposit down about 1% year-over-year and 3% on the non-interest bearing. I know you talk a little bit about that earlier. Is there anything going on where you maybe some of that the excess utilization might be still there, that the [indiscernible] are still there? But maybe there is actually some use and then take down of those deposits before drawing a line. So, is that another reason maybe to feel good about, getting that GDP growth as it maybe you\u2019re seeking through some of that and some of your customers on the commercial side or point down their excess liquidity and then they\u2019ll turn to drawing back on their lines later in the year?","Curtis Farmer ","Yes. Brian, I think that\u2019s exactly as you said. It\u2019s a combination of normal seasonality. And then secondly, we do feel like that we\u2019re starting to see with many of our client's utilization on excess liquidity and I think that is a good forerunner of hopefully growth opportunities as clients start thinking about CapEx and other growth related to lending activity. And so, I do think that what we\u2019re seeing in the first quarter beyond seasonality is some pull down of deposits for net investment type activity in many of our businesses and many of our customers.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thanks, Regina. Good morning, and welcome to Comerica's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our President and CEO, Curt Farmer; Interim","Chief Financial Officer, Jim Herzog; Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile; Executive Director of Business Bank, Peter Sefzik. ","During this presentation, we will be referring to slides which provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on the SEC's website as well as on the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. This conference call contains forward-looking statements, and in that regard you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to materially vary from expectations.","Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

Also, this conference call may reference non-GAAP measures, in that regard, I direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within the presentation. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Curt, who will begin on Slide 3.","Curtis Farmer","Good morning, everyone. Today, we reported full year 2019 earnings per share of $7.87, a 9% increase over 2018. Highlights for the year included driving strong loan growth, which pushed total assets to a record level while continuing to turn our relationship oriented deposit base. Also with the benefit of higher fee income, revenue reached at an all time high. This growth along with careful expenditure control resulted in an efficiency ratio of under 52%. In addition, credit quality remained solid and we meaningfully reduced excess capital. Our book value grew 10%. We raised dividend 46%. Also our ROE increased to above 16%. ","Slide 4 provides details of our 2019 results. Average loans increased 4% including strong growth in the first two quarters of the year. Deposit trends kept up significantly in the second half the year, resulting in a relatively stable balances year-over-year. As far as net interest income, the benefit from loan growth and the net impact from higher rates was offset by an increase in interest rate and deposits as well as wholesale funding. ","The provision increased from a very low level in 2018 and reflected continued solid credit quality with 21 basis points in net charge offs or only 4 basis points excluding Energy. We repurchased 18.6 million shares during the year, reducing our average share count by 11% and together with an increase in our dividend we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders. ","In summary, we achieved record earnings per share and continue to enhance shareholder value. ","Turning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter earnings were $269 million for $1.85 per share. These results demonstrate our ability to drive solid returns with an ROE of nearly 15% and an ROA of 1.5%, despite declines in interest rates. ","Broad-based deposits and non-interest income growth, strong credit quality and continued active capital management were positive contributors to our performance. ","Compared to the third quarter, average loans remained relatively steady as expected. Mortgage Banker continued to benefit from robust refi activity. Also Commercial Real Estate and Environmental Services maintained their growth trends. This was offset by declines in general Middle Market as well as National Dealer which was partly due to lower inventory levels. ","The tone of recent conversations I've had with customers and colleagues across our markets is optimistic and we continue to see slow and steady economic expansion. We are focused on employing new customer acquisition, cross-sale and retention strategies that we have launched over the past year and we continue to make customer experience a corporate priority as we seek to raise the expectations of what a bank can be. ","While loans were relatively slow, deposit growth was robust, increasing $1.5 billion relative to the third quarter with almost every business line contributing. The mix of the growth was favorable with over 40% coming from non-interest bearing deposits. ","In conjunction with this growth, we have reduced higher cost brokered deposits by nearly $700 million. Our interest-bearing deposit cost declined 7 basis points to 92 basis points in the fourth quarter. We are closely monitoring the competition and with the recent debt rate cuts we are taking action to adjust deposit pricing. By carefully managing our deposit rates, we are attracting and retaining relationships. Our strategy is working and it is clearly demonstrated by our deposit growth. ","The increase in relationship deposit allowed us to reduce higher cost wholesale funding, and helped reduce our loan to total funding cost to 71 basis points. Also, our loan to deposit ratios decreased to 88%. ","Of note, the U.S. Treasury recently announced that we will continue to be the exclusive financial intermediary for the Direct Express government benefits card program for another five years. The economics of this program include attractive retail deposits that we continue to grow, and our ability to leverage a third-party platform for processing and servicing. ","As far as net interest income, over 80% of our loans are floating rate and primarily tied to 30-day LIBOR which on average declined 39 basis points during the quarter. Lower rates were the primary driver for our net interest income decline to $544 million, resulting in a net interest margin of 3.2%. ","We added $750 million of swaps in October and an additional $1 billion in early January. Our strategy is to continue to build our hedging program over time, closely monitoring the market and taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. Credit quality remained strong in the fourth quarter with net charge-offs of only 16 basis points. Charge-offs continued to primarily consist of valuation impairments on select Energy credits as capital markets for this sector remain soft. ","Excluding Energy, net charge-offs were only $2 million. Non-performing assets declined and were only 43 basis points of total loans and the provision decreased to $8 million. A $10 million increase in non-interest income helped offset the more challenging rate environment. We had strong growth in customer derivative income, as well as a gain from the sale of our Healthcare Savings or HSA business, along with incremental growth in several other categories.","Expenses increased as expected primarily related to higher compensation, outside processing and seasonal occupancy. This is in line with the outlook we provided for full year expenses to remain flat, excluding 2018 restructuring costs. We maintained our targeted 10% CET1 target. We returned $246 million in capital to shareholders through our dividends, which currently provides almost a 4% return and by repurchasing 2.1 million shares under our share buyback program.","And now I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James Herzog","Thanks Curt and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 6, as Curt indicated, average loans were stable in the fourth quarter with increases in Commercial Real Estate, Mortgage Banker and Environmental Services offset by decreases in general Middle Market and National Dealer. Relative to the fourth quarter last year, average loans were up 1.7 billion. Total commitments as of quarter end were stable compared to the third quarter with growth in Commercial Real Estate, Equity Fund Services, U.S. Banking and general Middle Market offset by reductions in Energy, Dealer and Technology & Life Sciences. Our pipeline remained solid.","Our loan yields were 4.43%, a decrease of 40 basis points from the third quarter. This was result of lower interest rates, primarily one month LBIOR in addition to a $3 million decline in non-accrual interest from an elevated third quarter level. ","Slide 7 provides details on deposits. Average balances increased 1.5 billion with growth across all three of our markets. Non-interest bearing deposits increased over 600 million while customer interest bearing balances increased 1.45 billion. We managed our higher costs brokered deposits down about 700 million. As far as deposit costs, with the decline in interest rates, we adjusted deposit pay rates throughout the quarter. Together with the decline in brokered deposits we achieved a 7 basis point decrease in our interest bearing deposit costs. This is at the high end of the guidance we had previously provided. ","As you can see on Slide 8, our MBS portfolio is stable and the yield on the portfolio held steady. Yields on recent purchases have been around 2.4%. We have had a modest increase in prepays in the back half of the year, so this is not had a significant impact on our duration for the unamortized premium, which remains relatively small.","Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income was $544 million and the net interest margin is 3.2%. Loans had a negative impact of $55 million or 31 basis points to the margin. The major factor was lower interest rates, which had $46 million impact and 28 basis points on the margin. Also contributing to the decrease were lower balances, a decline in non-accrual interest from elevated levels, and to a lesser extent other portfolios dynamics, including lower loan fees. Fed deposits added $3 million but had a 7 basis point negative impact to the margin. Higher balances added $7 million and resulted in a 5 basis point drag on the margin. A lower credit rate had an impact of $4 million or 2 basis points. Lower rates improved deposit cost by $3 million or 2 basis points on the margin and reduced wholesale funding cost by $7 million adding 4 basis points to the margin.","In summary, given the nature of our portfolio, our loans were priced very quickly. Therefore, the net impact of lower rates including a full quarter impact of the July and September rate cuts, along with October's was the primary driver of our net interest income in the fourth quarter. Assuming rates remain steady going forward, we believe the bulk of impact of lower rates is behind us. ","Credit quality was strong as shown on Slide 10. Our net charge-offs were $21 million or 16 basis points. Excluding Energy, net charge-offs were only $2 million. ","Total non-performing assets declined to 43 basis points, one of the lowest levels since 2006 and criticized loans comprised only 4% of total loans as of quarter end. As far as Energy, while charge-offs were lower in the fourth quarter than the previous two quarters, we continue to see impairment of select Energy loans with valuations of a few liquidating Energy assets impacted by volatile oil and gas prices, as well as weak capital markets. Energy non-accrual loans decreased $31 million. However, we have seen a moderate amount of negative migration as criticized Energy loans increased $146 million. Therefore, we increased our reserve for Energy which remains at a very healthy level.","Our reserve ratio for total loans held steady at 1.27% and resulted in a provision of $8 million, a decline of $27 million from the third quarter. As far as our adoption of CECL as of January 1, our implementation process has been successful and is virtually complete. Given a relatively short duration of our commercially-weighted portfolio in expectation of a fairly benign economic environment, we expect a change in reserve will be a decrease of 0% to 5% and therefore we will have a little impact on our capital ratios.","Non-interest income increased $10 million as shown on Slide 11. Customer derivative income increased $7 million, including the rate impact on the credit valuation adjustment. Commercial lending fees increased $2 million with robust syndication activity. We also had small increases in several other categories including investment banking, brokerage fees and securities crediting. This was partly offset by a $5 million decrease in card fees as a result of the mix shift in the transaction volumes of government cards as well as two fewer business days in the quarter impacting corporate and merchant card volumes, also fiduciary income decreased 1 million mainly due to a tax preparation fees received in the third quarter. During the quarter, we sold our HSA business for a gain of $6 million. Of note, deferred cmop asset returns which are offset in non-interest expenses were 3 million, the same levels as the third quarter. ","Turning to expenses on Slide 12. Salaries and benefits increased $4 million. This was a result of higher incentive compensation and commissions tied to performance as well as seasonal healthcare expense. In addition, outside processing increased 4 million due to a vendor transition fee, and seasonality drove a $2 million increase in occupancy expenses as well as several other categories. We continue to carefully manage costs as we invest for the future, as evidenced by our efficiency ratio of 55% which is well below of the third quarter peer average. ","In the fourth quarter, we repurchased is $150 million or 2.1 million shares under our share repurchase program, as shown on Slide 13. Together with dividends, we returned $246 million to shareholders. Our goal is continue to return excess capital back to shareholders and maintain our CET1 ratio at approximately 10%.","Turning to the rate environment on Slide 14. Assuming interest rates remain at the current levels, the net impact from rates is estimated to be $10 million to $15 million on our first quarter net interest income relative to the fourth quarter. This includes the full quarter effect of the recent fed cuts combined with the actions we've taken to lower deposit rates. Of course actual results will vary depending on a variety of factors such as LIBOR movements. As far as the remaining three quarters of 2020, if rates held steady, we expect to see a relatively smaller residual effect from rates as longer dated assets and liabilities reprice. ","In addition, continued hedging activity could have a modest negative impact. We continue to work to gradually moderate our asset sensitivity. We added $750 million to our hedging portfolio in October and $1 billion in early January. We currently have about $5.5 billion in interest rates swaps with an average remaining tenure of about three years and are currently in the money. Overall, we remain positive and constructive on the U.S. economy, and we plan to make steady progress in building our hedging portfolio over time.","Slide 15 provides our outlook for 2020, which assumes a continuation of the current rate and economic environment. We expect the average loans to grow approximately 2% to 3% in 2020 relative to 2019. We anticipate continued slow, steady economic expansion yielding growth in most business lines. This is expected to be partly offset by a decline in Mortgage Banker from elevated levels as refi volumes normalize and a modest reduction in National Dealer Services driven by a projected reduction in auto sales. ","As far as the first quarter, we expect loan growth for most business lines will be mostly offset by a decline in Mortgage Banker due to seasonality combined with a slowdown in refi activity. We expect average deposit growth of 1% to 2%. We believe we will have a normal seasonality through the year including the typical first quarter decline. Our goal is to continue to attract and retain long-term customer relationships by offering superior products and services along with the appropriate pricing. ","As I discussed on the previous slide, the rate impact on net interest income is expected to be mostly absorbed in the first quarter with an additional modest effect for the remainder of the year. Also the full year expense of higher wholesale funding will have an impact. In addition, we expect $6 million to $8 million decrease in non-accrual interest recoveries from the elevated level we saw in 2019. Loan growth is expected to provide a partial offset. We believe our portfolio will continue to perform well, resulting in a net charge-off similar to 2019 in the 15 basis point to 25 basis point range. ","Given the new CECL accounting standards, which became effective January 1st and assuming the current economic backdrop, we expect provision should be slightly above net charge-offs as we are taking into consideration our loan growth outlook. Note that this new standard may cause greater volatility in our provision. ","As far as non-interest income, we expect growth of about 1% led by card and fiduciary fees. Our expectation includes declines in certain key categories that had strong growth in 2019 such as customer derivative and warrant income. Also deferred comp which totaled $9 million in 2019, it\u2019s hard to predict and it's not assumed to repeat. As far as the first quarter, keep in mind that the fourth quarter included a gain on the sale of the HSA business and additionally a strong derivative income and syndication fees as well as deferred comp of $3 million, all of which are dependent on market conditions and therefore may not continue at these levels. ","Expenses are expected to increase approximately 3% year-over-year. We expect to see a rise in outside processing tied to fee income growth and increase in technology investment as we execute our revenue and efficiency related projects that are implied. In addition, we expect inflationary pressures on items such as annual merit, staff insurance and marketing. As a result of lower discount rate, pension expense is increasing about $7 million. Also recall the first quarter includes elevated salary and benefits expense due to share -- annual share compensation and associated higher payroll taxes, which are expected to be mostly offset by seasonally lower marketing and occupancy expenses. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. And as far as capital, we expect to maintain our CET1 target of approximately 10%. ","Now, I'll turn the call back to Curt.","Curtis Farmer","Thank you, Jim. The outlook we've provided reflects our expectations for continued moderate U.S. expansion through 2020. A core volatile economy and the strong value of the dollar remained a headwind for U.S. trade. However, many sources of uncertainty that accumulated through 2019 such as China and Mexico and Canadian trade agreements have been or may soon be resolved. The interest rate environment looks stable for the year ahead. And the labor market in the U.S. remains strong and will continue to support the consumer sector. We believe this backdrop should benefit us and our customers as the year progresses. ","Over our 170 year history, we have managed through many economic and interest rate cycles. With our efficiency ratio in the mid 50s and an ROE of nearly 15%, we are better positioned to weather changes in the economy or interest rate environment. We remain focused on controlling the things we can control to maintain our solid performance. ","Our 2019 results demonstrated our ability to grow revenue while maintaining favorable credit metrics and well controlled expenses. Our key strength provides the foundation to continue to enhance long-term shareholder value. Specifically our geographic footprint which includes faster growing diverse markets, combined with our relationship banking strategy is expected to result in growth of loans, deposits and fee income. We continue to maintain our proven expense discipline as we invest for the future. Also our conservative, consistent approach to banking including credit and capital management has positioned us well. ","Now, we would be happy to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. ","Ken Zerbe","I just wanted to start off in terms of NII outlook. I just want to make sure I really understand what you're trying to say here. The way I read it is that first quarter is obviously down $10 million to $15 million. And then the rate impact is going to be negative on NII. So if dollars go lower in each subsequent quarter throughout 2020 but then you had -- presumably you have the asset growth offset to that. Are you trying to say that NII from a dollar basis is going to be lower than the first quarter throughout the year, or like how do you see the net impact of all the different factors affecting NII after first quarter? Thanks. ","Curtis Farmer","Do you want to take it, Jim?","James Herzog","Yes, thanks for the question. We will see progressively lower impact from rates as we go through the year and I mentioned the $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter. It will be a much smaller amount in the second quarter. As of now it might be call it the $5 million to $7 million range. Then it becomes closer to a negligible number in the third and fourth quarter, even though we will see some impact all the way through the year. And of course, I've mentioned to the extent we have hedges and depending on the rates there, that will obviously have an impact also. ","We'll obviously pick up the volume as the year goes on, and you heard me mention the non-accrual impact that overall will be an impact on 2020 compared to 2019. ","Ken Zerbe","Sorry. The -- I guess because -- I'm sure you guys do very detailed modeling for the year. Is it right to assume that your NII if you look at say fourth quarter of \u201820, is that going to be lower or higher than the first of '20? ","Curtis Farmer","You should see volume overtake rate once we get beyond the first quarter, to answer your question. So most of that rate impact is solid in the first quarter. And then you're right, volume does start to step up and the rate impact starts to decline. So you start to see a crossover once you get into the second and third quarters. ","Ken Zerbe","Got you, okay. Alright, that's helpful. I guess maybe just -- I guess second question, in terms of fee income. You mentioned I guess in your guidance that, that assumes kind of I think essentially no -- what is the right word? No returns on deferred compensation assets. And that's part of the assumption starting at 1%. Can you just explain that and is it possible that your fee growth is more than 1% if you do get returns on those assets?","James Herzog","Well obviously deferred comp is a bit of wild card. It depends on the market and the market returns on the growth comp. So it can actually be positive or negative. So I would be very hesitant to assume there\u2019s going to be any kinds of return there. In fact it could go the other direction. ","Ken Zerbe","Got it, understood. Okay. And then just -- if I can sneak one last one in. In terms of your loan growth, obviously a 2% or 3%. I think last quarter you talked about something around nominal GDP. And I guess my interpretation of nominal GDP was closer to 4%. Can you just comment, are you seeing weakness or any kind of deterioration? I mean presumably you're seeing some weakness in your expectation for loan growth this quarter versus last quarter and what's driving that? Thanks.","Peter Sefzik","Hey, Ken. This is Peter. I think the 2% to 3% that we've communicated, we feel good about. We have seen a little bit of a slowdown in the fourth quarter. And I think we listed the businesses that where we've seen that. There's been some sort of interesting timing on what we\u2019ve had in Dealer and Mortgage. But going into 2020, we feel good about our ability to accomplish the 2% to 3% that we've communicated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","And then also on the NII topic. So, I guess this outlook implies probably that we got some incremental compression in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter. And then, help -- can you talk about how the margin should progress beyond that? Is it fair to assume stable or some incremental compression from there as we move through second, third and fourth quarter of 2020? Thanks.","James Herzog","Okay. Yes, happy to answer that. We have a couple of factors that will be netting against each other. We did note that we have about 5 bps of compression due to the higher balances, that\u2019s the excess liquidity that you saw in the fourth quarter, and you're going to net against that the $10 million to $15 million guidance that I offered in the first quarter, and progressively smaller amounts after that. And so, if you do the simple math on that, it would imply a modest reduction from the current through to '20. ","Having said that, we're always going to provide NIM percentage guidance just because it is so impacted by excess liquidity, which based on our customer profile is very hard to predict.","John Pancari","And then on the expense front, you indicated your guidance that you -- your expense outlook is impacted in part by higher outside processing expenses related to revenue and you mentioned in your comments too it seems like maybe fee revenue. Can you talk about what that is? And then separately, can you talk about what expense leverage you may have incrementally as you look at 2020 given the tougher revenue backdrop and any consideration for pulling back even harder on the expense side? Thanks.","James Herzog","Yes, very specific to the outside processing fees, so we actually do have some good core growth in a number of line items in 2021. One of those is card income. And of course, we have associated outside processing fees with that. Now, some of these strong core line item growth there is that we have will be offset by some of the items that I mentioned, the very strong year we had in 2019 with syndications, bonds, or derivatives and of course the deferred comp item that we talked about earlier. But we just saw the strong card year, and we will have some outside processing fees associated with that. ","And regarding your second question on where should be pull back, we are always very focused on expense control. I think we have to keep in mind that we're starting again from a very strong position of 55% efficiency ratio, but we do feel it\u2019s important to make the proper investments in technology and make sure that we're pushing forward in terms of moving the company to where it needs to be. So we are going to continue to invest in technology and don\u2019t anticipate pulling back on that at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. ","Steven Alexopoulos","To follow-up first on John\u2019s question on expenses. So if you look at the 3% expected increase in 2020, is there anything unusual you would call out? I mean, pension sound like was 7 million? Or do you think that's a good run rate for the company here, as you continue to reinvest?","James Herzog","Yes, pension would be the only growing usual item there. I would say normal inflation, including merits would be the largest item. So nothing too unique in terms of what makes up that expense base. Going forward, I'd be hesitant to call that a run rate. What we're really focused on is really operating leverage going forward. We do have a bit of a transition here with some of the pension expense and some of the strong non-interest income headwind as we talked about earlier. But we're really more focused on positive operating leverage, and that's where we expect to get in the future. ","Steven Alexopoulos","And I just was looking for more color, you guys put up really strong growth in deposits in the corner. Give more color on why was it so strong? ","James Herzog","Yes, it was a very strong quarter. We're very pleased with it. We talked about being up $1.5 billion. We keep in mind, we ran off about $700 million of brokered CDs. So the way I look at it is, we actually are up about $2.2 billion or so in deposits. So we were very pleased there. It's a very concerted effort to go out and deposit gather, reprice appropriately where we needed to. These are relationships that we have poured into the bank, none of these were standalone deposits. ","Now, I will say that probably at least half of this is seasonal. And it's always hard to tell when this money might bleed out during the first quarter. But approximately half, maybe a little half from what I can tell is seasonal. But there is a strong component of it that I think is core and will stick with us through the year, even if we see a minor decline in the first quarter.","Curtis Farmer","This is Curt. I might add, Steven that the relationship component that Jim talked about. We've made a deliberate strategy not to try to chase sort of hot money or transactional deposits. But heavily leveraged our deposit pricing and the programs that we've had in place like our CD program around new client acquisition and acquiring additional deposits from existing customers, which I think is the right strategy for us longer term and it\u2019s very consistent with our relationship based approach. ","Steven Alexopoulos","Maybe just one final one. Curt, your comments recently about Comerica potentially being in acquirer got quite a bit of attention. I'm curious, are you actively having conversations with targets or is this something you're just thinking of really over the longer term? Thanks.","Curtis Farmer","Yes, Steven, I think maybe, first thing I would say is that if you read the text of anything that has been written on me, there is no change in any of our strategy. There are a few headlines that maybe were I think a little bit misleading. We are very focused on organic growth as we have been for a long time. We've done two acquisitions during the last 20 years and what we said and what I said and we\u2019re outperforming is that if there's something that makes sense in Texas and California that would be a good strategic fit. And one of the major metropolitan areas and major right economics for our company and for our shareholders, we\u2019ll take a look at. But that lens is fairly narrow and so sort of day in and day out we continue to focus on organic growth. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust.","Jennifer Demba","A question on asset quality. It looks like the increasing criticized loans was Energy driven. Just wondering if you guys think charge-offs will be higher in that sector this year or lower? And are you seeing any other underlying weakness in any other sector in your portfolio? Thanks. ","Curtis Farmer","Pete?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, Jennifer. So we're guiding 75 basis points to 125 basis points in charge-offs. And if you take a look at 2019, only 4 basis points of ex-Energy charge-offs. We don't think that\u2019s sustainable. So we would expect that ex-Energy we would see slightly higher charge-offs than what we saw in 2019. And we're hopeful that, that could be offset fully or at least partially by lower Energy charge-offs. So we think that that\u2019s where we get the outlook. ","Jennifer Demba","Okay. Are you seeing any weakness at all in any other sectors or geographies Pete at this point?","Pete Guilfoile","No, we're really not. 4 basis points of ex-Energy charge-offs in 2019 and only $2 million in net charge-off ex-Energy in the fourth quarter. Our non-accrual levels are at very low levels and that includes Energy. So we're seeing a lot of strength, particularly in a $48 billion of the portfolio that is ex-Energy. ","Jennifer Demba","Okay. One other question. And we saw a major transaction announced in Texas recently. Just wondering if you guys are expecting any merger disruption opportunities from that transaction? Thanks. ","Curtis Farmer","Jennifer there\u2019s always disruptions that occur in markets when transactions occur, but I would say in general I think that there's nothing that strategically changes our focus as an organization. And we are in some different segments and some different customer focus and a number of transactions that have occurred.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo securities. ","Mike Mayo","So how much was your technology spending last year? How much do you think it will increase? And what are the areas of technology spending focused? ","Curtis Farmer","Yes. Jim, you want start on that and then I'll add in around some of the areas of focus. ","James Herzog","Yes, Mike. We don't quote a specific number in technology spending simply because it's so difficult and challenging to get an apples-to-apples work with other banks and defining exactly what falls in the technology bucket. But I will say we have a -- as implied in the expense outlook for 2020, we do have a modest increase in technology expense in 2020 over beyond the strong spend in 2019. So it is something that we continue to invest in. ","Curtis Farmer","And I might just add to that, Mike, that we've talked before about the year of initiative having positioned us well from an overall technology spend. We did a lot of work the last several years to rationalize many of our applications and some of our aging platforms. I think we've been a leader in terms of cloud migration, especially in non-customer interfacing applications. And then a lot of the work we have done around that has helped free up capacity for us for new projects. In the last 12 months that has included a new across the company loan origination and servicing platform, a new company-wide CRM platform, major investments in data analytics to help us in the marketing and servicing of our clients, major upgrades for our call center technology. And then for 2020 a number of key areas of focus and items that will be coming online related to upgrades to our ATMs, major upgrades to your banking center, infrastructure and technology including enabling all of our employees in the banking center with tablets to make them more mobile in their selling and servicing efforts, pretty major upgrades on boarding capabilities on the digital side for our consumer prospects and customers and then fairly significant upgrades to our treasury management platform and the payments area, as well as the new portal for our wealth management clients. So, we continue to be very focused on things that I would put in a category of colleague and customer enablement. And like most institutions, we have a longer term roadmap we're working on. But we feel like we are well positioned relative to our competitors in providing really good experience to our customers.","Mike Mayo","And then one follow-up. I assume you employed many vendors to help you with this transformation. What took place with the vendor transition costs? I guess you always have a balance getting vendors to help you facilitate the transition. On the other hand, there's always the risk of vendor lock in and during this quarter you had a vendor transition cost. So can you describe the analysis that goes into selecting vendors? How you prepare against too much vendor lock in versus the goal of transforming the company faster? ","Curtis Farmer","I'm going to take the sort of the second part of your question, and then I will turn it to Jim for the more specifics around the expense in the quarter. We do have a number of key vendor relationships like most institutions. Given the size of organization we are, we try to right balance between proprietary capabilities, and leveraging third-parties where it makes sense. Those third-parties go through the exact same oversight process that we do as if we were building something or servicing something in-house including robust fiber oversight. And we believe we've gotten really good relationships that we can leverage and we try to get sort of good point in terms of balance and trying to help concentration issues with any one senior single vendor. ","So Jim you maybe want to talk about the specifics around the quarter. ","James Herzog","Yes, I would say that other than the size there was actually nothing real unusual about this vender transition. We are always evaluating our vendors to do the right thing for both ourselves and customers. It's not unusual for us to have a vender transition. This one was a little bit larger. But it's something that we're always evolving on in terms of looking at both quality and cost and capabilities. And I was just saying that this is a one-time cost that\u2019s larger than typical, it's not unusual. We have had vender transitions really every year and sometimes multiple times within a year. So, I think there's probably not a lot more to that other than the size. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. ","Ken Usdin","A question on the deposit cost side of things. You mentioned that you saw the 7 basis point decline in costs. And just wondering what happens from here in a stable rates environment? How much do you continue to have of just natural resetting in deposit costs versus what else from here would have to be more negotiated with across the customer base, as you\u2019ve talked about in the past? Thanks.","Curtis Farmer","Jim?","James Herzog","Yes, happy to answer that. We did reprice deposits throughout the fourth quarter as I mentioned. So, even though we saw the 7 basis points decline in the fourth quarter, I would expect a continued decline in the first quarter just based off the efforts undertaken thus far. The change in the first quarter will be a smaller amount of the 7 bps that we saw in the fourth quarter. I\u2019d probably characterize it based on actions taken to-date as being kind of the lower-single-digits of bps. But we'll see where things play out there.","The two things that -- two or three things that caused a further reduction. One is, we did see some mix shift in the fourth quarter. The actions that we actually took in the fourth quarter probably would imply a little larger bps reduction but did see some of our relationship deposits grow related to some of the higher priced accounts. So whether or not some of that mix shift and wind remains to be seen but that could be a tailwind. And I would say really depends on the competition and what happens in competitive landscape. ","I've seen a little bit of follow the leader out there in terms of deposit pricing. And I think that in turn for the industry will be driven by loan growth and the demand for funding. That\u2019s certainly true specific to Comerica, but I think larger picture it affects the entire industry, we're not immune from that. So we'll continue to watch the competitive landscape and do the right thing for our customers and for our balance sheet. ","Ken Usdin ","And one more question just on the mix of earning assets. With all this good deposit growth that you have, a lot of it ended up just sitting in cash and unfortunately 10 years still 180 or so. So how do you sort of think about if this deposit growth continues or hangs around, does it just stay in cash or given not much of an optionality versus securities book or do you sort of flush it back into the security book over time?","James Herzog","Well, we do expect some of these deposits to late in Q1 as we mentioned the seasonality factor falls in Q4 and the typical Q1 seasonality. So how much liquidity and excess liquidity we have remains to be seen. To the extent we do have excess liquidity, I would say it really depends on the interest rate landscape. ","In general, we are happy with the size of our securities portfolio. And the curve is flat enough that there's not a lot of percentage in tying up that liquidity at this point in time. That\u2019s something we will continue to monitor, but I would not anticipate growing our securities book in terms of size at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","I just wanted to follow up to your response to Steve\u2019s earlier question on operating leverage. Obviously, in '20, given the poor comparison to '19 NII, that's obviously quite difficult. But is the message that as we look out into 2021, there's more flexibility for the expense growth to be less than 3% or at least you have more levers to pull it lower than revenue growth?","Curtis Farmer","Erika, this is Curt. I would say that when you look at the history of our company, especially the last year, we definitely have had a proven expense discipline. You look at the performance metrics that really are at the top of our peer group and we expect them to be near the top of our peer group once everybody reports, especially the efficiency ratios. So we know how to manage expenses. We've done a good job at that in our history. We remain very focused on expense management. There are a few dynamics in play in 2020 that Jim talked about. And we are going to continue to strike the right balance between managing expenses and investing the thing that we need to invest in longer term to help our customers and to serve our customers appropriately and to grow the institution. But you should expect for us longer term to remain focused on positive operating leverage and there's always additional levers that we can pull. We don't believe strategically that sometimes those are the right things to do, and again, striking the right balance between investing in technology and things of that nature. And it's for the overall expense side worth numbers. ","Erika Najarian","Got it. And my second question is, you bought back almost $1.4 billion worth of stock, which really helped in a year when the fed cut three times. And with the CET1 ratio just 14 basis points above target, how should we think about buyback appetite in 2020?","Curtis Farmer","Jim?","James Herzog","Yes, we -- for us it\u2019s a pretty simple target in terms of we're simply calibrating what we need for support our loan growth, support our dividend and then calibrate that against earnings generation. And the goal is simply to come as close to 10% as we can. And we've been in that ballpark for last two quarters. And I would anticipate staying plus or minus to that 10% throughout 2020. ","Erika Najarian","And just as a follow-up question. I think I ask you this every quarter. But can you maybe just remind us what is your actual capital binding constraint? Because I'm sure a lot of peer or a lot of investors look at the CET1 and it's 150 basis points above the targets of some much larger regional banks. But if you could remind us what your actual binding constraint is on capital?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, there's a couple ways of looking at that. If you look at it from a pure stress testing standpoint, the binding constraint would be Tier 1. We obviously don't have it referred in our stack. But there's another way of looking at it. And that is, we're always conscious of our constituents and the rating agencies, regulators, customers. And from that standpoint the CET1 is a very important ratio too. So I'm not trying to say there's just one binding constraint. It depends on what perspective you're looking at it from.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James.","Michael Rose","Just as we think about the efficiency and the technology expenses, been a lot of talk on this call. Is there any change to kind of the intermediate term profitability ROE, ROI expectations just given the front loading of some of the expenses in the revenue environment? Thanks. ","James Herzog","No. We've enunciated in the past that we expect to be in a low to mid ROEs. We could drop to be more of a low double-digits -- I'm sorry, just to clarify, the low double-digit and mid double-digit ROE. And we expect to stay in that range in the foreseeable future. Interest rates will be a significant impacting driver there. So we'll see where those go. But we feel pretty good about the double-digit ROE going forward at this point, so.","Michael Rose","Okay. And then just one housekeeping question. Just when I look at the NPAs, how much of that is actually Energy versus non-Energy when I look at the commercial bucket? Thanks. ","Curtis Farmer","Pete?","Pete Guilfoile ","Yes, Michael, I don't have the breakdown for you. I don't think. It\u2019s Page 10. So 43 million in Energy, 156 million in ex-Energy. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.","Gary Tenner","I have a couple questions, one on the Energy bucket. As you gave your guidance for loan growth in 2020, obviously you highlighted Dealer Services and Mortgage. I'm curious with the pretty significant decline in this quarter in E&P, and what seems to be still a kind of a challenging outlook for that segment, what the apatite is for new lending in that space in 2020? ","Curtis Farmer","Peter.","Peter Sefzik","Hey, Gary. This is Peter. So, I mean our appetite is that we are still looking for opportunities, but I will tell you that they're more limited in this environment that we're in. We're not seeing a whole lot of deal flow. We are seeing consolidation in the space. Not a lot of capital coming into it. But we're continuing to be a very important energy lender in the space. We've got really good relationships. We're going to support our customers and to the extent there\u2019s new opportunities that make sense for us, we're pursuing them.","Gary Tenner","And then secondly on the HSA business, I assume that there were some associated deposits with that line of businesses. So can you just highlight what the amount was?","James Herzog","This is Jim. Those deposits were very negligible. They won't even move the dial whatsoever. That's a fairly small scale business for us. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","Just wondering, I was looking at average loan growth, it seemed to have weakened a little bit from the mid quarter update. And I'm just wondering, what drove that? And what gives you the confidence of the 2% to 3% loan growth in 2020? Because first quarter is going to start off kind of flattish.","Pete Guilfoile","Peter, it\u2019s Pete. I would just remind you again. For last year we had 4% year-over-year loan growth, it felt really good across kind of most of our businesses. In the first part of the year, we really saw good loan growth in middle market. And I think if we got into the second half of the year, we saw a little bit really in California and Michigan where middle market slowed down a little bit, but nothing that overly concern of. Texas continued to perform really well. So, as we go into next year, we feel like our pipelines in middle market and those markets look really good and we feel good about our specialty businesses. ","Again we did see a little bit of dial back in Dealer at the end of the quarter. Out EFS business dialed back a little bit, but we still feel really good about those going into 2020. And feel like we're going to be able to achieve that 2% to 3% that we've communicated.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then, on a separate note, just one housekeeping. The guidance for non-interest income in the first quarter of down $10 million to $15 million, that does not include one less day count, which I think is about $6 million to $7 million. Is that right? ","James Herzog","That is correct. Yes, we were simply guiding on the rate impact and we mentioned $10 million to $15 million. So you are absolutely right, there will be the one day impact. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets.","Lana Chan","I just a couple of cleanup questions. One on the fee income side. The expectations for growth in 2020 from the fiduciary side, it was kind of flat in 2019. What's driving growth expectations in 2020? ","James Herzog","Yes, it\u2019s fiduciary specifically?","Lana Chan ","Yes. I think that was one of the drivers of the fee income growth in 2020, card and fiduciary.","Curtis Farmer","Yes. I would say there\u2019s a couple things related to fiduciary. One, that\u2019s a business that we've been in for a long time and a business in which we have scale serving our existing clients who are in the institutional trust business as well. And then we have a third-party trust platform where we provide trust services for many of the larger broker-dealers in the U.S. And so we see growth opportunities kind of across all of those various buckets. Fiduciary is also one of those categories that is impacted by market and so optimistic outlook on the equity and bond markets for 2020. The flattest nature of the 2019, nothing unusual there. We did have some repositioning with a number of different customers. But over time that\u2019s a business that we have grown nicely and we would see sort of normal growth in 2020.","Lana Chan","And the second question is, can you remind me, do you have a target dividend payout ratio?","James Herzog","We do not. Our goal with the dividend is simply to make sure that it is sustainable. That's where really our focus is. And obviously you don't want the dividend payout ratio to get too high if you have what I\u2019ll call a normal income stream, which we consider our income stream to be somewhat normal right now. So simply sustainable and strong and we're comfortable with it is right now.","Curtis Farmer","Lana, just to add to that. Obviously the last four or five years, we've had very nice growth in dividend and return to our shareholders, so we've been very focused on that. And you\u2019d expect for rate of growth in the dividend to start to slow out in the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brocker Vandervliet with UBS.","Vilas Abraham","This is Vilas Abraham for Brock. Just a quick question on CECL, if you guys could just give a little bit more color on the day two impact. Who are you thinking about that and maybe specifically as it relates to the Energy portfolio? Thanks.","Curtis Farmer","Yes. The day two impact with regard to Energy, we have to look at a couple of different factors. One is, it\u2019s not just our -- the economic forecast but how the economic forecast would impact Energy specifically. And so we would expect that there would be modest growth in our reserves and it would be just like it would be under the incurred model but we don't expect CECL would impact that to any larger degree than with what we see under the incurred model. ","Operator","I'll now turn the call back over to Curt Farmer, President and Chief Executive Officer for any further remarks.","Curtis Farmer","As always, we appreciate your questions. We appreciate your interest in our company and I want to thank you for joining the call today. Have a very good day. Thank you. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's call.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. Good morning, and welcome to Comerica's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curt Farmer; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile; and Executive Vice President of the Business Bank, Pat Faubion.","A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC's website as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. As we review our first quarter results, we will be referring to the slides which provide additional details on our earnings.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release issued today as well as Slide 2 of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as the filings with the SEC for factors that could cause actual results to differ. Also this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures, and in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ralph.","Ralph Babb","Good morning. Before getting into our quarterly results, I'd like to directly address the recent discussions of our fundamental performance.","I've talked to many of our shareholders over the past several months and have listened closely their feedback and suggestions. I want to make sure everyone recognizes that, I, along with the rest of the Comerica board, hear and understand the desire for improved returns. Rest assured, we share the same goals as all of our shareholders for enhancing value.","I know that we must earn our right to remain independent every day, and our management team and board are committed to doing what is in the best interest of our shareholders. We are a business bank at our core, dedicated to providing high quality financial services and building lasting client relationships.","We operate Comerica for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders and all of our actions are directed to maximize value, while not compromising our commitment to our clients, our culture, regulatory standing, responsible underwriting and strong risk management. We have also always been a conservative commercial bank, which results in lower lending yields compared to many industry peers. But our discipline has also meant less loss damage during economic contractions, which was proven through the last cycle.","Also as a business bank our model by its nature is more interest rate sensitive, which clearly has hurt us. Historically, we actively hedged our rate sensitivity, but ceased as rates fell. In hindsight, we left too much yield on the table during a weak recovery with prolonged price competition.","However, our yield gap to peers has been slowly closing, without any shift in our conservative culture and without relying on rising rates. This is in no part small, reflecting our greater emphasis and success in both sector specialization and middle market lending, which comprise over 50% of our portfolio and provide some of the highest returns.","Our growth opportunities align with our commercial bank model, where client relationships are stickier. Our business bank is national class and we are a trusted advisor with long tenured employees who have deep expertise in the businesses they serve. Many of our high caliber clients have banked with us for generations. And beyond serving their business needs, we have integrated our strong retail and wealth management capabilities to further cement these relationships.","We also have a strong treasury management platform with an improved merchant offering and are one of the top commercial card issuers and through the cycle, we posted superior credit metrics. At the same time, as you know, we have been managing for years in an extremely low rate environment along with a slow growing economy, a host of increasing regulatory and technology demands and more recently the energy cycle headwinds.","In light of the mounting challenges we have faced, we took actions to reduce cost, including judiciously renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing real state and rationalizing some operations. In addition, last year, our key senior leaders did not receive the normal merit increase as well as our three-year incentive payment. Our pay-for-performance comp structure reflects our strong alignment with shareholders.","As a result of these efforts, our 2015 expense to earning assets ratio was better than all but one of our peers. However, we along with nearly half of our peers have not achieved double-digit return on equity. As a result, we have been undertaking a more intense review of our expense and revenue base. To help us in these efforts, we have engaged Boston Consulting Group, a globally recognized management consulting firm that is very familiar with the range of challenges the U.S. banking industry is facing.","While this process is in its early days, we fully expect to identify meaningful opportunities to operate more efficiently and lower expenses as well as drive increased revenue even in the current environment. We are taking an expeditious, yet comprehensive and thoughtful approach to executing this type of program with a goal of building a stronger, more competitive and more profitable organization.","Given the breadth of the review, we plan to provide more information around the opportunities identified by the next quarterly earnings call and we intend to deliver to our shareholders as soon as practical, a broad enterprise-wide plan, designed to help reach tangible targets.","We are going to pursue this cost and revenue initiative with the urgency it deserves, and continue to utilize our strengths and competitive position to improve our results. And if other strategic alternatives present themselves that are realistic, achievable and will maximize shareholder value, we will not hesitate to consider them. That said, it's important to realize that when considering any strategic alternative, timing, economic developments and industry condition, like what's occurring in the energy space, must all be taken into account.","Over the last five quarters, we have been impacted by the current oil and gas cycle. We have been appropriately increasing our reserve allocation for energy loans over that time, and we have significantly increased them in the first quarter to nearly 8% of total energy loans. A year ago, our total energy commitments were $6.9 billion. Today, they are $5.6 billion, a decline of $1.3 billion. Outstandings have declined also during that time by $500 million to $3.1 billion.","Overall, our borrowers are aggressively reducing costs, cutting back on capital expenditures and preserving liquidity. In addition, they are paying down bank debt through the sale of assets, which are generally sold at prices significantly higher than reflected in the borrowing base. Utilization has increased slightly to 54%, driven by the decline in total commitments.","While you are all very understandably following reserve-to-loan ratios across multiple energy portfolios in the banking system, it is important to understand the risk differences. Our energy portfolio consist of 70% E&P, 16% midstream and 14% services.","Within E&P, the well or field diversity of our customer base is spread broadly across the major producing basins in the country. We have very little deep water exposure and only two second lien loans totaling $18 million. Typically, we do not make high yield unsecured or second lien loans unless the half of our E&P relationships have high yield debt behind our senior position.","Our risk ratings and current reserve allocation for energy reflects our rigorous review of every relationship. We've been prudently downgrading loans, taking into consideration our customers' expected operating cash flows in continuing depressed price environment and the resulting total leverage. We believe we are being realistic in our assessment of the probability of default, given our expectation that prices may remain lower for longer.","The provision increase in the first quarter reflected the high end of the range in our 2016 guidance for the incremental impact of energy loans adjusted upward for revised regulatory guidance and includes the results of the Shared National Credit exam. However, it is important to note that our fundamental view on the energy sector has not changed significantly.","While the current oil and gas cycle presents a challenge, we believe we are adequately reserved. Keep in mind, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. We also look beyond direct energy risk and we remain comfortable with our Texas commercial real estate exposure.","We have not seen any noteworthy deterioration in our Texas portfolio outside of our energy book. I believe that we have a framework for delivering enhanced shareholder value and are moving with urgency to execute against our strategic priority to drive meaningful improved returns for our shareholders.","Now, I will move on to our first quarter results, turning to Slide 4. Absent the impact of energy, our overall results were solid. In particular, we saw a significant benefit from the December rate increase. Average loans were stable at $48.4 billion, increases in commercial real estate and national dealer services were offset by decreases in general middle market as well as a cyclical decline in energy and seasonality in mortgage banker finance.","Average total deposits decreased $3 billion to $56.7 billion, reflecting our relationship banking strategy as well as purposeful pricing and strategic actions taken in light of the LCR rules. Typical seasonality was also a factor, as deposits declined in January and February, followed by growth in March. The majority of the deposit decline on a period-end basis was relative to an elevated deposit level associated with our government card product at yearend.","Net interest income increased $14 million or 3% quarter-over-quarter. The Fed's December rate hike is expected to add about $90 million for the year, as the bulk of our loan portfolio is floating rate. The benefit of the rate rise in the first quarter was partially offset by lower non-accrual interest, fewer days in the quarter and several other smaller items.","Aside from the provision for energy loans, that I already discussed, overall credit quality continued to be solid. Total net credit related charge-offs were $58 million or 49 basis points of average loans. Excluding energy, net charge-offs for the remainder of the portfolio remained low at $16 million or 15 basis points.","Non-interest income declined $22 million following strong commercial lending fees in the fourth quarter, particularly for syndication fees. Non-interest expenses decreased $24 million or 5%, primarily reflecting a $14 million decrease in salary and benefits as well as decreases in many other categories such as consulting fees, advertising and occupancy expenses.","Our capital position is solid. In light of the earnings impact from the deterioration of the energy book, we remained disciplined and repurchased 1.2 million shares under our equity repurchase program. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way, as we have for many years.","Now, I will turn the call over to Karen, who will go over the quarter in more detail.","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. First quarter average loans were basically stable at $48.4 billion compared to the fourth quarter. We had good loan growth in our commercial real estate business, driven primarily from construction draws on attractive projects with proven developers and continued conservative credit parameters, such as high equity content.","Also, our national dealer business was seasonally higher. This growth was offset by a decline in general middle market, as we remain disciplined in this highly competitive environment as well as seasonal decreases in mortgage banker loans and the continued cyclical decline in energy. Importantly, positive growth trends through February and March resulted in period-end loans $1 billion dollars above the average for the quarter and our stronger pipeline increased further.","Total loan commitments declined, led by energy, resulting in utilization increasing to 51%. Our first quarter loan yield increased 14 basis points, reflecting the increase in short-term interest rates in December, continuing loan price discipline and wider spreads on energy loan, partially offset by lower seasoned margin and a decline in interest collected on non-accrual loans following an extraordinarily high fourth quarter.","Turning to deposits on Slide 6. Our deposit cost remained low and stable at 14 basis points, as we continue to prudently manage pricing. We have not instituted any standard pricing adjustments in response to the December increase in short-term rates. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market, and we believe we are well-positioned with predominantly operational relationship-oriented deposits. Of note, our loan to deposit ratio remained low at 87%.","Turning to Slide 7. As you know, during the fourth quarter, we deployed a portion of our excess reserves into securities, given the likelihood of rate increases occurring in small increments over a longer period of time. As you can see in the diamonds on the slide, our portfolio yield declined modestly, resulting from the mixed impact of adding lower yield in treasury securities along with continued depressed yields on replacement securities.","Going forward, assuming no change in the rate environment, we expect continued minor pressure on the average securities yield, primarily due to reinvestment of prepays at slightly lower rates. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirements plus a buffer.","Turning to Slide 8. The December rise in short-term rates positively impacted us in the quarter. As Ralph mentioned, net interest income grew $14 million or 3% and the net interest margin expanded by 23 basis points. The largest factor was a benefit from higher LIBOR and prime base rate on our loan portfolio, which added $20 million as well as slightly wider loan spreads. This was partially offset by lower interest received on non-accrual loans and lower fees.","Other loan impacts included one fewer day and slightly lower balances. Our larger securities portfolio added $6 million. The higher interest rate earned on Federal Reserve deposits was more than offset by lower balances, resulting in a $2 million negative impact.","Higher interest rates also resulted in a modest increase in our floating rate wholesale funding cost. In total, higher rates contributed about $22 million to the increase in net interest income. As we've indicated, we expect that if deposit rates hold at their current level, the upside from the first rate hike will be about $90 million for the full year over the 2015 level.","Turning to Slide 9. As you can see in the bottom-right table, aside from energy, our overall credit picture remain strong. Criticized loans were $3.9 billion at quarter end with close to half attributed to energy loans. While the level of criticized energy loans continued to increase, as we prudently downgrade, we are not seeing any meaningful negative migration in the remainder of the portfolio, where less than 5% of the loans are considered criticized.","Close to two-thirds of our non-accruals are energy loans and the quarter-over-quarter increase is almost entirely from energy. Net credit related charge-off were 49 basis points or $58 million, also derived mainly from energy. Our other business lines had low charge-offs and strong recoveries.","The $148 million provision for our total portfolio reflected an increase in our energy reserves as a result of the negative migration, along with charge-offs and the preservation of a qualitative reserve. Overall, our allowance for credit losses increased $91 million to total $770 million and our allowance to loan ratio increased to 1.47%.","Slide 10 provides further detail on our energy portfolio, which at quarter end totaled $3.1 billion outstanding equivalent to 6% of our total loans. E&P loans comprise 70% of our energy portfolio and we are 26% through the spring redetermination process. So far borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average as a result of lower energy prices.","We had a handful of customers' drawdown lines, as they prepare to restructure their high yield debt, which resulted in period-end loans remaining relatively stable in the first quarter. However, those balances have come down since quarter end and we expect that trend to continue.","Energy services loans totaled $426 million or 14% of energy loans and less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. These loans have declined 11% over the past quarter. Energy services have been hit the hardest and 65% are rated criticized. However, average balance sheet leverage for the bulk of the portfolio is under 2 to 1, which speaks to the financial wherewithal of these customers.","Although approximately 14% of our energy loans are non-accrual, 89% of these non-accrual loans are fully current on interest payments, including the three loans we have in bankruptcy. The reserve for energy loans is close to 8%, and as Ralph mentioned, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses.","Aside from our energy business line, we identified early in the cycle about 100 customers in other businesses that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to energy or could otherwise be disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged low oil and gas prices. Those loans now total $534 million and have declined 14% since yearend and 28% from a year ago.","Losses this quarter were $3 million and we continue to monitor these loans closely. However, we have not seen significant negative credit migration over the last quarter and balances are declining nicely.","Slide 11 outlines non-interest income, which decreased $22 million. The biggest driver was a $10 million decrease in commercial lending fees following robust fourth quarter activity, particularly in our syndication area, as well as a decline in unutilized fees due to the decrease in line of credit commitment.","In addition, we had several items that are difficult to predict. Specifically, a $7 million decrease in deferred compensation, which is offset in non-interest expense, a $2 million securities loss and a $2 million decline in BOLI income. As you can see in the shaded area, excluding deferred comp, first quarter non-interest income was in line with the same period last year, reflecting seasonally softer fee income.","Turning to Slide 12. Non-interest expenses decreased 5% or $24 million, reflecting our tight ongoing control of expenses. Salaries and benefits expense was $14 million lower due to the $8 million decline in pension expense and $7 million decrease in deferred compensation expense, which is offset in revenue, as I mentioned. Lower technology and regulatory-related staffing as well as one fewer day were offset essentially by annual stock compensation.","Moving to Slide 13 and capital management. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way with the repurchase of 1.2 million shares under the equity repurchase program. While we prudently scale back the dollar amount of our repurchases, we were able to repurchase a similar number of shares to the prior quarters and continued to decrease our total shares outstanding.","We submitted our CCAR plan for the 2016-2017 cycle earlier this month and expect to receive the results in mid-June. As you would expect, we remain focused on returning excess capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","Turning to Slide 14. You heard both Ralph and me mention already that we expect the year-over-year benefit to net interest income from the rate rise that has already occurred to be about $90 million, assuming deposit prices continue to remain stable. The table on this slide give some estimated additional upside to net interest income over the annual period following a rate rise.","For example, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move with that rise at a 25% data, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in annualized net interest income. Of course, our interest rate sensitivities are based on many assumptions, not just deposit pricing assumptions. Our standard modeling and the list of assumptions we use are included in the appendix.","Turning to Slide 15 and our outlook. Excluding the first quarter energy impact to provision, our expectations for the full year have not changed significantly. However, as Ralph mentioned, with the continuation of the low rate environment and slow growing economy, we are embarking on an initiative to reduce expenses and drive revenue. Because it is still early in that process, we are not able to provide better insight into its impact on our 2016 outlook, particularly relating to revenues and expenses.","As far as credit, given the larger provision this quarter, we do want to provide color around our expectations for the rest of the year. At this point, we believe we are adequately reserved. Any movement from here will be driven by developments in the energy sector, which are inherently difficult to predict. We expect continued solid credit quality for the remainder of the portfolio with metrics absent energy to remain better than historical norms.","With the significant reserve build we established in the first quarter, if the energy outlook remains stable, we would expect the provision for the rest of the year to reflect net charge-offs between 45 basis points and 55 basis points similar to the last couple of quarters. Additional reserve changes will depend on a variety of factors, the biggest being oil and gas prices, as well as our energy customers ability to cut cost, raise equity, sell assets and reduce debt, among other things.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Ralph.","Ralph Babb","Thank you, Karen. In closing, as I mentioned at the outset of this call, we are initiating an aggressive review of our expense and revenue base, which will take us a long way to our goal of a double-digit return on equity.","Rising rates will provide a significant benefit. We are neither waiting nor relying on that to drive improved returns. Our focus is and has always been on our shareholders and delivering performance to maximize value and meet your expectations.","And now, we would be happy to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Well, regarding the profitability initiative, is everything on the table as a part of that? Could you sell-off one of the regions? Could you exit a key business? What's the band that you're looking at here?","Ralph Babb","The band is very wide. We're going to look at all opportunities, not only for expenses, but also for revenue and what make sense for us longer term in our model.","Steven Alexopoulos","And just on the reserve build this quarter, I was looking, the prior guidance was for $75 million to $125 million reserve build, if oil stayed at $30, it's now at $40 and the reserve build is at or above the upper end of that range. Can you help me reconcile the differences? I would have thought the reserve build would have been a lot less, given where oil actually is today.","Ralph Babb","Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, the OCC came out with guidelines that all of us were looking at, even though we are not a national bank as well as the Shared National Credit exam. And I think the guidance that came out did add to the provision and that was really looked at across the industry. Pete, do you have anything to add to that?","Peter Guilfoile","Yes, I think, given the fact that we have a heavily weighted portfolio toward E&P credits and the guidance was around the E&P portion of energy, combined with the fact that that does drops, the drop in energy prices in the first quarter was pretty severe, and it wasn't just the levels that went to, it was the speed at which prices dropped. I think that caused a little more damage than most people would have thought was going to.","Karen Parkhill","And I think we should reiterate that our fundamental view on the energy sector has not changed significantly.","Steven Alexopoulos","So was that OCC review the reason, criticized jumped as much during the quarter as well?","Ralph Babb","It played a part, but I would say, we continued with our very tenured approach and conservative approach to making sure that we're recognizing all of the issues within the portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey","I just want to be sure I understand the provision guidance from here. I think you all said it would be consistent with 45 basis points to 55 basis points of net charge-offs if energy is stable. So does that mean that you would cover that amount and so your provision would be in the ballpark of $60 million a quarter and then give or take any energy fluctuations?","Ralph Babb","Yes. That's what it would be.","Bob Ramsey","So you basically will maintain the level of energy reserve that you all have built here, and then cover any charge-offs on top of that as we go forward?","Ralph Babb","That's right. And as we've said, we expect to see that portfolio continue to come down.","Bob Ramsey","And then just back to the efficiency review, I was wondering if you could comment on sort of what triggered the review? I mean, I think it's a great path forward, but you all mentioned on the call sort of that you have not achieved double-digit return on tangible equity, but I think that's been the case ever since the crisis. And so why now embark upon this new direction?","Ralph Babb","Well, as we've always talked about, we've been very judicious at looking at expenses. And we think that its time now to take a very broad view and look at everything, again, especially with the use of someone from the outside, so that we make sure that we're not missing things that you get comfortable with, as well as on the revenue side from the same vision. And I think that will be very successful. It's only recently started, but there are certainly things on the table that I think could provide a good end product in expenses.","Bob Ramsey","And I know you will really give all the details next quarter, but is it fair then to think that the end goal of this is to get to a double-digit return on tangible common equity even in the current rate environment?","Ralph Babb","We're going to do everything that we can find to walk down that path and whether we will absolutely get to it or whether it will take a little bit of interest rate as well, it is our strategy to do everything from a revenue and expense standpoint to get as close as possible.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neil and Partners.","Scott Siefers","I don't want to belabor the first quarter provision numbers since you've given pretty good guidance for the rest of the year, but just want to make sure I understand sort of the order of magnitude of what the upward revision based on the revised regulatory guidance and SNC was maybe as a percent of the total provision. Otherwise, I'm just trying to square that original $75 million to $125 million reserve build from a couple months back with what actually took place and just really trying to figure out what the total impact of that upward revised regulatory guidance in the SNC was?","Ralph Babb","Well, if you take the guidance at being at $125 million and then where we went to, the biggest portion of that was, as, Pete, you were saying earlier, relied on the fact that the guidance changed with the report that I was talking about, which is a public report from the OCC, as well as our continued view of where things are with the up-and-down of oil prices that we've seen. And so when you add all that together, that's where we really came to. Pete, do you want to add anything to that?","Peter Guilfoile","Yes, I think one thing to keep in mind, when there's new regulatory guidance that comes out and it impacts your risk ratings, our protocol is we will downgrade credits that we think are no longer in line with that guidance, but we don't upgrade credits that now may be allowed to be upgraded because the guidance is different. That's not our protocol. If we determine that a credit was substandard before that guidance came out, we kept it substandard.","And then the other thing, as I mentioned before, is the fact that when prices came down as fast and as severe as they did, there was a fair amount of migration in the energy services portfolio and you'll see that also reflected in our reserves this quarter.","Ralph Babb","Good news there is the services portfolio is only 14%.","Peter Guilfoile","That's right.","Scott Siefers","And then if I can switch gears and just ask on the profitability program really quickly, and of course, I understand you will give a lot more detail in the 2Q. But at its base, would you intend for Comerica still to be a business bank primarily, one that's still biased toward higher interest rates? In other words, would you anticipate this review just to cause any meaningful underlying change in the business model kind of from a very top level?","Ralph Babb","My perspective at this point is it will strengthen the model, as we move forward, but we're very open to looking at other items that may come up, that might be add-ons or types of business that for whatever reason we don't think needs to be a part longer term, so having said that really everything is on the table to look at to strengthen our model for the future.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James.","Michael Rose","Just a follow-up on the program. Is the goal to be kind of the top decile or top quartile performance? Is that kind of the end goal? I know you're not going to give targets today, but is that kind of the goal you are shooting for?","Ralph Babb","We want to be at the strongest position to focus our business and model for the future, meaning dictating the highest return.","Michael Rose","And then just one quick follow-up. It looks like the share repurchases on a dollar basis are tracking a little bit below kind of the [ph] $3.93, which you are approved for. Would you expect to fully utilize the full amounts that you are approved for?","Ralph Babb","As Karen mentioned, we are looking at the earnings today. And keep in mind that the model that was used at the CCAR process had interest rates going up considerably more than they have. That has not happened. So we could see and probably will see a reduction in the amount that we actually use.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray.","Brett Rabatin","I wanted to, I guess, first just talk about the regulatory environment you had mentioned with the SNC review in the first quarter. Can you guys break out how much of the provision might have been related to the regulatory piece in 1Q from the energy perspective?","Ralph Babb","When I was mentioning the regulatory perspective, it was more the new guidance that had come out by the OCC that I mentioned, which is a public document. It was not focused as much on the Shared National Credit exam. Pete, do you agree with that?","Peter Guilfoile","Yes, I would. We don't comment specifically on results of the SNC exam, but one thing to keep in mind I think is 95% of our portfolio are Shared National Credits and the nature of the Shared National Credit exam in and of itself is fairly conservative, in the fact that, you get the lowest of three ratings; our rating, the agent's rating and the regulators rating. And so given the fact that such a large portion of our portfolio are Shared National Credits that certainly has an impact.","Ralph Babb","It's a conservative approach.","Peter Guilfoile","That's right.","Brett Rabatin","And then the other question around energy, there was a lot of concern during the first quarter about energy companies using lines drawing down and those companies already being in a bad situation, but that doesn't seem to be as big a concern. How do you guys think about that going forward? Is that something you worry about with undrawn lines or how do we think about the remaining exposure you have that hasn't been drawn on?","Ralph Babb","We saw a little bit of that, but not much. And don't expect to see it I think today. Pat, you want to add to that?","Patrick Faubion","Yes. About two months ago, we had a list of credits that we thought we would be concerned about, defensive draws, if you will. And I can tell you that list today is much smaller than it was a month or two ago. First, a lot of those credits, their borrowing bases had been reduced as a result of redeterminations. Others have agreed not to draw, which is a good thing.","And the vast majority of our borrowers are doing the opposite. They're selling assets. They're raising capital to make sure that they are staying within the confines of what they expect the new borrowing base to be. So we're really pleased to see that. And as Ralph mentioned, we really didn't have much in the way of defensive draws this quarter. That's why our loans were flat. They didn't grow. And I can also tell you that they've come down a fair amount since then. We're down about a $125 million this month over the peak of March. So we expect both loans and commitments to continue to decline this quarter.","Ralph Babb","One thing you might mention, Pete, too, is the sales that a lot of our customers are doing of property have been significantly higher than their value that's included in the borrowing base.","Peter Guilfoile","That's right. Since really last summer, our borrowers have sold about $1.7 billion of assets. And actually it goes back a little further than that. But on average the premium has been 93% above what we have those assets valued at in the borrowing base and in 2016 that premium is even higher. It's about a 120%. So not only is there a lot of opportunity for our borrowers to sell assets to raise liquidity, but it's a very accretive process when they're doing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","A couple questions just around the drawdowns. How much in actual drawdowns of unused lines on the energy side did you see this quarter and what is your current reserve for undrawn energy commitments?","Ralph Babb","We didn't see much of a drawdown at all. As a matter of fact our usage is about 54% on those lines. You want to add to that Pete?","Peter Guilfoile","Yes. We really just had a handful. And the loans that resulted from that were not significant at all.","Patrick Faubion","This is Pat. I think we had a total of four and one was over a weekend at quarter-end. The borrower needed to meet a covenant test and informed us that the draw would be made prior to the weekend. The money was repaid on Monday following the weekend. So the drawdowns that we've seen have not been unanticipated and we remain in good touch with our borrowers","Karen Parkhill","You asked about our reserve for unutilized commitments. Our total off balance sheet allowance is slightly under $50 million with the large portion of that allocated to energy.","Ralph Babb","Right.","John Pancari","And then, secondly, regarding the profit initiative. A, I just want to see, if you can give me a little bit of color about how much you believe will come from the expense side of the equation versus the revenue side at all. And then secondly, this is higher level, but, Ralph, as you thought about this and looked at this, did you consider at all, was the larger strategic alternatives ever on the table for you in terms of a sale of the bank given the potential foreign bank interest or was that even a consideration before you got to this decision around the profitability program?","Ralph Babb","Well, as I was talking earlier, we have to earn our right to be independent every day. And looking at our model is one of the most important things and opportunities that I think we had and we were thinking about that and moving forward with that and we don't have a feel at this point how much could be revenue related, as well as how much might be expense related, but I do have a feel that there is substantial opportunity there in moving forward.","And as I mentioned too in our remarks, we look at all of our opportunities that are out there and regularly review that at management and the Board level and review the opportunities, but one of the things you really have to look at is what are the current conditions, things like the energy issues that are in the market as well and the overall environment when you are looking at all opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Eads with UBS.","David Eads","Looking at the expectation for energy-related charge-offs, the first-quarter charge-offs were very heavily weighted toward oilfield services. Is your expectation that the energy charge-offs the rest of the year will also be primarily in oilfield services or would you expect a little bit of a bigger mix between E&P and services?","Ralph Babb","I don't think we would see that bigger change in the mix. Do you, Pete?","Peter Guilfoile","No, I think disproportionately we're going to see more charge-offs in energy services. But energy services are very small portfolio for us, so I can't say that we're going to have the majority of our charge-offs in energy services, but the vast majority of our E&P book are well secured credits. Some of them are having financial difficulty and some of them are going to go through bankruptcy, but we feel that given how well secured so many of them are, we don't expect to take charge-offs on a lot of those credits. The energy services side, as you know, is different. The loss given the default, if you will, is higher. Those assets are less reliable in a liquidation scenario.","David Eads","And then maybe one on NIM. It was a good start to the year. Just curious what outlook we should expect, if we don't see other rate hikes. Should we be expecting a little bit of pressure on NIM each quarter or do you think you guys can keep it flattish for the next few quarters?","Ralph Babb","With growth, as we've talked about a lot, it's a very competitive environment out there. Pricing being one. And we've been very careful to focus on not stretching from that standpoint. And so I think until you see rates actually move up, probably would be more of a flat to looking at pressure. Karen, do you want to add to that?","Karen Parkhill","I would just add that if you're talking about rate NIM, David, that the biggest wildcard on rate NIM is where our deposits and excess liquidity go with the Fed and that is something difficult to predict. That said, you did see a big increase this quarter, and that is from a quarter-over-quarter perspective likely to be the largest impact moving forward. Year-over-year, however, you will continue to see a year-over-year positive impact. We talked about the fact that we expect net interest income to rise $90 million year-over-year just from the rate rise that has already occurred.","David Eads","Maybe on that point, can you talk a little bit about the plans for -- you talked about some strategy to reprice deposits for the LCR and intentionally bring down deposit balances. Should we expect that to continue or is that kind of done or should we be seeing more of that dynamic play out?","Ralph Babb","We are still focused on making sure that we are doing the right things for the institution on the LCR side. And as was mentioned earlier, we are well over the '17 point where we need to be with the cushion as well. But because of the cost that you can have to incur over certain parts of deposits that are included in LCR, we're taking, as we call it, purposeful valuing those deposits and pricing. Karen, anything to add to that?","Karen Parkhill","I would just add that we have strength. We started from a position of strength as it relates to deposit pricing and at the appropriate time we will use that position to maintain balances. But we feel very comfortable with where we are today from a liquidity perspective, a balance sheet perspective. And so we have been maintaining our discipline on holding deposit pricing. As a result, just from that, balances could move down slightly, but if they do that is obviously very purposeful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust.","Jennifer Demba","I was wondering if you could talk about demand trends and asset quality trends within your Technology and Life Sciences book.","Ralph Babb","Overall, we've seen what I would call steady demand and that is looking forward. There's been a lot of discussions about things actually pulling back a little bit. Pat, you want to add to that?","Patrick Faubion","Yes. This has been a very strong growth business for us. Today, we're probably focusing more on credit quality, more on granularity. You can see that our charge-offs declined this quarter in TLS. The key to this business is our long-term team, as well the solid long-term relationships with key venture capital providers. We're in 14 cities. It's a robust business and one that will be very important to us in the years ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","I guess the first question, just in terms of when you think about the reserve balances, specifically for energy, I'm looking at the price of oil during the first quarter. And I know you've referenced or Karen has referenced that the oil price came down sharply in the first half of the quarter, but it also rebounded quite a bit in the second half of the quarter.","So when you think about the reserve that you need or when you think about where your borrowing bases are, what you're going to provision for energy, is it based on the low point, on the average, on the endpoint, because I guess I'm kind of wondering if oil does track down to $30, is suddenly that a much worse scenario for reserving?","Ralph Babb","When we look at our reserves we actually use price decks that are where we think it's going to be on the strip, but also it is stressed as well. And you mentioned the prices that are pretty close to that. Pete, I'll let you expand on that a little bit.","Peter Guilfoile","Yes. I think when we were talking about that sharp decline and how that was kind of different, even though it rebounded, it did impact the credit quality of a number of borrowers and that gets impacted in a number of ways. It gets impacted by their ability to raise capital. It gets impacted perhaps by their outlook, particularly on the energy services side of the equation. And so I think it was just that sharp drop, so it's not just the level, but how quickly prices dropped had a particularly detrimental impact on the energy services segment this quarter.","Ken Zerbe","And does that rebalances the -- so the second half of the quarter rebound play into your provision expense guidance, meaning that your price decks have now reset higher, presumably, plus you would need to reserve less?","Peter Guilfoile","Yes, our price decks are now higher, and so when we're doing redeterminations this spring, the benefit of those increased prices is going to get factored into our risk ratings. But bear in mind that the prices today are still -- oil is down about 25% from our price decks in the fall. Gas might be 30% down. So prices are still lower than they were in the fall.","And then the other thing on the energy services side, I don't think there's going to be a big recovery in energy services until we see our rig count go back up again. And I don't think people are expecting rig counts to go up at these price levels. The good news there again is that our energy services portfolio is small and it's probably about a half or third of it that is performing just fine, even at these low prices. So while we've had certainly some severe migration in the energy services portfolio, and we're going to have some more, we'll have some more charge-offs, I think long-term we don't expect to see the charge-offs there to be excessive. We think they'll be manageable.","Ralph Babb","I think when you look at rig count too, it's down to the lowest level it's ever been in Texas, but also in the country.","Peter Guilfoile","That's right.","Ken Zerbe","And then just one follow-up, on the expense side or the strategic review. When I think of Comerica, I don't think you're terribly inefficient by any means, but what are some of the areas at first blush of where -- what are the most ripe areas, I guess, for potential cost savings?","Ralph Babb","You know what we've done and we've opened it up to everything and we're going item by item and looking at all of our expenses, and that way, we don't miss things and I don't want to over-site any one particular item at this point in time, because I want everything to remain on the table until we move down the road and make our decisions from a strategic standpoint of what will be best for our model going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Karen, I wanted to just ask you about the investment portfolio and one of the points that Ralph had made earlier about just having left a little bit of money having not hedged. It was up on average, but it was flat sequentially. You talked about the rollover of yields. But just to that point exactly, do you anticipate that you will continue to consider pulling forward some of that asset sensitivity, whether it's part of the BCG plan or not, but in terms of just where we stand in the environment, what's your thought process from here when you consider loan growth versus securities growth and how you want the balance sheet to look?","Karen Parkhill","We have obviously been focused on having some upside in this prolonged low rate environment. At the end of December, you will remember that we purchased -- took about $2 billion of our excess reserves at the Fed and purchased Treasury and Ginnie Mae securities, put those out longer term. That added about $6 million this quarter alone from that move. That did take a little bit of asset sensitivity off the table, not a lot.","You will see in our standard model for asset sensitivity in the appendix that in that standard, 100 basis points rise on average in an annual period, its still about $200 million. That is something that we continue to assess all the time. We may end up purchasing more securities over time, but it will clearly be dependent on our balance sheet movement and any opportunities that are out there.","Since December when we purchased additional securities, longer rates have been near their three-year lows, so it's not necessarily an opportune time right now, but we will continue to assess. And as Ralph mentioned, in our history, we have used basic fixed to floating hedges on our portfolio and at some point we'll introduce that again.","Ralph Babb","You might want to comment too, one of the things that we have to do is maintain a high level of liquidity because we have customers that are very high in dollar amount transactions, like our government card program as an example that are in and out during a given period of time.","Karen Parkhill","Yes, so when we think about the liquidity that we will have on balance with the Federal Reserve, we do take into account the fact that we do have large depositors that can move money in and out fairly easily. So we do take that into account.","Ken Usdin","And then just a quick question on loan growth. Michigan down both on the sequential and a year-over-year basis, just wondering any updates in terms of the markets there and what you are seeing as far as just underlying growth opportunities?","Ralph Babb","If you look at Robert Dye's estimates, which is our economist, he is positive about Michigan and California being above the national average, which is about 2%, that he is focused on, on GDP. And Texas, he's got slightly positive about two-tenths of a percent from that standpoint. So we're looking at opportunities there as well as we've seen continual growth and opportunities in California. Would you like to add to that, Curt?","Curtis Farmer","I might just say, in the Michigan market on a positive front for many of our customers on the business bank side, they had experienced some liquidity events in this stronger economy in Michigan. So positively we've captured some of that money in motion as fee income, as we've gained those opportunities in the wealth management space. And so there have been some liquidity events that have affected the portfolio overall.","Ralph Babb","One of the things just to follow-up too on our economist is, he publishes regular looks at the markets we're in that are very simple, one page, if you're interested, they're available on our website.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Just looking for more information on the Boston Consulting Group. How long will their review take? And once they complete the review, what will be the timeframe for Comerica's plan? And also, how many employees from Boston Consulting Group are going to be helping you out?","Ralph Babb","We have a number of people here on the ground and it's a beginning process, and the process will evolve with when we see the opportunities, how we address those opportunities, and who, if we need additional support, we will use going forward. So we're in very beginnings of that. So it's time where I can't answer that question with specificity at this time.","Mike Mayo","I mean, just even order of magnitude, is this three months? Sometimes you have a review taking a year. So is it three months, 12 months, 16 months or?","Ralph Babb","It will start, and as I was mentioning, a lot of things will get done along the way, but other things will take longer. So it could go certainly a year or two of implementation as well, depending on what we get. As we move down the road and as we look at the various things that are opportunities, we will keep everybody up to date with what we're focused on and what we think the results will be as well as the timing with it. We are only in the first couple of weeks at this point.","Mike Mayo","Can you give just any more assurance, though, it looks to a degree a plan to have a plan and you're paying outsiders to have this plan and it kind of gives you another couple years, after what's almost a decade of returns below the cost of capital in every one of those years. So can you understand that shareholders might be losing a little bit of patience and might want to see results sooner maybe something more dramatic. And I know you've got a question earlier, what about selling off a region, for example. What are your thoughts about all that?","Ralph Babb","I think we will look at all the opportunities, as I was talking about, and we are going to do it with the appropriate urgency. We hear everyone, we understand it and we want to do it that way, and it's high priority and it is an exciting priority as well.","Mike Mayo","And then, lastly, I look forward to seeing you at the annual meeting on Tuesday. Will you be webcasting the annual meeting?","Ralph Babb","We don't webcast the annual meeting.","Mike Mayo","All right. Well, if there is any way to change it, because some of your banks in the peer group like Key, SunTrust, Zions, BOK webcast it and Wells Fargo, USB and PNC webcast. So with a week away, if there's any way to do it, that would be great. Look forward to seeing you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Could you discuss what you'd expect to happen to your energy loan commitments over the course of the next year, if oil prices stayed at these levels? I'm just trying to understand what else will help you drive borrowing bases lower besides declining energy prices?","Ralph Babb","I think you'll see the borrowing bases reduce with prices where they are today. As was said earlier, they reduced about 22% so far on the redeterminations now. And I think people, as we were talking about earlier, have pulled back significantly and are not looking at future drilling or expanding. They are being very cautious and very smart about what they're doing.","Curtis Farmer","We haven't seen much in the way of new requests at all recently. I think the market is really trying to absorb where they are in this low-priced environment. There is a lot of private equity on the sidelines waiting to jump in. It's possible that new requests will be funded by private equity more than bank loans in the near future.","Bill Carcache","If I may just follow-up on that. Maybe could you give a little bit more perspective on the basis for your borrower who has received an unfunded commitment and it's been reset at the current prices where they are and it gets -- by the time that the next redetermination period comes along, if prices haven't moved, what would induce them to be willing to have that borrowing base declined assuming that oil prices have not fallen? Aren't they basically giving up optionality, wouldn't they prefer to maintain that borrowing base where it is? Just trying to understand a little bit better what is behind the thought process that those will come down.","Ralph Babb","Pete?","Peter Guilfoile","Well, there's two aspects to this. There's the price and there's the amount of their reserves. So if they are not building reserves and replenishing the reserves that they are pulling out of the ground, then in the fall redetermination, even if prices don't drop, their borrowing bases would need to reduce. And we would expect that's not going to be a problem for most of our borrowers.","Again, most of our borrowers, even at these prices, are generating good strong positive cash flow to pay down their debt. They are just not generating enough cash flow to replenish their reserves. So we would expect that if prices remain where they were and borrowers did not do a lot of drilling and replenish their reserves, their loan balances and commitments would continue to come down.","Patrick Faubion","And the redetermination process is not a surprise to these borrowers. They are looking out six months, eight months, 12 months, way, way out in the future and anticipating liquidity that's necessary to meet borrowing base declines.","Peter Guilfoile","And if I can just add to that, we have about six asset sales that they are teed up to close and these are borrowers that are anticipating lower borrowing bases and so they want to remain within the confines of that lower borrowing base.","Ralph Babb","And that's where we've seen significant sale prices over what we have them in the borrowing base today.","Patrick Faubion","Correct.","Ralph Babb","Which is good from that standpoint and our customers have been very good about, as you said Pat, planning ahead.","Patrick Faubion","Yes.","Bill Carcache","Finally, if I may. Can you discuss whether the purposeful pricing actions that you took on the deposit side resulted in a severing of any relationships? Just curious whether there may be any potential revenue implications.","Ralph Babb","There are always when we are doing purposeful pricing, whether it's a customer -- well, it's always customers from that standpoint and depending on the type of business it is, that it could cause them to move and we have taken that into consideration when we look at the overall effect and the value of the customer because we value customers based on a total relationship.","End of Q&A","Darlene Persons","This is Darlene.

(Operator Instructions).","I will now turn the call over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Persons you may go ahead.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Carmon. Good morning and welcome to Comerica's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Vice Chairman of the Business Bank, Lars Anderson; Vice Chairman of the Retail Bank and Wealth Management, Curt Farmer and Chief Credit Officer, John Killian.","A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC's website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. As we review our first quarter results, we will be referring to the slides which provide additional detail on our earnings.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements and in that regard you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause future results to vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement contained in this release issued today, as well as slide 2 of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our filings with the SEC. Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures and in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within the presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph who will begin on slide 3.","Ralph Babb","Good morning. Today we reported first quarter 2014 net income of $139 million or $0.73 per share, compared to $117 million or $0.62 per share in the fourth quarter and $134 million or $0.70 per share in the first quarter of 2013. Broad based loan growth together with solid credit quality and tight expense controls contributed to the 4% year-over-year increase in net income in the first quarter.","Turning to slide 4 and first quarter highlights. Average total loans increased $458 million compared to a year ago, including a $1 billion total increase in national dealer services, technology and life sciences and general middle market, offset by an $852 million decrease in mortgage banker finance.","Compared to the fourth quarter, average and period-end loans were both up over $1 billion with good loan growth across our footprint, and nearly all of our business lines including increases in general middle market, commercial real-estate, energy, technology, and life sciences and corporate banking.","Seasonal decline in loans we anticipated following the year-end run-up did occur in January; then starting in February, the positive loan growth trend returned. We attribute the quick turnaround to the improving economy and our continued focus on relations.","Average deposits increased $2.1 billion or 4% compared to a year-ago including a $1.7 billion increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. Compared to the fourth quarter, average deposits were stable, while period-end deposits were up $458 million or 1%.","In further comparing our first quarter 2014 results to the fourth quarter of 2013 -- and further comparing our first quarter 2014 results to the fourth quarter of 2013, net interest income decreased $20 million to $410 million, primarily due to a decline in accretion, lower non-accrual interest collected, and two fewer days in the quarter, while the increase in loan balances and decrease in deposit costs offset the continued decline in loan yields.","Credit quality remained strong with the provision for credit losses and net charge offs at low levels consistent with the last few quarters. Non-interest income decreased $11 million to $208 million due to decreases of $6 million in customer-driven fee income, primarily due to lower syndication fees and $5 million in non-customer driven fee income.","Non-interest expenses decreased $67 million, reflecting a $49 million decrease in litigation-related expenses, following an unfavorable jury verdict that impacted the fourth quarter. Also, salaries and benefits expense decreased $11 million, primarily due to reduced pension expenses. In addition, we were able to drive small decreases in a number of other expense categories. ","Our capital position remains a source of strength to support our growth, while continuing to provide us the ability to returning excess capital to shareholders.","We completed the 2013 capital plan in the first quarter with the repurchase of 1.5 million shares under our share repurchase program. Together with dividends, we returned 77% of first quarter 2014 net income to shareholders.","Last month, we announced the results of our company run stress test and that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2014 capital plan. Our capital plan includes up to $236 million in share repurchases for the four-quarter period that ends in the first quarter of 2015. The plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors further contemplates a $0.01 increase in Comerica\u2019s quarterly dividend to $0.20 per common share, a 5% increase over the current dividend rate. The dividend proposal will be considered by our Board at its regularly scheduled meeting next week.","Turning to slide 5 and a look at our primary markets, Dallas Morning News reported last month that Texas leads the nation in job growth, adding more than 322,000 jobs in the 12-month period that ended this past January, according to the U.S. bureau of labor statistics. Also, middle market companies in Texas are growing faster than anywhere else in the country according to the National Center for the middle market, and we are growing right along with the lone star state . In March, we announced that we were adding a new middle market banking team here in North Texas. ","In addition, we are adding other bankers in all of our Texas markets. Texas posted the largest increase in average loans of our three primary markets with average loans up almost $600 million or 6% over the fourth quarter. All business lines posted increases and were led by energy, general middle market, corporate banking, technology and life sciences, and commercial real estate. Also, Texas deposits in the first quarter were up $339 million or 3%. We continue to capitalize on opportunities in California. Similar to Texas, we recently increased staffing in our Northern California middle market banking team to help meet the increasing demand. ","In addition, we have expertise in growing sectors in the state, such as technology and life sciences, National Dealer Services, and entertainment. Average loans in California in the first quarter were up almost $400 million or 3%, with growth in technology and life sciences, commercial real estate, and general middle market. Average deposits in California declined 3%, while period-end deposits grew 5% from the prior quarter. The primary reason for the variability between period-end and average deposits was due to customer balances in U.S. banking as well as the financial services division, which serves title and escrow businesses.","We are a leading bank in Michigan where we have strong relationships with businesses and families, many spanning decades. We strengthened our number two deposit market share in the state based on the most recent FDIC data, and as a result, continue to be well-positioned with great brand recognition. Average loans in Michigan increased $149 million relative to the fourth quarter with growth in National Dealer, general middle market, and private banking. Average deposits also increased with corporate banking being the largest contributor. Our relationship banking strategy is serving us well as we continue to focus on growing the bottom line in this low rate environment. We are allocating resources to our faster growing markets and industries where we have expertise, which should contribute to our long-term growth. ","Recent recognition validates that we are making a positive difference. In February, we received 16 Greenwich Excellence Awards for middle market banking as well as 7 Greenwich awards for small-business banking. Comerica received more awards than any other bank. In addition, we were recently named Best Regional Bank in the Southwest by Global Finance magazine. Details can be found in the earnings deck appendix. ","Our balance sheet continues to be well-positioned when rates begin to rise. In the meantime, we continue to demonstrate that we can carefully manage expenses and maintain strong credit quality and a conservative approach to capital. ","And now I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen Parkhill ","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 6; we saw broad-based loan growth in the first quarter. Total average loans quarter-over-quarter increased $1 billion or 2%, and on a period-end basis, loans also increased $1 billion or 2% to $46.5 billion. We had growth on almost every loan type, as average commercial loans increased $679 million and construction loans increased $175 million. Also, average commercial mortgages increased $56 million, the first increase we have seen since the acquisition of Sterling. As mortgages to developers, post construction increased, and owner occupied real estate, which makes up about 80% of our commercial mortgages declined at a slower pace with normal amortization.","In total, average outstanding increased in nearly every business line led by increases in general middle markets of 283 million, commercial real estate of 246 million, and energy of 230 million; partly offset by $223 million decline in mortgage banker, in line with current trends in the mortgage industry. ","Our average loan growth of 2% outpaced the industry which grew 1%, based on the Fed's H8 data for U.S. large commercial banks from January 1st to April 2. Also our commitments grew 416 million to 53.2 billion driven by increases in commercial real estate, energy, and technology and life sciences. ","Line utilization was 48.3%, up from 47.1% at the end of the fourth quarter. Importantly, our loan pipeline increased with growth in nearly all business lines.","Finally, loan yield shown in the yellow diamonds, increased 19 basis points in the quarter of which 12 basis points can be attributed to the higher accretion and higher interest collected on non-accrual loans in the fourth quarter. Much of the remaining decrease is due to amortization and pay offs of older, higher yielding loans, a mix change in customer usage, credit improvement and a decline in LIBOR. ","Turning to deposits on slide 7. Our total average deposits were stable at 52.8 billion, reflecting a $296 million decline in non-interest bearing deposits while interest bearing deposits increased 297 million. As shown by the yellow diamonds on the slide, deposit pricing declined to 15 basis points due to higher rate CDs maturing and selective deposit rate adjustment. Period-end deposits increased 458 million to 53.8 billion, primarily reflecting an increase of 378 million in interest-bearing deposits.","Slide 8 provides details on our securities portfolio, which primarily consists of mortgage-backed securities. The NBS portfolio averaged $8.9 billion for the quarter. The fair value of this portfolio increased 87 million pretax in the first quarter, resulting in a net unrealized loss position for the portfolio of 10 million. The estimated duration of our portfolio declined slightly to four years at the end of the first quarter. ","Slower prepayment speed including a retrospective adjustment to the premium amortization similar to the third and fourth quarters, added 3 million or 12 basis points to the yield. The expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock, declined slightly to about 4.6 years as a result of the composition of our portfolio. Based on current rate expectation, we believe that the pace of prepays will be about 350 million to 450 million in the second quarter, similar to the first and fourth quarters.","In light of the fact that Fannie and Freddie backed securities are subject to a haircut and a cap under the proposed liquidity coverage ratio, we have continued to reinvest the prepays in Ginnie Mae securities. As far as the liquidity coverage ratio based on our preliminary analysis of the proposed role we expect to meet the proposed pays and threshold for 2015.","Turning to slide 9, which is summarized in the table on the right the moving pieces of our net interest income and net interest margin. The biggest driver to the 20 million decrease in net interest income was a 11 million decline in accretion from an elevated fourth-quarter level of 23 million. This reduced the net interest margin by 8 basis points. Just to note, the remaining accretion on the portfolio is about 28 million and we expect to realize this accretion at a declining pace over the next few years. ","Accordingly, for 2014 we expect to recognize accretion of about 20 million to 30 million, which is slightly higher than the 10 million to 20 million range we provided last quarter, as we continue to have better than anticipated performance on our credit impaired portfolio in the first quarter. ","Two fewer days reduced net interest income by 7 million, and lower interest collected on non-accrual loans had a 2 million or 1 basis point impact. ","The benefit from the $ 1 billion in loan growth contributed 8 million and combined with lower funding cost, which increase net interest income by 1 million, completely offset the impact from lower loan yield. Lower loan yields resulted from a decline in 30-day LIBOR as well as the continued amortization and pay off of higher yielding loans, particularly commercial mortgages, a mix change in customer usage and competitive pressures. On a declining LIBOR, you may recall that approximately 85% of our loans are floating rate, of which 75% are LIBOR -based, predominantly 30-day LIBOR. ","Finally, the decrease in excess liquidity, which resulted from the loan growth had a 4 basis point positive impact on the margin. As you have heard before, we believe we remain well-positioned for a rise in short-term rates. Based on our asset liability model, using a dynamic balance sheet and assumptions based on historical experience, we believe a 200-basis point increase in rate over a one year period, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result in approximately 200 million or a 12% increase in net interest income.","Turning to the credit picture on slide 10. Credit quality continued to be strong in the first quarter. Net charge-offs decreased to 12 million or 10 basis points of average loans and included 18 million in recovery. Our criticized loans declined 121 million and our non-performing loans declined 36 million. With the decline in non-performing loans, allowance coverage of NTOs increased to 1.8 times and coverage of our trailing 12 months net charge-offs reached 10 times. The continued cause of the trends in our credit metrics combined with loan growth resulted in a stable provision for credit losses and a small reserve release.","Slide 11 outlines non-interest income which included a 6 million decrease in customer fees and a 5 million decrease in non-customer related income. The decrease in customer fees was primarily a result of a $7 million decrease in syndication agency which is a component of partial lending fee due to low activity in the first quarter following a robust fourth quarter. We had smaller changes in several categories such as a decrease in customer derivative fee and increases in deposit service charges fiduciary and brokerage. The decrease in non-customer driven income was primarily due to a $4 million decrease in deferred compensation plan asset return, which was completely offset in non-interest expense. I wanted to bring to your attention that we early adopted this quarter an amendment to GAAP related to the accounting for affordable housing projects that qualifies the low income housing tax credit. Amortization of the initial investment cost which was previously recorded as a reduction to non-interest income is now reported in income taxes, all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change.","Turning to slide 12, we continue to drive efficiency with tight expense control. Non-interest expenses decreased 67 million. This included a $49 million decrease in litigation related expenses due to an unfavorable jury verdict in a lender liability case that impacted the fourth quarter and is now under appeal. Salaries and benefits expense decreased 11 million primarily reflecting a $13 million decrease in pension expense as well as lower deferred compensation expense. This was partially offset by annual stock compensation expense, two fewer days in the quarter and higher payroll taxes. Taking into account all of the moving pieces, our first quarter salaries and benefits expense is expected to approximate the run rate for the remainder of the year. We also had small decreases in several other categories reflecting our continued focus on managing expenses.","Moving to slide 13 and shareholder payout, as Ralph mentioned, we completed our 2013 capital plan, which included the repurchase of 6.9 million shares under our share repurchase program. Combined with the 1.5 million shares repurchased in the first quarter with the dividends paid, we returned 77% of first quarter net income to our shareholders. ","Our 2014 capital plan includes share repurchases up to 236 million as well as the authority to fully redeem 150 million subordinated notes at par later this year. These notes have a carrying value of 183 million at quarter end. Due to the lack of certainty about the possible execution and timing of the call, the impact of the call is not reflected in the outlook for 2014. ","The average diluted share count increased in the first quarter mainly due to the impact of a higher share price on our warrants and employee option. Vesting of annual employee stock grants also impacted the share count slightly. Our capital position remained strong with a tangible common equity ratio of 10.2% and an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio of 10.3% at March 31st on a fully facing basis excluding the impact of AOCI.","Finally, turning to slide 14 and our expectations for full year 2014 compared to full year 2013, our outlook for loan growth, net interest income and provision remain unchanged from what we provided at January. We are revising slightly our outlook for non-interest income and taxes. As a reminder, we expect our overall loan growth to continue at a pace similar to 2013. ","Average loans in 2013 were 44.4 billion and grew about 3% over 2012. Keep in mind that we expect mortgage bankers to be significantly lower than its 2013 average. And national dealer and mortgage banker can be variable and typically have seasonality. Also there is stiff competition for loans across all of our businesses and we fully intend to maintain our loan pricing and credit discipline. We expect our net interest income to be modestly lower as a result of lower accretion and continued pressure from the low rate environment. Given that we are in the benign part of credit cycle, we expect the provision to remain stable with last year. ","As far as non-interest income we expect it to be modestly lower with stable customer driven fees and lower non-customer driven income. Lower capital market related fees such as syndication and derivatives are expected to offset growth and fiduciary and card fee. We continue to expect non-customer income to be lower, you may recall in the third quarter last year, we reported unusually high warrant income from the exercise of warrants related to some technology and life sciences relationship. Non-customer driven income is difficult to predict because it includes items like warrant income. ","We expect lower non-interest expenses with lower litigation related expenses and a reduction in pension expense from 86 million to approximately 35 to 40 million. In addition, we expect to continue to offset increases from annual merit and regulatory cost with tight expense control. The outlook for our effective tax rate has been updated to 32% to reflective the change in accounting for projects that qualifies for low income housing tax credits, as I previous mentioned.","Finally, our share account should reflect both the execution of our capital plan, as well as the dilution impact from our warrants and employee auctions previously mentioned. Our rule of thumb is that for every $1 increase in average stock price for the quarter, warrants and auction dilution is about 250,000 shares.","In closing, the year is off to a good start and we are pleased with the loan growth and expense control we had in the first quarter. With a persistent economic and low interest rate headwind, it is imperative that we continue to focus on the things we can control, deepening and expanding customer relationships while carefully managing expenses. We believe our effort can assist us in delivering growth in both, pre-provision net revenue and the bottom line.","Now we would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI","How are you? Could you just spend a minute on slide 26 on the shared national credit growth, it looks like a pretty big pickup first quarter. What drove the pickup there, and could you just give us your philosophy on SNC portfolio there?","Ralph Babb","Okay. Lars?","Lars Anderson","Sure. Hey Keith. First, a couple of points I would like to make. First of all, the underwriting of our share national credit portfolio is consistent with our disciplined credit underwriting and credit standards, relationship pricing standards for the rest of the portfolio. ","Secondly, if you were internally to look at that portfolio, you would find that the profitability and asset quality metrics of the portfolio would be very similar due to our overall portfolio, but as you pointed out on page 26, you can also see that 65% of the SNC portfolio really is in middle market businesses which are typically smaller, what I would say large club syndicated credits, where we have strong relationships with those customers, it\u2019s consistent with our relationship model. ","So of the 693 increase, half of that was energy which frankly those are large syndicated credits as you know and we control our single client exposure certainly leveraging syndicated credit market, and it is a growth business for us. Middle Market business also helped drive that, which we\u2019ve seen commitments continue to rise and we\u2019ve been really focused over the past year. And really, the balance of it would be U.S. banking, which tends to have variability in the usage levels. So, I think that the key take away is that we treat SNCs the same as we do any other relationship in the bank and hold them to the same relationship banking standards and pricing as any other relationship.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay. Thank you. And then just on the loan growth guidance, obviously you had very strong loan growth this quarter, it was pretty broad. When you think about the pipeline at the end of the quarter, could you just give us an update on where that stood and why would you stick with the 3% given the strength in the first quarter? Thanks.","Darlene Persons","Our pipeline grew at the end of the quarter and remains robust. When we think about our loan growth outlook, keep in mind that it is a full-year average to full-year average outlook. And our full year average loans in 2013 were $44.4 billion. We also have mortgage banker finance, which we expect to be down year-over-year on average. The full year '13 average was $1.6 billion, and we\u2019ve said that we expect that to stabilize at the fourth quarter 2013 levels, which is about 1.1 billion. We also have our dealer portfolio that while it has increase slightly in the first quarter, we do expect normal seasonality in that portfolio to impact our full year average. ","And on owner occupied mortgage loans, we do expect those to continue to be impacted by amortization. So beyond those we do expect continued growth in other areas and we also fully expect to maintain our discipline in this competitive environment.","Lars Anderson","I may just tag on and maybe do a part of your question, and that is kind of the nature of that pipeline growth. It continues to be very broad, it's across all of our businesses, and frankly if you look at the individual components they would be very complementary of really what our focus is as a company, the lines of business that we want to grow, the ones that have the highest returns and fit with our relationship banking strategy.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Lars, I wanted to follow up on your response of the question on the SNCs; so if you look at the 700 million increase, how much of that was for participations and credits where you guys were not the lead bank?","Lars Anderson","I can\u2019t give you an exact number for the quarter at this point. We don\u2019t have that, but if you are go ahead and look at that chart on, again page 26, you'd see that 15% are agented by Comerica today. But again, if you look at that 65% of the overall SNC portfolio, you know those really are typically smaller syndicated credits where we have deep relationships with the management teams. We are not just in there providing credit solutions, it\u2019s really about my trusted advisor kind of approach to the customers, it\u2019s the relationship banking model and it\u2019s not just about the credit. It\u2019s about really bringing to them all of Comerica and all of our financial solutions. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more kind of look at it, but I can\u2019t specifically give you the number for that quarter.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","So, Lars, should we think about that big jump this quarter as being a function of just increased demand from larger borrowers or do you guys just have more of an appetite for those types of credits here?","Lars Anderson","Well, just keep in mind that half of that number was energy, and energy by definition almost is a syndicated credit market. These are very large credit facilities where we want to make sure that we\u2019re controlling from a conservative credit perspective . You know our exposures to single customers, but I'd also just reinforce that these are customers that are in footprint. These are customers that, you know we\u2019re the largest commercial bank headquartered in the State of Texas, we\u2019ve got a leverage position here, I think in Texas to be a leader in this industry, and it\u2019s really of footprint strategy.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Maybe just one for Karen, how many employees do you have in the BSA\/AML compliance group and how much is that have roughly cost to you now, per year?","Karen Parkhill","Steve; happy to follow up on that, I don\u2019t have an exact breakdown of the number of employees in dollar cost, but we have maintained a very robust department in that area for a very long time.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Scinicariello with UBS.","","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Just a couple of quick ones. First, I am just kind of curious Lars, maybe where you see kind of the most attractive risk reward across the loan portfolio, you know, as we sit here today?","Lars Anderson","Yes, we\u2019re very fortunate. First of all, you know we've got great growth markets that complement the businesses that we're in, and that\u2019s I think one of the strengths of our franchises that we do have diversity of businesses. If you look at the state of California, and you look at the diversity of the businesses there that we can grow versus Texas. For example, we\u2019re in a very attractive position. But you know, I mean, we are a middle market bank and while we do have some specialty areas, technology and life sciences, energy, commercial real estate, entertainment, you know, mortgage banking finances, these are all businesses they have typically a very attractive returns for us. But it\u2019s not just about the credit. It\u2019s really about the whole relationship. And as we look at each customer, we're using a very disciplined relationship pricing approach that really encapsulates all of the financial solutions that we bring to our customers. ","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","It makes sense, and then, just specifically on commercial real estate, looks like that seems to be hitting an inflection point here as -- do you think that\u2019s the case and is there an opportunity to maybe helping hands the book going forward in terms of yield and if that continues to grow?","Lars Anderson","Well, I think I heard you mention the term yield, is that correct?","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","Sure.","","Lars Anderson","Yes, in your question. So I would be, honestly here that we are getting pressure in the commercial real estate portfolio, there is no question about it. You have got a lot more banks out there chasing opportunities but we are not giving in terms of our commitment to ensuring that we get the right kinds of returns from these long-term developers that we work with for a long period of time. But I would tell you this, we have been sharing with you over the last few years that we have had a lot of construction lending volume, closures, commitments and a lot of equity that has gone in first and we have expected that at some point we begin to see draws on those and a number of those move over to mini firms. And frankly that\u2019s the key driver that we're seeing today in our portfolio. We did see relatively less activity of our larger developers going to the permanent market which also I think benefited us in the first quarter. ","Whether or not it\u2019s a permanent turn I really can\u2019t tell you but we are really pleased to see with these long-term customers, their continued strength, success and we're proud to work with them as I think the real estate market continues to strengthen.","Steve Scinicariello - UBS","","Sounds good, sounds good. And then just one quick one for Karen just on the expense side, obviously great performance this quarter, just kind of curious maybe some future opportunities whether it\u2019s regulatory cost or more vendor consolidation types opportunities maybe going forward on the expense side?","Karen Parkhill","","We are always looking for continued efficiency on our whole equation particularly on the expense side. And as we look for that continued efficiency, some of the things that we have been doing are things that we will continue to do, things like consolidating our vendors and renegotiating contracts with our vendors everywhere that we can to get better performance and better terms. And so, we will continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Good morning. I wanted to ask the loan growth question a little bit different way, I know you said the 3% growth is off your base of about 44-4 last year and it looks to me as if the end of period balances this quarter are already 4.5% above that. So, does that imply that through the course of the year you actually see a little bit of contraction from where we stand today?","Karen Parkhill","","Bob I mentioned that we do see contraction in certain portfolios like mortgage banker finance where the average of the full year last year was 1.6 and we do expect that to be down to about the stable level that we had in the fourth quarter which was about 1.1. So, we expect full year average contraction there and on our dealer portfolio we do typically see seasonality a little bit in the second quarter, a little bit more in the third quarter. And we expect to see that seasonality where inventory supply on lots comes down and therefore our outstanding floor plan financings come down. And then we do expect some continued contraction on our occupied real estate mortgages as amortization from our existing portfolio continues.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. And I know in your introductory comments you all said January started a little slow and then built but I am not sure I got the full commentary. Could you just give a little bit of color on sort of how through the course of the first quarter you also saw loan demand progress?","Karen Parkhill","","Sure we typically see year-end balance as period end balances at year-end run up for us and then we typically see contraction just following the year-end and that\u2019s exactly what we saw in January. So, we saw loan growth pick up starting in February post the contraction in January that we deem typical.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","And so is it just typical seasonality though, nothing more or less this quarter?","Karen Parkhill","","Yes, we view it as typical.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","","First, just a start on the C&I portfolio, just watching the yield come down here. Can you provide a little perspective on how pricing structure in terms today compare to 2007 year key markets?","Lars Anderson","Sure, Craig, when compared to 2007 in our markets, I just want to make sure that I got the right timeframe. ","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Okay.","Lars Anderson","Okay, Craig I am taking that as a yes. Okay, yes so, if you go back to the pre-crisis period I think you would see actually spreads a little bit thinner at that point. We are in a better position than we were there, however over I would say the past year or so, we continue to see really tightening of spreads and yields as more competitors have gotten active in the marketplace. And we're obviously staying very focused on our disciplined relationship pricing model and I think that that\u2019s going to serve us well.","Karen Parkhill","","Craig, I would also mention that our C&I yield did decline nine basis points in the quarter but half of that was related to a greater interest on non-accrual loans in the fourth quarter.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Thanks Karen. In one point there, what was the average C&I yields in the new business generated in the first quarter and also the average spread there too.","Karen Parkhill","Very difficult to give you averages for our whole portfolio because it is so very diverse and so very credit dependent and so very difficult to give averages.","Lars Anderson","Yes what I would tell you is that largely our loan spreads have been holding. I mean we have been very disciplined, it\u2019s not easy, I mean we\u2019re having to know have our bankers out in the marketplace more than ever making more calls, really focused on our relationship banking strategy and bringing a different value proposition to our customers.","Ralph Babb"," ","And credit is moving out as well.","Lars Anderson"," ","Yeah absolutely. ","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Can we assume it\u2019s close to the tier group average in the low 2s and if yes, should we expect significant more down side in the C&I portfolio yield over the next couple of years?","Karen Parkhill","","We do expect that our loan yields going forward will be impacted by the things that we've been impacted already and that would be a decline in higher yield and fixed rate loans particularly mortgages as well as a continued mix shift that can impact the portfolio of mix shift in utilization, a decline in LIBOR, LIBOR declined this past quarter in the first quarter, but yet it\u2019s lower today than where it ended in the quarter. So there are lots of things that we expect to continue to impact our loan yields.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","","I guess first question just about the LCR I think Karen mentioned if I heard right that you would be complying with LCR, what you think are the guidelines by 2015. But could you just be a little clear on that in terms of when do you expect to be as fully complying as you need to be and what is the impact that that could have on margin from here?","Karen Parkhill","So on the LCR as you know the rules are proposed right now and not yet final. And we obviously expect to be fully compliant with all of the phase-in requirements and the fully phased in requirement in 2017. As loans increase and the interest rate environment continues to improve, we do expect to see deposit decline and both on the loan and the deposit side of the equation can have an impact on our excess liquidity. Our excess liquidity right now does count as high quality liquid assets. So in that improving environment, we will need to be adding high quality liquid assets to meet the proposed LCR requirement.","The impact that that can have on -- that can have an impact on the net interest rate margin but we believe that it is relatively neutral to net interest income and that is the key income statement line on that we focus on much more than the net interest margin.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","No, of course, I just wasn\u2019t sure if there was going to be any meaningful changes, but it sounds like you\u2019re just letting sort of the portfolio take its natural course and you'll end up with a better coverage ratio rather than taking any specific more immediate actions. Is that fair?","Karen Parkhill","That is fair. We remain ever mindful of the fact that our securities portfolio and a rising rate environment will be mark to market and that mark to market impact is the numerator in the LCR equation. And so we keep that in mind as we think about ensuring compliance.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Okay, then really quick question on the purchase accounting adjustments for the accretion. I think you said you had 28 now, you expect 28 to 30 this year so presumably that implies better credit or some restatement or some additions to the accretion. When you think about next year in 2015 is this for the most part largely gone or what kind of I guess amounts would you envision in 2015 for the accretion?","Karen Parkhill","Year-over-year we expect a decline in accretion, last year we had 46 million in accretion and this year we expect 20 million to 30 million, we had 12 million of that in the first quarter. The remainder accretion that we have available we did say is 28 million and we do expect that to continue to decline each quarter. It may linger in small amounts into 2015 but we expect a continued decline and ultimately to be end material.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James","Hey just wanted to ask about the complexion of CDs in the balance sheet. Have you guys thought about with rates being as low as they are and potentially higher rates on the horizon beginning to lock in some CDs and where would you expect that portfolio to normalize out as a percentage of the total mix?","Karen Parkhill","So currently our MMDAs and DDAs are more than 80% of our total deposit balances, our savings as DDs are then less than 20%. On the CDs in particular we recognize that we have an ability to increase deposits when needed with our client base through things like CD and pricings. It is not something that we deem we need now particularly when you look at our balance sheet and the excess liquidity that we have.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. ","Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill","Good morning guys. I think most of my questions have been answered at this point but Karen may be just a quick one from you on the fee guidance. You gave a lot of good color on what would cause the year-over-year change i.e. warrants that were elevated last year. But was there anything specific that had changed from the outlook that you provided with the fourth quarter that cause it to be lower versus stable previous -- lower versus stable previously?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, I would say that the key change in the outlook again is on our customer driven side and we saw softness this quarter in our capital markets related fees particularly syndicated loan credits and customer derivative. And it is that softness that caused us to slightly change our outlook.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Research","Good morning guys. On your comment on comp expense this quarter being a descent run rate going forward, I was just wondering if that could also possibly apply to total expense levels as well versus that 1Q level just given the consolidation of vendors and other steps you\u2019ve been talking about or should we expect to see that line grow this year?","Karen Parkhill","So in total expense there are expenses that can be variable in the back half of the year, things like occupancy expenses, things like consulting type expenses. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily completely approximate a run rate but recognize that we are very focused on tight expense control and do intend to work very hard to maintain our expenses at a descent level.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Research","And just on that comp line itself I know you\u2019ve got some seasonal expenses in there and you\u2019re talking about that being a descent run rate but you\u2019ve also talked about hiring. And so I was just wondering if there are any other areas where you could trim up to sort of offset that hiring this year?","Karen Parkhill","We are very focused as we talked about before on every place where we do have expense increases or headcount increases and trying to figure out ways to self-fund the dollar amount of that increase. And that is a discipline that we maintain continually. And so we have had to add headcount in certain areas like compliance and regulatory. We also have added headcount on our front line to make sure that we were meeting increasing customer needs and demands but we are very focused on trying to offset that with other expense control.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning. Just a question back on the syndicated credits, obviously people are getting a little bit more concerned about that and you had a few questions early in the call, but maybe not necessarily what you\u2019re putting on your books, Lars or Ralph, are you seeing anything in that market that makes you a bit more nervous or any trends that are worth watching on the negative side?","Lars Anderson","No, really don\u2019t. In fact as I mentioned before Jon as we study that portfolio the asset quality the returns of that portfolio really are very similar to the overall company\u2019s loan portfolio. We\u2019re obviously going to watch the level as we do with our concentrations across any lines of business, anything we do but no we\u2019re very comfortable, it\u2019s relationship based and is very consistent with our strategy.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","How about anything in the\u2026","Ralph Babb","Why don't you comment on credits?","","Lars Anderson","Sure. I\u2019d be glad to. In the SNC portfolio we see it over the long term mirror our overall credit results but in the short term it\u2019s actually performing much better than our basic credit metrics. There are things that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace that do kind of make your hair stand up from time to time, we don\u2019t get into those kinds of credits and we\u2019re going to maintain that kind of discipline.","Ralph Babb ","Yes, if I could just clarify one thing that we do not have a syndicated credit trading desk, we\u2019re not out there buying and selling syndicated credits. These are all relationship based.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that helps. Because obviously everybody has a concern when they see that kind of growth, and I think we understand your approach to it as well but we hear the anecdotal stories about the industry and some of the broader things that are happening, so that helps.","Ralph Babb ","Yes, we remain very focused on building relationships with those credits.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great. Any theme in the construction growth you guys have had quite a few quarters in a row of descent growth. Is there any theme there that\u2019s new or different?","Ralph Babb","No, there really isn't. It\u2019s -- we\u2019re executing our same strategy, we haven\u2019t changed. Its urban market, it's in footprint oriented, its in-fill, closed in suburban, the majority of its multi-family and frankly we're just beginning to see I think some of the benefits of a number of the projects that we finance with some of our very long-term, well hailed developers. So we are hopeful that will continue to run. ","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Just here a couple more things. Do you know off-hand what\u2019s left in the non-accretable balance on sterling?","Karen Parkhill ","Non-accretable loan balance?","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Yes. Credit impaired.","Karen Parkhill ","Yes. It\u2019s not much, I don\u2019t have it off top of my head, happy to follow-up but it\u2019s not much.","Jon Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then just to be clear on the tax change, I think it\u2019s obvious, but same bottom line impact, it\u2019s just geography on the P&L, is that correct?","Karen Parkhill ","Yes. That\u2019s correct. The accounting change that we adopted is bottom line neutral.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Thanks. Good morning. First, I wanted to just ask you about, this year on the CCAR, you got a nice approval but the total amount of the buyback was a little lower year-over-year. And I think, a little lower than the market might have anticipated. I just wanted to ask you about just any thoughts in retrospect about this, your CCAR process and generally speaking, how you feel about what you put in for and how you are thinking about the eventual -- the future CCAR now that you have been through the first one?","Karen Parkhill ","Thanks for the question, Ken. We are very pleased with the outcome of our CCAR plan process. As you know that with our first year as CCAR bank and also the first year that the feds ran its own model on us and so we likely approach most things, approached it from a position of conservatism. When we think about our total payout to shareholders, we like the fact that we are able to pay to shareholders meaningfully and we think that as a result of our very strong capital position and the fact that we have had good continued credit performance through the cycle.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. And the second question just bringing all those commentary and questions about balance sheet mix, this quarter the average earning asset number was flat and you talked in your remarks about remixing some of those cash balances, you\u2019re moving things for LCR compliance, you still have a low loan to deposit ratio and loans are starting to at least this quarter outgrow deposits. So I am just wondering, are we at the point where we should be looking for more earning assets stability from here and if I'm incorrect in saying that how do you think about just the overall progress of earning assets, vis-\u00e0-vis loan growth as you look ahead?","Karen Parkhill ","When we think about earning asset, we do recognize under the new LCR requirement, again in a better economy rising rate environment where we do expect continued loan growth and deposits to decline that we will need to be adding high quality liquid assets. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that it is stable at this stage.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","And I guess then Karen, how would you think through or help us think through what that mean that you\u2019ll think about starting to go for little bit more wholesale whether it's FHLB\u2019s or issuing sub debt or rationalizing the capital structure, just how should we think about that as deposits come off, have kind of filling in from that or do you just continue to depend on more of a remixing?","Karen Parkhill ","It is likely that we will fund our high quality liquid asset with wholesale funding.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. Which you really haven\u2019t done so far, because the securities book really hasn\u2019t grown to date, right?","Karen Parkhill ","That\u2019s correct. And we are\u2026","Ralph Babb","Plus with the excess funding.","Karen Parkhill ","Correct.","Ralph Babb","Position.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Well, also what I am trying to get at, you still have the excess funding but then there\u2019s the need to add, so that would say to me more remixing, but I just want to understand the different between remixing which keeps earning assets flat versus adding wholesale borrowings which would allowed it to grow.","Karen Parkhill ","Okay. So I think it depends on the timeframe that we\u2019re talking about here. And in a short term environment where we have a lot of excess liquidity, we would think much more about remixing, in a long term environment as I talked about with the economy and interest rate environment changing and we would think more about wholesale funding obviously.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Hey good morning. Good morning guys, just one big picture question, you talked about a nice uptick in utilization this quarter, growth was pretty broad based there, there was an article in the paper this morning about expanding CapEx. Are you actually starting to see signs of that and if so are we finally starting to see a shift towards expansionary CapEx from borrowers or is it still efficiency driven?","Ralph Babb","Lars, you want to take a shot at that?","Lars Anderson","Yes, absolutely right. Let me just make a comment about the kind of sense we\u2019re getting from our customers and that is they are mildly or modestly more optimistic, but they are still cautious, so I would say it\u2019s too early really to call in terms of every turn of the corner in CapEx, and the beginning of expansion there, we clearly saw it, we saw it in our general middle market, an increase in utilization rates as well as and energy which was up in utilization technology and life sciences, environmental services, so we did see a pretty broad increase in utilization rates. So again a little early to call whether or not we\u2019ve turned the corner on CapEx but we\u2019re very hopeful that would be very good for Comerica given where middle market kind of centered bank and you\u2019ve seen commitments grow over a long period of time here at Comerica. ","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","","And just as one quick follow-up given the amount of commitment growth you\u2019ve seen, you\u2019ve been able to grow line utilization. If we were to see a big pickup in CapEx, how high do you think utilization rates could go?","Lars Anderson"," ","Well if you look back historically we run around the element 50% rate over a long period of time, we\u2019ve seen variations but we\u2019ve also seen from quarter to quarter, I mean you could see a 200 basis point change, but keep in mind that when we look at utilization rates that that\u2019s a period in time that is not the average for the quarter.","Karen Parkhill"," ","We are right now at our historical average per utilization and we\u2019ve reached as high as 53% in the height of the downturn but right now we\u2019re at our historical average.","Ralph Babb"," ","I think one of the things you\u2019re seeing too is people are keeping more liquidity and more potential with their lines as well than you had in the past. ","Lars Anderson"," ","And I think that that Ralph your point, that\u2019s one of the reasons that we haven\u2019t seen a draw down in liquidity that you typically would see is that a number of our customers are being more cautious protecting the liquidity positions.","","Ralph Babb"," ","And the result of that is you\u2019ll see higher commitment levels and lower usage levels in total and I think that\u2019s a trend.","","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari - Evercore","","Just to beat the loan growth dead horse a little bit here, excluding the mortgage warehouse and national dealer service seasonality that you mentioned Karen, anything about the end of period link quarter loan growths that would not be sustainable or in terms of those balances where they stand as of the end of March. Anything about that that would not be sustainable, thanks.","Karen Parkhill","","I mentioned that on period end we typically do see a run up at the year end and we did see a run down in January and we typically will not as high do see a little bit of run up at the end of each quarter, so that is why we focus on average balances instead of period end balances. ","","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay and that typical run up, which type of portfolios would that be in?","","Karen Parkhill","","It\u2019s honestly across most of our portfolios.","Lars Anderson"," ","Often time you see, what I would maybe define a little bit as window dressing as some customers really want to build cash on their balance sheet for the end of the quarter and that gets paid back and those would be middle market, US banking and such.","","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay all right and then separately the -- I believe you indicated Karen that you don\u2019t have all the detail around new loan production yields but you happen to have any of that granularity for the SNIC portfolio what the average yield is on that portfolio and then more specifically what the average yield is what you put on the quarter.","","Karen Parkhill","","I don\u2019t have the average yield of the SNIC portfolio, in terms of the average yield of what we put on in the quarter we do know that our decline in loan yield was mainly due to the things that I talked about. The fact that we did have fixed rate loan run-offs, the fact that we did have credit improvement, the fact that we did have a mix change in the utilization of our customer usage and so our new loans coming on board is not necessarily causing the deterioration in our loan yields. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful.","","John Pancari - Evercore","Yes that is, and then lastly just sorry if I missed it in your commentary but the decline in the commercial lending fees on a linked quarter basis, if you can just give us the detail on that.","","Karen Parkhill ","","Yes, that was -- we saw a decline of 8 million in commercial lending this linked quarter, 7 million of that was a decline in syndicated loans activity and that was because we have very robust syndication activity in the fourth quarter.","Lars Anderson"," ","And that\u2019s not unusual, in fact if you go back to the first quarter of 2013 you\u2019d see a similar type change from the fourth to the first, as the activity levels that we did see in the syndicated fee income, agency fee income that we did get in the fourth quarter of course we benefited from those balances in the first quarter of this year.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we do have a question from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Speaking of dead horses, could you just remind us what your charge-off experience was in your SNIC portfolio in each of the last two credit cycles versus the rest of your commercial book?","John Killian","Erika, over the long-term, the SNIC portfolio performs at the same level as the portfolio overall. I don\u2019t have off the top of my head those numbers through the last two cycles. But I can tell you that, over the last five quarters our charge-off levels in the SNIC portfolio have been nominal.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Great, and just one last question, Karen, you mentioned that if rates went a few hundred basis points you would see a 12% increase in NII and that sensitivity is on the dynamic balance sheet. Could you just tell us what your deposit volume and rate assumptions are in that exercise, and maybe where you think your loan to deposit ratio would trend in that scenario?","","Karen Parkhill","Sure. As we talked about in the past, that scenario is dependent on the assumptions that we put in. And in those assumptions we do expect loans to decline, we do expect deposits to -- that we do expect loans to increase, I\u2019m sorry, we do expect deposits to decline. We do expect a continued mix shift out of interest-bearing and out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. We have run sensitivity analysis on that scenario. And that sensitivity analysis that we have done in the past and shared with you in the past is things like what if deposits declined more? What if loans grow faster? What if rates move up higher? And even with those sensitivity analysis, that points to the fact that we are still very well positioned for rising rate environment. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful. And on the deposit decline in particular, we do have deposit declines, and one of our sensitivity analysis did show more deposit declines that we shared last spring with you.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Okay, and given the liquidity that you mentioned that\u2019s embedded within your customer base, is it possible that during this rate cycle we should be -- you know, you surprised at the upside or downside in terms of deposit volume behavior relative to what Comerica has experienced in the past? Or is it just we are not going to be able to tell at this point?","Karen Parkhill","We are in a very anomalous environment right now. And we recognize that history may not be the best barometer going forward, particularly from this environment. So that is why we look at the sensitivity analysis that we do look at.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Parnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Parnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning everybody, just a quick question again on the commitments. I guess in the bigger picture. I would like to get a sense of how you all think about the pricing for your commitments perhaps going forward now that you are in the same bucket as the CCAR banks. And I guess I\u2019m just curious, given some of the capital issues or capital buffers that they have to deal with some of those banks have said that commitment pricing could go up. Is that an advantage for you, particularly when you are focusing on middle market borrowers or has competition basically eroded that advantage?","","Lars Anderson","Yes, I mean, we -- frankly first of all we have a really a disciplined process where we review every line of business, every quarter or every product line on a regular basis, given the changing regulatory environment. And we're making the appropriate adjustments to ensure that we get the right kinds of returns out of each one of our lines of business on an overall basis. So are we reacting? Absolutely. Are we seeing the overall market react at this point? Not really. But we are going to do the right things. We are going to make the right adjustments to make sure that we get the right kinds of returns for our shareholders, given the Basel III environment.","Matt Parnell - Wells Fargo Securities","And then just a quick one for Karen. Karen, I saw that risk weighted assets were up about 2% quarter-over-quarter. Was the driven largely by commitment growth or where there something else driving that?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, that was driven by our loan growth and our commitment growth.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford & Bernstein.","Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein & Company","Just following up on the deposits in a higher rate environment, in that 12% figure, one of the things that I look at your deposit base versus other banks, one thing that jumps out is the large percentage of deposits that are in accounts greater than $250,000, significantly higher than a lot of other banks who profess to be a lot less asset sensitive than your disclosures imply. Just could you talk a bit about specifically those large deposit accounts and how you expect those to trade when rates rise and Karen, I think it would be great if you would update those sensitivities sometime soon and I appreciate it was a year ago and I think we are all looking for a bit more on the rate sensitivity.","Karen Parkhill","","Okay, happy to do that Kevin. And on your question on the greater than 250,000 in deposit, keep in mind that because we are mostly a commercial bank, we do have large commercial deposits from some of our customers, but as we focus on the full relationship with those customers, much of those deposits are operating account deposits which are tied to the other services that we provide those customers. So, they tend to be very sticky and tend to be stable.","Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein & Company","","Okay. So, if we -- I know again it\u2019s 10 years ago the last time short rates started to rise, but if we look at the period during when short rates were rising, your funding cost moved up significantly more quickly than your asset yields and I recognize there are, there is a higher percentage of loans that are floating now and other factors but is that the main driver of why you think things will be different this time?","Karen Parkhill","","Hard for me to speak as much about history but I would say going forward we do recognize that we do have a pricing ability on our deposits as needed to make sure that we maintain those deposits and maintain our loan to deposit ratio within more of a self-funding guideline that we got currently.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Brett Rabatin with Sterne Agee.","Brett Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach","","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow-up a little more on the sensitivity modeling and just go back to loan spreads and just want to make sure I understood what the analysis or what the assumption was if rates go up, what happens to loan spreads and how you think about LIBOR versus your loan portfolio yield?","Karen Parkhill","","So, as rates rise, we are very hopeful that short term 30 day LIBOR rises with it. As you know we are most exposed to that metric and that should help us significantly. In terms of loan spreads, difficult to predict because that is dependent on many factors, the credit environment, the competitive environment et cetera. But we have in the past and intend to maintain our discipline around pricing credit very appropriately.","Brett Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach","But specifically what\u2019s the assumption in terms of loan spreads as rates move higher?","Karen Parkhill","","Now that\u2019s something that we'll have to follow up on, I don\u2019t have that on the top of my head.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. ","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","","Sounded like the sesame straight pronunciation of our firm, I have young kids, so. I know there has been a lot of questions on the Shared National Credit portfolio. I was just looking at one of the things we had tracked was in the supplement you give the percent where your agent as well as the balances and it looked like, if I have got the history right, you went from 18% agent in 3Q to 16% agent in 4Q to 15% in 1Q. And then if I multiply that through by the balances, it looks like over the past six months the agent led balances actually came down a little bit and then the non-agent implied balances would have gone up about a 1 billion, is that a fair way to think about it or is there anything that\u2019s changed in the definition and just kind of any thoughts on why the agent would be going down but the non-agent going up?","Lars Anderson"," ","I would say the largest driver there would be the energy portfolio, I mean we don\u2019t typically agent the E&P portfolio. Those are very large credit facilities. These energy companies have very large CapEx needs and so as you see that portfolio continue to grow that would certainly have some dilution on it, but we haven\u2019t changed our strategy around relationships. And each one of these again, if you look at page 26 whether it\u2019s entertainment or energy or technology and life sciences, general middle market, this is all about relationships. So, no change in strategy, but I would say energy would be the biggest kind of diluter of that lead percentage.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research","","Got it. And then just on preferreds, I mean you are in a good position of having a ton of capital, it seems like there is maybe mix messages on, everyone just need preferreds to be a 0.5 of their RWAs regardless of common equity or to the excess common equity, does that kind of count against the preferred bucket or the tier 1 bucket which I really want to think about it. I mean have you gotten feedback or do you think eventually you will need preferreds as part of the capital structure or do you think as long as you\u2019re up here with these kind of monster common equity ratios preferreds just for in a separate world and don\u2019t matter?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, the stress test that we\u2019ve just gone through, we\u2019ve shown that we do have adequate levels of capital to withstand various severe stress scenarios. That said, the Basel III capital rule do fairly well dedicate the types of capital that are included in each of the different metrics and stacks. So at some point it could make sense for us to have preferred in our capital structure. But clearly we believe we need a good use of proceeds to be able to introduce it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Good morning, with CLSA. Just a follow up deposits in the higher rate environment seems no question that you had benefit from higher interest rates and I\u2019m just curious that 200 basis point higher interest rates that improves and 200 million if I heard that correctly. What change do you expect in CDs to go from what percentage today to what percentage in the future under that scenario?","Karen Parkhill","That again is something that we can follow up on with detail like that and some of the other questions that we\u2019ve had Mike. I would say in general we do expect deposits to decline in that scenario and most of that decline we would expect to be in non-interest bearing and so that we do expect interest bearing to increase. As far as the amount of CDs increase a little bit but not significantly.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Because the CDs are so far below the historical for you guys in the industry that you just think behavior has changed or rates going up 200 basis points won\u2019t be the trigger for a whole lot more CDs?","Karen Parkhill","Well, we do recognize that we have the ability with our existing customer base to be garnering in a rising rate environment, more savings deposits from them and we will be doing that as we need to.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And another follow up on the SNICs, if I\u2019m calculating this correctly they look to be at 22% of loans which I have to imagine is one of the highest levels for Comerica and if you go back in time in the 80s, Comerica pull back and your 90s and then especially after the Enron [indiscernible] the early part of last decade, you guys lowered your SNICs from then it was 20% down to 15% and today I think it\u2019s 22%. So is there any constraint for SNICs as a percentage of total loans?","Ralph Babb ","Yes, I mean we do not share what our limitations are within the company but I had to tell you that we are very comfortable with where we are. If you go back to the first quarter 2010 where we\u2019re 20%, we\u2019re at 22% today we\u2019ve had nice growth. The energy portfolio as I mentioned I think has a significant impact Mike on that percentage.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And then just a more general question goes to the trade-of between generating revenues reserve in the revenue generation ability for Comerica with expenses today. And so on the one hand I see loans growing faster, loan utilization up, you still benefit from the higher rates. On the other hand I look at the expense to revenue ratio, the efficiency ratio and it just looks a lot worse than peer and if you go back two decades the 90-92 merger of equal the expense to revenue ratio then was 61%, today it\u2019s higher 60s. So I guess the question is how do you evaluate that trade-off and when do you think you could reach your target for a 60% efficiency ratio?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, Mike, we did announce a couple of years ago that we had an efficiency ratio target, long term target to take that efficiency below 60%. We have made progress towards that target despite the impact of the low rate environment on us and we do expect to continue to make progress. We will need a little bit of a rate environment increase to ultimately get it over the goal line. If you look at LIBOR, 30 day LIBOR, to which we\u2019re most exposed, it sits at 15 basis points today, and that is incredibly low and we would deem a more normal rate environment to be closer to 300 basis points. We certainly don\u2019t need to get anywhere close to 300 to get it over the goal line but we will need a little bit of an uptick from here.","Lars Anderson","That\u2019s a big difference in your comparison as the interest rate.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And my last question is a little sensitive for Ralph that\u2019s for you. I know you\u2019re very young for your age, I don't mean to imply anything like that in my question but what are your plans to retire on a mandatory retirement age is what would Comerica\u2019s consideration be towards a strategic merger acquisition, something like that?","Ralph Babb","We don\u2019t have a mandatory retirement. The Board of Directors reviews the succession plan regularly and any time there is a meaningful decision made, appropriate announcements are made at that point. As you know we look at acquisitions from time to time and I guess we've done two in the last 10 years and they have to fit into the strategy and into the markets where we are and especially in the culture as well. And I used Sterling as our latest acquisition as a point of where the culture and the combination has turned out to be a real home run for us in our Houston market from the addition of the talent and the combination with our people and the growth that we\u2019re seeing in that market, because of it they are doing a great job. Our strategy there has not changed.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And just one follow-up to that. I think right here you say is that you\u2019re very confident about your future and Comerica\u2019s future. So under what circumstance would Comerica consider selling to another bank? And the only reason I bring that up is investors bring it up to me saying Comerica is a takeover target, just wondering what you\u2019d say to that?","Ralph Babb","We\u2019re very happy as I have said with our foot print and our strategy in what we have done and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on that strategy to move forward especially to give the type of returns that our shareholders expect and deserve.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital","","Well thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe I\u2019ll ask the question in another way from being a potential seller to a potential buyer. I mean would you have any interest in diversifying into companies with adjacencies and say factoring businesses for example or vendor finance and the like [indiscernible] a company called CIP which is big in those businesses, has a lot of excess capital and that would be merger equals to. Is that something that you might consider at some point in time in terms of just helping to diversify your footprint from a lending standpoint?","Ralph Babb","We like our footprint, as we have said and especially being in Texas and California and with our long time home in Michigan. And that footprint has the two largest economies in the country, the two states of California and Texas. And we like our overall model, and we like to refer to ourselves as a mainstream bank. And we have spent a lot of time in making sure that\u2019s the kind of bank that we are and moving forward that is our strategy and we don\u2019t look to change that strategy.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital","That\u2019s helpful. And then a question on just your national dealer services business. Clearly that part of the business is benefiting from where we are in kind of the auto sales cycle and new car sales are just being taking a long, a very strong clip, March was very strong. But I am trying to get a sense for what you would look at as an early indicator of the cycle potentially turning. ","One of the things I look at is used car prices, I know you predominantly I think financed new car inventory but if you were trying to find out some data points to see what would indicate a turn in that cycle or where you might turn a little more cautious in terms of that Dealer Floor Plan, lending in particular but more broadly across your footprint of auto and rental car and leasing loans. What kinds of things would you look at and how do you think about the cycle and where we\u2019re at? I mean do you think you can benefit from another three or four quarters before you dial it back, just some perspective on that would be helpful.","Ralph Babb","Well I think if you look back at history, the auto sales peaked at little over 17 million, we\u2019re in the 16s now, so that would be an indicator of I think where sales will be at some point in time and maybe when it gets to 17 million or above you\u2019ll start to see a slowdown in that particular cycle. The important thing from our strategy is that we look at multiple dealers that are our customers. In other words generally they have at least five dealerships within their -- in their model. And they are very much the majority of that or in our footprint. As I remember Lars you commented on this about 60% of it is California.","Lars Anderson","","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. That\u2019s the biggest part and it\u2019s naturally of all that the biggest mega dealers in the country are on the West Coast. But just to speak to that we watch a number of different metrics on a regular basis to ensure that we\u2019re tracking the health of the portfolio and inventory days on hand and those kinds of things. And on an individual by individual basis, each of these relationships are reviewed on a regular basis. I would tell you that you are beginning to see the growth margins on new vehicles begin to narrow. Last year those have kind of reversed and we\u2019re beginning to see an expansion in those margins and I think that\u2019s a positive for the industry. So as I think Ralph pointed out, we see a healthy 2014 in vehicle sales, but we\u2019re going to keep a close eye on the portfolio.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital","Thanks Lars. Just in terms of some other metrics on underwriting perspective, should we think about it in terms of LTVs against the value of full plan inventory, how have the -- I mean I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the strength of the dealer themselves, but also if you\u2019re lending against that and its collateralized how should we think about LTVs say in that business, have they moved, have they increased, decreased, how should we think about that?","Lars Anderson"," ","I mean our strategy hasn\u2019t changed, I mean our LTV is what we finance really what I would say robust credit policy for underwriting dealers has not shifted at all through the cycle and even to today, so I think you can have confidence in that.","","John Killian","If I could add, this is John Killian, if I could add, we\u2019ve been in this business for over 65 years, we\u2019ve been in it in a very major way on a national basis for over 20 years and it is over that period of time from a credit quality standpoint the best performing line of business that we have.","Operator"," ","And your next question is from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.","Gary Tenner - D.A. Davidson"," ","Guys, good morning, thanks for extending the call so long, I just have a quick question in terms of the general middle market lending segment. Just you know curious where some of the strength there has come from, it was highest I think it\u2019s been in three or four quarters, I assume it\u2019s generally California and Texas, but I wonder if you could kind of comment on where any specific pockets of strength are.","Lars Anderson","","Yes, absolutely, yes general middle market would typically be your manufacturers, distributors, people [indiscernible] those kinds of companies that you would expect, frankly Texas has been the biggest driver, probably no surprise to you as GDP amongst our key primary states, Texas leads the forecast for \u201914, it\u2019s at 3%, California is 2%. You know we would expect that our general middle market business would continue to go up. I would tell you it\u2019s a very competitive market, we\u2019re out there having to deliver the Comerica relationship banking model, every single day, win those relationships, but we\u2019ve been very pleased to see the growth in particular in Texas and in California in the past quarter and even growth in Michigan.","Operator"," ","And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Ralph Babb for closing remarks.","Ralph Babb","","I would like to thank everybody being with us this morning and also your interest in Comerica and wish everybody a good day, thank you.","Operator"," ","And thank you again for participating in today\u2019s conference, you may now disconnect."],"6604":["Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 16, 2013  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Darlene P.

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Ms. Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Darlene P. Persons","Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Comerica's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Vice Chairman of Business Bank, Lars Anderson; and Chief Credit Officer, John Killian.","A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC's website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. As we review our fourth quarter results, we will be referring to the slides, which provide additional details on our earnings.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause future results to vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release issued today, as well as Slide 2 of this presentation, which I incorporate into the call, as well as our filings with the SEC. Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures, and in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within the presentation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph, who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph W. Babb","Good morning. Today, we reported fourth quarter 2012 earnings per share of $0.68 or $130 million compared to $0.61 or $117 million for the third quarter. Loan and fee income growth, combined with expense control, contributed to our 11% increase in fourth quarter 2012 net income when compared to the third quarter. Full year 2012 net income was $521 million, an increase of $128 million or 33% compared to 2011.","Turning to Slide #4 and further highlights. In this slow-growing national economy, we continue to benefit from our position in growth markets and our industry expertise, which helped drive an increase in average total loans of $522 million. The increase in average total loans primarily reflected an increase of $762 million or 3% in commercial loans, partially offset by a decrease of $241 million or 2% in Commercial Real Estate loans. The increase in commercial loans was primarily driven by increases in National Dealer Services, Energy, general Middle Market and Mortgage Banker Finance. We continue to capitalize on opportunities by reallocating resources to faster-growing markets and segments.","Average total deposits increased $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter to a record $51.3 billion, primarily reflecting an increase of $1.3 billion or 6% in non-interest-bearing deposits. Excluding accretion, net interest income was stable in the fourth quarter and reflected an increase in loan volumes and lower funding costs, offset by the continued shift in the mix of the loan portfolio, a decline in LIBOR and lower yields on mortgage-backed investment securities. Accretion of the purchase discount in the acquired Sterling loan portfolio declined $2 million. Non-interest income increased $7 million to $204 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to increases in customer-driven fee income.","We maintained our tight control of expenses in the fourth quarter. Non-interest expenses decreased $22 million to $427 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in restructuring expenses related to the Sterling acquisition. Credit quality continued to be strong in the fourth quarter with lower non-accrual and watch list loans and a lower provision for credit losses. With net charge-offs of 34 basis points, we are well within our historical normal range. We have demonstrated throughout the cycle that we can effectively manage credit.","Our capital position remains a source of strength to support our growth. We repurchased 3.1 million shares in the fourth quarter and 10.1 million shares for the full year 2012 under our share repurchase program. Combined with dividends, we returned 93% and 79% of fourth quarter and 2012 net income to shareholders, respectively.","Turning to Slide #5. We continue to be pleased with the substantial growth opportunities in our markets, particularly Texas, where we continue to leverage our standing as the largest U.S. commercial bank headquartered in the state. The Texas economy continues to be a growth leader, consistently outperforming the national economy. We are allocating more resources in Texas to Technology and Life Sciences, Environmental Services, and Mortgage Banker Finance to complement our already-strong energy lending capabilities and our focus on a broad spectrum of middle market companies. Average loans in Texas were up in the fourth quarter and were up 10% from a year ago. While average deposits, which were relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, were down from a year earlier as expected, as we adjusted pricing on the former Sterling portfolio.","We are also well positioned to capitalize on the considerable opportunities in California, a state whose economy is gaining momentum, particularly in Northern California, where technology companies in Silicon Valley continued to drive growth. Our Technology and Life Sciences business has strong relationships with key venture capital firms in all of the major tech hubs. In our National Dealer Services business, we have relationships with auto dealerships in more than 30 states, California being the largest. And our Southern California-based entertainment group is active in financing film and television productions, as well as providing wealth management services to members of the entertainment community. Average loans and deposits in California were up in the fourth quarter and were up 13% and 15%, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 2011.","The economic recovery in Michigan is broadening and continues to improve, primarily driven by the recovery of the auto sector. We have strengthened our #2 deposit market share position in the state based on the latest FDIC deposit market share survey. We have long-standing relationships with businesses and consumers in the state where we have had a continuous presence for more than 163 years now. Michigan remains an important market to us, and we are proud to be among the largest employers in Metropolitan Detroit. Average loans in Michigan were relatively stable in the fourth quarter and down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2011, as customers continued to have significant liquidity and have deleveraged through the cycle. Average deposits in Michigan grew in the fourth quarter and were up 5% from a year ago.","Looking ahead, regardless of how our nation's fiscal issues are resolved, we still expect to operate in a low-rate environment for quite some time and are prepared to do so. We believe our focus on relationships, growth markets, industry expertise and expense management should assist us in increasing returns to shareholders and provide us the momentum that will not only carry us through an extended low-rate environment but enable us to succeed in it, too. We believe our company has a tremendous upside when the economy ratchets up and interest rates rise.","Looking at the impact from a 200 basis point increase in rates over a 12-month period, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, we should expect to see an almost $180 million or 11% increase in net interest income based on our analysis at December 31, 2012. This includes the value of our already-strong deposit base, which we anticipate would increase substantially when rates rise, providing a tremendous source of low-cost funding with continued loan growth.","In addition, as economic activity improves and investments ramp up, particularly among small and middle market companies, we expect fee income generation to continue to increase along with loan volumes.","We believe we are ready for the road ahead and have the right strategy in place to make a positive difference for our shareholders, customers and employees. And now I will turn the call over to Karen.","Karen L. Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. As Ralph mentioned, total average loan growth was $522 million or 1% quarter-over-quarter. The pace of decline of average commercial mortgage and real estate construction loans slowed in the fourth quarter, with a decrease of $241 million compared to the $344 million decrease we had in the third quarter. While properties are still being refinanced in the end market faster than new commitments are drawn, our Commercial Real Estate pipeline continues to grow and demand is improving.","As shown in the blue diamonds, loan yields declined 6 basis points in the quarter, reflecting declines in LIBOR and purchase loan accretion, as well as the continued mix shift in our portfolio. On the right-hand side, you can see commercial loans, which were up 3% or $762 million, were the main driver of our loan growth. As you can see on the green part of the bar, Mortgage Banker average loans grew again this past quarter, driven by market share gains and continued positive trends in the refinance markets. As we have said in the past, Mortgage Banker outstandings can be volatile and should eventually decline as refinance volumes slow.","As we have seen historically, we had strong seasonal growth at the end of the year with period-end loans increasing $1.9 billion or 4% to $46.1 billion. This primarily reflected an increase of $2.1 billion or 7% in commercial loans, with increases noted in almost all lines of business.","In addition, total commitments increased $817 million in the fourth quarter, with commitments increasing in almost every business line, led by Mortgage Banker, Energy, and Technology and Life Sciences. Line utilization increased to 49.4% from 48.2% in the third quarter. Also, our loan pipeline remains solid even with the high level of closing activity at year end, and almost 2\/3 of the pipeline at year end can be attributed to new business.","As shown on Slide 7, our total average deposits grew 3%, ending the year at an all-time high. Our average non-interest-bearing deposits also reached a new record, increasing $1.3 billion or 6% over the third quarter. The growth was broad based with contributions from almost every business line. We were able to lower deposit pricing by 2 basis points, as shown by the yellow diamonds on the slide. As I have said before, we continue to carefully scrutinize deposit pricing. However, at this level, it's becoming more difficult to continue to lower the overall cost in the future.","Our period-end deposits increased to a record $52.2 billion. We are closely monitoring activity, but we have not seen an impact on the expiration of the transaction account guarantee program on December 31.","Finally, our loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 88% at year end.","Slide 8 provides details on our securities portfolio, which primarily consists of highly liquid, highly rated mortgage-backed securities. The portfolio averaged about $10 billion in the fourth quarter. This slightly larger size helped offset the decline in yields, shown in blue diamonds, resulting from purchases of securities with rates in the 1.5% range.","Similar to last quarter, there was only a small amount of accelerated premium amortization recognized in the quarter. At December 31, the remaining net unamortized premium was about $95 million or just under 1% of the portfolio balance. The average duration on the portfolio remains low at 3 years. Prepayments were about $900 million in the fourth quarter. We expect prepayments will continue at this pace in the first quarter, assuming rates remain at current levels.  Lastly, we continue to manage the size of the portfolio in conjunction with our excess liquidity.","Turning to Slide 9. Our net interest income was relatively stable in the fourth quarter. Loan growth helped offset the impact of accretion and the continued low-rate environment. We've summarized in the table on the right the major moving pieces in the quarter. Growth in average loans added $4 million to net interest income but does not impact the rate margin. While we remain focused on holding spreads for new and renewed credit facilities, there are many mix shift dynamics that are impacting the loan portfolio, such as higher yield in Commercial Real Estate loans being replaced by lower yield in commercial loans; older fixed rates loans maturing, some of which are refinanced at current yields; as well as positive credit migration. All these factors combined had a $4 million or 4 basis point impact on the net interest margin. Approximately 85% of our loans are floating rate, of which 75% are LIBOR based, predominantly 30-day LIBOR. LIBOR declined in the fourth quarter, with average 30-day LIBOR declining 3 basis points. The decline in LIBOR had a $2 million or 2 basis point impact.","In addition, you may recall in the third quarter, we had $2 million in residual value lease adjustments in our portfolio, which reduced the margin last quarter by 2 basis points and was not repeated.","Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling portfolio contributed $13 million, which is a decline of $2 million in the quarter or 1 basis point on the margin. The accretion realized was greater than we had forecast, as the performance of the acquired portfolio exceeded our expectations due to improved credit quality and faster repayment or refinance activity. We have about $55 million of total accretion remaining to be realized on the acquired portfolio. Accretion will continue to trend downward each quarter, and we expect to recognize about $20 million to $30 million in 2013.","In aggregate, total loan-related items had a $2 million or 5 basis point negative impact on the margin. Dynamics in the securities portfolio, including prepayments being reinvested at lower rates, partially offset by a slightly larger portfolio, had a $2 million or 3 basis point negative impact. Lower deposit costs added $1 million and provided a 1 basis point increase to the margin. And finally, average excess liquidity increased $478 million, reducing the net interest margin by 2 basis points. As Ralph mentioned, our asset-sensitive balance sheet remains well positioned for rising rates. We believe a 200 basis point annual increase in rates, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result in almost $180 million increase in net interest income.","Turning to the credit picture on Slide 10. Credit quality continued to be strong in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs decreased to $37 million or 34 basis points of average loans. While gross charge-offs were at a similar level as the third quarter, we had a higher level of recoveries in the fourth quarter. Our provision for credit losses was $16 million, down from $22 million in the third quarter. This decrease reflects the substantial decrease in nonperforming and watch list loans, as shown on the right side of the slide. Our watch list loans decreased $565 million to $3.1 billion or 6.7% of total loans. Nonperforming loans decreased $151 million. With the decline in nonperforming loans, the allowance to NPLs increased to 116%. In addition, the average carrying value of our nonaccrual loans is about 55%, and the $629 million allowance is over 4x the annualized fourth quarter net charge-off.","Slide 11 outlines the non-interest income, which increased $7 million or 4% in the fourth quarter and reflects increases in customer-driven categories, including increases in commercial lending fees, derivative income and fiduciary income, partially offset by a decrease in letter of credit fees. We believe that the cross-sell initiatives we have been implementing over the past year are resulting in increased collaboration across business lines. Noncustomer-related categories were relatively stable at $14 million. Securities gains related to auction rate securities redemption were $1 million. This was offset by a $2 million decrease in deferred compensation asset returns, which was completely offset in deferred compensation plan expense.","Turning to Slide 12. We continue to maintain good expense control. Expenses decreased $22 million. Excluding the $23 million decrease in restructuring expense, the $4 million increase in severance expense and a $6 million benefit in the third quarter from gains on sales of assets, expenses declined $9 million compared to the third quarter. We incurred $2 million in restructuring costs related to the acquisition of Sterling, which closed in July 2011. This compares to $25 million in restructuring expenses recorded in the third quarter. Restructuring charges related to Sterling are now complete. While salaries increased $4 million, the increase was primarily due to a $4 million decrease in severance -- excuse me, a $4 million increase in severance and a $2 million increase in employee incentives, which were offset by a decline in deferred compensation, which, as I mentioned, is completely offset in non-interest income. We continue to carefully manage our workforce, which has decreased 5% over the past year as shown on the bottom chart on the slide.  Non-interest expense in the third quarter benefited from $6 million in gain on sale of certain assets not repeated in the fourth quarter. Also, in other non-interest expenses, legal expenses declined by $4 million in the fourth quarter.","Moving to Slide 13 and capital. As Ralph mentioned, we repurchased 3.1 million shares under our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. In 2012, we repurchased a total of 10.1 million shares for $304 million. We expect to complete the execution of the previously announced $375 million share repurchase plan through the first quarter.","Combined with dividends paid, we returned 79% of net income to shareholders in 2012. We have submitted our 2013 capital plan to our regulators and expect the response in mid-March. As stated before, we believe that we approached the CapPR process from a position of capital strength, as measured by both the current regulatory capital standards, as well as the proposed Basel III capital ratios.","On Slide 14, I am pleased to report that we have met and exceeded the financial hurdles we had set for the Sterling acquisition, including revenue and expense synergies, as well as integration costs. As I mentioned earlier, the integration of Sterling is complete. There will be no further restructuring expenses related to the acquisition. In fact, total restructuring expenses came in $15 million lower than we originally anticipated, with final total cost of $110 million. The former Sterling footprint, which was predominantly Houston, San Antonio and Kerrville, delivered loan growth of 10% and fee growth of 15% since the deal closed. Overall, we remain very pleased with the acquisition and the momentum we are building in the Texas market.","Finally, turning to Slide 15 and our outlook for the full year 2013 compared to 2012. We expect loan growth to continue but at a slower pace. Our 2012 loan growth was strong and broad based, and we benefited from our expertise in Mortgage Banker, National Dealer Services and Energy. Going forward, we expect Mortgage Banker outstandings to eventually normalize in line with refinance activity. We also expect the rate of decline of our Commercial Real Estate loans to continue to slow and eventually turn, but it's difficult to predict the exact timing by quarter or year. We plan to continue to -- our emphasis on middle markets, particularly where we benefit from our industry expertise. However, the current uncertain economic environment does bear on demand and competition for new loans, and we intend to maintain discipline with credit structure and relationship pricing.","We expect net interest income to decrease, primarily reflecting the continued reduction in the accretion of the loan discount on the Sterling acquisition from $71 million in 2012 to an expected $20 million to $30 million in 2013. In addition to accretion, we expect that the continued low-rate environment will have an impact on loan and securities yields, as older fixed-rate loans mature and higher-yielding securities prepay. While we believe it will wane eventually, we do expect a continued impact in portfolio mix shifts from Commercial Real Estate loan decline and positive credit migration.","On the positive side, we expect to benefit from continued loan growth and slightly lower funding costs.","With respect to credit, we expect our total provision expense will be stable, reflecting loan growth offset by a continued decline in problem loans and net charge-offs. We expect customer-driven non-interest income to increase, as we continue to benefit from the full year run rate of the revenue synergies implemented in 2012, including a renewed focus on cross-sell opportunities, selective pricing adjustments and product investments. Note that this does not include an outlook for noncustomer income.","Finally, we expect non-interest expenses to decline, as we have no further restructuring charges related to Sterling, and we expect to realize salary savings from our reduced head -- workforce. Also, tight expense management should result in reductions in several categories such as legal, advertising and other real estate expenses. This will be partially offset by slight increases in pension expense and payroll taxes. As far as pension expense, we made a contribution to the plan at the end of the year. The returns on the investment of this contribution will help substantially offset increased pension expense. Therefore, we estimate our retirement benefits increased -- expense to increase only about $5 million. We estimate our tax rate will be approximately 36.5% of pretax income, less approximately $66 million in tax benefits.","In closing, we are pleased with our continued loan and deposit growth, customer fee income generation, tight expense management and strong credit performance. We look forward to the year ahead, and we remain keenly focused on delivering a growing bottom line. Now we are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about the change in the end-of-period balances for the mortgage warehouse, how that trended in the quarter and then separately, your outlook for that in the near term? I know you expect that it could slow with refis, but can you talk a little bit about the -- for next quarter, where you think that could go?","Ralph W. Babb","Okay. Lars, you want to?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, I'd be glad to. John, we did see a bit of a spike at the end of the year, and frankly, you may recall in prior quarters, we typically do see kind of a run-up in those balances. The average increase for the quarter was up nearly $100 million, and of course, the end of the period was up around $373 million, but that frankly is not that unusual at the end of the quarter. So that's the kind of the first part of your question. Second part, kind of on a go-forward basis, the mortgage banking industry expects a 19% decline in mortgage loan apps in 2013. So as Karen made a couple of her comments, as we look at next year, it would not be unlikely to see some of those balances in the overall mortgage banking finance portfolio moderate. Assuming that occurs, potentially offsetting that could be purchase volumes if the residential real estate market continues to strengthen nationally. So it's a great business, and we got a great stable of customers. We have clearly added market share this year, have very high cross-sells into that portfolio. So we're committed to it on whole, John.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And then can you talk a little bit about the growth you're seeing in Middle Market. It was encouraging to see that, that book grew in the quarter, and I know you're talking about the strong increase you saw in line utilization and commitments. So I'm assuming that bodes well, but can you give us a little bit more color about what you're seeing changing there that's starting to drive some good growth?","Lars C. Anderson","Okay, very good. So assuming that you are speaking about Middle Market general and some of the pickup there, obviously, our total Middle Market businesses, we're seeing some nice lift. But in the Middle Market general category, again, kind of similar to Mortgage Banking Finance, we saw a nice peak at the end of the year at over $300 million, but the overall portfolio, up $100 million, which was really encouraging to see, we saw really increases in that largely across our portfolio. I think there was a lot of good activity that was -- that we saw in the fourth quarter. Some of it, John, that would have been -- I would characterize as tax-driven, year-end activity levels, maybe some transactions that accelerated into the fourth quarter. But in particular, this is an area that we're giving specific focus to. I think it's an area that we can continue to grow at a nice steady rate as we head into '13. We've made additional investments into our general Middle Market business, and we would expect, again, as Karen pointed out, assuming the economy gives us a little bit of growth, that, that's an area that we can certainly continue to gain in a number of our markets. I'd point out that Texas has been a bit of a standout there in terms of growth, but we're also seeing pickups in general Middle Market, not just in Northern California, but Southern California, we've seen pipelines grow and actually begun to see a little bit of growth there, too. So that's very, very encouraging. One last note I'd mention and this is just in total commercial, you may have noticed that the Michigan market actually was up 1% in the linked quarters, so again, general Middle Market contributed to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question, just on the securities portfolio. I noticed in the slide you had, basically Slide 8, saying the duration is 3 years. If you go back a -- just a quarter, your duration was 2.7 years. Can you just explain why the duration of your securities portfolio is increasing? I guess I would have thought it would be coming down given the excess liquidity you mentioned.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, sure, Ken. The average duration in our year, in every quarter, it ranged between 2.7 and 3. So if you look further back in the year, you'll see it was around 3 in other quarters. What I can say is that we managed that portfolio and the reinvestments in our prepays, trying to maximize all of our different parameters, including getting the highest yield at the lowest premium and maintaining this highly liquid, highly rated portfolio. And as we reinvest those prepays and try to get the highest yield possible, the duration can inch out a little bit. But again, the entire year it's been between 2.7 and 3 years.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just the other question I had on expenses, obviously, your guidance was lower because you don't have the restructuring cost. If you were to back out restructuring costs from 2012 and let's call that core expenses, what would the guidance be for core expenses year-over-year?","Karen L. Parkhill","So for 2013 or actually, for 2012, we had total restructuring expenses of $35 million. For 2013, we would expect you to take out that $35 million and then reduce expenses further based on the fact that we are maintaining continued tight expense control across lots of areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, just maybe we can touch on C&I loan yields. I'm wondering what is the average new money yield, say, on loans being put on the book relative to the 3.33% yield in the fourth quarter?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Well, what we are focused on and continue to remain focused on, Craig, is our relationship banking strategy, and we deliver a, I think a differentiated value proposition in the market. To support that, we take a very disciplined pricing approach to our Middle Market and frankly, all of our businesses. And while you have -- I think we saw -- heard a pretty good breakdown from Karen of the breakdown in some of the decline in the yields overall, one key component of that has been the migration of our portfolio, not just in asset quality but also in concentration in commercial and industrial. And as you know, in C&I, they're -- typically that's a little bit tighter spread, lower risk profile, and that's where we're continuing to see a lot of good growth, good Middle Market growth. So relative to our loan spreads, which I think is a pretty good proxy, as we look forward, for 2012, we really have focused very sharply on this disciplined pricing relationship, pricing and cross-selling. And for 2012, we've seen loan spreads hold essentially for the whole year in what has clearly been a difficult economic environment and obviously a very, very competitive environment. So I think it really underscores our business model and the fact that the market really is looking for what we're delivering in this relationship banking proposition. So all that really figures into, obviously, the overall yield dynamics for the company.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Lars, as you said, loan spreads haven't really changed throughout 2012, which probably means your new money yield hasn't changed that much. So I'm wondering if 3.33% really had the accretion in there in the fourth quarter, which is a little bit higher than we all thought. Can you help us think about how much downside is left in C&I loan yields if the accretion goes away and if yield curve and rates remain flat?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, Craig, loan accretion was built into that loan yield number, and for accretion going forward, we had $71 million in accretion in 2012. We expect $20 million to $30 million in 2013, but you can think about it as declining every quarter in 2013. Did that help?","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Karen, can I start, in terms of the drags on net interest income from loans remixing and then securities repricing lower, as you look through 2013, is there any reason to expect the amount of these drags to lessen through the year?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. So if I think about 2013 -- you didn't ask this, but do keep in mind the accretion drag, which we just talked about. On securities and loans specifically, we do expect the impact from securities yields to continue as long as rates stay where they are. Currently, we're reinvesting our prepays on our portfolio in the 1.5% area, but obviously, we'll be reinvesting those at current yields. So that could be an impact depending on the rate environment. On the portfolio dynamics or the mix shifts that we've talked about, we do expect that to continue. However, it should eventually slow. Hard to tell exactly when it will slow. We do have the Commercial Real Estate decline in the portfolio slowing. As we've said, that will eventually turn, although very difficult to predict the exact period. The older fixed-rate loans, even though it's a small amount that we've got on our overall portfolio, we have seen some impact, and that should continue but again, eventually turn. And the credit quality impact on the portfolio is continuing to improve but at a slowing pace. So hopefully, that's helpful.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So in aggregate, maybe about this pace the next several quarters but in aggregate, lessening, say, as we go through the year.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Hard to tell.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And on the loan side. Okay.","Karen L. Parkhill","Right. Yes. Hard to tell exactly when, but that's reasonable.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. Just a follow-up on John Pancari's earlier question on C&I, as you look out over the next quarter or 2 and you're talking to your customers, do you expect any slowdown and maybe draws on some of these lines that you're seeing that are building given that taxes have gone up and we still have a couple of these mini cliffs still to play out?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars, do you want to take that?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, I'd be glad to. Steven, couple of things there. Let me just first touch on the point and I had -- I think John had referenced this, too, and that is utilization rates. The utilization rates that we share are at the end of the period, and obviously, we saw a nice increase, around 120 basis point increase, in utilization rates. Actually, about nearly 100% of that was driven by our National Dealer finance, and the activities we saw at the end of the year, if you net that, the average utilization rates were very stable as we look into next year. But our pipelines continue to remain very strong. They compare very favorably with the fourth quarter of 2011, and frankly, I think our commercial businesses are very well positioned. If you look at the growth that we had in the fourth quarter, we noted several standouts, but frankly, we had growth in almost every commercial line of business that we have here at Comerica. And we had increase in commercial in every one of our core markets. So given the backdrop of uncertain economic environment that our customers are feeling and really a dampened appetite for investment, I think that we are well positioned with the right model to go out and offer it in the marketplace. So we'll have to see how '13 plays out, but I think Karen gave good outlook on that.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one on the guidance. Last year, the initial guidance for 2012 was relatively vague, became more specific as the year progressed. Karen, is that the plan for 2013?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, our plan is to update the outlook as necessary every quarter as we have done in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre with Bernstein.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Question on the provision outlook. So your provision for 2012 was $80 million. Your fourth quarter net charge-offs running at about $148 million annualized. Do you expect your charge-offs to get down closer to that provision for it to be stable? Or do you anticipate significant reserve release to continue into 2013?","Ralph W. Babb","John?","John M. Killian","Sure. I would say, first of all, that we do not target a specific reserve level. We follow the methodology that we have had in place for over 10 years, and it's worked well in good times and bad. If you look at our current reserve levels, they represent, though, about 1.37% of total loans at December 31, down a little bit from 1.46% at September 30. If you look at it on an average basis, however, our reserves to average loans at the end of the fourth quarter was 1.43%. Our reserves to nonperforming loans increased substantially in the fourth quarter, rising to 116% from 94% because of the decline in nonperforming loans. At 12\/31, our total reserve is $661 million. It's about 4.4x our annualized fourth quarter charge-offs, so we feel we're pretty well reserved. As we go forward, reserve levels are going to naturally vary, as net charge-offs and problem loans decline somewhat, which we do expect, and that'll be offset to some extent by loan growth. Eventually, at some point, provision levels will approximate net charge-off levels, resulting in reserve release moderating.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And just on that front -- and I understand it's more than 4x coverage of charge-offs, clearly well reserved. Is there any impact or potential impact of the recent FASB proposal for life of loss -- life-of-loan loss reserves maybe driving some incentive to soft adopt over time and keep reserve-to-loan ratios higher?","John M. Killian","That just came out, as you know, and we continue to study it. We believe, frankly, that it is an improvement over prior versions of the rules, but it's really still too early to tell and too early to be precise. It should result in higher reserve levels, not only for Comerica but for the industry as a whole. And frankly, implementation is probably still a couple of years away. There's certainly nothing in our reserves at this point that would reflect that.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And one final quick one, unrelated. Any -- have you seen any change in depositor behavior once the calendar turned and we saw the expiration of the TAG program?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. As we've said before and you may recall, we did opt out of the TAG program back in the summer of 2010. We saw no impact at that time. We've been monitoring it. We've seen no impact today, and we expect that our customers look to us as a pillar of strength and stability regardless of the TAG expiration program. So we will continue to monitor it but have seen no impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is actually Bryan from Ken's team. So core pre-provision earnings has been in the $200 million range over the past couple of quarters, and when we bring together the guidance from today for lower net interest income, higher core fees and lower expenses, even x the merger charges, what would your outlook be for PPNR? Do you think you can grow it from this $200 million level it's been at over the past couple of quarters?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, we would view PPNR similar to how we would view net income, that our focus is to continue to grow it as best we can despite the headwind.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my next question is on capital. So on Basel III, you're at 9.1%, quite a bit above the 7% Tier 1 Common threshold. But with no preferreds in the capital structure, you're closer to that 8.5% Tier 1 threshold. So is there an appetite either in the near term or longer term to add some preferreds to the capital structure, so you could potentially bring down common levels a little bit low -- a little bit more?","Ralph W. Babb","I think what we will continue to do there is monitor how the final rules develop and make that decision based on that. That's not a negative. It means we're just going to watch.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Sterne Agee.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Wanted to get maybe a little more color around the guidance on the expenses down net of the restructuring costs that happened in 2012. I was hoping maybe for some magnitude discussion and then some -- maybe some color around the programs you have, if you might reduce branch count or what kind of thing you're going to do to further lower the expense base.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, sure. If you think about expenses year-over-year, I've mentioned no restructuring charges. On top of that, we do expect, as I mentioned, reductions in legal, advertising, other real estate, as well as a run rate expense reduction from our reduced workforce. We also will have a significant tight control of expenses, similar to what we called our profit improvement plan last year, where we will be monitoring expense reduction at a very high level to make sure that we are achieving what we expect to achieve. Something I didn't mention, we do have our wholesale debt funding cost, which should come down as well. We have $1 billion in federal home loan bank debt maturing in the second quarter, as well as $50 million in sub debt maturing in the second quarter, which should take our debt wholesale funding cost down about $2 million towards the end of the year. So there are several things that we're doing to make sure that we keep a tight control on expenses.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, just wanted to hear -- if you gave it, I missed it -- but any kind of estimate for what you thought maybe loan pull-forward was from maybe this year into the fourth quarter with the strong year-end growth in the loan portfolio, whether it was related to the fiscal cliff or what have you?","Ralph W. Babb","Yes. Lars, do you want to take that?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, I'd be glad to. It's a good question. I think that there were -- there was -- clearly, we saw in good volume in the fourth quarter, a number of dividend recaps, some M&A transactions that were, I would say, accelerated to take advantage of a more favorable tax environment in the fourth quarter. Actually, nailing that exactly would be a little difficult in what that represented in our overall loan growth. In addition to that, our committed facilities, there were clearly some draws on committed facilities. I think the dealer finance book of business would be a good example where dividends were paid out before the calendar year end. That would have impacted and maybe created a little bit of window dressing. I can't nail it exactly for you, but it would not have been the majority of our activity for sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Could you give us what you're seeing in terms of trends on your -- in your specialty lending areas, where you're seeing relatively more loan pricing stability or relatively more pressure, whether it'd be Energy or Entertainment or tech or NDS?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Sure. Obviously, we have a very broad array of Middle Market industry groups, so without going through each and every one of them, I'm just hitting maybe some of the big ones. We clearly have a great value proposition that we deliver. We've been in these specialized areas for a very long time, have developed strong reputations and I think do receive a premium from a relationship perspective. Energy has been a very good business to us. That's obviously becoming more competitive as we see more people in there. The dealer finance business is very competitive, as we see more national players entering that business. General Middle Market is generally stable, but it's competitive. Our Wealth Management business, frankly, grew, and I wanted to point that out, in linked quarters, great to see some activity there. Our Small Business stabilized. I think pricing there is competitive but hanging in there. Technology and Life Sciences, we continue to get paid a premium. But we've got a number of other businesses, Environmental Services, our Entertainment, our health and ed. I'd like to be able to say that any of them are protected from the competitive pricing storm but none are. So in this environment, you got to execute and execute very well your business model, and I think that we're doing that. And that's one of the reasons that we had 17% commercial loan growth this year, about $4 billion overall. I think it's being well received in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin with Citigroup.","Arjun Sharma","This is actually Arjun Sharma, on for Josh. I just had a question on your deposits. The deposit inflows in 2012 were stronger, probably much stronger than most people expected, but when rates eventually do rise, how do you think about those deposits maybe leaving the balance sheet? Or how do you really model how deposit elasticity would work?","Ralph W. Babb","I would add a comment there that I think we have seen, even with good loan growth during this period, deposits continued to grow. And I think it's a change in approach by a lot of our customers, who, while are borrowing and moving lines up, they are also being very careful to make sure that they have more liquidity than they had in the prior days, if you will. So it's hard to estimate how much you think they will run down. Some will certainly get used, but I don't think it'll go to the levels that it has in the past anytime in the short-term future. People are going to be more cautious from a liquidity standpoint.","Arjun Sharma","And then just a quick follow-up. When you think about your new loan origination and that yields have kind of stayed relatively stable over the last couple of quarters, when you think about the returns on those loans, would you say that ROEs have stayed relatively stable over the last few quarters? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of how you would think about your incremental ROE for new loan originations?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. As we look at loans, that's an important component of it, but we really look at the overall relationship. And as we've shared before, we have a very robust relationship pricing kind of approach and models. And I would tell you that we are staying very consistent with the expectations for attractive returns for our shareholders with the new business that we're bringing in. Our position on that hasn't changed at all, and I believe that we're going to continue to stay committed to that discipline in '13 and going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just as a follow-up on some of the comments on Commercial Real Estate. It seems like your outlook is a bit more cautious than what we've seen in some of the industry data. Can you maybe expand on the comments of demand improving and maybe what geographies you are seeing the most improvement and maybe give some details on which products are actually showing strength?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Sure, Ralph. Yes, Nash, I think the comments that we've made is that we have seen a slowing in the runoff of that portfolio, which, I think, as Karen had mentioned, is a positive message. We've actually seen volumes of new business closed increase in the fourth quarter included in that. We're continuing to stay and I'd remind you, as very much of an in-footprint core market Commercial Real Estate strategy. It's very urban market oriented. It's where we're very active. You'd see the majority of the projects in the big markets in Texas and in California. Now multifamily has really been the dominant asset class that we've been active in, and the majority of these projects are with developers that we worked with through this past fiscal crisis. And frankly, we trust them. They trust us. We were reliable. They did what they said they were going to do, so we feel very good about our customer base. They are in very strong position. They're putting in strong equity levels into projects, and frankly, we continue to see multifamily as a good growth opportunity for us. But we do watch it carefully and in particular, the submarkets for any saturation. We are seeing a pickup in office activity in Northern California. The industrial asset class in Southern Cal has certainly strengthened. And in Texas, frankly, across a number of different asset classes. Again, though being dominated by multifamily, we're seeing good activity. So I feel optimistic about our Commercial Real Estate operation. I think we've got some very talented bankers who are well positioned in growth markets. But it's a business that you got to watch very closely, and we're going to do that, and we're going to do it consistent with our relationship banking model.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just, Karen, on the margin, it sounds like asset yields are down 11 basis points this quarter. It sounds like the rate of change could improve over the next couple of quarters. In terms of the liability cost, I mean, you took them down 2 basis points again this quarter, but do you feel there's still further levers for you to take down, whether it's on the deposit side or on -- or further actions you could take on the funding side? And just as a -- on in terms of asset yields, you did mention you're maintaining discipline. Are you seeing significant weakening in structure from others in the marketplace?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, I'll take the first part of your question, and then on the structure in the marketplace, I'll let Lars talk about it. On our margin and the liability cost funding, we are the lowest cost deposit provider amongst our peers. We monitor that on a very granular basis every month, and we continue to find opportunities every month that we look at it. But because it is so low right now on the deposit cost side, I'm not sure that, that will -- those opportunities will add up to be something meaningful enough for you to see. On the wholesale funding cost side, I did mention that we do have some debt maturing in the fourth quarter, both from federal home loan bank debt and some sub debt. That should take our cost of wholesale funding down around $2 million towards the end of the year. I'll let Lars answer the other question.","Lars C. Anderson","Would you -- could you restate the second part of the question? I want to make sure I answer accurately for you.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just that, yes, Karen had noted earlier about maintaining discipline in pricing. Can you just give us a sense if you are seeing weakening of structure from others in the marketplace?","Lars C. Anderson","From a credit perspective, not us?","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, credit perspective.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, okay. So yes, we're continuing to see some, I'd say, some weakening of structure in the market in particular areas. You do see it in Commercial Real Estate, frankly in Small Business a little bit, Middle Market. So that is, I'd say, creeping in a little bit, but overall, I'd say that structures are largely holding. We have not changed at all our strategy, how we approach our -- from a credit risk and structuring perspective at all. And then obviously, that has not had an impact on our growth rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello with UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones for you. Karen, I was just curious as we kind of look at that mortgage-backed securities portfolio and the amount of prepayments that we've had out there, I was just curious if prepayment speeds slow down maybe like 20%, 25%, what would that do to the potential margin headwind that is being created currently?","Karen L. Parkhill","If prepayment speeds slow down and we're -- don't need to reinvest at lower yields, obviously it will help that picture.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But it would be -- maybe it's got like a 3 basis points per quarter headwind today. Would that go down to maybe 1 or something less than that? Or what's kind of the ballpark that we could think about for potential if these prepayment speeds ever do slow down?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, I -- it's hard to tell exactly to give you good direction, but I would say that your general direction that you described is valid.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Great. And then just lastly, in terms of capital deployment going forward, obviously, entering the stress test from a very strong position once again, just in terms of priorities as you think about the year, given the outlook and other opportunities that you have in terms of loan growth and whatever, any reason why we shouldn't expect the same type of level of capital deployment going forward? Or are priorities any different in 2013 versus what they were in 2012?","Ralph W. Babb","I think at this point in time in filing, as Karen just talked, it's too early to talk about from that standpoint, but I would say, if you look at our history, we've been very focused on either reinvesting the capital or returning it to the shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on my friend Steve's question on capital allocation. Just acquisitions as a topic, Ralph, and it seems like Sterling's largely done and it's met your targets. And I think we all know it was a little painful on the way in from a stock price perspective, but it seems like you're pretty satisfied coming out of it. And just wondering if you could give us updated thoughts on what might or might not make sense for Comerica and if acquisitions are on the radar screen at all.","Ralph W. Babb","Well, I think as we talked back at the time that we did that, that was a very unique strategic acquisition for us because it got us into Houston in a way that increased our presence and gives us the kind of recognition that we need in our footprint and also got us into San Antonio and Kerrville. And when you look at the footprint today in Texas, I'm very satisfied with that. We have a very good footprint. We have a very good group of colleagues in the markets, and we can grow that internally, much like we did with California when we bought the Imperial Bank, which was about 10 years before that. In Southern California, we needed that to have the presence, and likewise, we picked up a number of ideal businesses. So from the standpoint of having to do an acquisition, I would say that's not the case. We're very comfortable with our footprint. So it would have to be something that had the kind of return and fill-in that was an investment alternative if you will.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Hurwich with Ulysses Capital.","Adam G. Hurwich - Ulysses Management LLC","You mentioned earlier the -- your approach to lending and the relationship banking mindset that you use. And then you also mentioned that you would see fees rising, and yet, you see some continued pressure on yields on loans. So obviously, there's a balance going on between trying to keep relationships profitable through the fees and then offsetting some of the loan pressure on the yields. Could you explain to us a little bit more how you think about that and maybe how that can sustain returns on equity?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. So yes, I think, as you pointed out appropriately, we look at the whole relationship. We look at our ability to both provide credit products but also fee-based products. I mean our mission at Comerica is to help our customers be successful, and the way that we do that is by building very deep, long-lasting relationships with them. And to do that, you've got to really understand their business, and it's one of the reasons that we are more focused than ever on having our bankers spend time in the markets, building deep relationships. And as they do that and deepen their relationship of our customers, they're able to provide more products to them. At the end of the day, pricing on a loan or whether you're getting in treasury management, you're providing interest rate risk management solutions, employee benefits at work. We really take a look at the total overall returns for our company, but we do keep a very close eye on credit pricing. No question about it, as that is a big key driver for our net revenue. So at the end of the day, that model and that approach is working. I mean we've shown some very nice growth in our disciplined relationship pricing approach. And frankly, we're really seeing some excellent activity level in terms of cross-sell, which is a good, I think, healthy reflection of the activity. I'd point out the collaboration that we're seeing now today between our commercial customers, and well, we're seeing record levels of referrals where we're banking the principals and executive officers like we've never seen before. And I think that really bodes well for us and really speaks to a successful, kind of overall review of our customers and the kinds of returns that we expect and for the value proposition we can deliver.","Adam G. Hurwich - Ulysses Management LLC","Just as a quick follow-up, a little bit difficult to answer I suspect. Given the balance, is there any way for us to think about a bottoming level for the ROE in this type of environment?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. Well, Ralph may want to tag on to it, but from an ROE perspective, I mean we've got internal models where we review each and every customer, every product that we do and the overall relationship and it is -- it's hard work. I mean it's day to day, but we're committed to a certain hurdle rate and that's risk adjusted. We're not going to give up from it. I mean, really as you look at 2012, the environment that we came through, I think that's as, as good evidence as there is out there about our model and our commitment to disciplined pricing.","Ralph W. Babb","It's a very focused model. I would like to add one comment on the acquisition question that John put forward and underline what I was talking about: from the standpoint of today, we feel very comfortable with that footprint. I won't say that there wouldn't be a strategic opportunity, but there would not be many today that would expand that in a way like the other acquisitions that I talked about. So we would look at most as can you acquire it and put it in play at the same return as you could build it out over a period of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I just had a couple of follow-ups. On the commercial mortgage portfolio, obviously, the owner-occupied piece has stabilized, and you talked a little bit about what seems like a decline, at least in the pace of runoff in the kind of -- in the developer side. But can you talk about on that developer side, what kind of the appetite is relative to the owner-occupied piece? Is that a piece you're actively trying to stabilize and grow? Or are you more focused on the owner occupied?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, absolutely, and depending upon which pages you're looking in the deck or in the actual earnings release. If you have the FDIC Commercial Real Estate, you have both the line of business breakout, as well as, what I call our relationship, our C&I relationships in there too. And what you'll see in there in that breakout in our earnings is that the -- our line of business construction portfolio grew in linked quarters, okay? So that was a real positive. You'll also see in line of business commercial mortgage that there was a slight decline. That reflects the increasing volumes of construction loans that we're providing that we talked about, but it also reflects the rotation of -- and the activity levels of our developers and accessing the permanent markets. Those construction loans and lines of business roll to typically mini perms, and there has been a lot of activity in rolling those out to the permanent market because it's very, very attractive. The remaining part of Commercial Real Estate in there is really relationship based. These are factories, distribution centers and such, and our approach to that real estate is really just building commercial relationships, C&I relationships, and whether it's adding an additional warehouse, it's a trucking fleet or it's equipment, we're really underwriting the cash flows for the C&I company. So we feel very good about, as I mentioned, our Commercial Real Estate line of business, our opportunity to grow that. And I think as we see out C&I portfolio continue to grow in the future, we're going to see owner occupied continue to grow with that.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And then Karen, on the FHLB debt that's due on second quarter, I think you said $1 billion, you said the positive effect on funding costs should be about $2 million towards the end of the year. I assume you mean $2 million per quarter, and that should impact basically third and fourth quarters. Is that correct?","Karen L. Parkhill","No, I mean $2 million for the rest of the year.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And the timing of the repayment -- or of that debt due in the second quarter, will it have an impact on the second quarter? Or will it be mostly backed up [ph] ?","Karen L. Parkhill","Very little impact because it matures towards the end of the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have all been answered. I just want to follow up on the C&I loan yields. From the Fed data, it looks like the average for all large commercial banks, the C&I loan yield's around 270. Is there reason to believe you guys would be in that range, below that range, above it for new C&I originations?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","We're just going to stay focused on pricing, our individual opportunities that get us sufficient returns. So it's very difficult for us to peg that against, I think, the overall industry and to project that. But we're going to stay focused on our disciplined relationship pricing model. And it'll come out where it does, but we're going to ensure that we're getting the right kinds of returns on our relationships.","Operator","Sir, we have no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn it over to Ralph Babb for any closing remarks.","Ralph W. Babb","Okay. Well, I appreciate your interest, and thanks for being on the call today. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Darlene Persons","Thank you, Regina. Good morning and welcome to the Comerica\u2019s third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; President, Curt Farmer; Chief Financial Officer, Muneera Carr; and Chief Credit Officer, Pete Guilfoile.","During this presentation, we will be referring to slides which provide additional detail. The presentation slides and our press release are available on SEC\u2019s website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com.","This conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to vary materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation and undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement in today\u2019s release in Slide 2, which I incorporate into this call as well as our SEC filings for factors that could cause actual results to differ. [Audio Gap] after this conference call we\u2019ll reference non-GAAP measures and, in that regard, I direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ralph, who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph Babb","Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported third quarter earnings of $318 million or $1.86 per share, excluding $20 million in security losses revenue grew 2%.","Our credit metrics remain strong and expenses were well controlled. This drove an ROE of over 16% and an ROA of 1.77% for the quarter. Relative to the third quarter of last year our earnings per share increased 48% and net income is up 41%. This increase is due to our management of loan and deposit pricing, as interest rates have moved higher, improved credit quality and continued successful execution of our GEAR Up initiatives, as well as a lower tax rate.","On Slide 4, we have provided details on the adjustments related to certain items. We realized $23 million in discrete tax benefits primarily related to the 2017 tax reform law. The bulk of the proceeds were used to reposition a portion of our securities portfolio into treasuries which yield about $4 million in additional interest per quarter. The repositioning resulted in a loss in the securities sold. We also incurred restructuring charges related to our GEAR Up initiatives.","Turning to Slide 5 and an overview of our third quarter results, a seasonal decline in National Dealer Services and typical summer slowdown in middle market contributed to a $641 million decline in average loans compared to the second quarter. This was partly offset by a seasonal increase in Mortgage Banker and continued growth in Technology and Life Sciences, specifically equity fund services.","As far as deposits average balances increased $263 million. Our deposit rate increased 9 basis points as we remain focused on our relationship approach to manage deposit pricing to attract and retain customers.","Net interest income increased $9 million with the net benefit from increased interest rates contributing $13 million. Our net interest margin decreased 2 basis points to 3.60% as the benefit of rates rising was offset by lower non-accrual interest recoveries and higher excess liquidity.","We continue to have strong credit quality with a decline in problem loans and 13 basis points in net charge-offs. The charge- offs for the quarter were fully covered by our existing allowance, and as a result there was no provision for loan losses.","Non-interest income increased $6 million or over 2% excluding the $20 million in losses on securities that I previously mentioned. We have maintained our expense discipline and our efficiency ratio dropped to just under 53%.","Now that we are no longer subject to CCAR, our board is able to more efficiently and effectively take capital actions with a focus on reducing our robust capital ratios to a level that is reflective of our business strategy.","In the third quarter, we meaningfully increased our payoff to shareholders to a record level. We repurchased $500 million in shares and increased our dividend 76% to $0.60 per share. Our estimated CET1 capital ratio decreased 23 basis points to 11.66%.","And now I will turn the call over to Muneera, who will go over the quarter in more detail.","Muneera Carr","Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. Third quarter average loans declined $641 million compared to the second quarter primarily due to seasonality.","Our auto dealer portfolio decreased $400 million. Dealers typically reduced inventory in the third quarter in preparation for delivery of the new models.","In addition this year dealer has been impacted by M&A activity with a few of our customers taking the opportunity to sell a portion of their franchises at attractive valuations. Summer slow downs in middle markets resulted in a $225 million decline in average balances.","We had a few large loan payoffs in the second quarter in private banking as I mentioned on our last earnings call. This has resulted in a $191 million decline in the third quarter average loans.","Also we remain selective in the large corporate space maintaining our pricing and underwriting standards in a highly competitive environment. Partly offsetting these declines, Mortgage Banker grew nearly $180 million with a lower pickup in summer home sales. Our portfolio continues to benefit from the fact that it is heavily weighted to home purchases with 89% purchased versus refi compared to the industry average of 75%.","We continue to have solid growth in Technology and Life Sciences, specifically equity fund services. Total period-end loans decreased $782 million with seasonal declines in Mortgage Banker and dealer services.","Commitment to period-end were up $650 million driven by increases in most business lines led by Technology and Life Sciences and general middle market. Overall, the sentiment is positive, reflective of the strong economy, yet customers continue to be cautious given recently imposed tariff and evolving trade discussions, as well as constraints due to available labor.","On a year-over-year basis we have growth loans in many of our specialty areas such as Technology and Life Sciences, national dealer services, commercial real estate and environmental services. This has been offset by the adoptions in energy which has declined to over $300 million, as well as decreases in large corporate and private banking.","Our loan yield increased to 11 basis points. Short term rates increased at a much slower pace in the third quarter. For example average 30 day LIBOR increased 14 basis points compared to 32 basis points in the first two quarters of this year. Therefore the rate benefit of 15 basis points was muted relative to the second quarter. Also higher loan fees in the margin added 2 basis points to our yield. Finally, nonaccrual interest recoveries which were elevated in the second quarter decreased $8 million reducing the yield by 6 basis points.","As you can see on Slide 7, average deposits were up $263 million in the third quarter, with growth in nearly all business lines led by increases in interest-bearing deposits and Technology and Life Sciences and Wealth Management. We expect average deposits to increase in the fourth quarter consistent with normal seasonal patterns, but not at the same magnitude that we have seen in years past.","Period-end deposits were impacted by the timing of monthly federal benefit activity in our government prepaid card business. Of note, relative to the third quarter of 2017 average municipal deposits are down nearly $1 billion. Deposit pricing for the third quarter increased 9 basis points, as we remain focused on our relationship approach to manage deposit pricing to attract and retain customers.","Slide 8 provides details on our security portfolio. As Ralph mentioned, we repositioned $1.3 billion of treasuries at the end of the quarter. We have enhanced our future earnings as the higher yield on the purchase securities resulted an additional $4 million per quarter of net interest income.","The loss taken on the securities sold was offset by the discrete tax benefit which resulted from the new tax laws. As far as the portfolio third quarter performance, the yield on the portfolio continued to trend up and there was no significant change in the duration or the relatively small underlying loss position. Yield on recent MBS purchases have been in the 330s, 360s which was well above the average rate of 228 on the $465 million in paydowns we received in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 9. Net interest income increased $9 million, while the net interest margin declined 2 basis points. Our loan portfolio added $13 million and 8 basis points to the margin. Increased interest rates provided the largest benefit, along with one additional day in the quarter and higher loan fees. This was partly offset by an expected decline in nonaccrual interest recoveries from an unusually high level in the second quarter, as well as lower loan balances.","Deposits at the fed added $10 million reflecting the benefit from the higher fed funds rate, as well as an increase in average balances. The higher level of excess liquidity drove a negative impact of 3 basis points to the margin.","Higher yield on the securities book added $2 million and 1 basis points to the margin. On the funding side, deposit cost increased $7 million primarily due to increased pay rates. This had a 4 basis point impact. Also we issued $850 million in senior debt at the end of July, primarily to fund our share repurchase program and prefund some debt that\u2019s maturing in the first half of next year. The higher debt balances, together with the increase in short term rates added $9 million in wholesale funding costs and 5 basis points to the margin.","In summary, the net impact increased rates contribute in $13 million or 8 basis points to the margin. Credit quality remained strong as shown on Slide 10. Our net charge-off ratio was 13 basis points. Gross charge-off remained low at $25 million. Recoveries were $10 million following an unusually high level in the second quarter.","Total precise loans declined $95 million or 5% and now represent 3.4% of total loans at quarter end. This included a decrease in non-accrual loans which comprised only 47 basis points of our total loans. Energy criticized and nonaccrual loans continued to decrease. The positive credit migration resulted in a reserve release and reserve ratio of 135%. The economy is strong and our customers are performing well. At this point they're not seeing any concerning trends.","Turning to Slide 11. Excluding the securities losses, which I previously discussed, non-interest income grew $6 million on over 2%. This included good customer activity in both interest rate and energy derivatives. Investment banking also increased with a pickup in M&A activity.","Also we have smaller increases in car and brokerage fees. This was mostly offset by decreases in syndication following the robust activity in the second quarter, as well as letter of credit fees. In addition, we had increases in bank-owned life insurance with the receipt of the annual dividend, as well as deferred comp which was offset in noninterest expenses.","You may recall that in the second quarter we incurred a charges to increase the reserve for a derivative contract related to Visa Class B shares. Expenses remain well controlled and our efficiency ratio dropped below 53% as shown on Slide 12.","Salaries and benefits increased $4 million, as the impact from higher contract labor related to technology project, deferred comp as well as one additional day in this quarter were partly offset by a reduction in our workforce. Relative to a year ago, our workforce is down nearly 2% as we have implemented our GEAR Up initiatives driving increased productivity and efficiency across our organization.","GEAR Up restructuring charges were $12 million, an increase of $1 million from the second quarter. In the third quarter, we repurchased a record $500 million or 5.1 million shares under our equity repurchase programs, as you can see on Slide 13. In addition, we increased our dividend 76% to $0.60 per share. Together with dividends, we returned $600 million to shareholders. We have a target to repurchase up to 500 million shares in the fourth quarter and expect to facilitate this through an accelerated share repurchase program.","Our estimated CET1 declined 23 basis points to 11.66%. Our goal is to reach a CET1 ratio of 9.5% to 10% by the end of 2019. Careful consideration will be given to eearnings generation, capital needs and market conditions as we determine the pace of the share buyback.","Turning to Slide 14. Our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from increases in rates. Approximately 90% of our loans are floating rate, with the bulk tied to 30 day LIBOR. Also we have a favorable deposit mix with the majority being non-interest-bearing. Combine this with careful management of pricing, and we have been able drive a cumulative loan beta of 89% and a cumulative deposit beta of 21%.","In conjunction with the September fed rate action, we increased our standard deposit rates on select products. We believe average deposit cost will increase approximately 12 to 15 basis points in the fourth quarter.","Deposit rates are expected to continue to increase as short term rates increase. However, with some variability depending on the competitive environment among other factors, we are closely monitoring our deposits, as well as the market.","In total, we estimate $285 million in additional net interest income in 2018 resulting from the full year impact of the three rate hikes last year, plus the three rate increases so far this year. We have incorporated the slower pace of recent short term rate movement, as well as our deposit cost estimates in determining the expected net benefit of $15 million from a third quarter rate increases of which $1 million is already in the run rate.","Of course the outcome depends on a variety of factors, such as the pace at which LIBOR moves, deposit betas and balance sheet movement. It's likely that the fed could raise rates in December, as well as continue tightening next year and we stand to further benefit with our well positioned balance sheet.","We have not yet added hedges to change our asset sensitivity. Our asset liability committee continues to asses our position to determine the appropriate path given balance sheet movement and our outlook for rates.","Now, I will turn the call back to Ralph to provide an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter.","Ralph Babb","Thank you, Muneera. Certain continuation of the current economic environment, we expect loans to grow through the end of the year. We believe this rebound will result in average loans being stable relative to the third quarter.","Seasonality in the fourth quarter typically drives an increase in National Dealer Services and a decline in Mortgage Banker, supported by increased commitments, we anticipate growth in several businesses such as middle market and Technology and Life Sciences, primarily equity fund services.","Also, in large Corporate, we continue to be selective, maintaining our pricing and underwriting discipline. Regarding net interest income, as Muneera indicated, we expect to continue to see the net benefit of the recent rise in short term rates. In addition, the securities portfolio repositioning adds about $4 million.","We expect headwinds in the form of higher debt costs resulting from the full quarter impact of the late July debt issuance, as well as lower non-accrual interest recoveries and loan fees. We remain well positioned to benefit from future interest rate increases, though this outlook does not include a December rate hike.","We expect continued strong credit quality to result in a $10 million to $20 million provision. Putting aside the third quarter loss on securities, the BOLI dividend and deferred comp income, which is difficult to predict, our fee income is expected to be relatively stable. Our GEAR Up initiatives should continue to drive growth in card fees and fiduciary income. Mostly offsetting this growth is a possible reduction in derivative income and investment banking from strong third quarter levels.","Expenses are expected to increase modestly. We expect a small increase in technology project costs, as well as typical seasonal and inflationary pressures. We continue to be on track to fully realize our GEAR Up savings.","Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Altogether, we expect our pretax pre-provision net revenue to grow while we continue to achieve positive operating leverage and drive our efficiency ratio lower.","In closing, our third quarter results were solid. We continue to focus on revenue growth, as well as maintaining favorable credit metrics and well controlled expenses. Through a significant increase in our share repurchases and dividend, we were able to meaningfully increase the capital return to our shareholders.","We expect to maintain our robust return of capital while properly managing our capital base to support growth and investment in our businesses. With a solid pipeline, as well as increased loan commitments, along with seasonal factors, we expect loan growth to trend positive into the end of the year. We remain well positioned to meaningfully benefit from rising rates as we manage loans and deposit pricing.","In addition, we have been executing our GEAR Up initiatives and delivering on the efficiency and revenue opportunities. Our return on assets, return on equity and efficiency ratios clearly demonstrate our commitment to enhancing shareholder value.","And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks.","Ralph Babb","Morning.","Ken Zerbe","Just wanted to clarify one really quick thing, yeah, I think Muneera said the \u2013 the interest-bearing deposit costs are going to be up 12 to 15 basis points next quarter is that total deposit costs?","Muneera Carr","Interest-bearing deposit cost, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Okay, perfect. That helps. And then maybe a little more broadly, could you just talk about how you guys view debt or long \u2013 you know, I guess long-term debt as part of your funding mix from here because presumably if you do have further reductions in non-interest-bearing are you going to be more active in issuing sort of more net debt, like x any kind of sort of pre-fundings?","Ralph Babb","Muneera?","Muneera Carr","Okay. Thank you, Ralph. Ken, we have - first of all our deposits as you can see we talked about the profit in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll continue to see an increase in in line with seasonal patterns. Beyond that, as far as funding is concerned, we have a lot of attractive sources of fundings.","We can raise market index deposits fairly easily. We have FHLB funding that essentially is at about a 30 day LIBOR rate more or less. That's sort of the second source that we can go through. If necessary, clearly we can also approach the market. All of that does mean that loan growth is doing really well. So overall Comerica should benefit.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Okay. Sorry, but the day you issued in July was purely a pre-funding of debt that's maturing?","Muneera Carr","That's right. And also for the share\u2026","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Okay. And then just last question really quick. The loan yield \u2013 its called the loan yield beta calculative of 48%, was that purely due to where average LIBOR was are you guys seeing any signs at all of spread compression in the market? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Go ahead, Curt.","Curtis Farmer","Yeah. No I would say that nothing that is unusual on the lending side. It remains a highly competitive market and we remain very disciplined and very relationship focused. We have pricing model that we take into consideration client by client, overall credit risk and profitability of the client relationship.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. So is this \u2013 are you saying that the loan yield beta should go back to sort of more the \u2013 call it 80%, 90% range next quarter because LIBOR goes up. Is that what you're implying?","Muneera Carr","So looking at our loan deposit, I mean loan yields and the beta \u2013 cumulative beta that we are picking up, that's an all-in calculation of how our yields are benefiting. It includes non-interest accrual interest recoveries as an example. But purely for rates you can see that, our loan yields benefited 15 basis points when LIBOR was moving on average 14 basis points. So the pull through is there and there isn't any issues on the spread front, we are maintaining our pricing discipline.","Ken Zerbe","All right, perfect. That helps. All right, thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Morning, Erika.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is Brandon on behalf of Erika. How are you.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, good.","Unidentified Analyst","So similar to Ken's question, just wanted to ask more about the competition within commercial lending. You know how much business would you guys estimate. You guys always think you know alternative lending and said another way, how competitive is you know structure and pricing?","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to take that one?","Curtis Farmer","Yeah, Brandon, it is obviously a competitive environment and that competition extends not only to traditional banks but the non-banking or shadow side of things as well and we are definitely seeing some deals that are more highly leveraged and more covenant light.","Having said that, we've got a great client base. This past quarter 40% of our new originations were to new customer activities. So we're still been in a net acquiree with new customers. And so it is a competitive environment, but we felt like that we really are trying to stick to the market in line with the business we serve and we still have opportunities to grow.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you. And then you know my follow up question is, can you guys tell us what your exposure is to syndicated leverage lending or sponsor back transactions?","Ralph Babb","Pete?","Pete Guilfoile","Yes, less than 5% of the portfolio.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Morning, John.","John Pancari","Morning. A question on your interest rate sensitivity on Slide 14 and you talked about it too. You're indicating to a degree that your sensitivity is coming down a bit over time with these modifications to that sensitivity. How much of that is tied to deposit betas? And you know as you dialed that into your assumptions and if it is tied to deposit betas, is it all surprising you, because we would have assumed that you've got higher betas already assumed in your scenarios? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Muneera?","Muneera Carr","Right. Specifically talking about our expectations for the September benefits and how we are computing that, I mean, it all depends on a variety of different factors. How is LIBOR moving and LIBOR has been slow in the way it moved in the third quarter and then building that same slow pace in the fourth quarter and certainly the other variable is deposit cost and for that I gave a range of 12 to 15. We sort of picked our most likely scenario of where the deposit cost will go - turnout and all of that is folded together [Audio Gap]","John Pancari","Okay. So there's no real wholesale change in your assumptions tied to your deposit betas, is that fair to say?","Muneera Carr","That is fair to say.","John Pancari","Okay\u2026","Muneera Carr","From a deposit beta standpoint we have to monitor the competitive environment and make adjustments accordingly. And I talked about the fact that we made a set of pricing change early in October and that is part and parcel of those costs that I mentioned.","John Pancari","But I'm assuming you would have expected that you would be making that pricing change?","Muneera Carr","Exactly. Yes.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then separately on the expense front, I believe last quarter on the call you had indicated a low single digit outlook approximately for the growth rate in expenses for 2019. Is that still a fair assumption as we go into \u201919? And also how would you view the efficiency ratio for the full year coming off of the 2018 level? Thanks.","Ralph Babb","Muneera, take that?","Muneera Carr","Okay. So the comprehensive update on where we are going on expenses for 2019 coming on January earnings call, but a little bit of color on what to expect, our GEAR Up program will sunset at the end of 2018. We will continue to benefit from many of its initiatives and we have the last bit of benefit of about $30 million [ph] for next year. That will be folded into our overall outlook. That includes both expenses, as well as income benefit.","Beyond that though, we won\u2019t incur restructuring charges next year. So that will be a tailwind. Similarly, FDIC charges should be a tailwind next year as well. Offsetting this would be a typical increases that you see or merit or inflationary pressures or outside processing that typical goes up with and increase in revenue. Overall, I would say that we fully expect to generate positive operating leverage and we expect to continue to drive the efficiency ratio in the right direction.","John Pancari","Okay. Thank you, Muneera.","Muneera Carr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead.","Scott Siefers","Morning, guys. I was hoping you could just spend a moment talking about overall loan growth, just I know like at the back of the beginning of the year the hope was for it to approximate kind of real GDP growth, you know, at this point it looks like this year will come in a little light than that. But just as you look at you know, say the next several quarters what would it take for loan growth to kind of reaccelerate more the number that pretty much approximates like the real GDP rate just in your guys view?","Ralph Babb","Curt, do you want to take that?","Curtis Farmer","Yes, Scott. We historically had talked about loan growth more in line with GDP and I think as we\u2019ve gone into 2018 in the current environment that we're operating in and you look at things like H2 [ph] data across the industry there seems to be less correlation to GDP. Right now a lot of that is I think due to many other factors that I have already spoken to including the competitive landscape both from a bank and non-bank or shadow banking scenario.","And so our customers are definitely I think more optimistic than they have been. We still are not seeing a lot of accelerated CapEx spending. I think some of that hesitancy as Muneera alluded to is around just you know, tax reform positive, but the customers were sitting on more cash right now and in some cases there are deleveraging. And then I think beyond that there's some hesitancy on their part around just trade issues, mid-term elections just sort of the unknowns that might be out there.","So we have obviously booked a lot of new business, but we are seeing utilization rates, its from moderate to down overall and I think that the end - I think part of that is customers are sitting on a lot of cash.","The third quarter for us is often a down quarter because the seasonality that Muneera and Ralph both alluded to earlier and we are optimistic about the fourth quarter sales and growth overall through the end of the year. Our pipelines are pretty strong and commitments are up for us about $650 million in the third quarter.","So we would expect to see growth in the market, Technology, Life Sciences, as well as the build up in dealer that we normally see in the fourth quarter and some of that would be offset by the normal seasonal decline in Mortgage Banker Finance.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right, perfect. I appreciate that color. And then if I could switch sides on the balance sheet for just a second, just that you know as we look at the base of non-interest-bearing deposits, I mean, the growth has just been so extraordinary over the last few years. And it's you know as a percent of your total deposit base is just you know - so kind of out of bounds with where it would have been under what you would've called it today\u2019s typical cycle in the past, you guys have - you even just sort of had a very top level as to where that ultimately ends up - ends up flushing out, in other words will it just structurally be much higher than it's been in call it decades past or does it trend back down more meaningfully?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curtis Farmer","Yeah, you are right and we have seen a lot of growth in non-interest-bearing deposits and a lot of that has to do with the nature of our client base given the heavy commercial orientation to the base. And so as customers start to eventually to utilize some of that cash, you would expect some of that to come down. And then as we continue to see interest rates increase there will be some eventual movement of deposits potentially into interest-bearing overall.","Scott Siefers","Okay. All right. Thank you guys very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hi. Good morning, Ralph. Another question just on the deposit side, Muneera you mentioned that you\u2019d put through the standard October pricing and it seems like we're kind of on like a - you know, every six months or so where you put through the standard. How are you guys monitoring the need and the speed of which you need to put through that standard right? Because you had a very fast repricing in the second quarter then it was slower in the third. Now you're saying it's faster in the fourth following the October. So can you get away with doing them every six months or so or is the dynamic of the pricing environment changing quicker now than it would have been previously?","Muneera Carr","All right. So Ken, you know, you're right and I think I've been signaling this for a few months now, but I have said, it's not going to be a linear progression, it's not going to be - this is the pay rate and that's some sort of a systematic increase over time.","A lot of this depends on what's happening with loan growth, how much funding do you need, and what's happening in your - in your markets the competition and so we look at what's happening in our own deposit base, what's happening outside the competition, where is loan growth going and all of that has been factored into doing what we think we need to do to both attract deposits and retain our customers. I would say if you look at our total deposit cost so far and how are deposit base as we access that our pricing strategy is working so far.","Ken Usdin","Yeah, I think that's fair. Thanks for that. On the other side of the balance sheet to your point about watching loan growth in terms of that pricing, obviously with loan growth being slower than initially expected, you haven't had to - you haven't seen a lot of growth in the other bucket, so the cash balances continue to build and the securities book has been pretty stable too.","So can you just talk about how you're thinking about your earning asset mix as you go forward if we get a little bit of loan growth, do you start to put some of that cash into the loan book, do you start to buy securities given that we're finally at a steeper point of the yield curve, how do you think about usage of that - that excess cash that's been building up and weighing on the NIM?","Muneera Carr","So - you know, good point that you\u2019re making, I would say from overall cash, if we look at all balance sheet movements loan growth clearly would be our top choice in how we want to put our cash to use. Beyond that it is nice to see long-term yields moving up, which allow us the potential possibility of investing in securities, but we are happy with the size of our portfolio right now and I look at sort of the fact that we have a debt maturity coming up next year and some of the cash is going to be utilized for that, some of the cash is going to be utilized to grow loans. So we\u2019re not really looking at the present time to change the size of our securities book.","Ken Usdin","Fair. And the last thing could you just tell us about the magnitude of that debt maturity and what it's yielding relative to the - you know the portfolio?","Muneera Carr","The debt maturity is reached 50, its going to be six months LIBOR, less, I want to say about a few basis points \u2013 about 4 basis points or so \u2013 40ish [ph] basis points, I am sorry.","Ken Usdin","Six month, plus 40ish basis points, okay.","Muneera Carr","Yes, yes.","Ken Usdin","Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Morning.","Steven Alexopoulos","Morning, everybody. Ralph, I want to start on the loan growth side and given the very strong growth you've had in commitments, which Pete called out over the past two quarters, I'm surprised the outlook for the fourth quarter isn't stronger. Or are you just being very conservative with the guidance or are you really not looking for these mid-market companies to draw on the lines they've taken out?","Ralph Babb","I think its a combination of the two. It is the companies are getting prepared for growth, but they are watching very carefully as Curt was mentioning earlier what's going on in the markets and from a tariff standpoint, as well as the other competitive parts. And as it grows they are prepared and that's the positive to compete and the commitment as you mentioned and as Pete has talked about, went up in the second quarter and third quarter nicely. And so they are prepared for that growth and on GDP has been stronger as well. So I think all of the signals are a little more positive than they have been. Pete, do you want to add anything to that?","Pete Guilfoile","Yeah. And Steve you know we're definitely not approving commitments that we don\u2019t expect to be used. That's not a very profitable business for us. So it really is - utilization is lower than we normally would expect it today","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. That's helpful. Maybe for Muneera regarding the 12 to 15 basis point increase in deposit rates in 4Q, can you give more color on the standard increase that you're talking about here for October was that to all customers over a certain balance size or was it more widespread and are you seeing competitors do more widespread increases at this point?","Muneera Carr","It was select customers in select markets that the pricing changes were different in each. I think that this is sort of what we see others doing as well and we respond based on what we see in our different markets and how we see our customer base react depending upon what type of products they're using and what level of balances they have with us.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. That's helpful. If I could ask you one more. The decline in the non-accrual interest took a couple of basis points off in this quarter. It looks like you're calling that out again as a headwind for 4Q. Can you quantify that headwind still to come? Thanks.","Muneera Carr","Yes. I would say normal we say $1 million to $2 million. So that's what we would expect to pick up every single quarter. We picked up about 4-ish this time, so I'd say a couple of million dollars, 1 to 2.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Great. Thanks for all the color.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Muneera Carr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliot with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Geoffrey Elliot","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Back to the \u2013 this point on non-interest-bearing deposits and a mix shift. Thanks for the comments around expecting some decline and some shift into interest bearing overtime as rates go higher.","But can you help us understand how you think about quantifying that. You know, I guess, the data points that we look at pre-crisis if that was something like 25% of deposits and it climbed to mid-50s and has started to come down.","I mean, are there reasons why it should not go back to that sort of level over time if rates increase, are there reasons why it could go lower, reasons why it should stay higher. How do you think about quantifying that when you're looking out over the next few years?","Ralph Babb","Muneera, do you want to take that?","Muneera Carr","Yes, sure. So I think it's really important for us to make sure that we are clear about what we're seeing in our deposit base. When you look at either year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter increases, our interest-bearing balances are going up because we have new money coming in. There is a little bit of mix shift thing, so I don't want to say that that's not what's happening. But at least as far as our actual deposit base and the activity that we are seeing, that we see new money coming in interest-bearing and on the non-interest-bearing side we either get customers putting their money to work, whether that\u2019s M&A or reducing leverage you know, or in some instances we see a little bit of you know maybe a one or two customers that might have tried nothing systemic over there.","Their movement in balances it's going to happen as rates continue to increase, so I don't want to say that that's not what's transpiring. It is just very difficult to predict - just trying to give you some color of what they're actually seeing in our deposit base.","Geoffrey Elliot","Sure\u2026","Ralph Babb","The number of products that customer has - could also affect the amount of deposits\u2026","Muneera Carr","And Ralph made a good point that that is well.","Geoffrey Elliot","Understood. Thanks. And then I think you made the comments in the prepared remarks that average deposit should be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter but less of a - less of an impact than usual. Well, you know what is it about this year that means you're expecting to see a smaller impact?","Muneera Carr","If you go back and study our sort of deposit base for the last, I don't know six, five years, fourth quarter is usually a good quarter for us and people build, window dress their balance sheet. We see money coming in and the magnitude of fourth quarter deposit increases tends to be substantial. We are expecting a fairly similar seasonal pattern as we approach fourth quarter this year is about.","Geoffrey Elliot","Great. Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Morning, Peter.","Peter Winter","Just provide an update on some of the earnings benefits and strategies given that you're no longer subject to LCR?","Ralph Babb","Do you want to take that Muneera on the LCR?","Muneera Carr","Yeah, on the LCR front, I mean, the one big benefit is that you know we do have liquidity coming from our securities portfolio that we can then deploy. If loan growth picks up, its another added source of liquidity that we have, we can repurpose some of those dollars and instead of reinvesting then there move them to low and we don't - that's just - you know beyond that we still have to do our own internal liquidity stress testing and make sure that we are carrying appropriate levels of liquidity to take care of our customers.","Peter Winter","Okay. And I guess there was a lot of opportunities then I guess as you said to pay down debt as well?","Muneera Carr","Not really because of the debt that we have - that you can look at our debt pricing it's pretty efficiently priced. So I would say not really.","Peter Winter","Okay.","Ralph Babb","Is those views flexible\u2026","Muneera Carr","We have the flexibility if we choose to.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then on a separate question the capital ratios are still high at 11.66 and you've given that capital target of 9.5% to 10%. Could we assume that you're going to continue to do about 500 million share buybacks per quarter next year?","Ralph Babb","Go ahead, Muneera.","Muneera Carr","Okay. The way I think about it is for next year, clearly we have given you target. We know where want to go by the time 2019 comes to an end. We talked about the fact that you want to do a buyback at a measured pace. And we are going to look at our earnings generation. A large part of what we could give back is going to be what we generate in earnings and then beyond that it will be whatever it takes for us to get from our current capital ratios to our target. So that's how you should think about it.","Peter Winter","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brett Rabatin","Hey, good morning everyone. I wanted to - I guess go back to the margin and just thinking about the excess liquidity. Should we not expect at least a few basis points of improvement in the margin from a liquidity drainage in the fourth quarter, maybe Muneera can you talk about the effect of that in 4Q and what happens to that position in the current quarter?","Muneera Carr","Well in my comments I said that we are expecting to grow deposits in the fourth quarter which generally means that it's good for us in the sense that we will make more net interest income in dollars, but because the excess liquidity is going to be you know at the fed, it means that its from a yield standpoint, dilutive margin. If that helps you.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. And then want to go back to deposits you know, obviously the prepaid card timing was in effect on 3Q. What else affects seasonality in the fourth quarter in terms of deposits?","Curtis Farmer","Yeah. This is Curt, Brett. So just a normal build out that we see with customers building deposits at year end. So you see a build up in the fourth quarter and then in the first quarter a lot of that gets utilized as they pay taxes, distributions to employees for bonuses things of that nature. So it's just a normal sort of seasonal flow that we see, especially given our heavy core commercial orientation of the company.","Brett Rabatin","Okay. But, I mean, if you excluded that from the third quarter your deposit trends would have been kind of flattish this quarter. It sounds like you're basically saying look there'll be a little bit better in the fourth quarter despite customers using excess cash. Is that a function of you growing your core customer\u2019s deposits or new customers, how do we think about what you're doing in terms of the net flows and deposits?","Curtis Farmer","Yeah, I think it's a combination of both, in the fourth quarter again we see a normal seasonal build-off that we have been a net client acquisition mode. As I alluded to earlier 40% of our new loan originations in the third quarter were to the customer. And so every new customer\u2019s we\u2019re relationship bank, we expect deposits and treasury management and other things to come with that.","So even though customers utilizing cash and deleveraging et cetera, are using it for M&A purposes fourth quarter is typically seasonally higher and then we continue to be - we believe in a net client acquisition mode.","Brett Rabatin","Thanks for all the color.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Steve Moss","Good morning. Just want to start on expenses or go back to expenses here. In particular on - tech spending was a little bit of a driver for incremental quarter-over-quarter expenses. Just wondering how we should think about tax spend into 2019?","Ralph Babb","Muneera, do you wan to take that.","Muneera Carr","Yes. Overall, our tech spend or our investments in technology are going to be stable and even for this year they really are stable. What you're seeing is a little bit of I\u2019ll say push towards getting certain projects completed towards the back end of the year. It's not really because we are increasing the amount of technology budget, but we have a spend that we have. We think that it is \u2013 the overall spend is at a good level. It is - we are making the right investment and right changes that we need to make and that our customers and colleagues will find useful.","Ralph Babb","That was a big part of the GEAR Up process as well.","Muneera Carr","And Ralph is right\u2026","Ralph Babb","For technology\u2026.","Muneera Carr","Yes, Ralph is absolutely right, that is in our E2E CRM or whether it was it was moving our applications to the cloud, it was all part and parcel of GEAR Up initiative as well.","Steve Moss","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the loan loss reserve here, its come down slightly, perhaps looking for a little bit more of a decline, wondering how we think about that reserve over the next 12 months or so?","Ralph Babb","Pete, do you want to take that?","Pete Guilfoile","Yeah. We had three reserve releases over the last three quarters that\u2019s total about $16 million. I think the opportunity to release more reserves will probably be around energy, we\u2019re at 16% criticized there. So to the extent that energy continues to improve, there's a little bit of opportunity there.","Charge-offs had been very low. We expect the charge-offs remain - continue to remain low, there's still more opportunity there as well. I think the rest would be \u2013 ex energy, the rest of the portfolio is pretty much at record low levels of criticize. So you know we're seeing provision in the $10 million to $20 million next quarter from a guidance standpoint and that assume that reserves remain fairly level.","Steve Moss","All right. Thank you very much.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Morning, Gary.","Gary Tenner","Just wanted to talk about loan growth for a second, you talked about the fourth quarter and obviously we know you've got some seasonal businesses that you know drive some fluctuations there. But wasn't much conversation around the energy portfolio other than sort of a - you know kind of trailing view of it, so I was just wondering kind of where the appetite is for that business today given the rebound in oil prices?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curtis Farmer","Okay. I didn't quite hear you, Gary. Thank you very much. I mean, obviously energy is a big part of the Texas economy and a business that we've been in for a long time and so even that that book of business has managed down for us over time, its still a business that we want to be in and a business where we want to take care of our customers.","And we feel like it really has started to stabilize for us. It should be less of a headwind that its been in the last two years for us as we manage down that portfolio today. It's about a $1.8 billion portfolio. We would see it sort of fluctuating in a relative range around that number. We are seeing some nice new opportunities, some nice new commitments and some nice relationships that we there brought in. Energy products are certainly helping there and most of the clients that we're working with are just a lot stronger than they were as more equity and sponsor support out there. There's a lot of equity in the projects that we\u2019re working on and there's good hedging in place. And as you know overall retail has been up in 2018.","Gary Tenner","Okay. So it\u2019s the right way to view it then to your point that it will not serve as a headwind anymore but probably won't be additive materially to growth?","Curtis Farmer","Yeah, I think it will be less of a headwind and they will have some opportunity to grow as the portfolio of the company \u2013 our loan portfolio overall our growth. But I would not expect a significant growth from here, but the more moderate growth.","Gary Tenner","Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jon Arfstrom","Hey, thanks. Good morning.","Ralph Babb","Good morning, Jon.","Jon Arfstrom","Just a follow up maybe for you Pete, you mentioned a couple of times the 40% of your growth is from new relationships. Can you talk a little bit about the theme behind that kind of where and what?","Pete Guilfoile","I think that was Curt that mentioned that\u2026","Jon Arfstrom","Curtis, sorry.","Curtis Farmer","It's really -- we do track -- yes, Jon. We do track that across all of our business lines and we continue - really not a new thing for us. Almost every quarter we are very focused on taking care of our existing customers, but also focused on growing the franchise overall. It really is across almost every business and every market that - that we serve and even if utilization is not higher than it is right now. We are booking relationships and booking commitments of where we do feel like there will be borrowing against those facilities at some point in the future.","And what has allowed us to do is to continue to build our franchise across the board with great sort of relationship based opportunities where we can sell into the relationship, additional products and services that are value-added to the client, so treasury management, hedging product, card services, et cetera.","So we really think of it sort of the long-term view as we\u2019re building the value of our franchise. As you know we\u2019re in great business lines where we have a lot of depth and we\u2019re in some really great economies throughout the United States.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. So broad-based\u2026","Curtis Farmer","They are broad-based\u2026","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. And then just 30,000 foot type question, you guys have done. You guys have done well the last few years with a relatively flat balance sheet. But it feels like some of the rate benefit is fading in some of the obviously GEAR Up you've done well on that and see really performed, but I think from here we all think you need to grow a little bit faster.","And I guess are you bigger picture more optimistic on the growth outlook and is this the kind of environment where Comerica can go back to putting up that mid-single digit type growth?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curtis Farmer","Yeah, I think we are we are very optimistic. All the things that you mentioned, a lot of those are now so to speak in our rearview mirror, a lot of the things we went through with GEAR Up were meant to help position us well for a faster growing environment. So the rework of our underwriting loan origination process that we call in end to end credit redesign really is all about creating more capacity for our relationship managers to spend more time now calling all existing customers and prospects.","And then we we've added a lot of technology enablement for our relationship managers, a new CRM platform, sort of digitizing the process around loan underwriting and origination for us, like digital transformation for us in terms of treasury manager products and services, really trying to make sure our relationship managers have more mobile approach to everything they do, which we think helps create capacity longer term.","And so we've got good liquidity. Credits not an issue right now. We're very focused in our calling efforts and so as we continue to see some optimism build in the economy and as Ralph mentioned earlier GDP continues to strengthen and we are optimistic about growth possibilities.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brock Vandervliet","Good morning. Good morning. I think all the hot buns have been asked and answered at this point. However, just want to cover Life Sciences and equity fund services. The pricing and relative competition you're seeing in those segments?","Ralph Babb","Curt?","Curtis Farmer","Yeah, I mean I think that, as we've alluded to not only on this call, but the last several quarters, most of the growth that we\u2019ve seen in Technology and Life Sciences has been that equity fund services component where we're providing capital call and subscription lines to VC and private equity firms.","There's been a lot of strong new fund creation which you obviously have seen and that still that feels like that is continuing. We tend to work with some of the best private equity firms out there in terms of strength and ELPs that make up their roster. And so we feel like it's a relatively low risk business for us and one where we can be fairly selective. But we also feel like there's still a lot of growth opportunities.","The business that we actually only been in now for 6 to 7 years so we still feel like we've got a pretty good growth trajectory around the business longer term. And on the TLS core side there is some momentum building there, after a little bit of softness the last 24 months or so, we feel like we're getting a lot of new opportunities to look at new transactions and we've still got some very solid long-term relationships with venture capital providers and so that business has been little bit softer, but we feel good about the longer term prospects there.","Brock Vandervliet","With respect to the capital call lines are you seeing new entrants or is it kind of the same cast of characters?","Curtis Farmer","All right. I think we work with a lot of the same banks and syndicates and bank groups that we have seen previously.","Brock Vandervliet","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Ralph Babb","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Michael Schiavone with Keefe Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.","Ralph Babb","Morning, Michael.","Brian Klock","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Brian Klock. I just had some technical difficulties. So how are you doing Ralph and everybody?","Ralph Babb","Good.","Brian Klock","I just want to kind of sneak in here, I might have missed this earlier, but I think there were some questions that may be different way, I just want to try to put them together. Muneera on the sort of NII walk, when you think about for the fourth quarter, you know, if we start with third quarter NII and like you said I think there is $14 million of the benefit from the fed hike that would come this quarter, right out of the \u2013 there was $1 million already in the third quarter run rate. You pick up that $4 million from this year, the securities repurchase thing and maybe what $1 million or so would be the other piece on the non-accrual interest is that the biggest pieces that we should think about in that walk?","Muneera Carr","Yes, you\u2019ve got it all correctly. Beyond that I mentioned the growth in deposits in the fourth quarter, which will also bring at least net interest income dollars. And then don't forget about the one extra month from the debt issuance that we had in the second quarter.","Brian Klock","Got you. All right, great. And then one last question maybe for\u2026.","Muneera Carr","I would just clarify, the issue of the debt is in third quarter, sorry.","Brian Klock","Third quarter, right, right. And then my last question I guess for Pete, you know \u2013 we\u2019ve been so focused on the loan growth side of this, but it does feel like the asset quality trends continue to be as good as they've ever been and we've all expected there to be this normalization of credit costs going forward. I guess when you look out into next year and when you think about a charge-off of well, I guess what you know - you're saying $10 million to $20 million is the guidance for the fourth quarter, but that even seems conservative given the run rate and your NPLs formation keeps dropping. So maybe I guess thinking about is there anything in the portfolio or in trends that you feel like the current level of charge-offs is going to materially change in the next year or so?","Pete Guilfoile","Not that we can see Brian. I think we feel really good about our book of business. We \u2013 commercial real estate has been performing very well. We\u2019ve remained disciplined in that business. Leverage lending we\u2019ve been very disciplined in that segment as well. You know, Curt mentioned we're being highly selective in energy.","So I think overall we don't see anything out there that caused a problem. It's hard to look farther than a couple of quarters, but I would say we look - we feel pretty good about credit quality next year.","Brian Klock","All right. So I mean, we're starting to see some of the margin benefits, as from all the other commentary, they are becoming you know the second derivative is declining when you think about NIM expansion.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Comerica Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Darlene Persons, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.","Darlene P. Persons","Good morning, and welcome to Comerica's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Participating on this call will be our Chairman, Ralph Babb; Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Karen Parkhill; Vice Chairman of the Business Bank, Lars Anderson; and Chief Credit Officer, John Killian. ","A copy of our press release and presentation slides are available on the SEC's website, as well as in the Investor Relations section of our website, comerica.com. As we review our fourth quarter results, we will be referring to the slides, which provide additional details on our earnings.","Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements. And in that regard, you should be mindful of the risks and uncertainties that can cause future results to vary from expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement contained in the release issued today, as well as Slide 2 of this presentation, which I incorporate into this call, as well as our filings with the SEC.","Also, this conference call will reference non-GAAP measures. And in that regard, I would direct you to the reconciliation of these measures within this presentation. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Ralph, who will begin on Slide 3.","Ralph W. Babb","Good morning. Today, we reported fourth quarter net income of $96 million or $0.48 per share. Impacting the quarter were merger and restructuring charges of $37 million or $0.12 per share related to our acquisition of Sterling Bancshares, which we completed on July 28, 2011. ","Turning to Slide 4, you will see highlights from the fourth quarter. We are pleased to see total loan growth of $1.5 billion or 4% on a period-end basis, which was driven by a $1.9 billion or 8% increase in Commercial loans, particularly in National Dealer Services, Mortgage Banker Finance, Energy Lending, Technology & Life Sciences and Global Corporate Banking. We had record deposits of $47.8 billion at year-end 2011, with an increase in period-end deposits of $303 million or 1% compared to the third quarter. ","Net interest income of $444 million increased $21 million or 5% compared to the third quarter, primarily resulting from an increase in average earning assets of $2.4 billion. Noninterest income of $182 million decreased $19 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to a $16 million decrease in net securities gains. Noninterest expenses increased $18 million to $478 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to severance and related expenses, merger and restructuring charges, as well as one additional month of Sterling.","We continue to see steady improvement in credit trends in the fourth quarter. This was the 10th conservative quarter of a decline in net charge-offs with a $7 million -- $17 million decrease. The decline was larger than expected, primarily the result of higher recoveries in the quarter. Other credit metrics were in line with expectations. Nonperforming assets were under $1 billion for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008. The former Sterling loan portfolio has performed as expected. As a result of the overall improvement in credit quality, the provision for loan losses declined to $19 million. ","Our capital remains strong as evidenced by our Tier 1 common capital ratio of 10.31% at December 31, 2011. Under the share repurchase program, we repurchased 1.6 million shares in the fourth quarter and a total of 4.1 million shares in 2011. Combined with dividends, this resulted in a total return to shareholders of 47% of net income. ","We continue to be an active capital manager and believe we approach capital management from a position of strength. As required, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve on January 9, 2012. We expect their response in mid-March. As previously announced, we are targeting a first quarter 2012 total payout ratio of up to 50% of net income through the share repurchase program and dividends.","With respect to our Sterling acquisition, we announced the successful completion of systems integrations and the opening of former Sterling branches as Comerica banking centers on November 14, 2011. All former Sterling customers can now bank at any Comerica banking center with complete access to our full line of extended product and service offerings. ","This acquisition continues to be a great fit, as the former Sterling\u2019s size, geographic footprint and customer focus uniquely fits our strategy and expands our presence in Texas. We continue to be focused on delivering revenue and expense synergies from the acquisition. Karen will go into more detail shortly. The Sterling acquisition provides us an enhanced growth opportunity in one of the most attractive markets in the U.S.","Turning to the economic outlook for each of our key regions. Our Texas Economic Activity Index indicates the state economy is growing, even as the pace of growth eased a bit toward year-end. Our Chief Economist expects the gains in employment and manufacturing activity toward the end of last year will lift the index going forward. Texas is expected to outperform the national economy in 2012, as we believe it did in 2011. ","Strong auto sales at the end of 2011 helped charge the Michigan economy. The rate of job growth for the state is about on par with the national average, and the unemployment rate is set to resume trending downward. More stability in labor markets will, in turn, help to stabilize the state's housing markets. We're certainly pleased by these positive developments in a state where we have a long history of service to our customers through many economic cycles. ","California's economy is showing signs of growth, but key components of economic activity remain soft. We believe the broadest measure of economic activity for the state, payroll job creation, is heading in the right direction and helping to bring California's unemployment rate down gradually. Ongoing job growth through the end of 2011 should help support the state's economy and firm up tax revenues. Silicon Valley continues to hire, and this is a -- more good news for our Technology & Life Sciences customers and the state. ","We're anticipating a slow-growing national economy in 2012. So as you know, we have heightened our focus on profit improvement. We are tracking our revenue-enhancing initiatives, as well as our continued expense management and are on course to deliver the expected results. Karen will provide our 2012 outlook, which incorporates our profit improvement plan. ","I believe we are appropriately positioned for growth in this economic environment. The Sterling acquisition accelerates our growth in Texas and provides us considerable momentum going into 2012. We have the right people, products and services in place to make a positive difference for our customers, employees and shareholders. ","And now, I'll turn the call over to Karen.","Karen L. Parkhill","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5, you will see that we ended the year with total loans at $42.7 billion, an increase of 4% or $1.5 billion quarter-over-quarter, with increases noted in almost every line of business, as well as across our growth markets of Texas and California. Commercial loans drove the increase, up $1.9 billion or 8% quarter-over-quarter, driven in large part by National Dealer Services, Mortgage Banker Finance, Energy Lending, Technology Life Sciences and Global Corporate Banking. ","In our National Dealer Services business, the auto industry began to return to more normal industry levels as expected, which helped drive outsized quarter-over-quarter growth. However, even if you strip away the growth in our National Dealer business, you can see on the right-hand chart that the rest of our Commercial loan portfolio still grew about 6%, again driven by broad-based increases across our businesses.","While not depicted on this slide, I would like to comment on our Mortgage Banker business. We had over $500 million quarter-over-quarter growth in our period-end loans in that business, driven by the continuation of low mortgage rates, industry-wide volume constraint and recent market share gains. We believe our balances in that business could be variable in the future, as mortgage rates stabilize and refinancing becomes a smaller component of the overall volume.","As you know, we track our loan growth against the industry. And as you can see on Slide 6, our loan growth has been roughly in line with the industry over most of the last 5 quarters. In the third quarter, we obviously benefited from the Sterling acquisition. But if you remove the impact of Sterling, as we have done with the dotted line on this chart, you can see our loans grew less than the industry in the third quarter, mainly due to the Japanese supply chain disruption in our auto dealer lending business. In the fourth quarter, however, loan growth outpaced the industry. We believe that our concentration in C&I lending helped this growth as you can see in the chart on the right.","Turning to Slide 7. Perhaps a good sign for the overall economy, our line utilization was up over 2 percentage points from 45.5% to 47.6%, the largest increase we've had in the last 2 years. That utilization rate increased even as our commitments, the denominator in the equation, increased 4% to $46.9 billion, a level we have not seen since the third quarter of 2009. In line with the growth in outstandings, increased commitments were noted in almost every line of business, and our loan pipeline remains strong, which is encouraging given the volume of closings we had in the fourth quarter.","As shown on Slide 8, our deposits continue to grow in the fourth quarter across all major markets and most lines of business. In fact, at $47.8 billion, we reached a record level. Our average deposits increased $2.7 billion quarter-over-quarter, due, in large part, to one additional month of Sterling. Of the increase, $1.7 billion came from noninterest-bearing deposits and $1 billion from interest-bearing deposits. Just as a reminder, at 40%, we have the highest percentage of noninterest-bearing to total deposits among our peers, based on last quarter's data. We believe this reflects our strong relationship banking focus. On a period-end basis, our deposits increased $303 million or 1%, with noninterest-bearing deposits increasing 3%. Interest-bearing deposits declined on a period-end basis, which is mainly a reflection of our prudent approach to deposit pricing.","Turning to net interest income on Slide 9, we had a 5% or $21 million quarter-over-quarter increase, primarily driven by $2.4 billion increase in our average earning assets. To give you a sense of the breakdown, loan growth contributed about $13 million to net interest income, our larger securities portfolio added about $12 million and a decrease in our deposit costs added about $3 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the accretion of the purchase discount on the Sterling portfolio and the impact of reinvesting the prepayments in our mortgage-backed portfolio at slightly lower yields. Just as a reminder, our strategy with the MBS portfolio is to maintain a shorter-duration, highly liquid, lower-risk portfolio. Currently, the average yield on the portfolio is 2.74% with a duration of 2.7 years. ","Loan yields were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter, reflecting lower prepayment fees and a slightly lower contribution from accreting -- accretion on the Sterling portfolio. We have not seen any material loan spread compression over the last several quarters. However, we are seeing increased competition for customers as liquidity in the banking system continues to increase. ","As mentioned before, our balance sheet remains well positioned for rising rates. Approximately 80% of our loans are floating rate, and 70% of that is LIBOR based, predominantly 30-day LIBOR. We believe a 200 basis point annual increase in rates, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, will result in approximately $150 million increase in net interest income.","Turning to the credit picture on Slide 10, our metrics continued to improve. Net charge-offs decreased $17 million to $60 million in the quarter. While our gross charge-offs modestly improved in the fourth quarter, our recoveries were significantly better. Over the last 8 quarters, recoveries have averaged about $20 million per quarter, substantially higher than the $7 million average per quarter over the 2 years prior to that. These results support our prudent approach to charge-offs. That being said, the timing and size of recoveries is the most difficult credit metric to forecast.","Our watch list in nonperforming loans also continued to trend downward after a slight uptick in the third quarter, reflecting the addition of the Sterling portfolio. Watch list loans decreased over $500 million to $4.5 billion at December 31. Nonperforming loans decreased $71 million. As a result of the overall continued improvement in credit quality, our provision for loan losses declined to $19 million. We ended  the quarter with a reserve ratio of 1.7%.","On Slide 11. Our expenses remained well controlled and, on a normal run-rate basis, were essentially stable. Over the last 5 quarters, you can see our expenses without restructuring charges increasing 1%, even as we increased our workforce by just over 4% due to the Sterling acquisition. It's important to note that our workforce, excluding legacy Sterling employees, decreased 1%. Our noninterest expenses totaled $478 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $18 million, reflecting increases from one additional month of Sterling, severance costs and restructuring costs as shown on the slide.","Turning to capital on Slide 12. As you know, our capital position remains strong, with 10.35% Tier 1 capital. Importantly, the quality of our capital ranks among the best in our peer group, with common stock comprising over 99% of our Tier 1. When we began our share repurchase program last year, we announced a target total payout ratio of up to 50%. We were pleased to end the year close to that target at 47% through dividend payments and over $4 million in shares repurchased. Throughout the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares. ","As Ralph mentioned, we submitted our stress test and capital plan to our regulators earlier this month and expect to receive a response in mid-March. While it is too early to comment on the plan, we continue to believe we are approaching the plan from a position of strength. And finally, as announced in December, we have approval to continue our current capital distribution program, targeting a total payout ratio of up to 50% through the first quarter of this year.","Turning to Slide 13. We are proud to say we completed the systems integration of Sterling in mid-November. With the conversion of over 200 systems and 49 banking centers, our legacy Sterling customers can now transact business across the Comerica network. Although the integration is behind us, we remain focused on delivering synergies we told you about at the time of the acquisition. ","To reiterate, on the revenue side, we are expecting approximately $200 million in loan growth and $4 million in noninterest income growth from Sterling in 2012. On the expense side, I am proud to say we have now reached the full 35% synergies that we originally expected to achieve in 2012, mainly due to lower-than-anticipated FDIC expense and our well executed integration, enabling a reduction in staffing ahead of schedule.","Finally, as you will recall, we announced merger and restructuring charges of $125 million at the time of the acquisition. We spent $75 million of this amount in 2011 and now expect to spend approximately $40 million of this in 2012, reflecting an improvement of approximately $10 million from our original forecast. The bulk of the remaining charge should be incurred in the second half of 2012 when we expect to complete the acquisition of our real estate integration plan. The benefit of those additional savings are built into our expense outlook that I will share on the next slide. The transaction is still expected to break even to Comerica's earnings in 2012, excluding merger and integration cost, and being increasingly accretive thereafter. ","Finally, our outlook. As you can see, we are modifying the format of the guidance we provide. We have spent the last few months speaking with analysts and investors, basically gathering your feedback on the type of guidance that is most helpful. We greatly appreciate that feedback and, based on this, have decided that we will provide directional indicators each year, along with good color behind it and quarterly updates as needed, for key income statement and balance sheet line items that drive our performance. ","Hopefully, you will recall our profit improvement initiative that began this past fall. In order to offset the effects of a continued low-rate environment, impacts from new regulation and increases in certain expenses, we identified over 250 initiatives to help ensure we continue to deliver a growing bottom line. We shared with you some of those examples, as well as the fact that we were driving for over $100 million in some revenue enhancements and mostly expense efficiencies, to more than offset the headwinds coming our way. That profit improvement is built into our year-over-year outlook on this slide.","We expect average loans to increase moderately, which we would define as 2% to 5%. Our pipeline remains strong, and we are monitoring, tracking and incenting our teams around loan growth. As we grow our C&I book, we expect our Commercial Real Estate balances to continue to decrease but at a slower pace. Obviously, our average balances are aided by the impact of our Sterling acquisition, but we still expect to see good legacy growth against the backdrop of a slow economy. Finally, as mentioned earlier, we could see variability in our Mortgage Banker business throughout the year, with balances potentially moderating in the future if interest rates stabilize and refinancing volume decreases.","We expect net interest income to also increase moderately. Because Sterling impacted only 5 months in 2011, we will realize the full-year benefit in 2012. We expect continued loan growth while keeping our deposit cost as low as possible. Finally, as far as the accretion of the Sterling -- of the loan discount on the Sterling acquisition, we expect it to be stable year-over-year but realized at an increasingly slower pace, over 4 quarters in 2012 as opposed to 2 quarters in 2011. ","With respect to credit, we expect net charge-offs to decline, albeit at a slower pace as we approach normal historical levels, and our provision to remain relatively stable. This is in line with our view that we should continue to see positive credit migration, offset by moderate loan growth, which, combined, is expected to result in a modest reserve release.","We expect noninterest income to be relatively stable despite regulatory headwind. A full year of Sterling, its revenue synergies and the positive impact of our profit improvement plan are expected to be offset by a full year of lower interchange fees and our assumption of no further significant securities gains. ","Finally, we expect noninterest expenses to also be relatively stable, reflecting inflation, higher pension and healthcare cost, as well as 7 additional months of Sterling expenses, offset by lower merger and restructuring charges and our profit improvement plan. Our rule of thumb for the tax rate remains unchanged at 36% of pretax income, less approximately $65 million in tax benefit. ","In closing, we are ready and excited for the year ahead. While headwinds exist, we feel confident that we can continue to deliver strong bottom line growth to our shareholders. ","With that, we are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Not to try and put you on the spot a little bit, but in terms of your guidance, when you guys used the word moderately, I mean, how should we be thinking about that? Is it sort of low single digit, high single digit? Any context would be helpful.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Ken, as we said, we define moderate to be between 2% and 5%.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I probably missed that then. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just the other question I had on margin. Obviously, this quarter held up reasonably much better than what we had expected, I think also better than, I guess, the 3.15% that was guided for. Where were you guys surprised, like what was the driver too that actually caused margin to be better than expected?","Karen L. Parkhill","Obviously, our margin was aided by our loan growth and our decreased deposit cost, but we also saw slightly higher accretion benefit than we anticipated in our margin.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to start, so you had good loan growth in the quarter. Most of it was dealer finance and mortgage warehouse and loans in the largest segment, Middle Market, were flat again. Could you give us some color on what you're seeing and hearing from your Mid Market customers? And is this an area that you're expecting to see growth in 2012?","Ralph W. Babb","Yes. Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, Steven. A couple -- I guess a couple of questions in there. Maybe I'll answer the second per what we're hearing from our customers. I think they're cautiously optimistic. They've obviously delevered the liquidity. They've built up borrowing capacity and making limited investments, we think, and they're very well positioned for a growth kind of cycle, hopefully ahead, which they can benefit in. The first part of your question though, talking about Middle Markets. It's important to understand that our Middle Market designated group is companies with $2,500 million in revenues, but that excludes all of the companies that really fall in our industry-focused groups, which is very significant. So whether it\u2019s Mortgage Banking Finance, Technology and Life Sciences, Entertainment, those are dominated by Middle Market companies also. So what I\u2019d say, Steven, is a good proxy for our overall kind of Middle Market growth would be to look at our Commercial loan growth overall for the quarter, which was 8%. So it's a good healthy growth rate, and we feel good about that momentum into '12.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just a follow-up question on the margin. I know it was tough to get the guidance right in 2012, given the deposit inflows. With it stabilizing, is it your view that you could at least hold the margin relatively steady here? I'm not sure what these comments on the accretion benefit helping, that, that implies they're going away next quarter. Just wonder what you're thinking on margin stability here.","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. As you know, Steven, we're going to focus on giving guidance on net interest income as opposed to margin, because net interest income is what truly drives earnings, and margin is clearly just a calculation of the results. So as we focus on net interest income, we do expect net interest income to benefit, obviously, from continued loan growth. And on the accretion side, we do expect it to be stable year-over-year, but realized over 4 quarters in 2012 as opposed to 2 quarters in 2011. So it will be realized at a declining pace. Hopefully, that answers your question.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Karen, what was the accretion benefit this quarter?","Karen L. Parkhill","We had $26 million in accretion benefit this quarter as opposed to $27 million last quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Sterne Agee.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask a question on -- basically, the past few quarters you've been noting increased competition but no real impact on the loan spreads. And so was just curious to hear any color around if that's something that you expect to occur in the next few quarters is compressing loan spreads on the loan portfolio.","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Okay. Yes, Brett. First of all, we expect that our loan spreads will materially hold as we head into '12. The part of your question regarding kind of pricing and spread compression, we're continuing to see compression at the larger end of -- or competition, excuse me, most intensive at the larger end of the market. But it's competitive throughout the marketplace. I'll tell you though, what we're focused on doing is we've got our bankers out in the marketplace more than ever, spending time with our customers, prospects, building relationships. And I think if you do that in today's environment, you can get paid for your value, and we're seeing that in our loan spreads really holding. Personally, I'm seeing that our customers value our type of relationship more than ever in this industry. So I think we're well positioned to hold our loan spreads.","Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, I know you're not going to talk specifically about the margin. But wanted to ask the liquidity that you have on the balance sheet, either average or end-of-period, is that a number that can decline from here? Or is that essentially kind of how you view liquidity level as a necessary run rate?","Karen L. Parkhill","So on liquidity, obviously, as we grow loans, we expect our liquidity on the balance sheet to decrease. So hopefully, that will be the case.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets.","Kevin Barker - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Sorry, this is Kevin Barker for Bob Ramsey. I'm sorry about that. If you were looking at your forward guidance, if there is one thing where you would see that -- you're saying you're relatively stable on noninterest expense. Is that something where you could see more merger synergies or you could see more expense saves that maybe increase the margin? How do you look at that going through the next 4 quarters?","Karen L. Parkhill","As we look at noninterest expense, obviously, it will be -- we'll have 7 additional months of Sterling, as we talked about, year-over-year. We also expect higher pension and healthcare costs next year, amounting to about $40 million. We'll offset that by lower restructuring charges of about $35 million, and we'll have the profit improvement plan. And that's how we get to relatively stable on the expense side.","Kevin Barker - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Is there anything you could do that would accelerate that or possibly even make that -- even have more synergies? Or is there -- I'm just saying, could you beat that, or do you see that as very conservative guidance on the expense side?","Karen L. Parkhill","We are always focused on monitoring our expenses. We've got lots of headwinds coming our way, and we're focused on offsetting those headwinds, as we talked about. As it relates to the Sterling benefit, we did say that we have received the 35% synergies that we anticipated in 2011. That said, we do have -- we will see some benefit as we focus on our final real estate integration towards the end of 2012, but we have built that into our outlook.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is actually on the provision. We appreciate the 2012 guidance. But as we're sort of the looking out to '13 and '14, could you give us a sense of what guidepost we could look at in terms of where -- how do we measure the bottom in the provision in terms of reserve release? Do you look at it as a percentage of charge-offs, of the loan portfolio?","Ralph W. Babb","John?","John M. Killian","Yes. The main drivers on both reserves and provision, frankly, be -- would be net charge-offs, the continued improvement in our watch list and, frankly, loan growth. As you know, it's not as simple as just having a target for the reserve level as a percentage of the portfolio. We have a very rigorous methodology, which we've been using for about 10 years. That includes reviewing every sizable problem loan every quarter. The methodology has served us well in all of our cycles. Our average carrying value of nonaccrual loans is 60%. And our $726 million reserve on the ALLL is 3x our annualized fourth quarter net charge-off run rate. So we feel we are well reserved. Going forward, now the reserve level will vary as charge-offs and problem loans decline. As our loan growth increases, that will also increase the reserve level that's required.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What are you reserving for new commercial growth? What are you putting away for new commercial growth?","John M. Killian","Well, that's statistically driven by our standard loss factors, which is consistent with our methodology. So that will vary, depending upon the assigned risk rating. So it's hard to generalize about that.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. If I could just have one more question, please. Karen, I noticed that your average securities balances on the AFS portfolio was up $1.6 billion quarter-over-quarter. Could you give us a sense of what you were adding to the portfolio in terms of type and duration? And also, could you give us a sense of as you model out 2012, how sticky you believe the deposit growth is going to be?","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure. I'll tackle the first question, first. Our securities portfolio did increase in the quarter, and hopefully, you\u2019ll remember, at the end of last quarter, we talked about putting more of our excess liquidity into mortgage-backed securities with a target portfolio of around $9 billion. You see the benefit of that in this quarter. That's what's happening. In terms of average yields and duration of that mortgage-backed portfolio, it's about 2.74% in yield and 2.7% in duration. It is a portfolio that we are continually focused on maintaining high liquidity, strong credit rating, et cetera, on it. I'm sorry, Erika, remind me of your second question.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As you look out into 2012, how sticky do you think the deposit inflows that you received in 2011 will be?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. The good news about our deposits is that they're driven by full relationships. And so because they're driven by full relationships and we have all of the banking business with our customers, those deposits are obviously used to help offset the fees around that banking business. So they are more sticky than many other types of deposits. So we feel good about the stickiness.","Ralph W. Babb","I think, too, and Lars, may want to comment on this, what we're seeing with our customers today is much more liquidity from their standpoint, and therefore, they're maintaining higher deposit levels.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. I think, Ralph, to that point, if you look at the fourth quarter, we obviously had very broad-based growth across a lot of our businesses, a lot of our growth markets. And yet, even with $1.9 billion Commercial loan growth, we also hit record deposit levels, which tells me that our customers seem to be carrying more liquidity possibly a more conservative stance or positioning themselves for growth in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Bryan -- this is actually Bryan from Ken's team. I was wondering if you could comment on your loan growth guidance. The 2% to 5% average growth for the full year seems kind of conservative, given that loans are starting much higher on a period-end basis at the end of the fourth quarter. Could you just comment on some of the moving parts there, and specifically, what the delta from Mortgage Banker Finance could be if rates normalize?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, okay. Let me first just tackle the Mortgage Banking piece of it and then the guidance piece of it overall. Mortgage banking is obviously an industry that we've been in a long time. We're very well positioned, and we picked up market share. But if you look at the fourth quarter volume and growth that we had, 75% of that volume, Bryan, was refis. So to the extent, I think, that underlying mortgage rates continue to change and move, they hit a 30-year record, I think, low as of yesterday. That clearly has an impact and, of course, drives variability in that particular business line. And of course, we have some other business lines with variability. To the point about the guidance for 2012, obviously, we're coming off of a very healthy fourth quarter growth, very broad based, but that's against a slow growth economic environment. And the impact of some of the -- our more variable businesses, as well as a continued expected decline in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio, albeit at a slower rate, is all factored in.","Ralph W. Babb","Lars, you might want to comment a little bit on the pipelines.","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. Just speaking of the pipelines, and again, I guess from a -- the sense of optimism that I do have though as we look at 2012. First of all, as we pointed out, our commitment levels are up. Usage levels are up over 2%, which is pretty significant in this business. Commitments to commit are stable and strong. And in fact, we're seeing a very good pipelines. Over 50% of the pipeline is new business, new customers for Comerica.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one follow-up. Does the noninterest expense guidance of relatively stable include merger and integration charges, or should we be looking at that more on a core basis x the merger and integration charges?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes, it does include merger and integration charges.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with DA Davidson.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a few questions. In terms of the severance expense in fourth quarter, what was the actual dollars of severance?","Karen L. Parkhill","Total severance and related expenses were up $5 million. $7 million was the total.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I know you're not providing specific margin guidance going forward. But just on a kind of looking back in the fourth quarter, could you give us an idea where the margin was for December?","Karen L. Parkhill","For the quarter, obviously, it was at 3.19%. We did see it improve a little bit more in December. We had the benefit of LIBOR increasing a little bit more in December than it had in October and November.","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question, if I can. Obviously, you are continuing -- or you've said that you are continuing your stock buyback plan in the first quarter. Could you give us just an idea? I know your target payout is 50%, but maybe just give us an idea of kind of where your bias lies between buyback and dividend as you look out through 2012.","Karen L. Parkhill","So we are obviously focused on total payout to our shareholders. When we think about the mix between dividends and share repurchase, we like a steady dividend that can grow slowly with us over time. We are more biased towards share repurchase, because it is something that enables flexibility. And particularly in this environment, when we're able to buy back our stock at lower than book value, it's very attractive.","Ralph W. Babb","I would underline that, as Karen said, we have a balanced approach to the dividend as well.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just one really quick follow-up question. Karen, on the accretion coming from the Sterling deal, you said it was $26 million this quarter, $27 million last quarter. Do you have a breakout of how much of that was accelerated accretable yield from payments coming in faster than expected?","Karen L. Parkhill","I don't have that, but I would say it was in the mid single-digit area.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And a question for Lars. You went into a lot of different details and good granularity. I guess I was wondering, you mentioned that 50% of the pipeline is new business from new customers. Did you see anything -- and the fourth quarter was so strong in Commercial growth. Was there any activity you saw from your Commercial customers trying to take advantage of the Obama stimulus plan of trying to put something into production before the end of the year to take advantage of that -- the tax deduction?","Lars C. Anderson","That issue has come up iron hot [ph]. I've heard it talked about in the industry. We have not seen that as a material driver. And I think evidence of that is you look at really the broad-based growth across a number of business lines, it's just not a -- was not a material event for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Reynolds with Wunderlich Securities.","Kevin B. Reynolds - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Actually, my questions have all been asked and answered at this point. So great quarter, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Hurwich with Ulysses.","Adam G. Hurwich - Ulysses Management LLC","Just a follow-up, most of my questions have been asked as well. But on the Sterling acquisition, if we were to think about the return, given your outlook for the profitability of that franchise, do you have any sense as to what your incremental ROE on that -- on their capital base would look like?","Karen L. Parkhill","No. We haven't looked at it that way. We are pleased with the performance of Sterling and pleased with our ability to integrate. So I would -- we're happy with where we are, but we honestly haven't looked at the Sterling the way you talked about it.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","In the past, you've mentioned commitments to commit, and I think they were $1.9 billion at the end of the third quarter. Obviously, this was a strong quarter for bookings. But can you provide that number? And I'm sorry if I missed it.","Ralph W. Babb","Okay. Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. I think this is really good news, because coming off of, obviously, one of our strongest quarters in a very long time, the commitment to commit has remained stable, absolutely stable.","Michael Rose - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So at about $1.9 billion?","Lars C. Anderson","That's correct. That's correct, Michael.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the margin in your press release. It shows the margin's down 33 basis points in Texas, down 14 basis points in the west, down 5 basis points in Florida, but on an aggregate basis, it's kind of flat. And just what's the simple explanation for that?","Karen L. Parkhill","Yes. Obviously, our regions and our businesses are impacted by how we FTP our businesses. But the simple answer is that we benefited from the increase in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio at the top of the house.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then separately, the commercial loan growth, I guess it's 32% annualized. And per your guidance, you're not expecting that sort of pace in 2012. But I was wondering, how much of that is for Shared National Credit? If I'm reading the page, Slide 19 of your presentation, if you could just turn to that, it looks like most of the growth is Specialty Businesses, and I'm just assuming that's more Shared National Credit or national lending.","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Well, first of all, maybe looking at the fourth quarter to give some indication. 28% of our [indiscernible] growth in the fourth quarter was Shared National Credits. 80% of that was energy, and that would be consistent with our strategy for our Energy business, which is very focused on large, high-quality energy companies. So frankly, outside of that, the majority of it was not Shared National Credit. I'd underscore also, for us for our Shared National Credit kind of strategy, we underwrite every single credit like we would any other non-SNC credit. It's held to the same stable credit underwriting policies, and it's held to the same relationship pricing model and pricing governance strategy. So -- and for us, our Shared National Credit relationships, which we continue to make a lot of progress on in terms of cross-sell, continue to improve in profitability for our company. The outlook, obviously, is moderate growth for 2012, to the other part of your question. And frankly, we're just continuing to stay very focused on our businesses and executing on those strategies. And to the extent that some, such as Energy, may leverage for risk management purposes, the Shared National Credit syndicated our credit capability, that would just kind of come along with it. But we're going to stay very focused on our strategy.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","The rest of the increase in Specialty Businesses is due to what? Again, Slide 19. I'm just trying to understand that one line.","Karen L. Parkhill","Energy was a big driver of the increase.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. So Energy is most of that or?","Karen L. Parkhill","Let's say it's Energy and other of our industry businesses, including Technology & Life Sciences, Entertainment, et cetera.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So of the $1.4 billion increase in the Business Bank loans, how much of that was due to syndicated loans?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes, in the fourth quarter, it's 28%. Great. And remember, 80% of that was Energy.","Ralph W. Babb","Right.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","All right. And the rest of the Specialty Businesses, the growth there -- I'm just -- I just want to complete my list. I want to give 2 other items. What would I include?","Karen L. Parkhill","The others wouldn't be as focused on syndicated credits, if that's what you're trying to get to.","Ralph W. Babb","Right. You may have some growth in U.S. banking, which we had. Global Corporate would leverage that. There's a little bit more activity in national Commercial Real Estate, which is REIT-oriented financing. But that would be -- Energy would be the key driver.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And also, why did loan utilization go up? It's been flat at most of the other big banks or almost all of them. Whereas in your case, it seems like demand has picked up. Any reason why you might be a little bit different than some peers?","Ralph W. Babb","We're -- we just continue to focus on our customers, and they had good activity and growth. And we've been growing with them.","Lars C. Anderson","As well as the commitments in total, we're up. And from a small business and Middle Market standpoint, Texas saw good growth.","Ralph W. Babb","That's right. In fact, small business saw a very nice funding to new customers in the fourth quarter, and commitment levels were even up for small business.","John M. Killian","And Mike, if I may add a question from a risk management standpoint on the SNCs. For the last several years, our SNC portfolio has performed, really, the same way that our portfolio has overall. It's basically been a mirror. But interestingly enough, in the last couple of quarters, it has performed even better than our total portfolio, from a credit risk standpoint.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","All right, that's helpful. I'm sorry, one last question. If I can just go back to my first question that I thought you said the yield on the MBS that you purchased, I might have heard this wrong, was 2.74%.","Ralph W. Babb","Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","That is the yield on the overall portfolio, Mike. The yields that we are purchasing today are a little bit less than that, as you can imagine in the market.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So I'm just looking at your yield on assets. Your yield on earning assets is close to 3.5% for the year, at least. I was just wondering, so how did that provide the boost to the margin? Was there anything else that helped the margin?","Karen L. Parkhill","No. The impact to the margin from the securities portfolio was the fact that we increased the amount in our securities portfolio to a target of about $9 billion. We did that at the end of last quarter, and you see the benefit of it this quarter. The real driver though is the fact that we had loan growth and we're maintaining our spreads in our loans, and we are continuing to focus on our cost of deposits and taking that down where we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello with UBS Securities.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions for you. First up, just given the positive trends that you're seeing in terms of loan utilization rates and commitments to commit and whatnot. Just kind of looking to get some color as to how much of a turning point maybe we've reached here in terms of demand. Do you feel some of these situations were more kind of situational or one-offs, or do you really feel there's been a shift in terms of kind of customer demand out there?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","No. I really can't. I wouldn't identify it as a onetime event, because again, if you look at where we got the growth, while it was clearly we had good quarter in Mortgage Banking Finance and Dealer and Energy, we had nice growth in Technology & Life Sciences and as well as our Global Corporate Banking, driven by international, Environmental Services, Entertainment, it was very, very broad based. So no, we feel very good about the momentum as we look forward to 2012. But we're reminded that the backdrop is, for 2012, a slow kind of economic environment, and we do have, of course, some businesses with variability in outstandings, as we've talked about.","Ralph W. Babb","I think as you said earlier, I would point out that our customers are making good money. They're well positioned. They have a very liquid balance sheet compared to several years ago, and they're beginning, as you mentioned, with that, I'll call it, cautious optimism that you pointed out, to step forward, even though there's still a concern about the slow-growing economy.","Lars C. Anderson","That's right.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That sounds good, and that's great color. And then just my last question is, just in terms of kind of the upcoming CCAR and process and whatnot. When we ran our stress test, you guys come out as one of the best positioned banks in terms of excess capital, and I know you've guided towards this 50% earnings payout level. But why not pay out more with your stock at these levels and just the amount of capital strength that you have? Why is 50% a ceiling? And could you increase that?","Ralph W. Babb","Let me reiterate what Karen said earlier. The 50% is in the first quarter, that we expect to continue to be at the 50% level. We expect to hear back on our plan on mid-March, and then we'll discuss what our ongoing level will be.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","Raul Gamez Dugas","This is Raul on behalf of John. Most of my questions have already been answered. Small question on the -- follow-up question on the buybacks. Could you give us a color around just the timing or the pace of buybacks that you would expect in 2012? And also, are there opportunities in terms of capital deployment in 2012?","Karen L. Parkhill","Until we hear back from the Federal Reserve on our capital plan submission, it will be very difficult for us to talk about any pace of buyback. That said, we are focused on 50% for the first quarter. So combined with our dividend, we should be on pace to focus on that payout for the first quarter. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful.","Ralph W. Babb","And we would focus quarter-by-quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jeff Davis with Guggenheim partners.","Jeff K. Davis - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I know the portfolio is small and it\u2019s contracted. But could you comment on what you're seeing in Commercial Real Estate values in Florida?","Ralph W. Babb","John?","John M. Killian","The real estate portfolio in Florida that we have is down to a couple of hundred million dollars, Jeff. And what we're seeing there, basically, is some slight declines still in that portfolio. I'm not concerned about it given the fact that we've come through the recession in pretty good shape dealing with that portfolio, but I still think it's going to be a while before Florida has anything near a normal real estate market.","Jeff K. Davis - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Would it be fair to say, though, 2012 is a stabilization year for it then?","John M. Killian","It almost -- to answer that question properly, Jeff, you almost have to look at it product by product. Let's say, on multifamily, the answer to your question would be yes. On retail, on office, for example, I don't think stabilization is here yet.","Jeff K. Davis - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you may have said it, and I just missed it, in terms of maybe Mike's question on the Energy book. Did much of the Energy growth come from European banks pulling out of syndicated deals and someone else stepping up to the plate?","Ralph W. Babb","Lars?","Lars C. Anderson","Yes. We have not seen maybe some of that volume of European banks exiting that some others talk about. We're very -- we have seen some opportunities come along in Energy and in other -- the broader corporate market, and we have selectively looked at them. But the reality of it is they really have to fit within kind of our footprint, within our industry focus. They need to individually underwrite. We're not just -- we wouldn't consider just purchasing a position, and frankly, they've got to really hit our relationship pricing model. We've got to have an opportunity to add value to the company and for us to get compensated for it.","Jeff K. Davis - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question. And I know the portfolio is even much  smaller than Florida. But any comment on what you're seeing in real -- commercial real estate values in Arizona, in the Phoenix market?","Ralph W. Babb","John?","John M. Killian","Yes. It would be almost a reiteration of what I just said in Florida, Jeff. It's a very similar situation. Single family there is still struggling. Multifamily in the right location, location, location, is stabilized. But everything else is still struggling to some extent, and probably, we'll see a bit of a decline even in 2012.","Operator","Final question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","My question was on the provision expense. I mean, guidance being relatively stable year-over-year, 2011 was about $153 million. If I divide that by 4, I get a quarterly run rate of $38 million, which is essentially double what it was in fourth quarter. So am I to assume that the provision expense is going to double off at the level we saw in fourth quarter going forward?","Ralph W. Babb","John?","John M. Killian","I think of this in terms of the annual run rate on the provision, and from $153 million, it actually leads us to the relatively stable guidance that we offered. Fourth quarter was a little unusual in that recoveries were abnormally high that quarter, which is good news, but it did result in the provision being a little bit lower.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So again, the $153 million is the run rate for next year is what you're looking at.","John M. Killian","Our guidance is relatively stable off of $153 million actual in 2011.","Operator","We'll now turn the call over to Ralph Babb for any closing remarks.","Ralph W. Babb","I would just like to thank you all for joining us on the call today and your continued interest in Comerica. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating, and you may now disconnect."]}}
