My name is LaShanta and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation Q4 2016 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Francis Idehen. Please go ahead, sir.","Francis Idehen","Thank you, LaShanta. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.","Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in the earnings release, today's material, comments made during this call and in the risk factors section of the 2014 10-K and the third-quarter 10-Q. Please refer to today's 8-K and the 10-K and the 10-Q and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast and expectations.","Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We've scheduled 45 minutes for today's call.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Chris Crane","Thanks, Francis, and good morning to everybody. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. Before I go into the results I want to take a moment to thank our crews who worked hard to restore power for our customers in Baltimore and Philadelphia affected by the January storms.","BGE and PECO were able to restore approximately 22,000 customers throughout the weather event, keeping the average restoration times to less than three hour, which is a remarkable accomplishment given the challenges associated with traveling and the working conditions as the storm intensified.","I'll start off by reiterating our strategy and our capital allocation philosophy. The balance sheet strength is a priority that guides every strategic decision. It allows us to deliver stable growth, sustainable earnings and an attractive dividend for our shareholders.","Our strategy for delivering these objectives is to harvest free cash flow from the Genco, to invest primarily in the utilities for the benefit of our customers, invest in long-term contracted assets, which meet our return requirements and return capital to the shareholders.","Consistent with this capital allocation policy, we're announcing today an evolution in our dividend policy. Our board has approved a policy to raise our dividend by 2.5% each year for the next three years beginning with the June 2016 dividend. The dividend increase shows our commitment to provide an attractive total return proposition for our shareholders and reflects the shift in focus towards our regulated utility and long-term contract businesses.","Our balance sheet and our cash flow profile support the shift in the dividend policy and maintain a high credit quality and investment grade rating remains a top priority. We continue to de-risk the Company by growing our regulated business. This has allowed us to generate earnings with a lower risk profile. We remain as focused as ever on careful disciplined use of capital.","Let's turn now to 2015 results in each of our businesses and our goals for 2016. Despite a difficult year in the markets we delivered earnings of $2.49 a share in 2015 demonstrating once again our ability to run businesses well and manage through even the most challenging environments.","At our utilities, 2015 was a record year for us in many respects and growing regulated business continues to thrive. We achieved a major earnings milestone: our utilities earned over $1 billion in net income, delivering the highest utility earnings on record. We invested nearly $3.7 billion in needed improvements for our customers across the utilities including the AMI and the grid modernization investments, significant gas and electric infrastructure and innovative technology and customer-oriented systems. Our track record for reliability and customer service has allowed us to earn solid returns. Our utility earnings on aggregate across Exelon is at 9.5% in 2015. Our returns reflect the constructive regulatory relationship in our territories.","PECO received a unanimous approval for both its $127 million rate case settlement and a $275 million long-term infrastructure improvement plan. BGE received approval for recovery of more than $200 million of energy efficiency and gas infrastructure replacement investments. And at ComEd, we achieved our fourth consecutive year of constructive outcomes in our formula rate filing. This year we filed a rate reduction at ComEd, showing our ability to contain cost and limit the impact of capital investments on our customers' bill even during the current Smart Grid investment cycle. The utilities continue to drive high operational performance and that performance is getting better each year.","Of the 26 metrics we track, 21 of them were best or second-best ever in 2015 including reliability and customer satisfaction. As for our goals in the utility business in 2016, our first primary goal is closing the PHI transaction at which point we will begin the important job of integrating PHI into the Exelon family of utilities.","We will bring our management model to PHI Utilities in order to improve the experience of the customers in the region. We will work diligently to develop and implement an effective regulatory strategy for PHI. We will invest approximately $4 billion in our existing utilities to refurbish and modernize the grid to improve service for our customers. That is part of the $18 billion we will invest in our existing utilities over the next five years.","We will work to maintain first quartile operational and customer satisfaction numbers while continuing to focus on productivity and cost management. Finally, we expect a decision in our November 2015 BGE rate case in June and we'll file our annual formula rate update at ComEd in April. By executing on these goals, we will deliver one of the most compelling utility earnings growth stories.","Our generation business had a solid year. Operationally in 2015, Constellation performed well even in the face of weak markets. Nuclear capacity factor was 93.7%. Refueling outage performance was very strong. Average refueling outage duration was 22 days. That's the lowest average since 2002. Our gas and hydro plants outperformed the dispatch match targets. Our solar and wind assets did the same for the energy capture targets. Our power business went 15 months without an employee OSHA recordable incident. It's the best safety performance ever. ","At Constellation, our generation to load matching strategy contributed meaningfully to the earnings. Our load serving business experienced growth in both power and gas. In 2015, we served 195 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, materially growing that platform from 155 terawatt hours the prior year. We continue to have high customer win and renewal rates. We are now a top 10 marketer of natural gas and it has significantly increased our delivery of retail gas to 720 Bcf last year.","In 2016, at Exelon Generation, we will continue to operate world-class fleet of assets at the highest level of performance while continuing to execute our strategy of growing the contracted generation business with 350 megawatts of wind projects in development. At Constellation, we will achieve our targets of serving 210 terawatt hours of load across our wholesale and retail base, using our commercial platform as both a risk management vehicle and an earnings driver. Each of our businesses is well-positioned to continue strong performance in 2016 operationally and financially.","We have some important priorities we are targeting in 2016. We will continue our broad advocacy efforts to ensure that our unique class of nuclear assets are properly valued for their clean, safe and reliable attributes. Developments in New York for a clean energy standard are constructive. The leadership of the governor in New York has been very positive, but more work needs to be done and we will engage with key stakeholders in the state. We continue with our specific efforts with legislators and stakeholders in Illinois on the low-carbon portfolio standard. ","We provided ample time to reach the resolution on the nuclear assets, suffering significant losses in the process. If we don't see significant results, we will make the economically rational decision. We continue to engage with MISO on a constructive reform to address the issues in Zone 4. We will work in the states in which we operate to develop compliance plans for the clean power pool. This has been a challenging period for our sector. We are tackling those challenges aggressively. We are reducing our costs by $350 million.","We will continue to shift our business mix to more regulated exposure both organically with our $18 billion capital into our existing utilities over the next five years and through our strategic acquisition of Pepco which will raise that number of capital investment to $25 billion over the next five years. The Company remains on a solid footing and our balance sheet remains strong. And we continue to run the businesses at the highest operational levels.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jack for the financial details.","Jack Thayer","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. As Chris stated, we had a strong year financially and operationally across the Company. For the full year, we delivered earnings of $2.49 per share and $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter. If bonus had not been extended, we would have delivered earnings of $2.58 per share, meaningfully exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. ","The appendix contains details on our fourth-quarter financial results by operating Company on slides 21 and 22. My remarks today will focus on 2016 earnings and O&M guidance, our credit profile, the cost management initiative and an update of our gross margin disclosures.","Turning to slide 6, we expect to deliver 2016 full-year adjusted operating earnings of $2.40 to $2.70 and $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. While we anticipate closing the Pepco holdings deal in the first quarter, our guidance is a standalone figure that assumes the equity and debt issued for the PHI deal is unwound during the year. The impact of the extension of bonus depreciation is included in the guidance. Our growing utilities earnings primarily reflect increased capital investment in distribution and transmission to improve reliability and customer service at ComEd as well as increased rates from PECO's recent distribution rate case, partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to storm and bad debt costs. ","Our strong operating performance at our utilities is fostering a positive regulatory environment in all our jurisdictions and is evident in the transformation and allowed and earned returns that we've achieved at BGE since the Constellation merger. BGE has improved reliability and customer satisfaction in every year as compared to 2012, the year of the merger, which in turn has led to improved regulatory outcomes and earned ROEs over that same period. Last November, BGE filed an electric and gas distribution rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission requesting revenue requirement increases of $121 million and $80 million through its electric and gas distribution rates respectively. ","The requested rates of return on equity in the application are 10.6% for electric distribution and 10.5% for gas distribution. We expect the Maryland PSC to rule on the rate case in the June timeframe with the new rates going into effect shortly after the final order. The revenue requirement increases reflect the continued investment including Smart Grid being made at BGE to improve reliability and customer service. Constellation had a record year in 2015 driven by higher realized margins that benefited from a lower cost to serve our load and strong performance in our portfolio management group. In 2016, we expect a more normalized cost to serve load and portfolio management performance, which we expect will have a negative impact on our earnings relative to an extraordinary 2015. ","Overall, at Exelon Generation the earnings impact from normalized margins and higher decommissioning costs, partially offset by fewer nuclear outages and cost management efforts, results in a forecast decrease in ExGen's earnings range versus last year. Our cost management initiative savings in 2016 should largely offset the impact of inflation at ExGen where labor and wage inflation are significant components of O&M. For reference, more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating Company can be found in the appendix on slides 23 through 26. ","Moving to slide 7, as we've said in the past bonus depreciation has a negative impact on earnings, but a positive impact on cash. In 2016 it creates a rounded $0.09 earnings drag at the consolidated level with a $0.06 impact at Exelon Generation and a $0.03 impact at ComEd. On the cash front it increases cash flow by $625 million in 2016. Despite the negative earnings impact of bonus depreciation in 2016 through 2018 we are affirming the CAGR of 3% to 5% for the enterprise and 7% to 9% for the utilities through 2018 that we disclosed at EEI.","In addition the extension of bonus depreciation will likely have a further effect on Exelon as a whole after the closing of the Pepco holdings deal. Once the merger is completed and we begin the integration of PHI's operating, planning and regulatory functions we will provide an update on PHI's forecast and the resulting accretion impact on Exelon's forecasts. On slide 8, our top financial priority remains maintaining our investment grade credit rating and ensuring the strength of our balance sheet. The five-year extension of bonus depreciation improves the free cash flow position at ExGen, which has a positive impact on our FFO to debt metrics.","ExGen free cash flow over the 2016 to 2018 period is now projected to be $5.35 billion or $3.2 billion after taking into account committed growth capital. Since our EEI disclosure Exelon Generation has commenced developing a further 350 megawatts of long-term contracted wind projects in Michigan and Oklahoma. As you'll note on the slide, given our strong cash flow outlook ExGen has a declining debt to EBITDA ratio starting at 3.2 in 2016 and decreasing to 2.3 times debt to EBITDA by 2018. Bottom line, we're growing durable earnings and shrinking debt. ","Turning to slide 9, I will provide an update on the cost management initiative that we announced towards the end of last year. We recently finalized the savings initiatives in January and have incorporated them in our current long-range plan. As we mentioned at EEI, the total identified savings are in the $350 million range with savings split equally between Exelon Generation and our corporate shared services organization.","$100 million of the savings of the shared services organization will be achieved within our information technology function with the remainder coming from various corporate function such as finance, legal, human resources, and supply. The corporate savings will be allocated roughly equally between Exelon Generation and the utilities. Overall, this means that roughly three-quarters of the total cost savings for the Company will hit the bottom line in Exelon Generation, while the remaining quarter of the savings will be realized at the utilities and ultimately passed on to our customers.","As a result, we expect a run rate earnings benefit from our cost management initiative of $0.13 to $0.18 per share beginning in 2018 with approximately 35% of the run rate savings achieved by the end of this year. Our proven track record of cutting cost and running our business efficiently gives us confidence we will be able to achieve or exceed these savings.","Slide 10 shows our 2016 O&M forecast relative to 2015. We project O&M for 2016 to be flat to 2015 and we expect a slightly negative O&M CAGR across the enterprise over the 2015 to 2018 period and a negative 1% CAGR at Exelon Generation. ExGen's year-over-year decrease is driven by a combination of factors: fewer planned nuclear outages compared to 2015, lower pension cost and the impacts of the cost management initiative. The year-over-year increase at PECO and BGE is due to inflation and budgeting for normal storm and bad debt costs, which results in incremental year-over-year O&M growth.","Slide 11 provides our fourth-quarter gross margin update. This quarter's gross margin update now includes the impact of the Ginna RSSA to 2016 and 2017 total gross margin. As we saw both power prices and heat rates for 2017 increased by the end of the quarter, we reduced our deviation to ratable. For 2017, we ended the quarter with a power position of 5% to 8% behind ratable on a total portfolio basis when considering our cross-commodity hedges. We are even further behind ratable in the Midwest approximately 13% to 16% when considering cross-commodity hedges. We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views on the market.","In 2016 total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. As you know, we're highly hedged in 2016, which combine with the inclusion of the Ginna RSSA allowed us to offset the impacts of lower prices in 2016. During the quarter, we also executed on $50 million of both power new business and non-power new business. Total gross margin increased by $50 million in both 2017 and 2018. The increase in 2017 is partially driven by the Ginna RSSA, which mitigates losses, while the increase in 2018 is driven by higher power prices across most of the regions, most notably in NiHub with around-the-clock prices increasing by $0.64 per megawatt hour.","During the quarter, we also executed on $50 million of non-power new business for both 2017 and 2018. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we will now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. ","Greg Gordon","Thanks, good morning guys. Great presentation. Thank you. A couple of questions. Can you talk in a little bit more detail about what your plan is and what the milestones are for making a decision in Illinois on the uneconomic units? And can you refresh our memory on where we stand in terms of profit and loss on the three units that you had initially a year and a half or two years ago identified as impaired?","Chris Crane","Sure. As you know we were successful and PJM was successful on the capacity market redesigns that gave some upside to the fleet in NiHub. Greatly helped Byron and added help to Quad cities, but since then as you've seen the downturn in the forwards Quad cities continues to be challenged and more neutral on cash flows and earnings, while maintaining the risk of operation. We continue to work on Clinton. Clinton is negative. We have two initiatives underway, one working with MISO on Zone 4 reforms and we'd like the design to be more like the new PJM capacity market design. But that in itself will not save Clinton. As you know there's a lot of work going on in Springfield with the administration and the legislature. And we have had a very strong support from the leadership of the legislature and the administration on coming to a resolution on the energy outlook for Illinois. It's not only the Clean Energy Standard, but there is an environmental jobs, agreeing jobs bill and there's a utility of the future bill that have to be negotiated together. There's been progress made in that dialogue, but it is critical that we have, that we're able to present to the legislature this spring a combined package that ensures the financial viability of our assets as they contribute highly in reliability, in environmental or we will have to make the rational economic decision. It's our job to get the stakeholders together. We're working hard on that and to bring the leadership what is a consensus package that\u2019s good for all of Illinois and its customers. So we're in this spring time in Illinois and we're hopeful that we can have reasonable heads prevail and negotiate a balanced outcome and as I said present that to the leadership so they can provide the continued support.","Greg Gordon","Okay, so Quad because of the further decline in gas prices and power prices since the CPE results has gone back out of the money. So is that a fair summary?","Chris Crane","It is. It is. With these forwards it is. ","Greg Gordon","Okay. And the second question is, so you guys are going to, based on your cash flow slide on page 37 you're going to end the year with a pretty substantial cash balance. And if I look at the cash flow profile you project through 2018 that should continue to grow all things equal. Your debt to EBITDA is going to be sub-3, by my measure you're trading at under 4.5 times EVD to EBITDA on the implied valuation of the nuclear business. That basically implies that the nuclear is a wasting asset write, that with $8.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet that you should be amortizing debt because these plants are going away in 10 years. I mean what can you do to convince investors that this low gas price environment doesn't ultimately drive these assets out of business? Because if they are 20- or 30-year assets and not 10-year assets the stock is undervalued. ","Chris Crane","Yes, first of all there's more than 10 years on these assets. We had license renewal at Braidwood. It goes into the late 2040s. The money producing plants are the larger dual unit sites that will run into the 2040s. That's Byron Braidwood, LaSalle, Limerick, Peach Bottom and they are positioned well in the markets. Peach Bottom is in the 30s I think, but the others are in the 40s. So we've got a long run left on these profitable plants. If the smaller units or the single site units cannot be profitable and we can't get a market design they will be retired and there is an upside based off of that retirement on free cash flow and earnings. We will remove the drag. As Jack described, we're very focused on the debt to EBITDA ratios at the GenCo, and over this period of time we will be reducing over $3 billion of debt at the GenCo and continuing to manage that, matching our assets with our debt. We feel very comfortable where we're at. But it is a misnomer that is out there that these are 10-year assets with a large debt profile on them. Jack, you want to -.","Jack Thayer","No, I think you covered it Chris. I mean the goal is to create that fortress balance sheet to do the right things around our assets and sustain the profitability of the long lived plants. ","Greg Gordon","All right, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers","Hey, good morning guys. If we go look at the dividend increase in the 2.5% a year for the next three years, can you maybe, Chris, share how the Board thought about using capital to raise the dividend considering you already have a pretty healthy yield? And then what was the thought process behind 2.5% a year for those three years? ","Chris Crane","Sure. We had, as we talked back three years ago now when we had to restructure the dividend, we had grown the dividend at Exelon based off of the earnings and cash flow on a very volatile business, the GenCo. We had to make the shift and take the pain at the time to refocus the payout and where that reliable cash flow would come from. We set out at that time after the merger with Constellation, improving the performance for the customers and the reliability of BGE and along with that improving the profitability. ComEd has done a phenomenal job improving reliability, making prudent investments and as our shareholders have seen, as you have seen, the strategic plan we laid out a few years ago is paying off. And it can be seen, it's transparent that by 2018 theoretically the utilities would be covering the dividend. In discussion with shareholders and feedback at the end of the year the certainty and our confidence in the business needed to be fully displayed. In dialogue with the Board, we thought that we can make these increases. We've talked about the free cash flow, we talked about the balance sheet and we're committed to that through 2018. I think it's a positive sign in the right direction that we feel confident in our strategy going forward.","Dan Eggers","Okay, got it. And then on the Pepco deal, I guess you have kind of down to one month of room for the commission to make a decision. I guess A, have you heard anything or is there anything indicative of where the commission could make a decision? And B, if the deal does not get approved how do we think about the full return of the previously raised equity and the debt retirement? ","Chris Crane","So the commission did state that they would take this matter up before our March 4 date. And that's our only commitment is to try this till March 4 and if we can't get it by March 4 then we have to fold up and then start to execute on the debt reduction and the buyback of the equity issued. And that would start immediately. The plans, the contingency plans are in place by Jack and Stacy and the team. And that execution would then start at that point. ","Jack Thayer","And Dan, just for modeling convention, what we've assumed is it takes us roughly five months to buy back the equity and that has a $0.06 drag associated with it during 2016 on our standalone plan. And we would assume we'd retire the majority of the debt associated with Pepco in March, which has a $0.01 drag. So all-in on a standalone basis there's about $0.07 of drag in our EPS associated with PHI closing that out if we end up on a standalone basis.","Dan Eggers","And I think that the disclosure in the back of the $1.6 billion or whatever buyback that you have in the appendix, that's based on just buying back the same number of shares you originally issued, although the notional amount is obviously less than you raised. And is there a possibility you guys could buy back the amount you raised rather than the number of shares?","Jack Thayer","To your point what we've modeled is buying back the 57.5 million shares that we issued for the transaction. I think our balance sheet strength and where we see that orienting from a debt-to-EBITDA basis provides a lot of flexibility. And we'll review what's the best means of creating value for shareholders. ","Dan Eggers","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Chris Crane","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Yeah, hi, good morning. Just on the dividend strategy change I just wanted to confirm that that's the plan kind of with or without Pepco?","Chris Crane","It is.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And secondly, what are your thoughts on the use of the bonus depreciation cash? And it sounds like you haven't included that in the impact of bonus or you're just taking the hit but not including reinvestment. What might you reinvest in?","Chris Crane","We have significant investment in the utilities. We are putting debt on the holding company. We would anticipate less debt issuance to infuse the equity into the utilities as part of that. And there we would look at other opportunities to for further regulated or contracted investment if they met our hurdle rates. ","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then the $1.350 billion that you're putting into contracted generation at ExGen, is that all renewables projects?","Jack Thayer","There's a contracted peaker up in New England that's a modest part of that. But the bulk of that is contracted wind or contracted distributed generation.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, and argue assuming \u2013 are you including any debt financing on those assets or are you assuming for purposes here you're just funding all of it? And could you add debt to those projects?","Jack Thayer","Steve, we're assuming that because of their contracted nature that we'll be able to secure project financing, which would get some measure of off credit treatment to minimize the impact on the overall balance sheet.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And so the $1.350 billion is just your equity investment in these? ","Jack Thayer","The $1.350 billion is just cash.","Steve Fleishman","Cash. Okay.","Jack Thayer","So that can be either project financed or equity financed, some combination of both.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, great. Thank you very much. ","Chris Crane","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Hi, good morning guys.","Chris Crane","Good morning.","Jack Thayer","Good morning.","Just a quick one on a similar topic. Does the projection you show for ExGen net debt to EBITDA stepping down to 2.3 by 2018, how much of your free cash flow are you assuming you are going to reinvest? Or is all of it just rolling into the net debt calculation in that upper slide? ","Chris Crane","Jonathan, the major drivers of that are we have a $700 million maturity in 2017 that we pay down. We pay down about $1.2 billion of CP and then a growing cash position, which ultimately takes you from that 3.2 down to 2.3 times.","Jonathan Arnold","So is it fair to say the 3.2 of free cash flow is kind of all rolled into the debt projection or not entirely?","Chris Crane","It's rolled into the debt projection. It's financing or funding the dividend increase. It's basically insulating the balance sheet to a very strong position.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. That was my other things got asked, so thank you very much.","Chris Crane","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta","Hi guys.","Chris Crane","Good morning.","Praful Mehta","Actually going back to this debt question at ExGen, I just want to understand given the goal is to harvest cash from ExGen as you've pointed out and to reinvest that cash, and we've talked about the lifetime of assets for the nuclear as well, is there a level of just debt, as in currently the debt balances let's say $9 billion, is there a level of debt that you see if the right debt grows that number that you see at ExGen, is it between the 2018, 2019 time frame? Are you targeting a certain number? ","Jack Thayer","We're retiring about $3.6 billion over the next five years at ExGen. And I think that provides us, rather than targeting a specific number I think more importantly it provides us with a considerable amount of flexibility and insulation and allows us to position from a point of strength our merchant fleet to compete on a long-term basis. It's clearly differentiated from the balance sheets of some of our competition. And we think that that will be a competitive advantage as we proceed through the coming years. ","Praful Mehta","Got you. Thank you. And then secondly in terms of the dividend, if the Pepco transaction weren't to close as you grow your dividend by the 2.5% as you've talked about, how are you looking at the payout ratio relative to just the utility earnings by 2018 and is there a target level that you're comfortable with in terms of payout relative to just utility earnings?","Jack Thayer","So from a dividend standpoint, in effect what we do is we set a minimum from a payout ratio at the utilities, but we've got a lot of flexibility in how we can fund that growth. So rather than targeting a specific payout ratio in aggregate what we're really looking at is a minimum payout ratio at the utilities of 65% to 70%. And then we look at where best to fund the dividend as well as fund the investment in the utilities to grow the regulated earnings stream of the company at 7% to 9%.","Praful Mehta","Got you. So there is an area where the payout from just the utility business or I guess the total payout relative to the utility earnings could go higher than the 70% if in case the Pepco transaction doesn't close?","Chris Crane","That's a possibility. But if you look at, go back to what Jack said, a payout ratio of 65% to 70% by 2018 theoretically with our earnings profile, the utilities would cover that dividend. And that's a theoretic position we wanted to be in because we need to make decisions on further capital infusions for necessary projects to drive customer satisfaction and reliability.","Praful Mehta","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Barbara Chapman with BNP.","Barbara Chapman","Hi.","Jack Thayer","Hey, Barbara.","Barbara Chapman","How are you guys doing?","Jack Thayer","Good.","Barbara Chapman","Good. If somebody could speak to your sources and uses slide on 27 please and help answer a couple of questions. One, the issuance needed at Baltimore Gas & Electric just seems larger than what we've dealt with. So I'm just kind of curious what's going on there as far as an investment standpoint. But also on the corporate issuance, it doesn't appear there is a placeholder for the reissuance of the debt that was not exchanged and therefore called last year. So if you could explain if the Potomac merger goes through are we done now with the permanent debt financing for that?","Jack Thayer","So Barbara, let me start with your second question first. This is on a standalone basis, so you'll note under the debt retirements that we have a further $1.875 billion of retirements here. If PHI goes through then clearly we would look to fill the gap of what we called during the fourth quarter of 2015 through a further financing at the holding company and on a pro forma basis, this sources and uses table would show the impact of that. With respect to BGE, we\u2019re retiring $300 million there. We\u2019re issuing $750 million, so the net $450 million you\u2019ll recall we have a significant gas program there where we are hardening and replacing infrastructure within our gas utility as well as we have significant investments in reliability on the distribution and transmission side. ","Barbara Chapman","Okay. So we are back \u2013 we\u2019re still on the original thought that closing Potomac you will be out with to refinance what had to be called then?","Jack Thayer","Absolutely.","Barbara Chapman","Okay, because it\u2019s confusing the way this is written on that issue. Okay.","Jack Thayer","And then Barbara, just the difference this time obviously is we would issue on the other side of the transaction completing. So we have sources of funding that we can use to bridge. And then we would do a large holdco issuance to replace that short-term financing.","Barbara Chapman","Okay. And then on the Potomac merger, you are not on the agenda for today's meeting, correct?A - Jack Thayer","No.Q - Barbara ChapmanAnd they canceled one of the February meetings. So are there only two meetings left for them to opine?A - Chris CraneLet me let Darryl Bradford address that.A - Darryl BradfordHi, Barbara. The commission has historically called a special meeting. They do that on 48 hours notice, so they could do it at one of their scheduled meetings. I think they moved back their meeting in February because of a conflict with [meruit]. But we wouldn't be surprised at all if the decision whether to approve the merger is not heard at one of their scheduled meetings but rather would be set on 48 hours notice at a special meeting.Q - Barbara ChapmanOkay. And so there would be a posted notice that there's a special meeting then?A - Darryl BradfordYes, 48 hours ahead of time is what their regulations require.Q - Barbara ChapmanOkay, thanks for clearing that up. Thank you.Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza","Good morning, everyone.","A - Darryl BradfordHi, Shah.","Shahriar Pourreza","So just looking at slide 8, is there a scenario that could essentially see some of your ratios including your debt to EBITDA essentially south of 2.3 especially if we continue in a sort of a prolonged low gas price environment?","Jack Thayer","I think obviously there is a measure of commodity sensitivity within our ExGen business. We think we're at I would characterize it as a trough in the cycle and we are showing debt pay down and the reduction of 2.3 times to the extent that our fundamental view comes into play. And we are able to benefit from our behind ratable strategy, that will give us even more balance sheet flexibility.Q - Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the dividend policy, when you think about your second leg of growth, should we assume like step functions to get you closer to what your consolidated growth is or should we assume maybe another large increase post-2018?","Chris Crane","So, we would analyze the best shareholder capital return policy. We'd be looking at are there further investments that can be made that create stronger and continuing growth in our investment in the regulated utilities. But it will be analyzed and as I said we theoretically hit a target of a payout in 2018. We will take into consideration the best uses of capital allocation at that point and we would anticipate some growth continuing after 2018. There's a lot of infrastructure and technology advancements that are coming along that will benefit the customers and benefit reliability and drive much more productivity within our workforce. So it's something that we'll look at and we're heading in the right direction. ","Shahriar Pourreza","Excellent, excellent. And just one last question. Just around maybe you could touch on the New York Clean Energy Fund that's being proposed, sort of the outlook for Ginna post the RSSA and then is there any impact to the put option with EDF?","Chris Crane","I will let Joe Dominguez cover this.","Joe Dominguez","Sure. Good morning. As Chris said at the top of the call, it's not the Clean Energy Fund but it's a zero-emission credit program that benefits nuclear. As Chris said at the top of the call, it's been a constructive development for us in New York. We still have quite a ways to go. But as a threshold political matter, having a governor with the prominence of Governor Cuomo step forward and propose to compensate nuclear fairly to keep it in business is important. If we get the details right I would go so far as to say it's kind of a watershed event for the industry. But we don't have the compensation details sorted out yet. The RSSA at Clinton will expire in March 2017, so practically speaking we need to see the details for the New York program this year. Once we see those details obviously it could provide incremental revenue that would factor into the put if that put in fact occurs. But we don't have important details right now on the level of compensation or how the procurement mechanism would work. So it's all speculative until we do the work over the next three or four months and nail this down.","Chris Crane","In my conversations with the leadership at EDF, they are very comfortable with our operations on the nuclear side and in this market environment they are not looking at exercising the put at this time. So we will continue to work on the regulatory side and drive strong operational performance. And we have a little time on Ginna to the end of the RSSA into 2017, and like Joe said we've got a very supportive administration that recognizes the clean benefits of nuclear and that's really appreciated.","Shahriar Pourreza","Congrats on the results.","Chris Crane","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Francis Idehen, you may begin your conference.","Francis Idehen","Thank you, Britney. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining for our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Thayer, Exelon\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon\u2019s senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earning release this morning along with a presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon\u2019s website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today\u2019s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today\u2019s material, comments made during this call and in the Risk Factors section of the 10-K, which we filed in February as well as in the earnings release and the 10-Q which we expect to file later today.

Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We have scheduled 45 minutes for today\u2019s call.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s CEO.","Christopher Crane","Thank you, Francis. And good morning everyone, thanks for joining the call. Before I go into the prepared remarks, I want to first start by addressing the situation in Baltimore. As a company with a significant presence in Baltimore monitoring the unrest with great concern, as you know, Maryland\u2019s Governor Larry Hogan has declared a state of an emergency and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has declared a city-wide curfew until next week. We join the rest of the business community in recognizing the issues that Baltimore is dealing with and needs to address so the city can \u2013 this great city can heal itself to get back on to economic growth for all.","Moving on to the quarter, I am very pleased with our financial performance. We delivered earnings of $0.71 per share, surpassing our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70. And Jack is going to describe our performance in greater detail.","I would like to focus my remarks on our priorities in how we are strategically pursuing value for customers and shareholders. We continue to operate in a challenging market environment, particularly on the generation side of our business, but our gen to load match strategy continues to create value as seen in the first quarter hedge disclosure.","Our advocacy efforts are focused on creating our channels to capture value for our communities and customers we serve and for our shareholders. I\u2019ll touch on those directly. In our regulated business, we\u2019re redefining the role of the utility of the future, in part by making needed infrastructure investments to modernize the grid. Over the next five years, our LRP has $16 billion of capital that will create approximately 6% CAGR with another potential $7 billion at PHI.","Installing smart meter technology to enable customers to make informed choices about their energy consumption and promoting energy efficiency investments in innovation and resilient technologies at our utilities is a way that is progressive and equitable across all customer types.","You can see this reflected in the energy plan for Illinois future build that we recently proposed through ComEd and Illinois. With these efforts we\u2019re bringing improvements to the lives of the customers in a way that creates value for the company.","Our merchant business faced challenges primarily due to policies and market design shortcomings that have failed to fairly value the benefits of nuclear. As a result, we focused our advocacy efforts on ensuring reliable, environmental and economical benefits of nuclear power are not taken for granted and that these plants are operated on a level playing field.","In Illinois, we are working with state legislators on the low carbon portfolio standard that values each of these benefits. The bill unanimously was approved by the Center Energy Panel and the Public Utilities Committee and will now go to the Senate forward. We hope the same will happen in the House and that the bill will be approved within this legislative session.","From a reliability perspective, we are pleased that FERC has granted the waiver to allow PJM to delay the capacity auction in order to further review PJM\u2019s CP proposal. It is clear from this action that FERC appreciates that the old rules are not sufficient to ensure reliability and the changes must be made. We look forward to a positive outcome.","We continue to work through the process of finalizing a contract with RG&E for our Ginna facility. As these events play out, we\u2019ve continued our best operating the plants and the utilities at high levels of efficiency, engineering our generation output through strong portfolio management while we expand our footprint and our profits in retail power and gas operations.","As you can see, we are doing things on both sides of our business, we\u2019re tapping into multiple channels to create upside and drive value for our customers and for our investors. This leads me to our proposed merger with PHI.","As you know, we\u2019ve obtained regulatory approval from FERC Virginia and New Jersey, we\u2019ve reached a global settlement in Delaware that is pending Commission approval. That leaves Maryland and the District of Columbia. In Maryland, we\u2019ve reached a partial settlement with several critical parties that has been presented to \u2013 we presented that settlement to the Maryland Public Service Commission and expect a decision from them on May 15.","In the District, we\u2019ve completed our evidentiary hearings and we\u2019re now filing briefs and the Commission will comments its deliberations. We have said from the beginning that this merger and the commitments we have made clearly demonstrate this merger is in the public interest and should be approved by the regulatory commissions.","While there is no guarantee that the Public Service Commission will approve the proposal and that there is no guarantee they will not impose conditions that would frustrate the transaction, we believe that the settlement and commitments that we are made in the proceeding are more than meet the statutory requirements for the merger approval and we will look forward to orders approving the merger. We expect the merger to close late in the second quarter or in the third.","In summary, we\u2019re creating value today while actively pursuing public policy changes that recognize the benefits provided by our clean reliable assets and we\u2019re working on all those fronts.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jack who will cover the financial performance for the quarter.","Jack Thayer","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. We had a strong first quarter to start the year. My remarks will cover our financial results for the quarter, second quarter guidance range and update our hedge disclosures and cash outlook.","I\u2019ll start off with slide 4. Starting with our first quarter results on slide 4, Exelon exceeded our guidance range and delivered earnings of $0.71 per share. At Exelon Generation, once again we realized the benefits of our generation to load matching strategy. Quarter after quarter this strategy has paid dividends in a broad array of market conditions.","During the first quarter, despite experiencing lower power prices than during the same period in 2014, we benefited from a lower cost to serve customers. We are realizing strong margins in our load business from contracts we executed last year after the Polar Vortex. In addition, our gas business performed above our expectations during the quarter due to favorable weather. While our nuclear plants performed better than they did at this time last year, we did have some nuclear outages that negatively impacted our quarterly earnings by approximately $0.04 relative to plan.","That being said, we continue to push our plants to perform at our standard highest levels of performance. Our portfolio management team performed strongly and was able to more than offset these losses. On balance, Generation earned $0.35 per share during the quarter.","Exelon\u2019s utilities delivered combined earnings of $ 0.39 per share, an $ 0.08 increase over the first quarter of last year. Although we did not see a repeat of the Polar Vortex of 2014, with sustained extreme cold and wind, we faced a very cold winter with heating degree days 14% to 19% above normal in ComEd\u2019s and PECO\u2019s service territories. In fact, it was colder in Philadelphia this winter than the previous winter. Cold weather, a lack of severe storms and increased distribution rates of BGE drove utility results this quarter. More detail on quarter over quarter driver of utilities can be found in the appendix on slide 16.","For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $ 0.45 per share to $ 0.55 per share. This compares with our realized earnings of $0.51 per share in the second quarter of 2014. We are reaffirming our full-year guidance of $ 2.25 to $ 2.55 per share.","Since our last call both PECO and ComEd have filed rate cases this year. On March 27, PECO filed an electric distribution rate case with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission requesting a $190 million revenue increase and a 10.95% return on equity. This is PECO\u2019s first rate case filing since 2010 and the first time filing based on a fully projected future test year.","In addition, if the PAPUC approves the new System 2020 plan, an additional $275 million will be spent during the next five years to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system, making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage. We expect the PAPUC to rule by the end of the year on the rate case and System 2020 plan with new rates going into effect in January 2016.","On April 15, ComEd filed its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission. ComEd requested a revenue decrease of $50 million. This reduction is a result of a continued focus on cost management and operational efficiencies that are being realized from a stronger more reliable grid with fewer outages.","EIMA and the smart grid investments are working. Since 2012, there have been more than 3.3 million avoided customer interruptions including 1.2 million in 2014, due largely to increased investments in distribution automation or digital smart switches that automatically route power around problem areas. Outage will save customers an estimated $175 million. More detail on each of these rate cases can be found in the appendix on slides 20 through 22.","I\u2019ll now turn to our first quarter gross margin update on slide 5. During the quarter, we saw a drop in natural gas prices, while power prices were steady and heat rates expanded further. The market is finally incorporating the change in the generation stack due to coal retirements as evidenced by the heat rate seen today. Approximately 10 gigawatts of coal plants that PJM have or will retire this year with the majority of retirements occurring in April and May.","We hedged closed to a ratable amount during the quarter in both in Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. At the end of the quarter, for 2016 and 2017, we remain considerably behind ratable in the Midwest where we continue to see upside. Total gross margin is unchanged, relatively unchanged across 2015 through 2017 from our fourth quarter disclosures. As I mentioned, Constellation had a good quarter and executed $200 million in power new business and $100 million in non-power new business.","In addition, we\u2019ve raised our power new business target by $100 million because we have line of sight for continued success in the balance of the year. This increase was offset by our nuclear outages resulting in a net $50 million improvement in 2015 total gross margin.","Slide 6 provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year, projected cash from operations of $6.7 billion. I\u2019d like to point out that we have increased our CapEx projections at ComEd by $200 million. In finalizing the investment plan for 2015, ComEd identified incremental opportunity to invest in infrastructure, including grid resiliency and security, storm hardening and smart grid. These investments will continue to improve the reliability of ComEd's system.","As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Thank you. And we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Eggers","I have been hearing a lot of concerns about the Pepco acquisition and probably some of the Maryland comments, both out of the MEA and the Governor's office. Can you just kind of share your thoughts on how you guys addressed maybe the market power considerations or issues that are raised and how you guys moved past that to get this deal done?","Christopher Crane","There are some that have mentioned a loss of competition and as all know, Pepco, Maryland and BG&E do not compete. Each of these will be standalone in the future as they are now. Rate cases will be decided by the Public Utility Commission in Maryland. We work at the will of the Commission. The benefits that we show by bringing PHI into the Exelon Utilities with best practice sharing being able to leverage procurement and the commitments that we made we think meet the test of best \u2013 to the benefit of the consumer.","And so the Governor has not taken that position. The Governor has stayed neutral since as he said he has come into this late in the process. So there was rumors that he was against it, that was clarified with the letter that he sent to the Commission saying he has faith in the Commission that they will do the right thing and he is neither for or against, he is neutral on it. And that\u2019s the support that we have gotten from Montgomery County and Prince George's County is significant. Those were the major customer bases, the majority of the Maryland customers are and we have a strong support from both counties.","Daniel Eggers","I guess just to play devil's advocate, but if Pepco were not to fill, you guys have funded the equity component of that transaction well in advance. How would you guys use that capital if you ended up having it back to deploy in a different direction?","Jack Thayer","Obviously, we don't anticipate that to happen. We anticipate getting a successful outcome here. To the extent that the terms of approval were onerous or we were rejected outright, we would look to cash settle the equity, the forwards that we had issued and we would look to utilize the capital raised from the convertibles to either fund growth at the business or return value to shareholders through other means.","Daniel Eggers","I guess just one last question on the prioritization of capital. Obviously the ERCOT CCGTs are out there, but there has been more conversation about prospect of the LNG project that you guys are an early investor in as well as these stories about the UK office. Can you just clarify how you guys are prioritizing those capitals and maybe address any of the issues that might be around what we have been hearing in the media?","Christopher Crane","You can see based off of our capital spend, our highest priority is in the regulated investments. We\u2019re making, as I said, $16 billion of investment over the next five years with another potential $7 billion with Pepco being PHI coming in. So that is, we see is a good solid investment needed for the infrastructure for the customers and benefit the shareholders. The CCGTs in Texas are still a very good investment, very positive NPV. It continues to match our generation to load strategy as we continue to grow that load book in Texas in ERCOT.","We said at the beginning we are getting these at very good terms, they are under $700 a KW on our brownfield site where we will have expense advantages combining them with our existing facilities. And the nature of those plants, the efficiency and the flexibility of them, they will dispatch well in that ERCOT market. So that\u2019s still a positive investment.","[ANOVA] is a good, strong option. We\u2019re the fifth largest in handling merchant gas. We have core competencies around our gas portfolio and continuing to grow out the gas business is a logical move, we believe. But the nature of that project is it would be a contracted long-term type arrangement that de-risks it significantly. If we are successful in obtaining contracts and permits, then we would make the investment to continue to develop out our gas business. So that\u2019s the strategy around utilities. The strategy around competitive electric and gas continue to be the primary.","The story in the UK is not an equity story at all. Exelon Nuclear Partners has been invited into the bidding process to be the operator on a couple of projects potentially in the UK. We have a very small office that we rent month to month that those folks are working out of. Part of the process of doing that is understanding more the UK market, so there has been some due diligence around that, but we have no plans right now on becoming an equity owner in the UK at this point. Those were clarification needed to be made.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Just a quick one on Illinois. Chris, you were saying you still think you are hopeful that you will get things across the finish line in the spring session. There has been talk that there might be slippage into the veto session and obviously with the PJM auction delayed maybe the state would want to wait, see the outcome. What\u2019s behind your conviction that we\u2019re still on for the spring?","Christopher Crane","There is a hearing today that we\u2019ll be continuing to address the issue. So it is being discussed, it\u2019s being worked even with all of the other business that has been going on in Springfield around budgets. So as I said, we got strong support, unanimous support out of the Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee in March, unanimous, and there is hearings on both the House and Senate this week to continue to discuss it. So we remain positive, cautious but positive that we will be able to get something through in this session. If we don't and the likelihood is that we\u2019re not going to get a bill and we have to address the long-term profitability of the units and we\u2019ll decide that as we see the legislative session end.","Jonathan Arnold","One other issue, Dan asked about the UK and you responded about the nuclear operator bidding process. There was also a story that you\u2019d been linked to looking at an investment in a CCGT which appear to be similar next-generation technology like you are working on in Texas, any comments on that?","Christopher Crane","Yes, I learned about that when you did in the clippings. So there is market intelligence that\u2019s going on at a lower level in the organization, but there is no plans to enter into equity positions at this point in the UK.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Your expected generation guidance for 2015 to 2017 in New England is 2x, 2x plus today versus what it was in the fourth quarter release. You haven't acquired any assets, so can you explain how you\u2019ve been able to double your expected generation in that market and the flow through impact it is having on your expected gross margin which looks like it\u2019s up marginally over the next two years, but then down marginally in 2017?","Joseph Nigro","I will speak to that and you are right you noticed that our expected generation in New England in all years has increased appreciably and as such, the generation percentage hedge has declined with that increased output of generation. Very simply, we had disclosed in Q4 2013 that we had worked with a field supplier to restructure a contract that we have. And if you remember back then, our generation had dropped by about 50% in that quarter-over-quarter at that time. That contract restructuring has been terminated and it will be effective at the end of June this year and the contract itself will revert back to its original terms and conditions.","It has two impacts. One, you\u2019re seeing the generation impact and the hedge percentage impact and the notification of that termination was at the end of the first quarter this year. So really you\u2019re seeing it flow through on an immediate basis. The gross margin impact was very minimal across the horizon. And as such, just mechanically when you look at the hedge disclosure, the dollars of the termination of the contract restructuring as well as the increased value of the generation output and the margin associated with that is all flowing through the open gross margin line and it\u2019s very minimal. So really it is a volume change that you see with a little dollar impact.","Greg Gordon","So then what\u2019s the economic rationale for termination if it\u2019s more or less NPV neutral? Are these fuel contracts for gas plants that have optionality associated with price volatility, are they baseload? Why would you terminate that contract if it wasn't increasing NPV appreciably?","Joseph Nigro","I can't say too much due to the confidentiality of the nature of the agreement, but what I will say is the contract termination was the right of the supplier held that right. And from our perspective, as I said, the impact economically was very muted. I can't speak to the supplier's perspective on why they terminated it, but it\u2019s related to a long-term supply arrangement that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","I wanted to focus on the CP product if you could. First, with regards to your expectations on the future retirements, I\u2019m curious, do you see these CP product as proposed, driving retirements as you go to 100% CP market? Is that conceivable and what kind of units? And then subsequently obviously with Supreme Court here waiting on the DR decision, how do you see that ultimately impacting the base of CP products of any eventual auction here? Does it appreciably impact CP or is it more of an impact from the base auction?","Joseph Nigro","I think to your first question around retirements, we don't see a material impact. I think the rationale is first and foremost obviously to improve the reliability on the system and to do that you need a couple of, you can go about that a couple of ways. One is the hardening of the units themselves which have a cost associated with it. The second thing is to make sure you have firm fuel on-site for these units and there is a cost to do that.","When you look at the economics of all of that, we don't believe there is going to be a material impact to retirement. I will sit here and say though given this structure that\u2019s been laid out if it is implemented, I would expect that you would see an increased risk premium effectively in the marketplace given the fact that the penalty structure is changing rightfully so to ensure reliability. But I don't think outright there will be material impact on the retirement side.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And on demand response?","Joseph Nigro","I guess from a DR perspective, there is a lot of flux around the rules, but sitting here looking at this auction, we would expect to see the demand response activity will continue in the way it has. And then as rule changes through time, if the change, whether it becomes a retail product as opposed to a wholesale product, we will have to see how that plays out.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then just turning to the renewables business, obviously the yieldco phenomenon continues to evolve. Have you given more thought about the degree to which this business is core as we\u2019ve seen the market evolve?","Christopher Crane","Julien, with respect to the renewables part of our business?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Exactly, just not with creating a structure yourself, but ultimately whether you could garner better value in the public markets of late?","Christopher Crane","As you know, we have an extensive business both on the solar as well as wind renewables part of our business. And how we have improved the returns on that business over the last number of years has been through the extensive use of project financing as a means of returning capital to the corporate coffers to reinvest either in the growth of the utilities or fund some of our other expansionary efforts around. As an example, the peaker that we are building in New England or the combined cycles we are building in Texas.","Certainly, we do watch and we do evaluate and consider the potential impact of value that a yieldco could have on our assets from the perspective of yieldcos as potential buyers of those assets or through the potential to create our own yieldco. And we continue to evaluate that within our project financing efforts. We have retained that option to be able to do that.","I think one of the key elements though to a successful strategy around yieldcos is having a significant and visible pipeline of assets that you could drop down. And we have I think a good amount of assets. We have elements like our ANOVA LNG facility that if we decide to pursue that and we had a long-term off take agreement that would provide attractive revenues that could fit in that type of structure. But at this point we don't have any plans to pursue such a structure and continue to have a candidly wait and see approach.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So more of a retain the business, build it out and then see down the line rather than monetize it?","Christopher Crane","Absolutely. So you see us continuing to deploy wind investments. We have a project that we\u2019re developing down in Texas, Laredo. You continue to see us work down a path on the ANOVA LNG project to secure a long-term off take and you see us continue \u2013 through our Constellation business continue to pursue opportunities to grow the solar side of our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.","Neel Mitra","I was wondering on the holdco side, how much more debt are you able to support after the Pepco acquisition closes now that you are more regulated?","Christopher Crane","Neel, as you know, we have significant debt issuance forthcoming that will be used to finance at the holding company, the PHI transaction that we would look to bring to market once we have visibility around a successful path in Maryland. We continue to evaluate the balance sheet capacity and the space that we have at that holding company. As you know, we\u2019ve said we will utilize that holding company as a potential vehicle to finance regulated growth. I think an important element to this is the interplay between the growing earnings mix of our utilities business relative to our merchant exposure on how the rating agencies perceive us.","And so to the extent that the rating agencies continue to evolve in their thinking around the risks embedded in our business and see us as a less risky credit, I would say that is the biggest mover of balance sheet capacity. Obviously, some elements around whether it\u2019s capacity performance, the Illinois Clean Energy Legislation that would be additive to the company's cash flow and earnings would also be helpful to our ability to add further leverage to the holding company.","Neel Mitra","And then assuming Pepco closes, what\u2019s the latest update as to when the dividend is fully funded by the regulated side?","Christopher Crane","So we project that towards the latter part of the decade into 2020 timeframe, but we will continue to evaluate that based off of rate case outcomes.","Jack Thayer","That\u2019s specific to \u2013 from a free cash flow standpoint, the utilities being able to not just from a payout ratio standpoint, but from a free cash flow funding standpoint, Chris\u2019 point on the latter part of the decade is when that cash would be available to potentially consider growing the dividend.","Neel Mitra","And then last on the Illinois legislation, if something isn't reached by the end of May, what are the options to maybe keep the process going through 2015 or is it kind of done through the rest of the year if you don't have an outcome by May?","William Von Hoene","We expect the session, this is Bill Von Hoene, to conclude at the end of May. It conceivably could be extended if the budget impasse continues. It\u2019s unlikely that the energy legislation would be considered during that period of time. There is a six-day session, veto session in November and into early December which requires a super majority on any votes that pass during that period of time. So that would be the next time the legislature would convene after the conclusion of this regular session.","Neel Mitra","And a super majority would require a 60% vote, is that correct?","William Von Hoene","That\u2019s correct.","Christopher Crane","The point on that though in May of 2014, we committed not to make any decisions based off of economics for a year. We\u2019re coming to the end of that year and we need to make decisions that start the planning process if we do not see a success path.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","So wanted to focus again on Illinois, so it seems like you guys are bullish energy prices in Illinois and that\u2019s why you are not hedging much of your portfolio. You are also bullish on capacity prices. At the recent PJM, you just had this spike in MISO capacity prices. So how does it all add up because on the one hand if capacity prices rise then you have less of a volatility on peak [indiscernible] potentially lower heat rates. So how does it reconcile with your outlook on heat rates?","Joseph Nigro","I think what I would say is if we talk just about energy prices in Northern Illinois for a minute, using prices as of the end of the quarter, we do still see heat rate expansion. We don't think the market has priced in all the upside really driven by the back of the change in dispatch stack. And if you think about two different timeframes like 2016, 2017, we probably see less upside than we do when you get out to the 2018, 2019 time period and it\u2019s probably to the tune of $1 to $2 accordingly.","Just as importantly, we also have a view that we think natural gas is underpriced at this point which in addition to that would drive prices higher net-net because you would see a slight heat rate decline with the rise in natural gas. But net-net, it would be a positive outcome. And your point is right that from a hedging perspective, we continue to remain behind our ratable hedging plan in the Midwest to the tune of about 10% in 2016 and 2017 approximately just given those views.","Angie Storozynski","And you also think that the carbon legislation in Illinois is not going to have any negative impact on forward energy prices in Illinois?","Joseph Nigro","No, we don't.","Angie Storozynski","Secondly, in ERCOT, you keep saying that you have a cost advantage for the new build and you clearly do. But forward curves are showing on peak spark spreads of $15, $16, so the conclusion or your dedication to the project is driven by your outlook on where these spark spreads are going to go as opposed to what we\u2019re seeing? And so can you give us at least a sense what kind of spark spreads you are assuming in your calculations when you think that the IRR of the projects is still interesting?","Kenneth Cornew","We continue to be comfortable with our investment in these plants because as Chris said, the cost advantage, the technology advantage meaning the heat rate efficiencies and the responsiveness of the plants. We\u2019ve seen spark spreads bounce around a lot in ERCOT. The lack of volatility recently has driven them down. Our long-term fundamental views are what I would say conservative and we\u2019re still confident in the investments, very confident actually.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shar Pourreza","Just sticking with the RSSA with Ginna, is there an update on the filing? And then just counter with the EDF put option, how should we think about under an assumption that you may own the remaining portion of this plan, is there an option that you can get an expanded RSSA contract if the timing works?","William Von Hoene","The RSSA contract was approved by FERC effective April 1, but with two adjustments being required in the contract which have been sent back and a compliance filing will be made by Ginna to reflect that. Then there will be a process by which the contract itself will be evaluated and potentially settled through a FERC procedure. So that is going to go forward for probably the balance of the year based upon precedent in other circumstances, although the ability to collect on a cost based rate is effective now.","The put is exercisable by EDF January 1, 2016. We do not know and don't speculate as to what would happen in connection with that. With regard to the potential extension of the RSSA agreement, it\u2019s predicated on the period of time that\u2019s necessary for the New York system to find alternative ways to deliver the same reliability that Ginna currently is required to deliver. So we would not anticipate in the absence of the failure of the New York system to do so that there would be any basis for extension of the agreement.","Shar Pourreza","And then just one lastly, sticking with the Illinois carbon portfolio, have you quantified what could potentially be available under the cap using let's say the 2014 rates? And then additionally, am I correct to assume that there is an opportunity to breach that cap if somehow credits are being constrained?","William Von Hoene","No, the cap is the same essentially 2% cap that goes on energy efficiency in RPS, and I think that\u2019s been calculated by a number of folks. There is no provision by which the cap could be breached under the legislation as it\u2019s currently proposed.","Shar Pourreza","And then you haven't quantified what could be available under the program using pre-existing rates, right?","William Von Hoene","No, we have not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon","A quick question on Illinois, with the Attorney General's office kind of weighing in on the MISO auction, is that entering the discussion in the Legislature?","Christopher Crane","There has been attention not surprisingly to the MISO auction in connection with the Legislative deliberations and I think it\u2019s relevant in the minds of a number of legislators. From our standpoint, however, it has virtually no impact on the health of our plants.","The Clinton plant which was a price taker in the auction and which had sold in advance a significant portion of the power that benefited the auction results is only about $13 million. So that\u2019s far short of what would be necessary and doesn't obviate the need for the low carbon portfolio standard for that plant or elsewhere.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha","I wanted to clarify, I may have missed this, I think you were mentioning that. On the forward prices versus fundamental view, if I heard you right, you said you thought Midwest was probably about $2 lower than what the fundamental view would be? I wanted to confirm that and what\u2019s thinking on mid-Atlantic for PJM right now, forward versus fundamental?","Joseph Nigro","What I said was there\u2019s two components to our view. The first is just fundamentally we still expect to see heat rate expansion in Northern Illinois across the time horizon. So if you look at calendar 2016, 2017 and beyond, we would expect to see heat rate expansion and that\u2019s probably in that $1 to $2 range.","But additionally, we see gas price upside which would also increase the power price beyond that upside. So that would effectively raise the heat rates as well and\/or effectively raise the power price as well. So there are two components to our view and as such, we\u2019re behind our ratable plan in 2016 and 2017 from a hedging perspective to the tune of approximately 10%.","And it\u2019s important to note that there is some seasonality associated with that in our hedging profile within a given year reflects that, meaning we see time buckets that are more valuable relative to the market than others. On the West upside, we see that heat rates and power prices are generally in line with our fundamental forecast and we don't see quite as much opportunity, but again there is seasonality associated with that and our hedging profile takes that into account.","Ali Agha","Joe, one other thing, on the retail side, a quick update on the competitive environment and the $2 to $4 margin that we\u2019ve historically been benchmarking just to give us a sense of where we are as new contracts are rolling in?","Joseph Nigro","I think in general, our load business has done very well whether we\u2019re talking about our retail book of business on the commercial and industrial side or our polar procurement business on the wholesale side. After the Polar Vortex last year, we saw, I would say folks may be pricing the risk more prudently from our perspective as it relates to managing a retail contract. That\u2019s one element of it.","And then from the margin perspective using that $2 to $4 benchmark that you laid out there, we\u2019re well in line in the range of that $2 to $4 whereas we were sitting here a year and a half ago we\u2019re struggling to be even at the low end of that range. So we\u2019ve seen improvement across the board both from a risk pricing perspective and a margin improvement perspective in our load business from both wholesale and retail.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller","This is a bit of a follow-up to that last question, but how long do you expect this magnitude of the load matching benefit that you got in this quarter to extend? Can we think about this extending through the full-year and beyond or was there something in the quarter that gave you even more benefit on the load matching side relative to what we could see later in the year?","Joseph Nigro","I think there's a couple of answers to that question and I think the most important one is we\u2019re seeing the changeover in the generation stack that we expected to see with retirements and low gas prices and you\u2019ve seen the heat rate expansion that we have been talking about for some time.","I think in addition to that, I think what you\u2019re going to see going forward is increased volatility and both upside volatility and downside volatility. And I think that has an impact on load following contracts because you need to make sure that they are priced accordingly.","So we have got the benefit of, I would call it, lower load serving cost in the first quarter and they\u2019ve come down on a mark to market basis for the balance of the year. But our expectation is given that market volatility we would expect to see that that would pass through to continuing to see appropriate risk premiums in our load serving business and appropriate margins.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Just want to circle back a little bit on PJM. We keep seeing a lot of announcements or people attempting to get new combined cycles built. We\u2019ve obviously had a lot to clear over the last few years, gas base is still pretty low meaning it is still pretty wide in parts of PJM relative to where Henry Hub is or even where TETCO is. Just curious your kind of multi-year thoughts about whether lots of plants actually do get built, meaning or do a lot just kind of disappear by the wayside?","And what this means not only for \u2013 your view of are we kind of at new build economics in PJM? Does the concept of building merchant combined cycle in PGM makes sense to you here? Just kind of broader thinking about gas plant economics in that market.","Joseph Nigro","There is a couple of questions there. Let me try to pick them off one by one. I think the first one is as it relates to the turnover of the [indiscernible] stack, I think it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re going to see retirements of generation assets. In our fundamental modeling, we have an add back of an appreciable number of gas-fired generators in PJM with most of them on the eastern side of PJM because that is where the economics are more favorable than toward a territory like NiHub for example. You are talking about a long-term investment asset with a build of a combined cycle plant and you are looking at a market with spark spreads that\u2019s a much shorter dated time horizon.","In PJM, unlike some of the other markets, the capacity price comes into play and is part of the equation. Clearly, we don't see new build economics work on the Western side of PJM. On the Eastern side of PJM, it\u2019s a much more marginal exercise. I think where spark spreads are and where capacity prices if you use last year as a benchmark for example, I think you could say that's a marginal calculation. There was some talk if you go back a year ago that people were going to be able to lock in gas contracts for 20 years at well under Henry Hub at M3 gas or mid-Atlantic type gas. I would tell you I haven't seen that and I don't think that is going to be the case, so there is an element of making sure that you understand what the dynamics of the cost of production are as well.","But I think net-net fundamentally, what we see is a turnover of stack. Our fundamental forecast reflects that so we have an appreciable add back of combined cycle plants and when we take that all into account, as I said previously, we still see upside to the heat rate in NiHub and we are generally in line with where the market heat rate is at West hub.","Michael Lapides","One real quick follow-up if you don't mind. You all talked a little bit about what the resolution on nuclear fuel means. Can you talk about what that means for fuel costs on a per megawatt hour basis for a typical nuclear plant? Like how material is the change on a dollar per megawatt hour? Are we talking $0.05 or $0.50, just trying to get my arms around it.","Christopher Crane","You\u2019re talking about the DOE fee?","Michael Lapides","Yes, please.","Christopher Crane","It's a little less than $1 a megawatt.","Michael Lapides","Got it, $1 a megawatt hour, so something that may have been 750-ish is now well below 7?","Christopher Crane","Yes.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Francis for closing remarks.","Francis Idehen","Thank you, Britney.

At this time all participant lines are in a listen only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today, Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, sir.","Dan Eggers","Thank you, Tamara. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.","Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation. And our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.","I'll turn the call over to Mr. Chris Crane, Exelon's Chief Executive Officer.","Chris Crane","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We had a good quarter delivering strong earnings, excellent customer service across our utilities and our nuclear units ran at high levels of reliability.","I'll turn to our regular reporting of our financial performance in a minute, but I first want to address a matter that I know is on all of our minds. We have publicly reported we have received two grand-jury subpoenas; the subjects which are lobbying practices in Illinois and the company's relationship with an Illinois state senator. These subpoenas and the speculation about what's behind them have dominated the news about Exelon and ComEd. Given that the investigations are ongoing we cannot discuss many details, but I'll tell you this, when we learned of these investigations we pledged complete cooperation with the government and that is the path we have taken. The company's outside lawyers are undertaking an exhaustive investigation of the facts relevant to the subpoenas, a special committee of the Board represented by its own outside counsel has also been informed and is being briefed on the investigation. Exelon's outside lawyers are sharing the results of the investigation with the government on an ongoing basis. Their investigation is enabling us to determine what changes necessary internally to ensure that going forward we operate at the highest possible standards, not whether actions have been legal or not but rather which go beyond the ethical reproach. We are keeping our eye on the ball by staying focused on the operational and the strategic path that has delivered the success.","Now I'll turn to the regular report and answer any questions about that I can at the end of the call. Starting on Slide 5, we've had positive developments over the quarter. First, we were named Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row with Exelon continuing to score in the top 20% of North American companies in all industries. ","Second, we launched a Climate Investment Initiative to invest $20 million and start-ups in our service territories that are working on new technologies to reduce greenhouse emission -- gas emissions in climate change -- mitigating climate change. ","Third, Pepco Maryland was granted a 9.6 allowed ROE in its most recent rate case. This is an improvement and the results continued to -- through the enhancement in our reliability and customer service for our customers. ","Fourth, the Maryland PSC issued an order in the alternative rate making proceeding known as PC 51, allowing Maryland utilities to file a multi-year rate plan as soon as next year. ","Fifth, the New York Supreme Court rejected challenges to the New York ZEC program removing the last remaining legal challenge in front of us. Sixth the Governor Wealth Issue and executive order beginning to process for Pennsylvania to join REGI, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This will allow Pennsylvania to meet its climate goals while helping to preserve the state's remaining zero carbon nuclear plants. ","Seventh, earlier this week, we announced an agreement with Governor Hogan in Maryland that will allow us to continue to operate Conowingo Dam and protect the long-term health of the Chesapeake Bay. Continued production of carbon free energy from the dam is vital to support Governor Hogan's goal in generating a 100% clean electricity in Maryland by 2040. ","Finally, we're announcing new round of cost savings at ExGen finding an additional $100 million savings. We continue to work hard at driving efficiencies and adapting to current market conditions. These savings will help ExGen navigate the depressed forwards but will not be enough to overcome the financial challenges of some of our Illinois nuclear plants.","I realize there has been some discussion on the potential impact of the investigation on the prospects of a clean energy legislation in Illinois. The need for clean energy legislation is bigger than just one stakeholder or one company. We are one part, but only one part of the ongoing discussion about the urgent need for legislation in Illinois. With the roadblock, excuse me, with the rollback of environmental regulations in Washington, states across the country are taking action to require emission reductions, so they can benefit from clean energy economy that will result. This is true Illinois where many stakeholders and policymakers want for Illinois on a path to 100% clean drive and drive electrification of transportation and to protect our communities. They believe the act action is urgently needed in Illinois to ensure clean air, reliable service in affordable rates for Illinois consumers. Exelon nuclear plants are essential to achieving these goals. The four plants without ZECs avoid $45 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emission contribute 4.5 billion in state gross domestic product pay $149 million in state taxes and if they were to retire prematurely Illinois customers -- consumers will pay more than $483 million more in electricity annually.","I should point out that the delays in enacting the legislation are in part linked to FERC's delay in issuing an order on PJM market capacity. This is due to the lack of quorum until the end of November when Commissioner Glick completes his recusal period, and while the FERC delay is very frustrating. It does allow Illinois more time to enact and implement the legislation changes in time to protect the clean energy programs from negative treatment in PJM capacity auction. The delay in FERC order will push back the 2022 and '23 auction until at least late fall of 2020. Spring passage of legislation will allow for Illinois clean energy procurement mechanism to be in place before the 2023\/2024 capacity auction and potentially before the 2022\/2023 auction as well.","Moving to our financial results, we have had a strong quarter with the earnings above our guidance. Our GAAP-based -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.79 per share versus $0.76 per share last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.92 per share versus $0.88 per share last year. Joe will cover these details in his remarks.","Moving onto Slide 6, operational performance at the utilities was mix this quarter. Each of our utilities performed well on customer operations side, with mostly top quartile performance. However, only ComEd performed in the first quartile and outage frequency and duration metrics. This year, in the Middle Atlantic, we have seen significantly more storms and abnormally higher temperatures which increased vegetation impacts it caused on the reliability related issues. For instance PHI had 27 minor storms in 2019 compared to four in 2018. These drove the lower reliability metrics for our mid-Atlantic utilities. Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatt hours of zero emission electricity with a capacity factor of 95.5. Exelon power exceeded our plan and had a gas and hydro dispatch match of 97.5 and a wind and solar capture of 96.5. That said, we also had some outages in Texas during critical hours that were disappointing and cause us to miss out on some of the bigger opportunities in ERCOT.","For now, I'll turn it over to Joe, and then we'll go to the questions after. Thank you.","Joe Nigro","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover our third quarter results, quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12 month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures. I will also provide an update on our full year 2019 guidance and our cost management program.","First, turning to Slide 7, we earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.92 per share on a non-GAAP basis which exceeded our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. The outperformance was driven by Exelon utility which delivered a combined $0.56 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to guidance, driven largely by O&M timing during the quarter and favorable weather in our non-decoupled jurisdictions including PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva Delaware. As a reminder, in total, we are approximately 70% decoupled across our utilities. ExGen earned $0.36 per share, which was a little behind our plan. The third quarter was impacted by unplanned outages at owned and contracted assets in ERCOT which unfortunately hit during periods of high prices. Although, we had one of the top 10 hottest summers in 70 years in PJM and the third hottest September on record, we saw lower prices and volatility which resulted in less ability to optimize our wholesale portfolio during the quarter.","Turning to Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.92 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.04 per share higher than the third quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less HoldCo earnings were up $0.001 per share compared with last year. The earnings growth was driven primarily by higher distribution rates, associated with completed rate cases relative to the third quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather in load at PECO.","ExGen's earnings were up $0.03 per share compared with last year, benefiting from fewer planned nuclear outage days at our owned and operated plants and savings associated with our cost management program. Higher ZEC revenues from the increase in New York ZEC pricing and the start of the New Jersey ZEC program in April of 2019 also contributed to ExGen's year-over-year earnings growth. These were partially offset by lower capacity pricing, primarily in PJM.","Turning to Slide 9, we are narrowing our 2019 EPS guidance range to $3.05 to $3.20 a share from $3 to $3.30 per share. As you are aware ComEd's ROE is tied to the 30-year treasury rates which is declined about 70 basis points since the beginning of the year. Our updated guidance takes into account the slight degradation in earnings we are seeing from the decline in treasuries. We are delivering on our financial commitments and confident we will be within our revised guidance range at year-end.","Moving to Slide 10, looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we continue to exceed our consolidated 9% to 10% target with a 10.1% trailing 12 month ROE. Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon utilities remained above 10% but dipped modestly last quarter, primarily due to a BG&E equity infusion to support capital investments as well as declining treasury yield which impacted ComEd's ROE. The decline in treasuries will continue to impact ComEd's ROE for the remainder of the year and going forward if they do not rebound.","The consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.4% ROE for the trailing 12 months, a 30 basis point increase from last quarter driven by higher distribution revenue from the constructive distribution rate order at both Pepco Maryland and the settlement at Atlantic City Electric. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth target by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities.","Turning to Slide 11. During the quarter, there were some important developments on the regulatory front outside of our rate cases. First, as Chris mentioned, in August, the Maryland PSC in its PC 51 proceeding found that alternative rate plans can be beneficial to both customers and utilities by reducing administrative costs caused by the frequent filing of traditional rate cases and providing customer rate predictability. The order supports the implementation of multi-year rate plans of a three-year duration and established a working group to develop the rules. We are actively participating in the group process. Once the commission issues its final order, Maryland utilities will be able to file a multi-year rate plan on a staggered basis consistent with the Commission's order.","Second, the DC Public Service Commission approved Pepco's DC notice of construction request for Phase 1 of the capital grid project. It will strengthen the capital area electric system, improve reliability and resiliency and help facilitate the district's climate commitments. This phase including rebuilding two substation and constructing approximately 10 miles of two 230kV underground transmission lines. Phase 1 is scheduled for completion by 2026.","On our current rate cases, Pepco Maryland received a final order on August 12th. The Maryland Commission approved a $10.3 million increase in annual electric distribution revenues. Importantly, the order increase at Pepco's allowed ROE by 10 basis points to 9.6%, a recognition of strong performance in reliability and customer satisfaction. Rates went into effect on August 13th. We also have several rate cases still in progress. On October 23rd, the administrative law judge providing over ComEd's annual formula rate case issued a proposed order, no additional adjustments to the revenue requirements were recommending. We expect to receive a final order from the Illinois Commerce Commission on December 4th of this year. Last Friday, BGE filed a settlement agreement with the Maryland PSC. The settlement provides for an increase to BGE's annual electric and natural gas distribution rate of $25 million and $54 million respectively. We expect a final order by December of 2019. Finally, we received a procedural schedule in Pepco DC multi-year plan with the final order expected in the fourth quarter of 2020. More details on our rate cases can be found on Slides 21 through 24 of the appendix.","Turning to Slide 12, we are continuing on our robust capital deployment at the utilities, investing $1.3 billion of capital during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have invested $3.9 billion in capital at the utilities, improving our infrastructure and increasing reliability and resiliency for the benefit of our consumers. We expect to deploy more than $5.4 billion this year, $100 million above our original plan. And as a reminder, 63% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital tracker.","Today, I will talk about two projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved performance to our customers in Maryland and New Jersey. The first project is the BGE key crossing reliability initiative, which is a $232 million multi-year project to install a double circuit 230kV overhead electric transmission line across the Patapsco River, replacing the 2.25 mile underground circuit. The circuits are critical link in the electric system and are exhibiting system symptoms of long-term failure and are approaching the end of the useful life. Key crossing will improve grid reliability by reducing risk of power outages caused by aging infrastructure and will support faster restoration of customer interruptions going forward. The second project Lewis Higbee Ontario rebuild project in Atlantic City. The $62 million project include rebuilding 369kV transmission lines which are about 16.5 line miles long in total and replacing 295 existing wood structures with 225 new galvanized steel structures. This project results potential system performance and reliability issues, thereby improving reliability and resiliency to customers in the service area of Absecon, Island.","On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin update incurring current hedging strategy at the Generation company. Since the Constellation merger, we have delivered strong results in our wholesale business quarter-after-quarter even in an environment of declining power and natural gas prices as well as lower volatility. These market conditions combined with reduced liquidity added out on the curve leads to less opportunity to optimize our wholesale portfolio compared to history. As a result, we are reducing our power new business target by $50 million in 2020 and '21 and our non-power new business target by $50 million in 2021. These new business target reductions are mostly offset by cost savings, which I will discuss on the next slide. I should also stress that these changes reflect our expectation for our wholesale optimization business. Our customer facing Constellation businesses continue to perform very well with sustained margins and success in delivering new products for our customers.","Turning to the gross margin tables, we did benefit in the third quarter from higher forward prices which you can see in the open gross margin line. These positives were offset by the lower wholesale business targets that I just discussed, which leaves total gross margin in 2020 and '21 flat. During the quarter, we hedged a more than a ratable amount as prices modestly recovered from their late second quarter lows. Although, we are still behind ratable overall ending the quarter 5% to 8% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in '21, we are much closer to a ratable hedging amount. We continue to see upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices.","Turning to Slide 14. Between 2015 and 2018, we have announced more than $900 million in cost savings which does not include the synergies from our merger with PHI. These savings were primarily at Exelon Generation with approximately one-third coming from our corporate services company. In addition to O&M savings, we have continued to find ways to reduce the capital intensity of our generation fleet and improve its cash flows. Since 2015, we have reduced ExGen's total annual capital expenditures from $3.5 billion to a projected $1.5 billion in 2022, while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet. Included in these reductions are the elimination of most growth capital at ExGen except for Constellation's customer facing solar business. $325 million of base capex savings and $675 million of savings from nuclear fuel.","One of the key components of our value proposition is ExGen's ability to generate free cash flow and we continue to look for ways to optimize its cash flow. Today, we are announcing additional $100 million in run rate, pre-tax cash savings in 2022. $75 million is attributed to O&M reductions and $25 million is other P&L items, which mostly offset the reduction in new business targets.","I should point out that these savings reflect our current state and we expect an opportunity for additional savings that will vary in amounts depending on the future state of our challenged Illinois nuclear stations. We can find these savings due to the hard work of all of our employees, who strive every day to run the company more efficiently, while adhering to our commitments of safety, reliability and community stewardship.","Finally, moving on to Slide 15, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment-grade credit rating. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our targeted ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt to EBITDA target of 3.0 times. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.5 times debt to EBITDA and 2 times debt to EBITDA when excluding non-recourse debt.","Before turning the call back over to Chris for his closing remarks, I want to set expectations for our fourth quarter disclosures. Given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois, which will shape the future of Exelon Generation and the fact that PJM will not have held the capacity auction for the 2022-2023 delivery year before our call in February, we will not be providing some of our usual disclosures, including the roll forward of our hedge disclosures to 2022 and ExGen's updated four-year free cash flow outlook.","Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.","Chris Crane","Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 16, we are accomplishing things we committed to do, including maintaining industry leading operations, meeting our financial commitments, effectively deploying more than $5 billion in capital across our utilities this year and advocating for policies that support clean energy. Our strategy remains the right one and we are committed to our value proposition. We will continue to grow the utilities targeting a 7.8% rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use, as Joe mentioned, the free cash flow from Genco to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, paydown debt and fund part of the growing dividend. We will continue to optimize the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for zero emitting generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants like we did with TMI and Oyster Creek, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the Generation to load match strategy at Constellation. We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics. We'll grow our dividend annually by 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our businesses and earn your ongoing support of Exelon.","Operator, we can now turn it over to questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first response is from Greg Gordon of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Thanks, good morning. Got a couple of questions. First as it pertains to ExGen, you sort of commented at the end with regard to plant closures. If you're, for one reason or another, unable to get the state of Illinois to understand the economic necessity of increased compensation for your nuclear fleet. At what point do you go down the path of moving to shutdown of the most uneconomic units?","Chris Crane","I can't stress how important the spring legislative session will be for the future of the four sites that are not covered under the ZEC program. So we'll be watching -- there's couple of variables here, we'll be watching what happens with the FERC order and what PJMs responses to the FERC order driving the legislation, but the first half of 2020, will be a real critical point in decision making and potential announcements one way or the other.","Greg Gordon","And Joe. As it pertains to the details of the guidance, it's sort of two steps forward, 1.5 steps back on the outlook for ExGen better wholesale prices, but -- and the cost cutting, but lower optimization expectations. Is that a function of just lower volatility and lower overall prices making it less some -- less -- that volatility lessening the opportunity for your traders to manage the book effectively or can you give us a little more color on that?","Joe Nigro","Yeah, Greg. You're spot on. I think it's a combination of factors. It's -- the lower volatility in the marketplace, I mean, we had a warm summer here and we didn't see much volatility, we didn't see prices respond. I do want to stress that we're talking about the wholesale side of our business, our retail business remains very solid. And as it relates to ExGen, we announced these cost cuts which mostly offset the reduction in new business targets. As Chris mentioned, depending on the outcome of Illinois, there is still other things that we would have to evaluate on how our business model changes and disposition of assets. There is other costs that we would look at -- some of the levers we have at hand, we'll continue to address capex obviously and any other asset financing. So there is a combination of factors here. But specifically to the drop in the new business targets, it is the market environment that we're seeing.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And then on -- two more questions, one on the regulated side, the ComEd sounds like it's operating very well but 30-year is a headwind and it'll continue to be a headwind into next year and until we see a steepening of the yield curve. So like -- as you're looking at the outcomes in the other areas of the utility business. The other 60%, 65% of the earnings contribution from outside ComEd, are you seeing opportunities to offset the impact of interest rates or should we assume that all things equal, you're trending lower in that 6% to 8% guidance range than you were before?","Joe Nigro","Yeah, Greg. Good questions, Joe again. We update once a year on our Q4 call and we -- and as it relates to Exelon utilities and we will expect to do that on the call in February. Having said that, we are seeing the impact of the lower ROEs at ComEd just for reference every 50 basis point move up or down is about $0.03 of EPS. So for 2019 for example, the weighted average 30-year is down approximately 50 basis points and you see that with our revised guidance. The 30-year treasury on the forward curve is down approximately 70 basis points versus 12\/31.","I would say though that's one piece of the plan. The capex plan, as we've said, only corporates identified projects that benefit the consumer and improve the liability in the customer experience. We have seen through time that as we get closer to a given period, we find need for an additional investment to continue to improve the liability in that customer experience and we'll continue to work hard at that as we move forward.","Greg Gordon","All right. And my last question, Chris, I know it's a difficult topic, the investigation. The second subpoena and the retirement of Anne Pramaggiore, they're all very disconcerting public disclosures. What is it that you can tell us about how you can potentially resolve this investigation? What kind of timeline are we looking at between now and when you can get the other parties and this comfortable with the way that you've acted or comfortable that they've gotten the information they need, so that we can resolve this?","Chris Crane","There is a grand-jury investigation going on. There's not a lot of details that we can provide at this point. The timeline is not set by us, it's set by the government and the grand-jury and we'll continue to cooperate. Anything we learn from our outside attorneys doing the independent investigation will immediately take action on and correct. But our cooperation with the government -- full cooperation, very open cooperation is the imperative here. And like I said, we're not passing judgment on is anything legal or illegal and some of our past practices with contract lobbyists or consultants. So these things can take a while. I don't expect it will impede our business at all. Going forward is keeping the eye on the ball, improving the operations, driving the reliability while driving efficiency at the same time. The management team is very focused. There's a lot of speculation in news articles. There is things out there that people are speculating on that they're getting to say that the best. So we'll just have to continue the process, continue to cooperate, continue to keep our eye on the ball and when it comes time that we're able to speak we can provide a little bit more color on any corrective actions we've taken. But for now, it's -- we can't go there.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Hey, good morning, team. Hey just wanted to follow up on a few details perhaps we can talk to as a function of the process today. And I'll include that the two of them together here. First the Clean Jobs Coalition and just some of the headlines around where the legislative -- legislation stands today. I know whether it happens this year or more importantly next year. Just wanted to understand how we're framing that conversation today given the realities? And then separately and somewhat related, I'd be curious how would you position the conversation of the franchise extension at ComEd next year? It seems unrelated, but I just want to make sure we at least talk through some of the process on that front as well?","Chris Crane","Sure, I'll cover the first part and Joe Dominguez is with us and I'll let him cover the second part. The conversations, negotiations, strategy for the legislation is still an active conversation with many stakeholders. And when you talk about the Clean Jobs Coalition, just so you know that's not a very structured organization. And to speak as a body, as somebody did to one publication, we're still very close in conversation with some of those members of the coalition and we'll continue, but there is a lot of people involved, there is different coalitions, there's the path to one hundred to the clean jobs coalition. There is the labor. So things are continuing to evolve in conversations with leadership and the legislature are continuing to take place. So it's not like we're stalled or stopped or don't have parties to deal with. Kathleen is doing -- for the Generation side doing a significant part of that. And Joe is working to not only support what the Governor wants and what the State wants, but in the meantime, also protecting the consumers to make sure what we're doing to get to the path to a 100% clean by 2030 is done in a most economic fashion. I'll Kathleen if she wants to add anything more to the first part and I'm going to turn it over to Joe.","Kathleen Barron","The only thing that I would add is that the same news story is talking about that question, Julien. I also mentioned that the FRR is the center piece of this CJC bill. And that's because it's essential to achieving the state's clean energy goals. If we do not address this, the PJM market will send over $1 billion a year to old coal plants rather than investing the money toward the state's clean energy ambition, and that the fact that folks are lobbying and rallying in the capital around this. The fact that it's an important policy change and that it needs to happen right away is something that should be noted.","Now obviously there are other elements of the bill both from the CJC, the path to 100 others that there is not agreement about and that's why it's going to take all stakeholders together to deliver piece of legislation that will get the states to its clean energy goals in a way that's affordable and we are committed, as Chris said, to working with all stakeholders to achieve that goal.","Chris Crane","Joe?","Joe Dominguez","Great, Julien good morning. Let me just start off explaining what the franchise agreement is. At its most basic level, it's an agreement that sets for the procedures for us to use city right away for our infrastructure and the fee schedule that we pay in order to use their right away. So what I'm talking about here that are kind of granular things that are in the franchise agreement is, how many times could you open up a street to interconnect a new business, what the fees are for those operations that kind of granular detail. We've been in negotiations with the city now for some time. There was a pause in those negotiations while the mayor's race was being sorted out and her new team was put in place, I'm pleased with the progress we're making right now.","There are three potential outcomes here. The agreement that is scheduled to come to an end at the end of next calendar year, at the end of 2020. Either party ComEd or the city have an option at the end of this year to terminate the agreement or they could continue to negotiate. As I said the path we're on right now is that we're continuing to negotiate and if we're successful we'll will get a new agreement. If the city elects to terminate at the end of this year, we will continue negotiations and if we do not reach a resolution. It's not like we stop providing electric service to the city but our fee schedule and our procedures will drop out of the franchise agreement and will be governed by the municipal code that'll add a little bit of process to our work, but it doesn't shut down quite obviously our activities. If the city does not issue a notice of termination at the end of the year and we continue to negotiate and can't reach a resolution. Then the agreement by its terms just continues year-to-year until we reach a resolution.","So that's kind of the outline of it. And Julien, if you don't mind, I'd like to provide some additional context Chris and Greg talked a little bit about our performance, but I think it bears on the entire discussion this morning. We are on track at ComEd to deliver our best performance in the history of the company. We talk about being first quartile. We're actually first decile in reliability and arguably best in class. As a result of the good policies, which we've advocated for, 92% of the energy that we deliver to customers comes from zero carbon resources. To put that into context, the next closest large utility is at about 46%. We have a supplier diversity program that is second to none. 41% of our spend this year is with businesses owned by women and people of color as well as veterans.","We are on track as a result of all of this to deliver the best customer satisfaction we've ever seen. And we're doing all of it at affordable rates. Today, our rates are 20% lower than the average for large American cities. Four out of nine of our rate cases have been decreases under the smart grid law, including the last two cases. Chris talked about the investigation and certainly, we'll have learnings as a consequence of it. But it's important for all of the shareholders who invest in our platform to understand that we are doing a lot of things, right. And with some humility could lay claim to being one of the best performing utilities in America. And I just add that for context in all of the things we're talking about today.","Chris Crane","Thanks, Joe.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Excellent. Guys, I appreciate that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Yeah. Hi, good morning. So I guess one of the things that we struggle with these disclosures has just been really what benefit if any you've gotten from legislation over the last few years. And for example on the formula rates, the ROE right now is actually really low and, as Joe mentioned. And then also, I guess, you've gotten the ZECs on Clin and Quad. So just but I think those plants would have been losing a lot of money if you didn't get them. So I guess, maybe you could just give some color of kind of what value really is at risk from this from an investor standpoint because it's just not clear that you've gotten a lot of value out of any legislation over this period?","Chris Crane","Well, we -- the value is the consistency in the process of the rate cases. We are tied to the 30-year and that was a negotiation that was done. If you look at the history of the rate cases and how it has improved the regulatory process and the consistency of the regulatory process, I think there's a lot of value in that. When you get 100% of ask or 99.6% of ask and you're not litigating something over an extended period, it creates predictability. We can't control the 30-year, but we can control the efficiency and the productivity of the system with the right regulatory format and that's what we've done. As for Clinton and Quad cities it did save the plants and it's more than just saving losing cash, we would have shut them down and that issue would have been resolved very quickly. It's meaningful to state in the community but it also is providing a profitable cash flow from those units.","We're working on legislation that would either secure on the other four sites in the state through the FRR process or we will shut those plants down. So -- in a point in time with the low interest rate, you could point to that and say we haven't got anything, but that is not been the historical case, and going forward, we'll watch what we can do if interest rates persist to stay low what action we should take. But I would have to tell you that, I understand the sentiment of your view or your question but there has been a great deal of consistency that's happened and a great deal of ability to invest capital. It's more than just the ROE, right. We have been able to through legislative terms -- been able to consistently invest needed capital for reliability and efficiency and be able to earn a return. They may be a little bit lower returns but we're able to predictably invest the money and predictably get a return on the money.","So that's huge, if you go back historically to what's happened in some of our jurisdictions investing money at risk and then getting the disallowances in the regulatory process was much more damning than having a low 30-year rate and having a low ROE , but still an ROE that's above our cost of capital.","Steve Fleishman","Yeah. Got that. And then just one other question with respect to the nuclear plants. This may be premature, but just could you give us a sense, I am assuming they're -- money-losing on their own the 4 nuclear plants that you're referring too, is there any way to kind of get a sense of the -- if you ended up having to shut them, what it would do?","Chris Crane","We don't evaluate the market response -- projected market response from shutting the plants down. So what we do evaluate is the current financial performance of the free cash flow and earnings and then the forward projected based on the forward curves and look at the credit metrics and the balance sheet to see what's happening. And so we have discussed openly that there -- the four sites are in the future at current forwards with the current capacity market being managed the way it is by PJM versus the needs that the state wants to maintain the clean energy sources with lack of being able to get legislation to change and be able to pull ourselves out of a very inefficient by what the state wants auction process at PJM and go into FRR. They're marginal at best to looking forward to losing cash and earnings.","So that's the situation. Now, I don't think we're announcing the amounts yet. We're continuing to evaluate these numbers, but I can tell you that some are more dire than others at this point and we need to move forward with the legislation to prevent the loss for the state from an environmental perspective and from economic perspective.","Steve Fleishman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next response is from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Just wanted to go back to the point you mentioned about the special committee at the Board with respect to the Illinois investigation. Are there any targeted deliverables in terms of reports or updates and will any of that eventually be made public or is that more for internal purposes?","Chris Crane","I'll let Bill answer that.","Bill Von Hoene","Steven, it's Bill Von Hoene. The special committee of independent directors will continue to meet periodically as needed. They have their own counsel. There is no particular deliverable that you should anticipate out of that. It's just part of the regular process that's undertaking in circumstances such as this. So no particular deliverable should you foresee.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. And in terms of the scope of the investigation, to your knowledge, is this focused solely on Illinois or there are other states or elements of the business involved?","Bill Von Hoene","We're not at liberty to talk about the particulars of the investigation but you've seen what has been reported about the subject matter and the subject matter of that has been reported by us in our case, and I refer you to that.","Stephen Byrd","Yeah. No, that's fair. And then just lastly -- just in terms of the scope of the investigation. I think there are four individuals mentioned. And I think we've seen two announcements from Exelon I assume just at a high level, you had mentioned, Chris at the beginning the policy is to cooperate with investigations. I presume that employees who do not cooperate would not be employed at the firm or is there sort of policy we should think about in terms of how you approach cooperation with the investigations?","Chris Crane","Yeah, the expectation is for all employees and all executives to participate in whatever manner they're requested to, if that's providing information or having discussions. That's the expectation. Peoples employment is based on their total record, but our expectation is full cooperation and ethical behavior.","Operator","Thank you. Your next response is from Praful Mehta from Citigroup.","Praful Mehta","Hi. Good morning. So maybe I just wanted to focus on the generation side a little bit, as comparing Q2 and Q3 power prices and it looks like every region the power prices go higher. However, given as you talked about your volatility was lower and so margins came in lower and there is also a little bit of cost cutting now for 2021. So just wanted to understand how we should think about the generation business, it seems like curves itself aren't enough volatility is now a new element that we need to consider. How should we think about the stability of the generation business? And also in the context of reserve margins in PJM, if you could just give us a little bit more on how you think about the business that would be really helpful.","Chris Crane","Let me have Joe starting and Jim McHugh go into more detail.","Joe Nigro","Praful. Good morning. What -- I think if you think about what the intrinsic strategy of our generation business is, it's been producing electric generation and we deliver it to our customer-facing businesses and that still continues. Obviously, the power markets have some challenges and you've seen what we done -- we've done with our new business, we continue to work hard to find ways to reduce the cost structure both from an O&M and capital investment perspective of our generation assets as well as our Constellation business. And I think that's -- what you'll see us continue to do. I think the second piece of that gets into the industrial strategy of what we're trying to accomplish as a company. You see how we're investing in our utilities, you see how we continue to manage our balance sheet and we continue to return value to the shareholders. That is being done on the back of cash flows that are being generated -- free cash flow that's being generated at Exelon Generation and we will continue to work hard to do that as we continue to transform the Generation business.","So last piece is obviously, as we've talked about in our prepared remarks and with some of the questions, we announced this cost cutting exercising business as usual state, depending on the outcome of the legislation in Illinois, clearly there is other elements to our business that would need to evolve under certain scenarios, so we'll continue to work hard at that and then that'll be dictated by other outcomes.","Ken Cornew","Hey, Praful, it's Ken Cornew. I'll just add a comment. We can -- our strategy continues to be a premier operator of generation particularly nuclear and other clean generation and also be a solutions provider for customers that has not changed. I wouldn't think about the Generation company any differently than that. And I'd like Jim to comment a little more on the customer side of our business.","Jim McHugh","Yeah, so I think it's important to note that the new business generation -- we put new business targets in our hedge disclosures, that's an expectation of the value we're going to create both from our customer-facing businesses as well as the optimization of the assets in the markets. The customer-facing businesses are performing very strongly and the stable value that has been there for a while, we still see good margins in really product enhancements and product solutions for customers who are demanding more. What's happening on our wholesale business side is the lower volatility in the markets which actually where we've reduced our new business targets around that end of the business, which actually, in my view point, leads to more stability. We have an environment where 70% to 75% of the gross margin in our new business will come from the stable customer-facing businesses that we run that are still performing strongly.","So a smaller portion of our overall gross margins would come from this optimization activity. We happen to have an expectation of those numbers in our forward disclosures and that's the number that we are lowering based on this environment where we just see the supply stack being strong in markets like PJM and policy adding more generations to the stack, low natural gas price volatility and low demand growth in markets like PJM. So I think we're able to shift our business focus here to this customer-facing business that's more stable. We can reduce our costs to match that new business model and really provide an environment that I think is a less risk environment for the Generation company.","Praful Mehta","Got you. That's super thoughtful and helpful color. So I appreciate that. I guess just the quick follow-up in terms of the federal investigation, as you mentioned earlier on the call, it could take a long time or it could take some time. So if it does take time and your Illinois legislation for some reason is delayed linked to that. How do you decide on what happens with the units? Do you still run them? Do you still -- nuclear refueling is still continued or do you kind of wait? What kind of decision making you kind of expect around that from a timing perspective?","Chris Crane","Well nothing has been linked to the investigation and the legislation. Right now, there is -- to run any legislation we've got to see a FERC order and we probably won't see the FERC order of PJMs response. Both of those tied together till sometime in the first quarter which will enable us to refine a legislative path going forward. If for some reason we don't garner support as a coalition in a large group of stakeholders to go forward with the legislation by what we see in the market forwards today, plants will start to shut down. That's the reality if something doesn't happen in the Spring. Because PJM will run there are auctions, and if there is lack of legislation or our ability to withhold the load and the generation from that auction, the expectation of clearing megawatts you've seen the trend. So without being able to get capacity revenue for those eight reactors and the market forwards being as low as they are right now. It's uneconomic and the one thing we are not going to do is sit around and damage the balance sheet and create a situation that's unrecoverable. The responsibility of the balance sheet is very felt very strong by the management team and the actions that we will take. If lack of cohesive and complete resolution path forward. We can't sit here for years and bleed cash and build up debt and damage the HoldCo and further damage the Genco.","Praful Mehta","Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Chris Crane, President and CEO for closing remarks.","Chris Crane","I just want to thank everybody for participating in the call today and the questions. And I understand that we can't answer everything right now, but rest assured, we're taking all the actions that are necessary to ensure we can put this behind us. So thank you. With that, I'll close out the call.","Operator","Thank you for joining us today.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Daniel Eggers","Thank you, Josephine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during the call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations.","Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We have scheduled 45 minutes for today's call.","I'll turn it now over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Christopher Crane","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us. We are off to a great start in 2017. In March, we marked our one year anniversary of the merger between Exelon and Pepco Holdings. Since they closed, PHI has successfully executed on merger commitments achieved synergy savings and made significant progress towards full integration.","We also continue to work hard on the regulatory front. Since the beginning of the year PHI closed up the Delmarva Maryland rate case and reached a settlement for our Electric and Gas rate case in Delaware.","We are now down to just a Pepco DC cases from our first plant cycle of rate case filings. That said, our regular team is already started the second cycle of rate cases at Pepco Maryland and ACE\u2019s plant.","At ExGen we completed the acquisition of FitzPatrick power plant representing the 25th nuclear reactor where we have ownership stake. We welcome the new employees to the Exelon family.","We also announced the Exelon Generation renewable joint venture which is allowing us to recycle capital at evaluation meaningfully above the value implied for our ExGen at our current share price.","The JV allows us to make even faster progress on our debt reduction goals without diminishing our commitment to renewable power. We continue to focus on the legal challenges to the zero emission credits or ZEC in New York and Illinois we remain confident that our arguments will prevail.","We\u2019ll cover these points in more detail on the call, but I wanted to highlight what we have done while staying focused on the day to day operations. As shown on slide 5, on a GAAP basis we\u2019ve earned a $1.07 versus $0.19 a share last year and on an operating basis we earned $0.65 versus $0.68 last year which puts as top of our $0.55 to $0.65 range and above consensus of $0.62.","Moving to slide 6, our first quarter operational report was strong, our colored block charts highlight operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities. Legacy Exelon utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. PECO actually had its best customer satisfaction rating ever during the first quarter.","BGE experienced the best ever CAIDI and SAIFI performance of all time. At PHI we are encouraged by the progress we are making and our customers are seeing the benefits. For example, by using a common Lockout-Tagout process, a procedure that establishes a zone of protection while restoring equipment we are able to send over 400 employees and contractors from BGE, ComEd and PECO to support the storm restoration at Delmarva during winter storm Stella.","As a result, Delmarva customers had their power restored two days sooner. Our thanks to everybody that helped in accomplishing that speedy recovery.","The power of Exelon utilities platform has significant benefit to our customers. We continue to improve upon these metrics to meet reliability commitments we have made to provide better service to our customers.","The nuclear team had a great quarter also. They completed three refueling outages and achieved a capacity factor of 94%. They had also had the fastest refueling outage ever for Calvert Cliffs nuclear station 2 running 20 days.","In the power business, we realized renewable energy capture rate of nearly 96% and a power dispatch match over 99%. Our two new bills, CCGTs in Texas have both achieved [first flyer] and are now selling test power onto the grid. The state of the art plants which are totally nearly 2,200 megawatts are on budget, on schedule for full commercial operations in the second quarter. We expect that they will be ready to participate in Texas this summer.","At Constellation, our highly hedged portfolio in 2017 mitigates the impacts of weaker power prices and lower low given their mild winter weather. Even in this recent low volatility environment our C&I business has been able to hold on to the margins and keep customers renewables.","On slide 7, we view 2016 is a great success in delivering our commitments and preserving some of our -- nuclear units by securing compensation for their clean energy attributes.","For 2017, we are focused on executing on these gains we made last year and more importantly affirming the ZEC programs in the quarter. In New York, litigation is further along at this point. On March 29, the judge in New York Federal court heard all arguments on our emotions to dismiss. We made strong arguments of this hearing and believes it lies clearly on our side.","We do ask that \u2013 we do did ask when we expect a decision but the judge has not given a specific timeline or deadline to issue [FERC] order. If we prevail on the motion to dismiss, we would expect the other side to appeal that decision. If the judge denies on motion to dismiss, we will move forward with the cases planned.","As I have said previously, we are confident in the strength of our case. In Illinois, two groups of Plaintiffs have challenged the ZEC in Federal Court and the cases are being before one judge. The Plaintiff\u2019s filed for preliminary injunction on March 31st we intervened in that case on April 10 and we filed motions to dismiss. The judge has held a preliminary injunction motion while he receives whole briefing on the motion to dismiss. He will then determine whether there is a legal basis to go forward. That briefing will be completed by May 15 and the judge is scheduled to inform the parties of his intention on May 22.","In the interim, we start recognizing ZEC revenues in New York on April 1. In Illinois the utilities have filed tariffs to [complete] getting collecting the ZEC payments on June 1. We don\u2019t expect the actual ZEC procurement process in Illinois to conclude until later in the fall we remain confident that the ZEC programs will be upheld in the courts to the benefit of the state, the communities and these valuable resources.","As we have discussed last year in our carbon policy principles, we see state programs as an essential mechanism until we have a more cohesive federal policy that values clean base load generation. Energy\u2019s Secretary, -- recent directed to look at the importance of preserving base load generation is early but encouraging. We appreciate the Secretary\u2019s focus to promote the needed market reforms to compensate these assets. We will support the DOEs effort as they move forward.","Turning to the upcoming PJM auction, we understand the investment community is paying close attention particularly after the disappointing MISO capacity auction results. Joe Nigro is available to answer more detailed questions if you have them, but let me share a few thoughts around the auction.","To the two positive we are going to a 100% CP for the first time which will put a higher performance burden on the entire fleet. We still think this should lead to a more responsible bidding given the higher risk around non-performance.","The CETL numbers or the import capacity into ComEd and EMAAC LDAs have tightened this year versus last year. The tightening can flag more constraint market conditions than last year in these zones which could help in separation.","So the negative PGM load, its demand forecast again for this auction in the approved seasonal aggregation that will allow products that otherwise would not clear to participate in a 100% CP world.","Finally, we have the risk of more uneconomical generation being built primarily in Pennsylvania in Ohio. These drivers were important but we still expect clearing prices to come down to bidding behavior.","You have seen our bid our assets in recent auctions to reflect the underlying economic needs of the individual plants, which in turn had led to some of our plants not clearing. You should expect us to bid our assets in the same responsible fashion in this next upcoming auction.","Now let me turn the call over to Jack to walk through the numbers.","Jonathan Thayer","Thank you Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the events that occurred this quarter.","Turning to slide 8, we had a strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the first quarter we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.65 per share, at the top of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. This compares to $0.68 per share for the first quarter of 2016.","Exelon\u2019s utilities delivered a combined $0.47 per share versus our plant and utility results were impacted by unfavorable weather at PECO and PHI which was more than offset by O&M timing across all the utilities.","With 70% of our distribution rate base and decoupled jurisdictions including ComEd starting in 2017, we experienced less volatility on our utility earnings from record warm weather in January and February than if we did not have these programs. To help put this winter in context, this was the first time in 146 years when there was no snow on the ground at Chicago for both January and February.","Looking across PJM, January and February was the warmest on record since data started being collected in 1950. Generation had a strong quarter relative to plan earning $0.18 per share. We had good performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted and our constellation team once again delivered strong results despite weak power prices and low volatility.","Turning to slide 9. The $0.65 per share in the first quarter of this year was $0.03 per share lower than the first quarter of 2016. To the positive, we had a full quarter of contribution from PHI relative to only 8 days last year, which added $0.09. The other utilities benefitted from rate relief and higher rate base, partly offset at PECO with even milder weather than last year.","ExGen was down year-over-year primarily on the loan impacts of lower capacity prices and power price realization as well as more planned refueling outages.","Turning to slide 10, we are reaffirming our full year guidance in this range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.45 to $0.55 in the second quarter compared with $0.65 last year. Our second quarter results will include contributions from the FitzPatrick plants and the plants of the New York ZEC program that started on April 1.","The Illinois ZEC legislation will go into effect on June 1, and plant procurement is expected to occur later this fall. Plants receiving contracts with recognized revenues retroactive the June 1st effective date.","Moving to slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute well delivering strong earned returns in the quarter. Looking at the trailing 12-month booked ROEs we saw nice improvements even relative to what we showed last quarter. At PHI we saw all of the utilities registered gains with some that are coming as revenues from the first cycle of rate cases are starting to flow through to results.","For the Legacy Exelon utilities we continue to see strong earned ROEs over 10% that led the consolidated Exelon\u2019s utilities platform to nearly 10% including PHI. We have plenty of work to do at Utilities and with our regulators to keep improving the product we are delivering to our customers, but we are happy with where the overall business is performing. We are obviously pleased with where our earned ROEs are trending, but I want to remind you that there will be variability in the earned ROEs that are different utilities as we go forward. The timing of rate case implementation, weather comparability and in-service states were all at back results. We think the ability to earn strong ROEs and the plan that we had in plan at PHI they improved their ROEs will be the recipe for our future success.","On slide 12 we have an update on our rate cases. Since our fourth quarter call, we have closed out the Delmarva Maryland case with a revenue increase of $38 million. We\u2019ve also reached unanimous settlement in our Delmarva Delaware Electric and gas cases for $31.5 million and $4.9 million respectively and would expect commission approval during the second quarter.","From our first cycle of planned rate cases we are now down just to the Pepco DC case but we expect the commission decision later in July. We are proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams, these efforts are helping to get PHI\u2019s revenues and earned book ROEs back on course while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers.","As we have shared with you many times before, we\u2019ve always viewed the turnaround in PHI earned ROEs as a \u2013 rate case cycle process. To that end, we filed our second rate cases in ACE and Pepco Maryland this quarter. Combined with the outstanding cases from the first cycle that I previously mentioned we are currently asking for $252 million in revenues which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions.","We expect the final ruling on Pepco Maryland and ACE likely in Q4, 2017 and first quarter of 2018 respectively. We plan to file a second cycle of cases in most if not all of PHI\u2019s jurisdictions in 2017 with all completed by the end of 2018 putting us in a position to earn between 9% and 10% ROEs in 2019. More details on the rate cases and the schedules to be found on slide 29 through 36 in the appendix.","Slide 13, provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter, we executed on $150 million of Power New Business and $50 million of Non-Power New Business. We are highly hedged for the rest of this year and have fell down -- generation to load matching strategy.","Total gross margin decreased in the first quarter by $50 million in both 2018 and 2019 due to the impact of price changes on our order portfolio. We ended the quarter approximately 12% to 15% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 an 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align to our view of spot market upside at [Nine]. Although we have increased our lengths in other regions as well.","We are comfortable to be more open when we look at market fundamentals. For example, oil regional natural gas prices today are over a $1 per MMbtu higher than they realized last year, yet the forwards for power are only about $1 per megawatt higher. We do not believe that is a sustainable situation.","To that point I should note that power prices have risen since the start of the second quarter and have reversed about half of the first quarter price declines.","On slide 14 we have highlighted some key recent events. On March 31, 2017 we executed on the creation of the Exelon Generation renewable JV, which will provide us with $400 million of pretax cash, including allocated debt that puts total JV Enterprise value at approximately $1.7 billion, the price implies an EV to EBITDA multiple over ten times and $1 per \u2013 [KW] value over $1,200.","The JV consists of 1,296 megawatts of renewable generation capacity which is about 35% of our renewable output and has an average contract life of 14 years. The JV structure provides the option to drop down contracted renewable assets from our portfolio in the future. The proceeds from this sale will be used to accelerate our deleveraging strategy.","Also on March 31, we closed on the acquisition of the FitzPatrick nuclear station from Entergy which adds 838 megawatts of nuclear capacity to our portfolio. The FitzPatrick plant is part of the New York ZEC program and will receive ZEC payments for the next 12 years which started on April 1. The plant is now operated by Exelon and I am happy to report we had a clean cut over of FitzPatrick onto the Exelon platform. We are excited to have the FitzPatrick employees as part of the Exelon family.","Our Exelon generation Texas partnership, commonly referred to as EGTP is a portfolio of 3,476 megawatts of gas generation in Texas. In 2014, we raised $675 million of non-recourse project finance for the assets which currently has a balance of approximately $650 million. With a downturn in ERCOT power markets these assets have been under pressure with a debt rating at a discount of base value for some time and the plant is struggling to generate adequate cash flows. Due to the combination of challenge cash flows and our decision not to inject additional equity we have come to terms with the lenders to pursue an orderly sale of the assets on their...","The modest current earnings and all of the debt are still included in our financial outlook. However, we see the ultimate exit from these assets being accretive to our UPS] and debt to EBITDA multiples starting in 2018. In light of the process we are not in a position to expand further out in this transaction.","Finally during the quarter, we decided to discontinue the sales process of Mystic 8&9 assets. We were exploring a sale of these assets as a direct result of interest received from potential buyers. During the sales process we ran into some issues with the fuel supply agreement that needs to be addressed. And as we said we would only transact if we were to realize a price greater than our \u2013 value. Our continuing to own these assets does not impact our commitments on our debt-to-EBTIDA target and debt reduction plans that we\u2019ve already shared with you.","Turning to slide 15, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment grade credit rating. We are forecasting to be a 3.2 times net-to-EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to our long term target of three times debt-to-EBITDA.","On a recourse debt basis, we are already well ahead of our target and taking into account the sale of EGTP we would be on target overall. As we said before we will look to [Indiscernible] whole project once we have reached three times target at ExGen.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.","Christopher Crane","Thanks, Jack. This brings us to back to our value proposition shown on slide 16 which ain\u2019t familiar. It is unchanged from our last earnings report and we remain committed to these points. We continue to grow their utility rate base at 6.5% annually through 2020 and regulated EPS by 6% to 8% annually through 2020. We continue to use free cash flow generated at ExGen to fund the incremental equity needs of the utilities of $2.5 billion and pay down approximately $3 billion of debt over the next four years at ExGen and the Holding Company. We are focused on optimizing value for ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon free generation fleet closing uneconomic plans, opportunistically selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plan and maximizing value through our gentle load matching strategy. We continue to focus on sustaining strong investment grade credit metrics and grow our dividend in a consistent visible manner.","Thank you for your interest and we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Greg Gordon","Hello good morning.","Christopher Crane","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","I notice that when you gave the update on your cash flow projections for the balance of the year that it\u2019s several hundred million dollars higher. I don\u2019t remember exactly the slide number. It\u2019s slide 18. It looks like the utilities are the major contributors to that with a modest decline and expected ExGen cash flow, can you give us a little more color on that?","Christopher Crane","Sure Greg. It is the utilities and some of its energy efficiency timing and some of its just working capital, so we are about I think $200 million roughly higher than our expectation.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Is that sort of a \u2013 is that a sort of a permanent affect in terms of as I think about rolling the balance sheet forward or is that more of a timing issue on when you are going to collect cash flows or spend capital?","Christopher Crane","The working capital is more of a timing issue, some of the energy efficiency is permanent.","Greg Gordon","Okay, can you give us the sense of what the split is there?","Christopher Crane","$100 million energy efficiency, sorry.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you very much. Second question and maybe it\u2019s not something you are able to really engage with me on the call on, but one of the reasons why I think the stock has underperformed is because people are looking obviously you\u2019ve had a little bit of softness in the 18,19 curves. You already told us that\u2019s bounced a little bit but if people are looking forward to the sort of 2020 role coming this fall and looking at the open theoretically open position and worried about the capacity market print and thinking while 2020 is going to be another down year. So I don\u2019t know if you can comment on how that looks today and also how that dovetails with what you continue to do with vis-\u00e0-vis debt reduction at the \u2013 at ExGen because while the balance sheet looks like it\u2019s in absolutely great shape today if EBITDA keeps going south, there is sort of a bar keeps going up every year in terms of what you have to do with your cash flow to keep it at that level of leverage.","Christopher Crane","A couple of thoughts Greg. One, I think it\u2019s probably given the liquidity in the market premature to forecast our 2020 ExGen earnings. But one thing to keep in context, on a recourse basis by 2020 we\u2019ll have $4 billion of debt. That is the most pristine balance sheet I think in this sector. So, from a strength perspective with the balance sheet and the ability to deal with the cyclicality of markets I think we are well positioned. Our fundamental perspective would be that as liquidity returns to the market prices are going up across and our hedging approach and the length that we are carrying relative to ratable is the master of that. So I think it\u2019s meaningfully premature to be trading on 20\/20 in 2017.","Greg Gordon","Fair enough. Thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning guys.","Christopher Crane","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold","Question on, you mentioned I think that you would be bidding the units in the PJM auction and the same I think you said responsible fashion. Can you give us any insight into what you see as different in the PJM auction set up with respect to say the and the QUAD which has the ZEC and Clinton which obviously cleared at a low price in MISO is there anything we should be thinking as we compare those two situations?","Joseph Nigro","Good morning. It\u2019s Joe Nigro. I\u2019ll take that question and answer it and if I\u2019ll start by saying we have a long standing practice of really not discussing our bidding strategy around the capacity auctions where we think it will clear. I think there is one thing that we have to take into account; it\u2019s the timing that you auctioned. The MISO auction was for June of this year through May of next year, and the PJM auction obviously is much further out in the curve. When you think about the operations of the power plant and the fuel loaded in the [Indiscernible] for example, that plant was going to continue to operate during that period.","What I\u2019d most say about QUAD cities in the bidding is we are going to continue to remain responsible in the way we bid our capacity reflecting the underlying economics of our plant and that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve done with past options. I think the major question mark with this option continues to be as Chris mentioned bidding behavior from the existing generation as well as the discipline associated with new goals. As it relates to existing facilities we continue to see economically challenged plants that have cleared previous options and in addition to that we see the economics, the new goals being marginal.","In your last option we cleared about 27 gig watts of base capacity which was about 16% of the total procurement and it remains to be seen how that 27 gig watts would participate in this auction but the big variables as I mentioned will continue to be the bidding of all the plants and we will remain discipline in that regard with all our facilities.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. Thanks, Joe. And then, could I also ask on that, I guess, topical issue today, but can you quantify to or describe your exposure to Westinghouse as a supplier presumably in the field business primarily and how we should -- is there any concerns you have with regard to the bankruptcy?","Christopher Crane","It\u2019s something that we follow closely not only as a supplier but for the industry. We have reviewed our positions that we have commercially with them. We\u2019re not concerned at this time, but we\u2019ll continue to watch it closely few fabrication. We continue to see that is an ongoing entity in the services business. We continue to gain support to see that is an ongoing entity. None of us know how it\u2019s going to shake out yet, but we have minimal exposure there.","Jonathan Arnold","So, can you give us sort of percentage of the fleet of that service or supply fuel too perhaps?","Christopher Crane","I can get the number for you. We continue to competitively bid our reactor fuel suppliers between multiple suppliers and we move that around based off of pricing but we are not held hostage to a single entity on fuel fabrication.","Jonathan Arnold","All right. Thanks Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Yes. Hi, good morning. Just wanted to get your thoughts on this DOE review going on baseload generation and maybe we also just have this FERC Conference and how these might tie into kind of state-by-state ZEC process that has occurred so far, we\u2019re trying to be of help this for generation. What could come out of DOE?","Christopher Crane","Yes. Steve, let me start off and talk a little bit about the Technical Conference over the last couple of days. There were three buckets of issues that I think we got to look at. One is carbon pricing on the market and what FERC could do to facilitate the states who are interested in doing that.","The second bucket would be the Mopar issues, that\u2019s PJM Grid 2020 [Indiscernible] ISO put out, and the third bucket are energy reforms. And so I think all three of these things are implied as well in connection with the Secretaries. Now, let me talk about the three. First, we think there was a constructive discussion around having one of the issues that has limited the ability of states to incorporate aggressive pricings between the states and I think there was good discussion around what FERC could do to address that problem.","There is I think a plenty of degree to solve Technical Conference, a growing recognition that putting carbon explicitly in the market is something that would address a lot of these issues and there is growing receptivity to that. The issue of the Mopar that's where I think it most directly addresses the state ZEC programs and the REC programs.","The New England proposal doesn't deal with existing baseload generation or existing generation of any kind, frankly and that\u2019s consistent with FERC\u2019s President. And so that template wouldn\u2019t have any effect on the state programs. The PJM proposal does however deal with existing resources. And we have not historically supported that proposal. We recognize PJM has made some important changes and those were talked about at the Technical conferences.","The issue with the Mopar from our perspective is that it is the distraction from some unfinished work that we believe FERC and PJM want to get to first. Unfortunately it\u2019s become little bit of tempest in a teapot, in a sense that there\u2019s a false narrative out there that the challenges to the IPP sector are driven by ZEC and REC policies, when in fact number of our college in business saw equity value is dropped by 70% and 80% before the ZEC even came in to our dialogue.","So we don\u2019t think the Mopar is an approach that it\u2019s going to be workable, applies in a face of what states are looking to do. I don\u2019t think it will that effective. We talked about MISO Zone 4, its notable that. And we did Clinton in a way where we\u2019d not have cleared the matter of auction or had been excluded by Mopar, the price in MISO would have risen from a$1.50 to $5 a megawatt that certainly not going to address the downstate issues that ING and others are facing.","At the end, we agree with what Chairman, [Indiscernible] and she basically question the wisdom of approaching this problem set with more Mopars per units that are receiving state environmental attribute payments. And I think that's why New York ISO, MISO and others are not going in that direction. So, that\u2019s we don\u2019t agree with the direction on the Mopar, but let me talk to you about something important that came up during recession and I think we do reporting that. And that is [India] talked about in Monday session and I\u2019m going to loosely quote saying that we politely ignored energy market design problems that are under value in baseload access.","And here, we can\u2019t afford to ignore those problems any more. And we completely agree with that. We talk and talk over the last few years of that energy pricing problems in the markets, can\u2019t back sold, negative pricing, to back that certain units and set price certain hours, the over commitment of resources driving uplift and a whole host of issues that we\u2019ve had technical conference is on and white paper on and we just having gotten, started and working on that. And as a consequence, and not addressing those energy market issues, states and our customers are being deprived of assets that add resiliency, they add fuel diversity and they add some environmental benefit.","And so, what we expect to do at the end of the technical conference you heard California and others echo this is we want set a deadline for bringing to conclusion again our energy market reforms that we\u2019ve talked about. And we think that talking about Mopars or other things that interfere with states rates before we fixed the energy market problems it\u2019s a little bit like putting your shoes on before you putting your pants up.","At the end of the day, it makes you look a little bit sold. And so once we get a reconstituted format at FERC, we\u2019re going to go after these energy price reforms and we think Secretary Perry's memo opens the door to address these issues. So we think for last couple of days at Secretary Perry's memo gives us an opening to look at some unfinished business that we have get at it. So, long answer, big subject, but we see lot of promise than we what we saw in last couple of days and we\u2019d see a lot of promise with the DOE is working on that. We have to get this stuff over the finish line.","Steve Fleishman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS Securities.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good morning everyone.","Christopher Crane","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, perhaps just to take it back couple of questions here, can we talk about the non nuclear generation strategy, specifically I wanted to just follow-up little bit on the renewable sell down. First, what's the remaining EBITDA that could be eligible to be sold down if you want to qualify it that way?","And then secondly, can you talk about whether or not you would eventually review the mystic sales. Is this something about restructuring the fuel arrangement and a matter of time or is probably something that it\u2019s going to be on the back burner for a little bit? And actually I\u2019ll throw the third question at the same time. With regards to Texas its not be very clear about this deed. The new Texas combined cycle assets or separate discrete process to the extent which that you ultimately divest and\/or lose control of the ExGen taxes asset. It\u2019s correct?","Christopher Crane","That last question is correct. And they\u2019re totally separate and would be operated that way. They are not part of the divestiture process. On the first two questions, Jack.","Jack Thayer","So Julien, with the JV structure we have the opportunity to sell down further assets, the two that come to mind are our AVSR solar facility which in 29th but that would not occur until 2019, but we\u2019ve got to get through the ITC recovery period for that. And the second assets would be our Albany Green Energy facility, it is wood-burning plant that hasn\u2019t contract to off-takers down in Georgia, that\u2019s coming online this year which could facilitate to drop down end of 2017 more likely 2018 and that\u2019s all contemplated as part of the overall structure with the JV.","With respect to the EBITDA I\u2019m not going to drill down into that and with respect to the GDP given the sales process that we\u2019re working with the lenders on, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s pretty impress to disclose the \u2013 and then with respect to Mystic, again, I answer that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Yes. Would you revisit Mystic, just to follow-up on that one or is that something is off of the table for now?","Christopher Crane","We\u2019re not going to talk a lot of details, but as we see in asset in that portfolio as a potential to create value and recycled capital we\u2019ll look at them. We will look at it on an annual basis. We have some work to do on that one site, but we\u2019ll continue to evaluate it going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Just to understand the JV structure bit further. On the renewable sale why not sell down the whole entity overtime as part of a wider deleveraging, why opt for this sort of JV structure?","Christopher Crane","We\u2019re still committed to clean portfolio. It\u2019s being in the renewable business is still part of our strategy. At this point maintaining the operational control, that maintenance and other facilities is important for us for our investment. And we\u2019re getting a fair return from those, but at this point we felt that the valuation that we were getting in the market allowed us to recycle the capitals, so we\u2019re not existing the renewable business and we continue to put about 125 million a year into solar at the CNI level or some of our national customers and We\u2019ll continue to look at that portfolio how to best manage those investments going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you for the patient.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Hi. Good morning.","Christopher Crane","Hi, Steve.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to follow-up up on Steve\u2019s question on the department of energy review. In terms of potential agencies or entities involved in your mind is that most likely to be FERC or Federal Legislation, in other words, I guess I'm struggling to figure out how the Department of Energy itself could provide economic support for baseload whether the nuclear, coal or gas. What sort of entities would most likely be involved and I guess I\u2019m thinking if the states are providing value for environmental benefits from ZECs and the ISOs are providing the reliability benefits through capacity performance. What other elements are not being captured? Or what other tools are potential here?","Christopher Crane","Yes. Let me assume this [Indiscernible] couple of parts to that. First we think the DOE has an important role in setting policy, I think the implementation inform of that policy could in certain instances being new legislation, it could be things that are at the ARC in terms of regulatory burdens on nuclear, but it would involve the commission in that sense, it could involve changes in rules at FERC. But DOE is going to have an important voice in our view and this policy discussion and we\u2019ll set the tone even if you can\u2019t complete all of the objectives.","There are certain tools that DOE has Section 202(c) authority under the Federal Power Act as an example allows them to secure resources in the market that are needed. That is a power that has been used sparingly I thing only two times in history, but certainly there is a discussion around the use of it for baseload resources.","With regard to attribute payments I think environmental attribute payments I think we\u2019re kind of been to wait and see where the administration goes on carbon, but I think you\u2019re general sentiment is correct that that\u2019s not something we see immediately coming out of the department. But U.S. kind of more fundamental question is, states are covering environmental and PJM is covering the liability. What\u2019s left? Well, I tell you what\u2019s left. What\u2019s left is resiliency which is a little bit of a different concept than reliability. Reliability assumes that pipeline infrastructure and other critical pieces are in place. PJM assumes that and says whether there is some reliability impacts or the reliability expectations could be met. Resiliency looks a little bit deeper at that and understands the impact of pipeline disruptions on natural gas-fired generation and should we start modeling those sorts of things, is there a value there.","The other piece is that it\u2019s not currently valued in the market is fuel diversity. As we transition to a market that is made up more and more of just natural gas, we\u2019re exposing our customers to fuel price volatility in the long run. Those things because of the short-term nature of the market are fully considered, but if you look at Secretary Perry\u2019s memo and it gets a second bullet point, second and third bullet points so that memo address those very issues.","Stephen Byrd","That\u2019s very, very helpful to think through. Really appreciate that. And then just I wanted to revisit your nuclear operational capabilities and appetite for growing your ownership of nuclear plants. I mean you acknowledge as a very strong nuclear owner and operator. Under what circumstances would you think about increasing ownership of merchant nuclear generation? What kind of criteria would you think about in terms of your appetite for doing so?","Christopher Crane","Yes. We have interest in increasing merchant exposure across any technology. What we would look at is only contracted secure revenue streams going forward, it\u2019s pretty clear cut.","Stephen Byrd","That makes sense. But that could include state to state sort to determine payments rather than a classic PPAs, is that fair?","Christopher Crane","Yes. That is fair.","Stephen Byrd","Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","Christopher Crane","Thanks. It\u2019s time for one more question, operator.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Christopher Crane","Good morning.","Shahriar Pourreza","Just real question on how you sort of thinking about the dividend and you\u2019ve got utility that\u2019d eventually to sell fund, sell fund the dividend and cover the whole co-interest. What data points are you looking at where you could sort of think about revisiting the growth rate. Is sort of clarity around PJM? Is clarity around ZECs? What sort of a data point we should be thinking about?","Christopher Crane","Yes. We updated our dividend policy. The board updated the dividend policy about a year ago and gave you the clarity through 2018 on annual 2.5% increase of the dividend. As we said at the time we want to give you a longer-term view on dividend policy. What we need to do is execute on our rate cases in our efficiency at the utilities and in costs and operations.","And so 2017 is going to be a big year to continue to have that focus. And so as we come through 2000 into 2018 we can have a dialogue with the board looking at we\u2019re achieving or close to achieving the goal towards 2018, 2019 on where we were going financially in our focus and strategy. So next year \u2013 this year is a big to perform. Next year is a year where we should be working very hard to give you a longer term view.","Shahriar Pourreza","Excellent. And then just lastly on retail, just maybe a little bit of an update. I mean, obviously there are some businesses that have changed hands. There some consolidation. There\u2019s some obviously some trends, segment turnings into bit of oligopoly. So I'm curious on just from a generality standpoint what you're seeing as far as the margin environment and that would be helpful?","Joseph Nigro","Good morning. It\u2019s Joe Nigro. I\u2019ll answer the last question first. Our retail margins for C&I origination still remain between that $2 to $4 we talked about well within that payment. The market hasn\u2019t seen volatility and we continue to monitor that. The consolidation overall helps because there is less participants in the marketplace we\u2019ve acquired companies ourselves, obviously all the big entities that have come to this face that hasn\u2019t been there historically. That\u2019s been a positive. We have seen some aggressive bidding behavior by some smaller entities in certain sectors like government, contracting and other things but overall we continue to monitor this very closely and we are comfortable with the projections we have in our margins remain in net $2 to $4 space.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. Terrific. Thanks guys.","Christopher Crane","Thanks, Pou.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Crane for closing remarks.","Christopher Crane","Thank you. We appreciate your time and interest in Exelon. We really are off to a great start in 2017 and look forward to executing on the commitments we\u2019ve made to you. So appreciate your time today and I\u2019ll end the call.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines."],"8588":["Exelon Corp.

My name is Prasanthi and I'll be facilitating the audio portion of today's \u2013 and active broadcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. For those of you on this stream, please take note of the options available in your event console.","At this time, I would like to turn the show over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investors Relations.","Dan L. Eggers - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Prasanthi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material, comments made during this call, and our Risk Factors section in the earnings release, and the 10-Q, which we expect to file on May 10. Please refer to today's 8-K, the 10-Q, and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.","Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We've scheduled 45 minutes for today's call.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning. Thanks for joining us this morning. Once again we had a great quarter financially, where we closed near the upper end of the range even with the milder weather. And operationally, our utilities and plants continue to operate at high levels.","The big news for the quarter is we closed the Pepco Holdings transaction in March. We are excited to have Pepco utilities as part of the Exelon family. We know this has been a long journey and it took much longer than any of us anticipated, but we appreciate the patience of our investors as we pursued the merger. Our employees who worked tirelessly from the inception to the completion of the deal and the many stakeholders who've supported was critical to getting the deal done.","PHI is an important piece of our strategy to become a more regulated company with more stable earnings streams. While we are still in the early stages of integrating PHI, PHI's earnings outlook is consistent, if not better, than what we showed you at EEI. It brings meaningful benefits to our customers, communities in Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, including bill credits and reliability investments. More than $500 million in total commitments have been made and will be achieved due to this merger.","We're now focused on integrating Pepco into Exelon. We will bring our management model and our best practices to improve the experience of our customers. The transaction confirms Exelon's role as a leader in the industry. We serve 10 million customers, more than any other utility company. We will spend nearly $23 billion in capital across our utilities and generating business over the next three years, which is the second-highest among our peers. We are the largest pure T&D by rate base and within the top five when including rate base generation.","We are the second-largest generator of electricity in the country, the largest competitor by a factor of nearly two, while producing power at the lowest carbon intensity of any large generator. We are the leader in the retail electric provider in the country serving 139 terawatts. The culture of the industry leadership is found throughout our organization, positioning us very well for the future.","Switching to operational performance. Our first quarter operating performance was strong and we're on track for a strong year. At our legacy utilities, our SAIFI and CAIDI are on track to meet reliability targets; we are in top quartile in both. At the GenCo, our nuclear plants ran at a capacity factor of 95.8%, our solar and wind assets outperformed their energy capture targets.","Switching to Illinois in the nuclear plants. While there is much to celebrate this quarter, we also need to make tough decisions on the future of Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear stations in Illinois. The board has given me authority to go forward with early retirements for Clinton and Quad Cities plants, if for Clinton adequate legislation is not passed during the spring legislative session that is scheduled to end May 31, and if for Quad Cities adequate legislation is not passed and the plant does not clear the upcoming PJM auction. Otherwise, we plan to retire Clinton on June 1, 2017, and Quad Cities on June 1, 2018. This is consistent with planned refueling outage and capacity market obligations.","We committed to our employees, our shareholders and the communities to try to find a path to profitability for our distressed assets. This is because these plants are vital to the communities that they are located in and provide economic and environmental value to the state. The state's own analysis showed that closing Clinton and Quad Cities would result in $1.2 billion in lost economic activity and 4,200 jobs lost, and a significant reduction of supply of reliable electricity for Illinois residents and businesses.","We worked hard over the last few years to find a path to sustainable profitability. To bring $120 million in strategic capital to these plants, we've pursued legislation and regulatory market changes. We've been successful in some areas: the PJM market reforms that were put into place last year, the cost reductions that we've achieved, and the large number of stakeholders who have worked so hard to help in this fight. We have strong allies in our cause, our employees, our plant communities, the bill sponsors and co-sponsors, our partners in labor, and our vendors among others. I want to thank them all very much for their support and regret the impact on this decision that we have on them.","But for reasons outside of our control, we have not seen progress in Illinois policy reforms, also the Supreme Court stay creates uncertainty regarding the EPA's Clean Power Plan. Power prices have fallen to a 15-year low in PJM, causing the economics of Clinton and Quad Cities to further deteriorate. These plants have lost $800 million in cash flow from 2009 to 2015. Just to be clear, we are not covering our operating costs or our risks, let alone receiving a return on our invested capital. We've done all we can up to this point and we continue to work through the spring legislative session to enact the much needed reforms. However, without adequate legislation we no longer see a path to profitability and no longer can sustain the ongoing losses.","On a more positive note, we continue to see a pathway to reform in New York where Governor Cuomo, the legislature, the Public Service Commission have recognized a need to preserve the state's nuclear plants. New York is quickly moving forward to implement a clean energy standard that will allow us to continue to operate our challenged Ginna and Nine Mile plants.","I'll turn the call over to Jack to discuss the first quarter results further.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, 2016 guidance, update our gross margin disclosures and provide an update on developments since Q4.","I'll start on slide eight. As Chris stated, we had a strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the first quarter we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.68 per share, near the top of our guidance range of $0.60 per share to $0.70 per share. This compares to $0.71 per share for the first quarter of 2015. Exelon's utilities delivered a combined $0.37 per share. During the quarter, we saw unfavorable mild weather at PECO and ComEd versus planned, which was partially offset by lower bad debt expense at BGE. There are only eight days of PHI included in our results, which had a minimal impact on the quarter.","Generation had a great quarter, earning $0.34 per share. We had strong performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted. And while weak power prices and lower volatility were a drag, our Constellation team delivered strong results. Our generation to load matching strategy continues to provide value and we benefited from a lower cost to serve our customers.","For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. This compares to our realized earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2015. The appendix contains details on our first quarter financial results compared to the first quarter of 2015 results by operating company on slide 16 and 17.","Turning to slide nine, we are affirming our full-year guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share which now includes the contribution from PHI and assumes an average of 926 million shares outstanding for 2016. This should help calibrate your segment models.","On slide 10, we are still working through a comprehensive financial plan now that we have closed the PHI deal, but want to address the pieces that we can today. We are reaffirming our earnings growth at our legacy utilities of 7% to 9% per year from 2015 to 2018. On PHI, we are still working through the plan, but see the contribution equal to or better than what we showed you at EEI and consistent with sustaining our 7% to 9% utility growth target.","On slide 11, to meet these growth targets we are going to be busy on the regulatory front. The PHI utilities have been out of rate cases for at least two years. We are continuing to invest $800 million per year to improve reliability and customer service leading to the low-earned ROEs that we show on slide 30 in the appendix. However, by the third quarter, we plan to file distribution cases in all of PHI's jurisdictions and expect decisions in all cases by the middle of next year providing needed revenue release.","Atlantic City Electric and Pepco Maryland have already filed their cases. ACE filed an electric distribution base rate case on March 22 with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities requesting an $84 million revenue increase and a 10.6% return on equity. It also included PowerAhead, a five-year $176 million grid resiliency plan.","On April 19, Pepco requested a rate increase of $127 million with the Maryland's Public Service Commission. The rate cases include smart meter recovery and a two-year $32 million grid resiliency plan. In addition to reducing the number and length of outages, Pepco's five-year smart grid program is generating nearly $4 in customer benefits for every $1 invested.","In addition, ComEd made its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission. ComEd requested a revenue requirement increase of $138 million reflecting approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. Those investments, which included $663 million for smart grid-related work has helped strengthen and modernize the electric system, resulting in record power reliability and customer satisfaction, operational savings, and new ways to save on electric bills for ComEd customers. More details on the rate cases can be found on slide 33 \u2013 slides 34 through 37 in the appendix.","Slide 12 provides our first quarter gross margin update. In 2016 total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter we executed on $200 million of power new business and $100 million of non-power new business. We are highly hedged for the rest of this year and well-balanced on our generation to load matching strategy. Total gross margin decreased in the first quarter by $150 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2018, as PJM power prices moved approximately $1.60 to $2.10 lower since the beginning of the year. We ended the quarter approximately 5% to 8% behind ratable in both of these years when considering cross-commodity hedges with a majority of modeling concentrated in the Midwest to align to our fundamental view of spot market upside at NiHub.","Power prices have risen since the start of the second quarter and we are timing our hedging activity to lock in the value of the recent price increases while remaining well positioned to capture our fundamental view.","On slide 13, I wanted to give you a quick update on some tax implications that are associated with the completion of the PHI merger. With the inclusion of PHI, we expect to realize $700 million to $850 million of additional cash from 2017 to 2019 related to legacy NOLs and the impacts of bonus depreciation. However, now, as a very modest cash tax payer for 2018, we have less ability to take the domestic production activities deduction, or DPAD, in 2018 which effectively increases our overall consolidated tax rate by as much as 200 basis points or the equivalent of $0.06 to $0.08 per share in 2018. Although this is a one-time negative impact to 2018 ExGen earnings, it comes with significant positive cash flow and we expect to return to normalized tax rates in 2019.","With the variability of interest rates, I'd like to remind you that ComEd's allowed ROE is based on a 30-year treasury rate plus 580 basis points, and thus sensitive to moves in this rate. Every 25 basis point move in treasury rates results in a $0.01 move in EPS.","Before turning the call over to Chris, I wanted to raise a few scheduling points. We'll be hosting an Analyst Day on August 10 in Philadelphia and we'll get details around shortly. Therefore, we will not be having a second quarter earnings call and will release earnings before Analyst Day.","I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jack. Just closing out on slide 14, the capital allocation philosophy. I want to cover that before we turn it over to Q&A, and take a moment to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy. Balance sheet strength remains a top financial priority. We have a strong strategy to deliver stable growth, sustainable earnings, and an attractive dividend to our shareholders. We will be growing that dividend at 2.5% each year for the next three years, starting with the dividend payable in June. From a capital deployment perspective, we will continue to harvest free cash flow from the generation business to invest primarily in our utilities to benefit our customers, invest in long-term contracted assets which meet our return requirements, and return capital to our shareholders. This is the right strategy for our markets and our assets.","Thanks and we'll open the line up now for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we do have audio question from Stephen Byrd (17:13).","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Steve (17:15).","Unknown Speaker","Start on the Illinois legislation. And wonder if you could speak to the breadth of support that you have for the proposal. And then also if you could just go through the mechanics of if it was implemented, how it'd work? So we can start to think about modeling the impacts.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Joe, you want to cover that?","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Sure. Steve (17:36), the support is the same support we had for the original bill, labor, the host communities. And in addition, we now have the support of some groups that represent climate scientists and others that are concerned with greenhouse gas emissions.","In terms of how the program would work, let me just start with a policy analogy that I think all of you are familiar with. Existing state RPS programs for renewables provide compensation of qualified resources through renewable energy credits, RECs. The REC value is the difference between available wholesale revenues and the costs needed to keep the existing renewables in operation and get new renewables built. All this is done in order to get the benefit of greenhouse gas reductions while protecting customers. If wholesale revenues go up, the needed REC payment goes down. We see that happening every day in REC spot markets.","The ZEC program is designed the same way. It's a payment for the state value of zero emission credits from nuclear plants which represents the difference between the needed revenues and the costs of operating the plants. In the case of the New York and Illinois programs, the way it would work is that experts at the Commissions will determine on a prospective basis the cost of operating the plants plus risks, less available market revenues. And where there is a delta between that, in other words where the costs and risks are not covered by available market revenues, the ZEC program will kick in and provide compensation for greenhouse gas avoidance.","The program is not a PPA or a contractor difference. If revenues or costs are different, there is no true-up. And \u2013 so, Steve (19:26), I think if you have additional questions, perhaps after the call we could work with Dan and Emily to set up a meeting, go through more programmatic details.","Unknown Speaker","That's great. That's a great start. Thank you. And then just shifting over to renewables more broadly, could you just speak to your degree of appetite for more acquisitions? It sounds like you'll be a full taxpayer, I believe, in 2019, if I have that correct. But just broadly, what degree of opportunities do you see out there in renewables? Is this an area that you would expect that you'll see further growth in?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It is definitely throttled based off of our tax capacity and we are looking at that now. You do get a certain amount of dilution with delaying the benefits of the tax attributes of the project, so we have some projects in the pipeline now and are re-evaluating others to see if they're \u2013 they would be viable to go forward in the near-term.","Unknown Speaker","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. A couple of \u2013 first, a logistical question. The Ginna $101 million that you mentioned that you're getting, is that \u2013 is kind of a trued-up amount including past years, is that in your guidance for this year? Or is that kind of like a one-time item or how are you treating that?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Steve, that's in our guidance.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Including any back from prior periods?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","That's correct.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then a question just \u2013 is there any way you can give us some sense on the cash flow or losses from Clinton and Quad Cities, let's say, in your guidance for last year or something of that sort?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","So we've stated that it's greater than $800 million since 2009. There are some variables in there on cash savings going forward or cash losses going forward, power prices coming down, cost cutting initiatives; and we do have an element of overheads that would not be as controllable. So you would see the run rate to be similar to what has happened in the past.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Steve, you know, on this point \u2013 so for 2017, the cost exceeded available market revenues or at current marks (22:12) by $140 million. But I think importantly and Joe raised this point, it's not the whole picture. The closure also avoids millions of dollars in basis and unit-contingent risks that we face by operating the plants. And stated differently, in order to reverse course we need Illinois as well as New York to provide a structure that allows us to cover our cash costs plus normal operating risks in order to reverse this course.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And $140 million that's kind of cash flow? Does that include like CapEx, or is that just kind of cash flow without CapEx?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's cash flow.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. One last question just on the \u2013 in the event legislation doesn't happen and you need to shut the plants, what \u2013 is there any cost related to that?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","As you saw in the K, and we reiterate in the Q, there is some unfunded liabilities on the decommissioning trust. Those numbers are in there at full 100% ownership of the plants. And so the way that we would have to handle that is \u2013 you know, you can start out with parent guarantees, but you have to have it funded over a 10-year period, I think 60% by the end of the fifth year, and then the rest by the end of the 10 years.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Those numbers in the K are still good then, so that we just can use those?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","They're updated in the Q.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That'll be coming Tuesday.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good Morning.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Good Morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just to clarify one thing on the current proposal that I think was emerged last night around the legislation. So originally this applies to all nuclear plants in the state, but is it correct that this would just be Clinton and Quad? And can you just explain how that works in terms of the discussion of the ZEC structure?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Joe?","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Sure. Jonathan, all plants could apply, but quite obviously the only plants that would receive revenue under this program would be those where the costs exceed the revenues. And so there is \u2013 it's a 20 terawatt-hour cap which has enough room in it to accommodate Clinton and Quad Cities. And our expectation is that Exelon would seek to have those two plants participate. The other plants would not participate.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And that's sort of nuanced in how the legislation's worded effectively?","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","That's correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","It's the same offer to you, Jonathan; if you'd like, after the call, we could sit down and work through some of the details.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That'll be great. And is there any...","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Jonathan, just to interject just to make the clear point, they would provide the opportunity to be compensated for cost plus risk.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That was one thing. The second thing, in your fourth quarter deck, you have this forecast around leverage ratios and the like going out through 2018, which, I believe, was assuming that Pepco would not happen. This was of the ExGen. Can you give us a sense of how that progression would look if you kind of market to the \u2013 with Pepco scenario?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Sure. So, Jonathan, we still anticipate reducing leverage of ExGen by $3 billion over the five-year planning period, albeit this is not to the extend that we would have under the standalone scenario, because ExGen's free cash flow is now being deployed to help fund PHI's capital spending program. And we'll provide more detail on the puts and takes of that at the Analyst Day in August.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So $3 billion is kind of the new ExGen delevering number?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","That's right. That's over the next five years, we have a large maturity. And I believe it's 2019, that we would look to retire at maturity.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So that's over five years?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","That's correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then the 2.3 ExGen debt-to-EBITDA that you were looking at for 2018, roughly what does that look like now?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","It, over the five-year period, would go to right around three times.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So that's again over five years, rather than three years?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","That's correct.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And then I guess you mentioned in the prepared remarks the prices have rebounded...","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","So, Jonathan \u2013 sorry, just let me correct, 2.7 times at the end of the five-year period.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So whereas you have 2.3 times in 2018, it's now 2.7 times after five years?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And then you mentioned that prices have rebounded. So can you give us a rough sense of how the kind of gross margin mark would look if you use more like today's prices?","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Yeah. Jonathan, good morning. It's Joe Nigro. I think if you look at our hedge disclosure at the end of the quarter and then factor in the changes since the end of March, you would see all of that drop in 2017 and 2018 being recovered. We've seen an appreciable move, as you know, in prices since the end of March. We're actually higher in NiHub than we were at the end of the year. We're higher at West Hub than we were at the end of the year, so we would have recovered all that drop and probably adding to it. We calculated that a couple of days ago, but the market has continued to move higher, so we probably have seen it actually go over where it ended the quarter.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay. That's it. Thank you very much, guys.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So perhaps to follow up on the same theme, can you elaborate a little bit on the balance of the nuclear portfolio that is ex-Clinton, ex-Quad? How you think about their cash flow profile? And if you don't get this legislation, what the prospects are for further rationalization? I don't mean to jump the gun too much here, but just talking about the future a little bit more?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So there's varying cash flows by assets depending on their location. They are positive at this point. If you look at the other units that are more challenged, you're looking at Ginna and Nine Mile. One \u2013 we know about Oyster Creek and it's coming up in 2019, the other one that has a real focus on it right now is Three Mile Island.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And specific to Illinois, is there any commentary around \u2013 so let's say we don't get it in 2016 or 2017, does that trigger another set of reviews? Again, not to push it too much.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","At this point we'll have to watch the capacity auction clearing in the out years. It's tight on energy at some of the assets, but they are positive.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Okay, great. And then turning back to the utilities real quickly, can you comment, or I'm curious, if you will, what the earned ROEs embedded at Pepco for 2016 \u2013 just what's the baseline on the Pepco side as far as you see it post the close?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Julien, in terms of \u2013 I think we included it on slide, I believe it's 30, the earned for 2015. Obviously, while we're in the pendency period during the rate cases that \u2013 obviously, there's regulatory lag, so we're going to see that decline, but we'll have a much deeper dive in the PHI as part of the August 10 meeting. You can see on slide 29 the rate base statistics and I think can work through some assumptions on regulatory lag using that information.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And perhaps not to jump the gun too much on the Analyst Day, but what is the thought process on the baseline for a future regulated CAGR?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","I think the thought is the 7% to 9% that we confirmed on the call and PHI is absolutely consistent with that expectation. We, as we mentioned, are seeing improvement relative to what we forecasted or projected at EEI using PHI's internal forecast. And Dennis and team continue to work to identify further opportunities around efficiency as well as regulatory policy to work to get those earned and allowed ROEs in line with the success we've experienced within Maryland, Pennsylvania and Illinois.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. You wouldn't roll it forward though?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","I'm not certain I understand what do you mean roll it forward?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","The 7% to 9%, just roll it forward to CAGR off a 2016 base?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll address that at the Analyst Day.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","All right. No worries. Thank you.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, embedded in there is 7% to 9% through 2018, so just thinking it through, it's in there.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Chen (32:25).","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Brian (32:30).","Unknown Speaker","Going over to slide 13, the EPS impact that you've laid out in that top table, I just want to verify that that is not including the use of capital from that positive cash flow impact that you've got on the second row right?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's right, Brian (32:46).","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. And then I just want to verify that Quad Cities didn't clear in the 2018 and 2019 auction, correct? So the closure of Quad Cities shouldn't have any sort of residual obligation that you have for the 2018, 2019 capacity through (33:03)?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And your next audio question comes from Praful Mehta.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. So just on the leverage a little bit, just to ensure we understand both at the holding company level and at ExGen. You've kind of talked about the ExGen debt and what you see over the 20 \u2013 the five year period. How are you looking at holding company debt given the leverage you've assumed post Pepco transactions? Is there any objective to delever a little bit at the holding company as well?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","So Praful, as you've heard us comment in the past, we do target at 20% FFO to debt on a consolidated basis and that was one of the benefits of adding PHI to the Exelon family. And so we will certainly be looking at our leverage ratios at the GenCo. I think you'll also see us consider to the extend we have available cash at the holding company as well, we just need to see as we get further out what the realized power prices are and what the free cash flow coming off of the GenCo is in those five years.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. And just so if you think about from the sources\/uses perspective, the source is primarily out of ExGen coming to fund CapEx at the utilities and then deleveraging both at ExGen and the parent. Is that a fair way to think of it or is there some cash generation coming out of the utilities as well over the next two year, three year period?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","I would say, on a net basis, utilities are consumers of cash. So you're correct. That ExGen cash flow as well as debt raise at the utilities is the primary source for funding the significant CapEx that we see, $25 billion over the next five years at the utilities.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you. And then just finally, we saw that the power new business and the to-go business, the EBITDA, or the growth margin of that is going from $250 million in 2016 up to about a $1 billion by 2018. Could you just give us a little bit of context of what's driving that significant ramp-up in that side of the business?","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Yeah. Hi. It's Joe Nigro. That's pretty standard shape that we have. If you go back and look at disclosures over the years, you would expect to see much less new business in the prompt years \u2013 in the prompt year, in this case 2016, than you would in the out years, for example, in 2017 and 2018. Embedded in that power new business is things like the execution of our retail business and the margins associated with that. So as we get closer to the swap period more and more of those contracts get layered in, we begin to reduce that bucket of power new business.","I mean, there's other elements of our business that follow that same timing shape, so this isn't unique in the sense of seeing a ramp up between the prompt year to two years forward and we're very comfortable with the numbers that we've put out there.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Thank you so much guys.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.","Christopher M.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions) Thank you. ","Ravi Ganti, Vice President of Investor Relations, please go ahead. ","Ravi Ganti","","Thank you, Amy. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s President and CEO and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following the prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings review this morning along with the presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. The earnings release and other matters that we will discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.","Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today\u2019s call obviously during this call and the risk factors section of the earnings release.","Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause the results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations.","Today\u2019s presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher M. Crane","Thank you Ravi, and good morning to everybody. Before I talk about 2013, I will give everybody a little bit of update on the system status. This year, this winter have provided us with a lot of opportunities to perform storm recovery in the last 36 hours, we\u2019re hit pretty hard with snow in the ComEd zone. The recovery went fairly well, in fact we\u2019re back up and running at normal levels.","BGE was hit by freezing rain and ice yesterday morning knocking out Exelon PECO 175,000 customers. As of early this morning, there were 45,000 customers left to recover. We have adequate resources on the system now. PECO was the one that was most slanted by any of the utilities by this storm. Over 700,000 customers have been affected thus far making it the second worse storm in PECO\u2019s history, only beat out by super storm Sandy. We had yesterday 35,000 resources on the ground in the recovery phase and that is ramping up even more today.","ComEd is dispatching over 300 of their resources and will continue to support the recovery. As of this morning, there were still approximately 430,000 customers; out of that we expect to make some solid results in the next couple of days. This could last for few more days and we are really focused on this health and safety of our customers with another storm coming in, so company is doing everything possible to expedite the recovery there.","So I\u2019ll switch now to 2013; it was a strong year for operations. Each utility; PECO, BGE and ComEd achieved top quartile and best ever our outage frequency in customer satisfaction numbers. Nuclear delivered a capacity factor of 94% and an all-time higher generation output. Gas and hydro availability upon demand was over 99%, and renewable energy capture was 93%. ","We have been confronted by low power and gas prices, impacts of subsidized generation in sluggish low growth. With that said, we delivered on our financial plan. We achieved $2.50 a share which was right in line with our guidance and Jack will be providing more color on that in a minute. ","We continue to manage cost O&M was better than planned, realizing $360 million in merger synergies and on track to 550 ComEd's by year-end. Previous actions have ensured solid credit metrics and balance sheet strength that allows us to continue investing and growth.","You know about the $15 billion in utility investment we\u2019ve talked of. Jack is going to provide more color on that also in a minute. We had more than $1.3 million smart leaders during 2013 end to other infrastructure upgrades and system hardening and transmission projects.","We added 158 megawatts of clean generation primarily at our Antelope Valley solar facility and we have the substantial generation growth in our development pipeline for the next two to three years, approximately 500 megawatts and contracted win solar in the completion of our nuclear power upgrades.","Public policy remains a critical focus for us. At the utilities, we saw meaningful improvement in the fair return on our investments in Illinois and Maryland, Senate Bill 9 in Illinois allowed us to achieve our grid modernization programs, which is driving customer liability and we are having constructive result on rate cases in Illinois and in Maryland.","It is clear that Exelon and other competitive generators are not really compensative for their reliable generation. We\u2019ve been active in the PJM stakeholder process since we auctioned results of last May to improve the rules. We continue to be a leading voice against subsidized generation and have had some success. We will continue the efficacy process going forward.","Looking-forward, we see some challenges, but we hope to do see some light at the end. Continued pressure from subsidies and lower commodity prices are present, but the recent weather events have resulted in price volatility that we haven\u2019t seen in a long time. This should result in supplier side risk premium adjustments, which will assist in the market recovery and we have given this and other fundamental shifts we remain positive.","Today, we are providing guidance range of $2.25 a share to $2.55 a share for the adjusted period earnings for 2014 and now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jack to provide more details.","Jonathan W. Thayer","Thank you Chris and good morning everyone I am on Slide 2. I\u2019ll first discuss the fourth quarter and 2013 financial results and then turn to 2014 earnings guidance cash outlet and other insights on 2014 including our gross margin update. We achieved operating earnings of $0.50 for the quarter and $2.50 per share for the year, in line with the midpoint of our guidance expectations of $2.40 to $2.60 ","Turning to Slide 3 in the quarter results for utilities; 2013 was bad year for our three utilities. Our utility customers are realizing the operating and cost benefits of the merger, each BGE, ComEd, and PECO had its best operating year ever, hence will approve for the value of scale and the ability to leverage experience, cost utility, best practices and resources.","Operating performance in each utility improved over 2012 in all key metrics including safety, reliability, customer service and customer satisfaction. For all three, reliability customer satisfaction and add frequency are in the top quartile of similar utilities in the United States.","We continue to make capital investments to make our system even stronger and more reliable. For the fourth quarter ComEd delivered earnings of $0.13 per share and full year earnings of $0.49 per share at the top of our guidance range.","Fourth quarter earnings decreased to $0.06 per share compared to the same period of 2012, related to the impacts of the October 2012 distribution rate order, partially offset by favorable weather, volumes and customer mix. ","PECO delivered earnings of $0.12 per share for the quarter and $0.46 per share for the year, exceeding our guidance range. Fourth quarter earnings increased $0.02 per share over the same period last year; this is largely related to decrease storm cost and favorable weather. ","BGE's earnings were $0.06 per share for the fourth quarter and $0.23 per share for the full year, in the middle of our guidance range. Fourth quarter earnings increased by $0.04 per share from the same quarter in 2012. Higher electric and gas distribution rates and lower storm cost drove the higher earnings. ","In December, both ComEd and BGE received constructive results in their rate cases. The Illinois Commerce Commission approved to an increase of $341 million for commerce delivery service revenue, nearly 95% of the original request, a testament to the success of the formula rate mechanism. And the Maryland Public Service Commission approved an increase of $34 million for electric base rates. And $12 million for gas base rates. The 2014 outlook for lower growth remains modest. We expect less than 1% load growth in our PECO and BGE. And load growth to be flat to negative at ComEd.","At each utility load growth is influenced by ongoing energy efficiency programs. PECO's modest growth of 0.3% reflects growth in manufacturing employment in the region. Strong growth in the residential sector is driving BGE\u2019s 0.6% expected load growth in 2014. There is more detail on load for the utilities that can be found on page 27 of the appendix.","Turning to ExGen\u2019s results of Slide 4. ExGen delivered earnings of $0.21 per share in the fourth quarter, and $1.40 per share for the full year. For the quarter ExGen\u2019s earnings decreased by $0.12 per share compared to the same quarter of 2012. The majority of the decrease was driven by lower realized energy prices across all regions. This was offset in part by higher capacity prices and lower O&M expense. ","Looking ahead to 2014 on Slide 5, we expect adjusted operating earnings in the $2.25 per share to $2.55 per share range and $0.60 per share to $0.70 per share range for the first quarter. Lower total gross margin of ExGen driven by lower energy price is the main driver of the year-over-year decrease. This is partially offset by higher return to ComEd driven by higher allowed ROE and with recovery of capital investment from the formula rate as well as higher revenue at BGE. In addition, higher O&M costs driven by inflation and the anticipation of average storm costs offset in part by merger related synergies and lower pension costs contribute to the year-over-year earnings differences. More detail on the individual operating company drivers can be found on the appendix.","Slide 6 provides our projected sources and uses of cash for 2014 compared to 2013 actuals. Cash from operations is expected to be $6.1 billion which is an increase from 2013 or $75 million due in part to higher distribution rates at ComEd and favorable income taxes and other settlements offset by lower gross margin and Exelon generation. 2014 CapEx plans are largely consistent with our estimates provided at EEI. ","I will discuss our O&M outlook on the next slide, but would first touch upon our financing plans for 2014. We\u2019re projecting $1.2 billion of long-term debt issuances at ComEd and PECO with the proceeds to be used for refinancings and incremental capital investment at ComEd. In early January, we completed more than half of our 2014 financing plan for the $650 million ComEd first mortgage bond issuance. The transaction consisted of $300 million of five year bonds with the coupon of 2.15% and $350 million of 30 year bonds with a coupon of 4.7%. The proceeds served to retire $617 million of debt maturities in addition to general corporate purposes. ","In addition to the maturity comment, we have $525 million of maturities at ExGen which we\u2019ve retried with cash on hand improving our credit metrics as a non-regulated business. As mentioned on the third quarter call, we think we have an opportunity to redeploy capital for growth opportunities through project financing of certain assets in our existing portfolio.","To that end, I\u2019m pleased to announce the closing of a $300 million L plus 425 term loan of ExGen Renewables I. ExGen Renewables I is the indirect holding company of Continental Wind, a $667 megawatt wind portfolio of 13 projects located in six states, refinanced in September of last year, this transaction had an order book that was well over subscribed consisting of high-quality investors resulting in our springing and pricing by 25 basis points to 50 basis points from our initial guidance. We think this serves as evidence that we have a strong portfolio of assets that can generate additional proceeds to deploy for the right growth opportunities.","Slide 7 shows our 2014 O&M forecasts and our 2013 actual O&M. We project O&M for 2014 to be $6.575 billion, an increase of $100 million over last year. The O&M CAGR for the entire company from 2014 to 2016 is a negative 0.6% with ExGen O&M remaining roughly flat during that time period. This year-over-year variance is mostly driven by inflation and the anticipation of average storm costs at the utilities offset by merger synergies and favorable pension and OPEB costs. We expect to hit our run rate merger synergy target of $550 million in 2014.","On Slide 8 as we told, at EEI we are investing $15 billion in our free utilities over the planning period, resulting in consolidated rate base growth of between 5% and 7%. We are targeting a minimum 10% ROE at each utility by 2017. Our utilities provide stable earnings growth for the company and could wholly fund the dividend of 2016. We expect consolidated utility earnings will grow 6% annually from 2013 to 2016. Slide 8 shows our projected utility earnings range from $1.10 to $1.40 in 2014 from $1.25 to $1.55 in 2016.","Slide 9 provides our fourth-quarter gross margin update. As a reminder, we changed the format of our disclosures to include cost of sales and gross margin as opposed to O&M and depreciation and amortization. We disclosed the implications of the format change in an 8-K in December and have included that disclosure in the appendix of his presentation. During the fourth quarter, 2014 power prices slightly increased in PJMs in the Midwest, while decreasing in 2015 and 2016 across most regions.","In 2014, total gross margin decreased by $50 million from our last disclosure. As you know we are highly hedged in 2014 and this rounded variances due to our few minor adjustments during finalization of our 2014 through 2018 mono range plan. As a result of the pricing decrease, total gross margin is down $100 million in both 2015 and 2016 since the third quarter call.","In January we experienced severe winter weather in our load shedding regions as well as significant power and gas price volatility. Our balanced generation to load strategy, as well as our geographic and commodity diversity, served us well in this challenging environment.","On the generation front, our oil peaking fleet and other dispatchable generation allowed us to manage the higher loads due to the cold weather. However, we did experience some issues, similar to other operators including an outage at Calvert Cliffs that setting impact on the portfolio management results. We\u2019ll provide more details about the financial impacts during our first quarter earnings call.","Yesterday, ISO New England announced the preliminary results of their full capacity option for the planning year of 2017 and 2018. The clearing prices are $15 per kilowatt month in NEMA and $7.025 per kilowatt month in the Rest of Pool. These results are pending for approval. ","The clearing prices reflect the tightening supply and demand balance in New England after to announcements to retire baseload generation. Our New England capacity position 2100 megawatt in NEMA and 735 megawatts in Rest of Pool will benefit from these higher year-over-year prices.","As you will see in the appendix, our forecasted generation has decreased by roughly 50% in New England. Exelon worked with the supplier to restructure certain trends of a fuel supply contract resulting in a more flexible and a reliable supply contract.","Despite the fact that our forecasted generation is lower, the changes in the fuel supply contract result in favorable gross margin variances in the portfolio that are included in the open gross margin forecasts.","On Slide 10, we believe that PJM prices will improve due to full time retirements and increased costs for some generators to comply with impending environmental regulations.","Our current forecast has approximately 52 gigawatts of coal retiring in the Eastern Interconnect through 2016, which includes approximately 24 gigawatts in the PJM footprint. Our near-term forward power markets have shown some improvement in recent weeks. We still see forward heat rates trading lower than our fundamentals which suggest given the natural gas prices, expected retirements, the change in the supply, PJM\u2019s supply stack and load assumptions ","Our hedging strategy continues to reflect this view. Our overall hedge percentages increased due to two factors; the restructuring of the New England fuel supply contract and shifting to a larger heat rate strategy of PJM.","As of yearend 2013, we were 2% to 3% behind ratable in PJM relying on an even larger amount cross-commodity hedges to capture our view that heat rates will expand. At year end natural gas sales represented 12% to 15% of our hedges in 2015 and 2016.","The changing fundamental drivers of the gas and power markets have already led to significant amount of volatility so far in 2014 spot prices. The power market have modestly responded. We will continue to evaluate the amount of upside we see in the market based on our fundamental views and carry positions that will allows us to benefit as much as possible from the realization of these use while meeting the other goals of our hedging policy.","On Slide 11, ExGen have shown strong financial metrics and cash flows to maintain its investment grade rating and pursue opportunistic growth investments as they arise. For 2013, ExGen had an FFO to debt ratio of more than 37% and we expect this ratio to improve in 2014 to approximately 40%. ExGen\u2019s investment grade, credit rating and robust balance sheet allows us to pursue growth projects.","As we showed you at ETI, we have declining base CapEx of ExGen from 2013 to 2016. Our priority is the safety and reliability of these plans and these cost reductions will not compromise our ability to achieve those priorities.","Our base CapEx in prior years was higher to prepare for license extensions and mitigate asset management issues. We are also able to implement cost management programs including reverse engineering, which contributed to reductions. These CapEx reductions helps to mitigate the reduction in rev net fuel.","Pension improvements are also contributing to our strong financial strength when looking at cash relative to earnings. The rising interest rate environment results in lower pension costs and contributions. For 2015, we are forecasting a $100 million decline in pension contributions versus expense.","Further ExGen has a favorable cash tax position. We have substantial near-term cash tax favorability compared to book taxes due to bonus depreciation, use of NOLs and other tax credits. Our longer term tax position has increased tax capacity for growth opportunities in renewable generation.","All these factors contribute to our financial flexibility and robust cash metrics including EBITDA minus base CapEx of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion and free cash flow of $1.25 billion in 2014.","We have a financial strength not only to see us through this period of low commodity process, but also to grow. Our healthy balance sheet, sustainable dividend and our discipline constitute a solid platform for sustained growth.","As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts.","Now I will turn the call back to Chris for his concluding remarks, before we open the call for question and answer.","Christopher M. Crane","Thanks Jack. We continue to act aggressively on things we can control and really work on things that we can influence. We believe in the power market recoveries we repetitively said and we are managing our portfolio accordingly to maximize its profitability.","Our investments in the utilities is very high priority. The stable earnings and the cash flow provided, will support sustainable dividend going forward. We continue to focus on cost cutting and driving the emergent synergies as we have discussed.","We have talked about asset rationalization in the past and despite our best ever year in generation some of our nuclear units are unprofitable at this point in the current environment due to the low prices and bad energy policy that we are living with.","Assessing the market operations and commercial policy solution is the focus right now. A better tax policy and energy policy would be the clear answer, but if we do not see a path to sustainable profits, we will be obligated to shut units down to avoid the long-term losses and that decision have the process should bring us to some conclusion by year-end.","Our balance sheet strength enables us to invest in diversification. We will continue to add assets to the portfolio, that are earnings and free cash flow accretive. We will mitigate the market effects by pursuing aggressive costs cuts, asset rationalization and deploying capitals to drive growth.","With that, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Christopher M. Crane","Hey Dan.","","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC","I was wondering maybe can if somebody could just give us some thoughts or some color on what\u2019s going on in the forward curves right now. Obviously we\u2019ve seen a lot of movement in the 2014 curve, but 2015 and 2016 has been pretty benign so far. Is there a liquidity issue out there, is it a fundamental issue and you can kind of when do you guys expect that to start to move?","Christopher M. Crane","Let me have Joe Nigro address that.","Joseph Nigro","Hey Dan good morning. I think there is a couple of issues that we are dealing with. First since the end of the year, the West Hub power, if we use that as the first proxy, is up across the board and really that\u2019s been driven by the changing gas basis that we\u2019ve seen in the Mid-Atlantic and we really haven\u2019t seen any heat rate expansion. We have price appreciation if you look at the balance of 2014 and 2015 and beyond across the board to West on the back of the gas bases change.","The bigger issue is really in NI-Hub, because the gas bases really hasn\u2019t moved if you look at 2015 to 2018 since the end of the year. We really haven\u2019t seen a change in gas bases nor have we seen much of the change in the NYMEX price for natural gas. We\u2019ve seen the calendar 2015 price at NI-Hub go up slightly about $0.50 or so.","I think it was as of last night on an ATC basis. But we are actually down from 16% to 18% and I think your question about liquidity is spot on. There is absolutely no natural buyers on the forward curve in NI-Hub. And then on top of that there is very little speculation on being done in NI-Hub from a trading perspective. Certainly we marry those things together, we did not see it.","And the last thing I would add is as you remember as we walk into the year, we saw the calendar 2014 ATC prices raised and hear rate expand slightly and I think it was the back of some retailers and others coming to market and cover, but we haven\u2019t seen any change on the backend and we expect to see that until we see liquidity improve.","Christopher M. Crane","And then Dan I\u2019d just add, given the January cold weather issues and severe price volatility we\u2019ve actually seen liquidity really back off just in a recent week. So, but NI-Hub liquidity is probably about as bad as we\u2019ve ever seen it, and really even in 2015 there is almost no activities.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC","And can I guess kind of on the point we\u2019ve seen the multiple retailers drop out of the business in January already. What kind of landscape are you guys seeing as far as competitors and maybe more departures in the business I guess A and then B. Are you having more conversations with customers looking to maybe reconfigure how they are buying power to get in to more firm contracts and things like that?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Dan, there is a couple of data points to that, but first is there were a couple of wholesale solar procurements done in January. And I would tell you versus what we had seen in previous year, you saw some increased risk premiums and in some cases higher margins.","I think that\u2019s the first data point. The BGS auction will take place next week. The fixed price proportion next week and I think we\u2019ll get another insight as to how people are thinking about it. From a retail perspective it\u2019s really too early to tell, but I think you are right on. We have seen a number of folks announcing, they are getting out of the business, they are going to scale down the business. We have seen some small defaults return on expected in this kind of environment.","I would fully expect that folks are going to take both year to reassess the risk rewarded suddenly growth volume products and when you think about the impending retirements that we\u2019ve been talking about we use PJM proxy with some of the changes come as it relates to demand response bidding and just the GAAP basis issues we\u2019ve seen as well pretty much all over the interconnect.","I think it\u2019s safe to say that we are going to expect people here to reassess what they think the value of a loan probably contracted and we would expect to see the volatility and the margins increase through time both retail and wholesale load volume contracts.","Jonathan W. Thayer","And Dan, I would just reiterate what Jack said. Our matched load to gen strategy really has played out well here in January. While others are concerned about uncontrolled costs to serve load. With our robust asset base, our portfolio management capability in the wholesale side has allowed us to take those issues off the table and led our retail team focused on what the customer\u2019s need, whether they are concerned about prices, if they are indexed or exposed at all and how we can help them get through this. I think that's our advantage in our mass gen to load strategy. And I think it puts us well ahead of a lot of our competitors.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC","So can I just take that to mean in the first quarter, that even with this volatility in January and into February on retail, the generation has offset that? So there has been kind of a net neutral so it hasn't hurt or helped appreciably?","So can I just take that demand in the first quarter that even with this volatility in January and into February on retail, the generation is offset but there has been kind of a net neutral so it hasn\u2019t hurt or helped appreciably?","Jonathan W. Thayer ","It\u2019s certainly the talk, but we are right on plan. We don\u2019t have any concerns about this weather and the volatility that has been in the market.","Dan L. Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities, LLC","Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research, LLC","Yes, excuse me hi guys. Couple of questions; first and I\u2019m not sure you can answer this, but on the nuclear plant et cetera, we are losing money in this environment, is there a way to give us a sense of how much lost earnings there is, let\u2019s say in 2014 from plans that are not economic right now?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes, we are not putting that out yet. If we have to make a decision, if again we will tell you the upside, but we don\u2019t have that number to published yet. ","Steven I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, I guess you had mentioned this in your remarks, but on the bottom of Slide 12, you talked about that you believe that you are going to have positive earnings CAGR, half of this 2014 guidance over the long-term. Should we assume that assumes you are kind of $2 to $4 power price recovery broader or is that something where even without all that given potential savings on new shutdowns and other things you are doing that might be possible even without that?","Christopher M. Crane","Let me ask Jack go through the logic there.","Jonathan W. Thayer","Steve, it incorporates a number of things. It incorporates our fundamental views both around power prices as well as capacity and that would provide an important part of that positive earnings growth, offsetting the declines that the forwards would suggest in the business. We also have a continued focus on cost that we are pursuing and building on top of the $550 million of savings from the merger and we expect that to also be additive and then we\u2019ve factored in the available capital and balance sheet space that we have and the opportunity to use that for further investment in organic growth or potential acquisitions or other means of growing our EPS base.","Steven I. Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi good morning guys.","Christopher M. Crane","Good morning.","Jonathan W. Thayer","Good morning.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just sort of strategic question despite might be for Jack. Jack, in volatility and the recent volatility we\u2019ve seen is kind of what\u2019s going to ultimately inform the force, why don\u2019t use some of that financial flexibility to be substantially left hedged?","Jonathan W. Thayer","","That\u2019s in our outlook. I\u2019ll let Joe Nigro to talk about that.","Joseph Nigro","At this point in this cycle, if we talked about 2015 and 2016, until the only the two primary follow years that we are hedging, we\u2019ve never had a larger opening power position at this point in over hedging cycle. ","So we talked a lot and Jack mentioned some of the things that we did in the fourth quarter in trying to selling gas and rotating out of a very long position and we took advantage of the price rise, we saw in natural gas from about mid-October through the end of the year. In early January, the gas market actually came off zone and we took the opportunity to buy back a lot of these hedging that we\u2019ve put on. So we\u2019re still carrying a very long open power proposition.","The second thing I would add to that is, there has been some movement in prices when we talk about rest of them may have 2015 in certain seasons like summer and winter and we compared that to where we think ultimately they should settle given the fuel price environment we are in and then will give an opportunity to rotate positions and make power sales and really think its associated on the seasonal basis, but sitting here today we\u2019ve never had a larger open power position at this point in the form of commodity cycle.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just one, because you mentioned that this restructuring of the gas or I guess its gas or fuel supply on New England, but if you are going to generate a lot less presumably that was a low-priced contract that\u2019s going not to be as low-priced any more. So I\u2019m curious is there a gain associated with that and when did it show up in 2013 as something that will be in 2014 or might not be thinking about that, right?","Joseph Nigro","As we look at this, the way its flowing through our financial statement, you've seen it in the hedge disclosure. We restructured a 1 giga supply contract that was positive margin overall. You're right, we had a substantial decrease in the output of our generation up in New England that you see in the disclosure, to the tune of about 50%. ","The way the mechanics working and disclosure is such that we reduced our power new business to go and we added the value of that contract and we monetized into our estimated open gross margin, so the next change to the bottom line is zero, but it's just more in cash flow.","Christopher M. Crane","Just the big driver of this is around making sure we have fuel reliability and flexibility and can run the plans when they are most needed on the system, that was a huge driver doing that.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So is there a financial impact from the restructuring?","Jonathan W. Thayer","The financial impact that you see, if you look at our hedge disclosures quarter-over-quarter; for example in 2014, you'll notice we reduced our power units to go by $150 million. We reduced it by $100 million. A good portion of that is the benefit of this contract and we're locking cash flows that we reduce the power usages to go and we have grossed up the gross margin for that balance.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Sorry to keep kind of on this, but does that mean there is not as an upfront gain associated with it?","Christopher M. Crane","What they are trying to tell you it's built into the numbers you are looking at. There was an optimization that needed to be done for reliability upon this system that drove the contract restructuring. We were compensated for that and is in the numbers and it is positive, but it's in the numbers you see.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Can you quantify it?","Christopher M. Crane","","No, there is terms under the deal, no.","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just finally Chris on your last comments around assets and everything, at EEI you talked a little about PPA's and then there was a sort of potential puff to addressing economic situation of some of the nukes and then there was a story about something being negotiated and Illinois round club cities. Can you comment at all about that?","","Christopher M. Crane","Yes. Somebody ran with a story that was not true. We are not negotiating with the state of Illinois on PPAs. What my statement was at EEI and still in pass forward, we would like to get longer-term contracts on especially the MISO assets. It is not being compensated for the reliability and we have origination folk out working on that, but it's not with a state entity, it's through multiple paths to other parties that are securing long-term needs.","We'll continue to work on that. As you know there is not many of those deals out there, but MISO \u2013 and now MISO sales would be our target to try to find those opportunities. ","Jonathan P. Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much guys.","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Hi Chris, you had talked a couple of times about your efforts to achieve changes in energy policy that might benefit the Company and I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. Then in particular, what you are hoping to see done on renewables and on CO2 regulation and perhaps what do you think may play out on those two fronts?","Christopher M. Crane","Our biggest push right now is at the federal and the state level is to stop subsidizing in generation. That's renewables and other sources of generation. It skews the market. It's doesn't give any of us the right signal should we be investing, should we be shutting down and we think that a good policy for the competitive market is let the assets compete. ","So, we've done a lot of work in the last couple of years trying to tell that story and we hope that it's continuing or will start to resonate with more of the stakeholders as we go forward the other thing that we're continuing to push on and explore. ","We do not get compensated as others for reliable baseload generation, we load a core, in a nuclear reactor we can run for up to two years with very reliable generation. We are not depending on the wind, the sun, or the flow of any fuel through the pipe it's there. So we think the capacity markets, not the energy markets should reflect the reliability and the dependability of those and Joe Dominguez and our regulatory folks continue to work in market space to try to find opportunities to improve the roles around that and we'll continue to push it. ","As far as greenhouse gases, we\u2019re not advocating for a carbon bill. We spend a lot of time working on that in the past, and Washington I don\u2019t think is the place to try to resolve that issue right now. We continue to watch what the EPA is doing and what they have under their jurisdiction right now as it's been pointed out to regulate going forward. We'll monitor that going forward, how we make our investments around that or how we would make our disclosures around that. But we are not in the advocacy spot right now in that area.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Okay understood. Could you maybe just elaborate a little bit on what type of compensation you think would be appropriate for the reliable baseload as opposed to what you are receiving already in capacity markets?","","Christopher M. Crane","Yes, I\u2019ll let Joe Dominguez touch on that. ","Joseph Dominguez ","Sure. So when we are talking about reliability, you are talking describe this fuel diversity or not allowing to get fuel on gas because of this volatility risks. The way I think that is being translated in stakeholder space, is you increase the requirements for firm fuel. And so obviously a nuclear unit has firm fuel, we load up 18 months of fuel in core. And the thought is that especially coming out of these winter events, the gas units will be required to have something that looks like firm fuel and that may involve firm transport requirements, it may ultimately involve a winter peaking season, whether it's an examination if whether sufficient gas can be provided to cover all the megawatts that are bid in the option. But those are the discussions that are better occurring. We think that will put upward pressure in the capacity market and allow nuclear units compensate from the firm fuel they have in the reliability they provided to the system.","","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Great. So, you're basically hoping that the requirement for firm fuel supply and transmission on the gas plants will drive capacity prices higher and you will benefit accordingly, is that fair?","","Christopher M. Crane","Yes, but I don't want to be limited to that. I think what we need to figure out for the utilities on the system is whether the gas units will perform, fully more in peak season and now we're going to a peak in the winter and that's really what comes out of this. And I think the ISO's are going to examine a number of tests requiring firm transport is one of them, but the other way to do it is, you just whittle down the number of megawatts that could participate in capacity option. Either way, we will see some uplift in the capacity market as a result of those [Indiscernible].","","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Got it. Okay and thank you very much ","Christopher M. Crane","Sure ","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Michael Weinstein with UBS.","Michael Weinstein \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Hi guys. On that same topic, could you talk about the PJM parameters that were released and what do you think capacity imports into PJM and how that might be changing?","","Christopher M. Crane","Joe Dominguez?","","Joseph Dominguez","I think the most significant ruling was limiting the sub angle DR. And so we see the effect that already that's approved by FERC. FERC has not approved PJM's request on the import limits as yet. As you know they issued a deficiency letter. Our review of the deficiency letter suggests that they can answer the questions relatively quickly, re-file and be in time for decision by FERC in advance of the auction. ","In terms of the planning parameters, I think they would modestly reduce the number of imports, the number of megawatts of imported generation in this next capacity auction, that's my view based on what I've seen so far.","","Michael Weinstein \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Honest projections. A couple of technical questions. Concerning the interest on ExGen just looks like in the guidance it went down to $325 million and the run rate of the fourth quarter would seem to imply about $400 million and net debt looks like it could actually increase. So I was just wondering what the cause of the decline in interest going forward?","Joseph Dominguez","Well, I think we can \u2013 I would say broadly that it's related to lower balance and we've been refinancing at lower levels. But why don't we take the more specific modeling questions offline.","","Michael Weinstein \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","No problem. And one last question. Have you baked into guidance any of the uplift from January like any of the risk \u2013 increased risk premiums or anything like that that might have happened or might be occurring, in your 2014 guidance?","","Joseph Dominguez","No, we haven't, where you talk about it from a retail margin perspective where performance in January nonetheless convincing.","","Christopher M. Crane","We do think it should be and eventually will be. As we looked at these auctions or the muni [ph] aggregation process, we never could understand the numbers on some of the suppliers that are able to make, and so we didn't win a lot of those. We pushed \u2013 as we looked at our own models, the place that jumped out was the volume favorability, the VLR that can be directly seen in a weather event like that. So, we have previously priced that into our offerings that would \u2013 that portfolio management would protect us from events like we just went through. So, that's why we're seeing right now we're on plan.","","Michael Weinstein \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. Good morning.","Christopher M. Crane","Good morning.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Chris, as you are thinking through your strategic plan for 2014 and perhaps beyond that, but looking through this calendar year, where does the prospect for regulated utility M&A fit into your planning right now if at all? What kind of priority would you give that to build up your regulated base?","","Christopher M. Crane","So, right now, we are not in a position where we would want to trade our equity for anything other than something that was a relative value deal. So, if you look at \u2013 we believe we're undervalued at this point and there is market upside. Between the market upside and the current valuations we're being given, we think there is upside to that. So, we would hold our equity \u2013 use of our equity only to something that would be a relative value deal that we could see the upside accretion in earnings and profitability. Other things that would be looked at, would just be balance sheet type growth activities, as Jack has pointed out previously. ","So, off the balance sheet, we're willing to engage in anything that we can see on the near term as a positive accretion in earnings. But not create a dilution on the equity utilization just because we think most are trading at a premium.","","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay got it. Also to clarify, you pointed out earlier also in Slide 12. When you look at your planning period and things are ultimately ending up with a positive CAGR in earnings. Are we looking at 2013 through 2018 or through 2016, what's the planning period, can you just define that?","","Christopher M. Crane","Put 2014 through 2018.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","2014 through 2018. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jon Cohen with ISI Group.","Jon A. Cohen \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Hey good morning. Just a question on, when you say you have balance sheet capacity. Is that also looking out long-term through 2018 or is that more over the next few years?","Christopher M. Crane","That\u2019s looking out throughout 2018. Clearly we have more balance sheet capacity in the front years based on where the power curve is currently trending. To the extent that our fundamental view comes to fruition then clearly we'll have similar level of FFO relative to debt, that would create incremental capacity but consistent with prior comments. We think we are between $1 billion and $2 billion of balance sheet capacity into investing growth.","Jon A. Cohen \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay, and if your fundamental view on the power markets does not come to fruition and does that kind of\u2026 ","Christopher M. Crane","That we arrive at $1 billion to $2 billion to the extent that our fundamental view comes to fruition than it's been equally higher.","Jon A. Cohen \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay great and just one other question on the planning parameters; I noticed PJM broke out ComEd and BGE as separate LDAs, even though it looks like there is plenty of import capacity. Can you just talk about what their thinking was around that and does that help you at all?","Christopher M. Crane ","Joe Dominguez will answer that.","Joseph Dominguez ","Sure. PJM is right under the tariff to separately model zone. When there are concerns that the megawatts supply needed within the zone won't receive adequate compensation through the RTO pricing into a liability criteria. As you indicated the ComEd zone, transmission the PECO [ph] ratio looks like it's pretty robust, BGE is a little bit tighter. ","But I think what this ultimately tells us is that as we get into the auction period, bidding practice within those zones is going to be very critical and what the cost of supply within the zone is going to be critical. PJM, we think wisely has taken steps to protect the liability in those zones by separately modeling the LDAs.","Jon A. Cohen \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay. And can you just clear up one thing, as a nuclear generator, what is your flexibility for bidding in avoided cost, I mean it looks like they don't specify an avoided cost rate for nuclear, it's mostly for coal and other fossil units, can you bid something other than just being a price taker?","Jonathan W. Thayer","The answer is yes, you can. There aren't the bulk rates, which is what you're pointing out, but there is nothing that prohibits nuclear from bidding an ACR.","Jon A. Cohen \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay, great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont of Jefferies.","Paul B. Fremont \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. It looks like for the year 2014, the effective tax rate came in at 33.8%, which is well below your guidance of 37.4%. I guess my question is what caused tax rates to be significantly better and also I don't see sort of a consolidated effective tax rate that you're assuming for 2014 in your guidance?","Christopher M. Crane ","We'll have our tax VP address that. Tom Terry?","Thomas D. Terry Jr."," The guidance you've been given is just a core effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in the financials and what you'll actually see realize reflects the utilization of renewable credits, which drives that down substantially below what you get which is ongoing core tax rate.","Paul B. Fremont \u2013 Jefferies LLC ","So what is the consolidated tax guidance for 2014?","Thomas D. Terry Jr.","","Can we give that guidance?","Christopher M. Crane","We don't provide that Paul.","Paul B. Fremont \u2013 Jefferies LLC ","Okay. And then is it again the renewable credits that's getting you to the much lower effective tax rate this year versus what you are originally guiding to?","Christopher M. Crane","","Yes. Paul you are seeing the continued build out of AVSR. You are seeing build out of wind generating assets through our renewable business. You should expect us to be a regular beneficiary of tax credits in lowering our overall tax liability on a cash basis as well.","Paul B. Fremont \u2013 Jefferies LLC ","Even though you can't give sort of a consolidated effective tax rate directionally, should we assume something similar to 2013 and 2014?","Christopher M. Crane","Let us step back and look at how we want to discuss that. We've got more renewables coming on, we've got a pipeline. It hasn't been something that we've talked about in the past. I hate to do it on the fly right now. So let us regroup and we'll put something out or we'll address it on the next call.","Paul B. Fremont \u2013 Jefferies LLC ","Okay. And then just real quick on your discussion of the supply disruptions and what you're going to talk about in the first quarter of 2014, will that discussion essentially only impact your 2014 number or could it also have an effect on sort of future periods that you said that you were including in your disclosures?","Christopher M. Crane","So, our disclosures are based-off of forward strip where we see the market on our short-term view doesn't come in to our disclosures. Joe?","Joseph Nigro ","Yes. Paul, couple of things; one thing is this. None of our January activity is in this disclosure that we released today. As you know and you see in the disclosure, we have new business targets to go from the power side and the non-power side. ","So, any value created whether it's in January or the balance of the first quarter for changes we see in value for the balance of the year would go towards meeting the business targets for the year. ","In addition, I think the question your are raising is what the value on the forward curve of some of the activity and disruption we've seen in January. As we talked about, it's been much more significant in the front-end of the curve and very muted on the back end of the curve, and we haven't seen anything in the two weeks instead of past that has led us to believe that our retail is changing, appreciably yes. ","But I do thing as we get to the end of the first quarter, we'll have better insight as to what the impact is on the forward curve as we move through time and what it means, but as of right now, our plan includes retail margins that we previously talked about when you think about like seeing on power that don't get back to the middle of that $2 to $4 range.","If we see that expand, we would take that into account and recognize it to see it helps meet our new business targets or possibly expand them.","Paul B. Fremont \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay. And last question from me, we've seen announcements of new gas plant construction in PJM, can you expect this to be limited to sort of the Pennsylvania, Marcellus region or do you expect to see more activity in other parts of PJM.","Joseph Nigro","Paul, I think the general consensus is that you are going to see more in the Mid-Atlantic region prior to January 1, as you know, we saw substantial degradation in gas bases as it related to the Mid-Atlantic and the Marcellus area. It's not unreasonable to think you can see this in Ohio as well as the Utica shale starts to build out as quickly as people expect I do think though since we've seen an uptick in gas basis since the first of the year. ","You have to take a step back and pause and reassess what the economics of the trends are because there's going to be some very seasonal differences when you look at the curve being up if you then pervade sort of the proxy $0.30 to $0.35 on an annualized basis. There is a big winter component to that whereas the summer and the shoulder months are still weak, but in general I think you would see it in Marcellus and Utica region.","Paul B.

My name is Carol and I will be your operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2018 Fourth Quarter Exelon Earnings Call. All lines have been place on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like turn the call over to Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance for Exelon. ","Daniel Eggers","Thank you, Carol. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section on Exelon's website. The earnings release and other materials which we discuss during today's call contains forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.","Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the Appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. ","I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Chris Crane","Thank you, Dan, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our yearend 2018 call. Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to thank our employees in those of other utilities who worked during the extremely cold weather to keep our communities safe and warm during the recent Polar Vortex. Our nuclear plants ran at nearly 100% during the week. ","The investment reliability made on our system made a difference and we had more than 500 crews out restoring service to customers in temperatures that reached a negative 23 degrees without including the wind show factor. ","I\u2019ll start on Slide 5. 2018 was a great year for Exelon and its operating companies. We executed on our strategy and delivered on our commitments to customers, communities and shareholders. We are in a solid position to continue to bring value to our stakeholders in 2019. ","Our financial performance was strong. Full year GAAP earnings were $2.07 per share and adjusted operating earnings were $3.12 per share, well ahead of the original guidance range. ","Joe will walk through the details later in the call. Last year we shared our goals for 2018 and are proud to report we are able to meet those commitments. Utility and generation operations had best performance in multiple categories. I\u2019ll get those details in a few minutes. ","Last year, Exelon Utilities invested more than $5.5 billion in capital, primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience, as well as improve reliability and resiliency, which resulted in higher customer satisfaction scores. We are also effective on the regulatory front completing 13 distribution and transmission cases in 2018. ","PHI was able to reach constructive settlements in all of its cases, including Pepco, and in Maryland \u2013 at Pepco in Maryland and D.C for the first time since 1980s. We shared the benefit of the tax reform with our 10 million customers returning more than $675 million on an annual basis. Working with stakeholders to realize timely and fair regulatory outcomes helped us fund future investments in our system and continue to improve customer service. ","On the policy front, the Second and Seventh Circuit Court upheld the ZEC program in New York and Illinois. Although the plaintiffs have appealed to the Supreme Court, we expect these rulings to stand. New Jersey enacted the ZEC legislation which will start this spring and we are still focused on preserving nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. ","The Public Utility Commission of Texas adopted the changes to the ORDC curve earlier this year. We are awaiting a decision from FERC on PJM\u2019s fast start proposal and on PJM\u2019s capacity market reform and PJM is expected to file its reserve market reforms in coming months. These policies, each in their own way better compensate our zero carbon nuclear fleet for the value it provides by addressing flaws in the existing energy and capacity markets. ","We are growing our dividend by 5% each year through 2020 with the Board raising the annual dividend to $1.45 per share on Monday. We are dedicated to corporate responsibility and supporting the communities we serve in an important part of who we are and what we do. ","As part of our partnership with the UN HeForShe Initiative, we held an inaugural STEM initiative leadership academies for teenagers in Chicago and Washington D.C. 95 girls participated in a week long program designed to empower them through mentorship and creating opportunities to learn about STEM. We are expanding this program in 2019. ","And 2018 was another record year for employee volunteerism and contributions. Our employees volunteered more than 240,000 hours last year on average seven hours per employee and donated nearly $13 million. In addition, Exelon donated more than $51 million to charitable organizations throughout our footprint. ","We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our 34,000 employees. We were named a Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, Black Enterprise Magazine, DiversityInc and the Human Rights Campaign. We are also recognized for environmental stewardship. We received a score of A minus on both the CDP climate change and water surveys, the highest by any utility for each. ","We were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 13th year in a row and we had a series of commitments for the 2018, we delivered on the task is for 2019 is beginning as big and I will cover those at the end of the call. ","On Slide 6, we show the impact that Exelon management model has had on our utility operations. Each of our utilities have materially improved their operation since the merger with Constellation or PHI. To put this chart in perspective, ComEd has improved its overall reliability 60% since 2012, the hard work of our employees and the ability to share best practices across a large platform is paying off. ","In 2018 all four of our utilities ended up in top quartile for safety, or outage frequency performance with ComEd at top decile and PHI matching its best performance on record. Each utility achieved top quartile on CAIDI or outage duration except PECO which missed top quartile by only one minute. BGE and ComEd performed in top decile. ","BGE and PECO had top decile performance in Gas odor response for the 6th consecutive year and PHI delivered top decile performance for the second year in a row. This level of reliability demonstrates that the investments we are making in our system are yielding positive results for our customers, but we still have more to do to confront climate change and our customer demands. ","Customer satisfaction was top quartile at, at least three of the four utilities ComEd, BGE and PHI had the best performance on record in call center satisfaction. ComEd and PHI scored in top decile for service level and BGE and PHI had their best performance on record. ","Our utilities in the Mid-Atlantic operated extremely well in the phase of record-breaking rainfall. D.C. saw more than 5.5 feet of rain, Baltimore 6 feet and Philadelphia, 8 feet of rain during last year. ","Our safety metrics improved over the year as a result of the actions we are taking to correct course. We will continue to focus on improving our performance in this area. ","Turning to our competitive business on Slide 7. Our Generation fleet performed very well in 2018 providing abundance of clean electricity that our country needs. In fact, Exelon generated one out of every nine clean megawatts in the United States, more than twice as many of any other generator. Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. ","Our capacity factor was 94.6 exceeding 94% for the third year in a row in five out of the last six years. We generated the most nuclear power ever at 159 million megawatt hours avoiding more than 82 million metric tons of Greenhouse Gas Emission in 2018. Our average outage duration was 21 days, a new Exelon record and 13 days better than the industry average. ","Exelon Power\u2019s gas and hydro dispatch match 98.1% and wind and solar captured 96.1% or better than plan. In October, we acquired the Everett LNG import facility and in December, we received a cost of service order from FERC for Mystic unit 8 and 9, which together will allow us to provide fuel security in New England market through May of 2024. ","Our Mystic units are critical in keeping the lights on during the extreme cold temperatures we saw in January and February of last year. At Constellation, our C&I operating metrics remains strong. 78% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than six years and power contract terms of 24 months on average. ","We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers and continue to focus on cost is helping us support operating margins. Constellation strength lies in its durable relationship with its customers. That relationship is more than just power and gas, but is built on Consteallation\u2019s unique ability to help our customers meet their energy needs, while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals.","Now I will turn it over to Joe. ","Joe Nigro","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. Today, I will cover our 2018 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures, and 2019 guidance. Starting with Slide number 8, we had another strong year. For the fourth quarter, we earned $0.16 per share on a GAAP basis, and $0.58 per share on a non-GAAP basis. ","For the full year, we earned $3.12 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the midpoint our revised full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 above our original midpoint. ","Exelon Utilities outperformed our full year plan due to higher distribution and transmission revenues with the early resolution of rate cases at Pepco and favorable weather. This was partially offset by the first quarter winter storms. ","ExGen performed in line with guidance. Realized gains realized gains at our nuclear decommissioning trust funds were offset by several factors unique to 2018 including higher allocated transmission costs. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments. ","Turning to Slide 9, it shows an overview of our 2018 rate case outcomes. Across our utilities, we received final orders in eight distribution cases. We reached settlements in six of the cases at PECO, Delmarva, Delaware on the electric and gas sites. Delmarva, Maryland and PEPCO Maryland and D.C. which is the first time we\u2019ve had settlements at PEPCO since the 1980s. ","Additionally, ComEd received a 100% of its ask for the second year in a row and finally in early January, the Maryland PSC approved 78% of the ask in BGE\u2019s gas distribution case. Our focus on improving the reliability and service levels is reflected in our rate case outcomes across our jurisdictions. ","On Slide 10, we compare the 2018 trailing 12 months blended transmission and distribution earned ROEs to 2017. Our constructive rate case results and the roll-off of the FAS 109 charge drove the improved earned returns this year. We are encouraged by PHI\u2019s ongoing improvement with earned ROEs improving by 70 to 140 basis points. ","Exelon Utilities earned a combined 9.7% ROE, up year-over-year. We remained focused on achieving our Utility earnings growth targets by improving the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities. We expect that all our utilities will earn in a 9% to 10% range in 2019. ","On Slide 11, we roll over to our outlook for Utility CapEx and rate-based growth covering 2019 to 2022. Since the merger with PHI in 2016, we have invested more than $16 billion in our utility and plan to invest nearly $23 billion over the next four years. As Chris said, these investments are improving our system reliability, service experience by our Utility customers and preparing us for the future. ","As a reminder, the CapEx budgets we share with you reflects identified and approved projects. As we move through time, we generally find more investments due to additional system needs. When we compare our 2019 to 2021 CapEx outlook, versus the same period last year, we plan to invest an additional $1.5 billion of CapEx for the benefit of our customers. ","This additional capital is spread across our utilities with the biggest increase at our largest utility ComEd. Since the PHI merger, we have added nearly $6 billion in rate base across the utilities. ","Over the next four years, we will grow our rate base 7.8% annually to $50.7 billion, adding $13.1 billion to rate base by 2022 or the equivalent of adding a utility almost the size of ComEd without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals. Rate base is growing slightly faster than the 7.4% growth we projected last year. ","As a reminder, the bulk of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers. These support our ability to make additional investments to strengthen our system and have the opportunity to earn a fair and timely return on our capital where we do not have these mechanisms; we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools. ","In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility starting on Slide 22. ","As you turn to Slide 12, we continue to forecast strong Utility less holding company EPS growth of 6% to 8% even for the elevated \u2013 even from the elevated 2018 starting point, where we executed the midpoint of our guidance range \u2013 we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09 per share. ","Compared to last year, the outlook for 2019 to 2021 has improved with all bands increasing by $0.05 per share. The durability of our industry-leading earnings growth reflects a combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for more digital economy and growing environmental goals along with concerted efforts to manage loss and a focus on modest customer bill inflation. ","On Slide 13, we provide our gross margin updating current hedging strategy at the Generation company. There is no change in total gross margin in 2019 from our last disclosure. Open gross margin increased $50 million due to improving spark spreads at ERCOT, as well as higher prices at New York Zone A and NiHub, which were offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million in Power new business. ","In 2020, open gross margin is up $150 million, due to higher prices in most of our regions. Given our hedged position and execution of $100 million of new business, total gross margin increased by $50 million since last quarter. ","We are showing you 2021 for the first time today, which is down $250 million compared to 2020. The decline reflects lower power prices in PJM and ERCOT, plus lower capacity revenues in New England and PJM. ","Our Power and non-Power new business To Go numbers for 2021 are consistent with prior years. I should point out that these disclosures are based on 12\/31 pricing and do not reflect any impacts from recently approved ORDC curve changes in Texas. ","We remain behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 9% to 12% behind ratable in 2019 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 while we are $0.02 to $0.05 \u2013 2% to 5% behind ratable in 2021.","When considering cross-commodity hedges, our open market length is primarily concentrated in the Midwest in Texas. We are comfortable maintaining a more open position given our balance. ","Slide 14 shows our O&M and capital outlook at Generation. Our O&M forecast has been updated since our third quarter call, primarily to reflect increased pension expense and the acquisition of the Everett Marine Terminal that serves our Mystic units. Like the others, the returns on our pension investments did not meet our planned returns resulting in increased cost going forward. ","In total, these updates have added $75 million in O&M costs or about a 6% - or $0.06 per share drag in 2019 through 2021. However, even with these cost pressures, we expect to see a 1% annual decline in O&M over the next four years. Compared to our previous disclosure, our 2019 to 2021 CapEx is up modestly. In 2019, due to timing delays for our Midway plants and some retail customer-sited solar.","In 2020, with modest increases in nuclear fuel cost related to the rising uranium prices where we had hedged with colors. We continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleets. ","Slide 15 rolls over to ExGen\u2019s available cash flow outlook for 2019 through 2022. We expect cumulative available cash flow to be $7.8 billion, which is $200 million higher than our previous four year outlook. We will use the available cash flow from ExGen to primarily fund the increased utility investment, pay down debt, and cover a small portion of the dividend. ","We will invest approximately $600 million in growth capital which is primarily customer-sited solar projects at Constellation and as I mentioned the completion in the West Medway plant in New England this quarter. ","As I mentioned earlier, we have identified additional capital investment at our utilities. As a result, we have significantly increased the amount of equity going into the utilities from ExGen by $700 million to a range of $4 billion to $4.4 billion.","We will use between $300 million and $500 million of ExGen\u2019s free cash flow to fund the dividend not covered by the utilities. As utilities continue to grow, ExGen\u2019s portion of the dividend decreased as even as the dividend itself grows. ","Finally, we have planned to retire between $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion of debt with our strong credit metrics exceeding our internal targets, we felt it made more sense to shift cash, plans for debt reductions to instead support the higher value-added and need investments at our utilities. ","A big part of our value proposition is our unique ability to redeploy strong free cash flow from generation to fund Utility growth without needing to go to the equity markets. This remains a differentiated advantage to our peers. ","Moving on to Slide 16, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit ratings. We are comfortably ahead of our corporate targets for FFO to debt and well above the agency\u2019s downgrade thresholds. As you are aware, Exelon and its operating companies are on credit watch positive at both S&P and Fitch. ","Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target of three times in 2019. We expect to be at 2.4 times debt-to-EBITDA and 1.9 times debt-to-EBITDA on a recourse basis. We are actively following the PGE bankruptcy process. PGE is a sole off-taker of our Antelope Valley Solar Ranch or AVSR facility which was funded by Exelon DOE loans and project financing at our non-recourse to Exelon. ","We, along with other owners of renewable generation under contract with BG&E recently received a FERC order affirming the Commission\u2019s role to approve any modifications to existing PPAs which BG&E has challenged in the bankruptcy court. We will remain diligent in protecting the contractual value of AVSR and the role what assets like ours have in California\u2019s clean energy future. ","From an earnings perspective, AVSR provides $0.03 per share to Exelon in operating earnings and is not significant to our credit metrics given the non-recourse project nature. ","Finally, I will conclude with our 2019 earnings guidance on Slide 17. We are providing 2019 adjusted operating earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in earnings at the utilities is driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our consumers, last year\u2019s completed rate cases and improvements in PHI\u2019s ROEs.","The decline in Generation earnings is a combination of normalized Illinois ZEC revenues as we recognized $0.11 of 2017 Illinois ZEC revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and lower realized energy prices which are partially offset by increased ZEC revenues in New Jersey and New York as well as fewer planned nuclear outages. ","As you think about our 2019 earnings, the most notable new updates include, the $0.05 per share increase to our Utility earnings band, the $0.02 to $0.03 of pension expense at ExGen due to worst than expected plant performance in 2018, as well as a roughly $0.03 per share drag from the recent Everett LNG facility acquisition, which represents a negative near-term impact, but is a positive value driver in the future with the Mystic cost to service contract beginning in 2022. These impacts are reflected in our O&M and other expense data in the appendix. ","We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in a range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix starting on Slide 61. ","I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments. ","Chris Crane","Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 18, I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2019. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities and running our generation fleets safely and reliably. ","We will meet or exceed our financial commitments including achieving earnings within our guidance range and maintaining our investment-grade rating. ","At the Utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $5.3 billion of capital to benefit our customers and we will file rate cases with the goal of achieving the 9% to 10% earned ROEs across Exelon Utility families by year end. ","Building upon successes in Delaware, D.C., Maryland and Pennsylvania, we will advocate for policies in our state legislatures and our commissions that will enable the utility of the future and help meet the needs of our customers. ","At Generation, a number of our nuclear plants are economically challenged due to market flaws that failed to value zero carbon nuclear energy for its environmental and grid resiliency benefits. As you know, we plan to retire TMI later this year and as a reminder, all of the Dresden and portions of the Braidwood and Byron plants did not clear last year\u2019s PJM auction. ","We will continue to engage with stakeholders on state policies while advocating broader market reforms at the Federal level. We will support PJM price formation changes like fast start and reserve market reforms with our states to implement the expected FERC order on PJM capacity reforms and preserve the authority of our states to advance their clean energy policies and continue our efforts to seek fair compensation or zero emitting nuclear plants. ","We will continue to grow our dividend at 5% annually through 2020 and we will be a partner and ally in the communities we serve. Being a good corporate citizen for our customers, communities and employees is key to who we are. ","Finally, turning to Slide 19, I will close on the value proposition that highlights our strategy and our commitment to shareholders. We have updated some of the numbers, but the proposition remains the same. We will continue to focus on growing our utilities targeting a 7.8% growth - rate base growth and a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022 rolling forward another year at above the Group trajectory. ","We continue to use free cash flow from ExGen to fund incremental equity needs of the utilities, pay down debt, and fund part of the growing dividend. ","We will continue to optimize value of our GenCo business by seeking fair compensation for zero emitting generation fleet, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the gen to load match strategy at Constellation.","We will sustain strong investment-grade metrics and we will grow the dividend annually of 5% through 2020. This strategy underpins this value proposition is effective in providing tangible benefits for our stakeholders. We are well positioned for growth to capture additional upside though needed policy and market reforms are required. ","We are very confident about the prospects for Exelon in 2019 and beyond and we remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earn your ongoing support at Exelon. ","With that operator, we can now open the call up to questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question this morning comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Greg Gordon ","Thanks. Good morning.","Chris Crane","Hey, Greg. ","Greg Gordon ","On the Utility side of the business, obviously, pretty meaningful increase in capital opportunities across the entire set of companies. What\u2019s the expected bill impact of the increase in spending? ","And as you look at the long-term and how much more sort of customer experience enhancing types of capital programs are you contemplating that are also affordable as we think about the opportunity, not just this year to execute on this new capital plan, but to continue to evolve your plan.","Anne Pramaggiore","Good morning, Greg. It\u2019s Anne Pramaggiore. I will start with your first question. We \u2013 when we put our capital plans together, LRPs each year we look at what the needs are in front of us. We challenge ourselves on O&M and if you can look at the O&M trajectory, it\u2019s about 0.3% increase over that four year period. ","And we always look at affordability. And we\u2019ve got eight bills on the distribution rate side and four of them \u2013 excuse me, three of them are roughly flat over that period that we\u2019ve showed you. Four of them are trending less than inflation and one of them will come in right at inflation and that\u2019s a combination of managing our O&M and also our energy efficiency programs which are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our package here. ","So, that\u2019s basically what we are looking at in terms of affordability. The other question that we ask ourselves is, are there vulnerable groups inside that average that we look at in terms of billing and rates. And we \u2013 so, we\u2019ve been looking hard at the low income side and a lot of our initiatives include enhanced low income programs along with it. ","So, that\u2019s what we are looking at in terms of affordability, bills that are staying at or well below inflation and also looking at low income. In terms of looking forward, we think about investment in really three buckets. ","One is, reliability and resiliency, just the core basics and improving the material condition of our systems, the safety of our systems and as the economy changes, and we\u2019ve got more and more parts of the economy leaning on the electric system, how do you ensure that that\u2019s reliable and resilient. The second area is, really adapting to renewables and distributed generation. ","We\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility and dynamism to add to the grid in order to be able to deal with the kinds of changes that we will see in terms of supply coming from many different places and many different actors and demand being much more volatile. ","So, thinking about sensors on the system, artificial intelligence, distributed intelligence on the system that allow us to move operations on our assets from 16 to 18 cycles down to 6 to 8 cycles, that sort of thing. And then the last area is really thinking about electrification of transportation and what we need to do the system to \u2013 in expectation of that kind of shift. ","So those are the areas that we think about and look out. We watch our stakeholders very closely. We are starting to see legislation and policy come out of D.C. in December, big piece of policy there. The Pennsylvania came out with a clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction, executive order in January. And so we watch what our stakeholders and our policymakers are telling us and how they are directing us. ","Greg Gordon ","Great. Thanks. And I\u2019ll ask one more and then go to the back of the queue. Joe, I know that you were focused on the strong 2018 performance and the 2019 outlook. But I think it\u2019s sort of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again with people just focused on the 2021 rollout of sort of the guidance pieces for ExGen. ","And once again we see as we have in prior years, pretty significant backwardation and what the current state of players for the earnings outlook for ExGen based on the algebra you gave in the deck, it\u2019s $0.20 headwind on total gross margin, probably a $0.05 offset through prudent O&M. ","But still much like we\u2019ve seen in past updates that are sort of two years forward. There looks today, significant pressures on ExGen margin, what can you tell investors about how you feel about that as you think you roll into real-time over the next two years? ","Joe Nigro","Hey, Greg. I appreciate the question. The first thing is, we are not in the business of giving EPS guidance beyond the prompt here, but having said that, I think as you\u2019ve seen through time, our earnings have improved each year when you look at forward years and by the time we get to those in the realized time period. ","When you look at the gross margin in 2021 versus 2020, there is a \u2013 the two big drivers very simply are, as you mentioned, one is the backward-dated price curve and obviously, for us the biggest impact is at NiHub and West Hub and Jim could talk for a while about what we are doing. We are aggressively managing our portfolio. ","You see that were behind our ratable plan. Actual spot prices last year obviously, were very, very strong. And then, secondly, Kathleen and her team are working very aggressively on policy reforms as well as PJM and others. So, I don\u2019t think this story has been fully written there and obviously we have a very large open position. ","The second piece of it is driven really by capacity and some of it\u2019s in New England where the prices were lower year-over-year and in PJM where we had lower volumes clear year-over-year. But from my lens, I think, the strength of our balance sheet affords us strategic and operational flexibility and hedging is \u2013 less hedging is an example of that and t through time, we\u2019ve continued to improve our earnings and we will continue to work hard to do that in 2021. ","Greg Gordon ","Okay. Thank you guys. ","Chris Crane","Yes, just to add on. I mean, just to summarize that. You have got low or minimal liquidity in those years, 2021 and out \u2013 2021 and out \u2013 you build the liquidity as you go through the prompt year in to the next year and you see the curves come up and that\u2019s been the pattern. ","Until we get these market reforms in, if it\u2019s moving the plants in Illinois or some amount of the plants in Illinois to FRR, so we can get better capacity treatment that matches state\u2019s environmental needs or if you look at price formation that's working through you look at reserve curves being revised, there is a lot of activity going. ","So, that\u2019s why we are keeping more of an open position. We believe the market will strengthen. ","Greg Gordon ","Thank you, Chris.","Chris Crane","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman ","Hi, good morning. Couple market structure questions. ","Chris Crane","Hi.","Steve Fleishman ","Hi, Chris. The \u2013 first of all in Pennsylvania, in terms of any chance to get to x. Could you give us an update there? And when would something have to happen for you to not have to close TMI?","Chris Crane","So, the activities that Kathleen is leading with the other operating companies in Pennsylvania are promising. We have some strong support. It\u2019s going to have to move this spring. We have to order a core by May, and we\u2019ve let the stakeholders know that. So, if we can get this through in that period of time, we will be able to save the unit short of that we would be beyond the return at the end of May. ","Steve Fleishman ","And is there any sense on what the value \u2013 targeted value of the ZEC is going to be in Pennsylvania? ","Kathleen Barr\u00f3n","I\u2019ll take that one, Steve. This is Kathleen. I think that is subject to discussions that are ongoing among the lawmakers now. So we don\u2019t have an estimate for you on how the program will look. How it will be priced. Those are discussions that are progressing as Chris said with some promising outlook. ","Steve Fleishman ","Okay. And then, just, have to ask and probably hard to answer. Just, any better sense of where FERC may come out on the capacity market reforms? Is there any hinge from the changes at FERC and what happened with the New England auction and things like that where you might have a better idea? ","Kathleen Barr\u00f3n","I\u2019ll take that one, as well. I don\u2019t think we have a better idea than we did on our last call of how they are going to come out. Clearly, there has been some delay in the schedule and I think that\u2019s a function of the transition at FERC. The unfortunate death of the Chairman integrating a new Commissioner, Commissioned with floor announcing her plans for retirement. ","So, while they have been able to get out a number of important orders others have lagged and the capacity market order among them. So, I think, as we are doing as you are doing, looking at the key leads and trying to make an estimate of where we think things will land but we really have no single yet from them as to when we will see their final decision in that docket.","Steve Fleishman ","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Chris Crane","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?","Chris Crane","Yes. Hear you well. Good morning. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Excellent. Congratulations again. I wanted to follow-up a little bit more on the utilities side, can you walk through some of the more specific dynamics for the longer-dated 22 year. I mean, that\u2019s just a pretty impressive jump at the end there. ","What exact dynamics? And also what kind earned ROEs are you embedding out there within the ranges? I mean, just perhaps once you get the 22, what are we going to talking about with respect to the position of the utilities and also rate case schedule et cetera?","Anne Pramaggiore","Hi, Julien. It\u2019s Anne Pramaggiore. Let me start by giving you sense of what the investment patterns look like and what sort of \u2013 I think driving the trending that you are seeing and then, between Joe and I we\u2019ll talk about the ROEs. So, we are \u2013 there is a couple of things that are happening there. One is the things that we have done in the last year. ","So we\u2019ve gone through and accelerated our Gas main replacement program as we move them from 30 years to 20 years. And so, you are seeing an acceleration of the Gas investments. So, that\u2019s one of the pieces that you are seeing trending there. One of the things that we are doing at PECO now is we are looking at some material conditions upgrades. ","But we are also doing a program to upgrade 4 KV feeders to 12 KV feeders in anticipation of more and more distributed generation coming on the system. You just can\u2019t put that stuff on the kind of some of the feeders we\u2019ve got in place in right now. So that\u2019s one of the areas we are looking at. And another program at PECO is, really enhancing the underground replacement program. ","Again, underground cable program. Again, some material condition work. I think you are pretty familiar with the \u2013 most of the PHI work we\u2019ve got, D.C. plug that we are getting started and we also are looking at some work potentially coming through off of the new legislation that was passed in December. ","At BG&E, we\u2019ve got some new EV investment that\u2019s coming through after the order that just came out of the commission. So, some additional capital investment there. At ComEd, we are expanding the distribution automation program that we have in place. We are doing some more underground cable work and starting to invest across the utilities on security investments. ","We got about a program for security on our substations and cyber security, that\u2019s about $900 million across the utilities over that period and some investment in some of our IT systems to get ready for, again, more flexible dynamic grids. So those are \u2013 I think some of the things that you are looking at that's driving that capital trend. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","And just to jump on quickly in that, what\u2019s driving that uptick from 21 to 22 though? What are the dynamics there, specifically? That\u2019s a pretty big jump. ","Joe Nigro","Julien, it\u2019s Joe. Good morning. Specifically to your question, the jump from 21 to 22, Anne went through at each of the utilities the investments that we are making in the rate base. That compounding of that investments is one component of it. The second thing is we have a rate case in PECO in 2021 that has benefits in 2022 and then the third thing is there is additional spending under the formula rate at ComEd. So, those three things together gets you to that outcome. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Excellent. All right. And then, turning back to the other side of the business real quickly. Can you talk a little bit about Everett and the contribution on the ExGen side? As you see that cost of service kick in 2022? And then also, how do you think about that asset has aligned, even at Mystic we are ultimately be pulled out of the market, how do you think about the LNG asset itself contributing kind of more structurally even?","Joe Nigro","Yes, I think, first of all, Julien, we acquired the Marine Terminal in Q4. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the acquisition is earnings negative from 2019 to 2021 driven by the increased O&M amounts with about half of the $75 million increase in O&M or $0.03 a share being driven by Everett. ","The gross margin from the facility is included in our open gross margin calculation in our hedge disclosure and isn\u2019t really material. What I would say is, obviously the Mystic cost of service contract arrangement begins in 2022 and effectively the whole thing is bundled and it becomes accretive at that time. ","We committed, we had a capacity commitment prior to the last auction and we were committed to honoring that commitment and one way to do that was to acquire the facility. We were also very clear \u2013 to your question about how would we treat it in the future? ","We are very clear that with any type of asset that is economically viable, we are going to work for solutions and ways to try to make that asset viable. But I think you\u2019ve seen with our financial discipline that when we\u2019ve had to, we\u2019ve taken the stance of making the necessary change.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Excellent. Thank you very much. Congrats again. ","Joe Nigro","Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein ","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. ","Chris Crane","Hi, Michael. ","Michael Weinstein ","Hey, just to be clear on the ROEs at PHI, you are saying that for all of 2019 you will be at the 9% to 10% range or are you going to be \u2013 or is that like a runrate at the end of the year?","Joe Nigro","That will be - by the end of the year, we will be in that range of 9% to 10% and effectively that will be the trailing 12 months at that time. ","Michael Weinstein ","Gotcha, okay. And then, on the ORDC, I understand that\u2019s a dynamic issue and you are not going to provide a point number on that, but is one of the things we\u2019ve tried to estimate it ourselves here around $25 million, perhaps of improvements for Exelon. I am just wondering if that\u2019s in the right ballpark. Perhaps you can give some kind of hands as to where what kind of impact you are thinking this might have on you? ","Jim McHugh","Right. And to be clear \u2013 hi, it\u2019s Jim McHugh, Michael. To be clear, we are talking about ERCOT?","Michael Weinstein ","Yes.","Jim McHugh","Okay, ERCOT ORDC, it is hard to put a pinpoint on a number on it. The way we are looking at it right now is, even before the ORDC change, we\u2019ve been talking about the tighter reserve margins. And you\u2019ve seen the CDR reports and we are in agreement with where they are coming in now. The reserve margins for this upcoming, somewhere look like they are somewhere between 7% and 8%. ","So, I think with the ORDC changes, you are just making the likelihood that scarcity is going to play a bigger role in where the summer prices go. We\u2019ve seen the forward market move up since the end of Q3 about $15 for summer on peak. Over the last month so, it\u2019s been more up and down and maybe a little higher, but more flattish. ","So, I think the market has been moving around its expectation of just how many scarcity hours there is going to be, which \u2013 to your point is the hard to predict. Obviously, it depends on where coincident or high loads with generation outages are variable win. The one way to think about it perhaps is, a single hour at $9000 is a dollar on the CAL ATC price. It's about $13 or $14 on the summer on peak price. ","So, I think what we are going to see the market do is really trade on a pretty volatile range as the assessment of how many scarcity hours there may or may not be can drive that summer $15 at a time just by adding an hour or two. So, putting an estimate on it right now is really just say how many hours we think there is going to be. ","But I think the way we like to think about it is increase the likelihood and sends the right price signal in times of tight market conditions.","Joe Nigro","And Michael, Jim is keeping a relatively significant open position and capability to extract value as we see volatility occur both in the forwards for the summer in 2019, as well as we will position ourselves well during that summer period. ","Michael Weinstein ","Thank you, very much for the help.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. ","Shahriar Pourreza ","Hey, Joe and Chris.","Chris Crane","Hey, Shar. ","Shahriar Pourreza ","So, just real quick on the O&M profile change, post 2022, should we kind of assume this is the new normal? And then, as we are sort of thinking about some of the incremental revenue items that\u2019s not within plan that could help mitigate or at least support some of this O&M pressures, especially they are closer to 2021, can you provide some color there? ","I mean, I think you mentioned, Mystic is obviously is one of it and LNG is another one. Is there sort of anything else we should be thinking about from the revenue offset side?","Joe Nigro","Yes, the one thing I would say and obviously, we haven\u2019t given you a forecast of O&M, 2022 and beyond, but the one thing I would say, and I made it the comment in my prepared remarks, the cost to service agreement at Mystic kicks in, in the middle of 2022 and that would more than offset those cost to the O&M that we show in 2021 or so. So, effectively, it turns into an accretive outcome as I said in my prepared remarks.","Chris Crane","And then pension, as you know, the market for 2018 was not great on equities. The December was pretty tough. We got some of that \u2013 a portion of that back in January. So, we will watch the pension. We will watch the pension investments, the interest rate and the return on the fund is what will drive the other half of what we saw the increase on this year, so, Everett and the pension. ","As far as the O&M discipline, we worked through the out years. We are far less than 1% all across the company and you know that\u2019s dealing with labor contacts, at 2.5% wage increases and other inflations forces. ","So, we do have a good plan on continuing to drive efficiency, hold the cost down and maintain that inflation rate as much lower at the generating company than utilities. But still the utilities are less than 1%. ","Shahriar Pourreza ","Got it. Got it. And then just lastly, Chris, that\u2019s helpful. And then, as we are sort of thinking about the ExGen gross margin, I know we\u2019ve talked about in the past maybe taking somewhat of a different approach when it comes to managing the portfolio, i.e. maybe operating some of the units more \u2013 from a portfolio portrait, so, like maybe FitzPatrick or Nine Mile, right? ","Are we sort of seeing any impact from this in your outlook or is this sort of something you guys are still going through internally? And then, I guess, what I am asking is, also beyond FitzPatrick and Nine Mile, is there any sort of things we should be thinking about from taking a more holistic approach to the assets?","Jim McHugh","Yes, it\u2019s Jim. I mean, if you are talking about New York, I think the way we are thinking about the portfolio in New York is, the capacity and the ZEC payment that we receive in New York has somewhat of an offsetting nature as energy prices rise. ","So we're in the \u2013 out in the outer years. So we are looking to make sure we are hedging our portfolio along the lines of where we think that index is going to set as the ZEC price sets according to the structure, the index structure in the ZEC. So, really there is not much of a shift in our strategy. ","I think what we\u2019ve been doing is finding opportunities in the nearby year to on the energy side to understand if we think the market is slightly underpriced or slightly overpriced. And right now, recently, we\u2019ve seen a pretty strong move in New York prices and we've been getting some good hedges off in CAL 2019 and CAL 2020 area to take advantage of those higher New York energy prices.","Shahriar Pourreza ","I guess, what I am asking is, have you seen any synergies for having these two assets so close to each other more from \u2013 less from a dispatch and hedging, but more from taking these systems, taking the units and operating as one. So there is clearly some synergies in there for owning these two assets so close to each other, right?","Chris Crane","Yes, I didn\u2019t get your question, first. I am sorry. ","Shahriar Pourreza ","No, it\u2019s okay. ","Chris Crane","So, the nuclear team is evaluating that. What they can do as far as management or what they can do as far as warehousing we have looked at combining security of plants. That\u2019s a cost prohibitive item. But they are continuing to drive through that. ","There is definitely more synergies that we will be continuing to work on there as we complete the integration and the team has time to work through the regulatory process and we have time to make the investments to make these consolidations. ","Shahriar Pourreza ","Perfect. And those synergies are incremental to plants?","Chris Crane","Right. They will be \u2013 if the ones aren\u2019t included now, but there also are initiatives that are underway across the nuclear fleet. We are looking at how we centralize warehouses versus having overstock warehouses each site. ","There is a lot of initiatives underway right now to take advantage as technology advances in \u2013 built into the cost savings numbered. Now as an assumption that we centralize engineering since we have much more digital information and we can trend the equipment remotely versus having the engineers in the plant on the site. So there is things like that across the fleet that we are working on. ","Shahriar Pourreza ","Perfect, Chris. That\u2019s what I was trying to get at. Thanks so much. ","Chris Crane","Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Chris Crane","Hey, Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold ","Couple of things. On the O&M at ExGen, just when you look behind the numbers that obviously have these new incremental pieces. Are you still going after the $200 million in additional cost savings?","Chris Crane","Yes. ","Jonathan Arnold ","And $100 million at services that you shared at EEI?","Chris Crane","Yes, that\u2019s still in the plan. We have line of sight on that and we will continue and just to reemphasize, we are not going off plan on savings or efficiency. ","Two factors, pension, underperformance in the market required us to higher state O&M and Everett, which reverses out and provides greater revenues in the 2022 timeframe. So, these are the things we have line of sight of, it\u2019s not that the efficiency programs have been taken to pedal off of. ","Jonathan Arnold ","Yes, I just want to check Chris, because you are showing it slightly differently. So, thank you for that. ","Chris Crane","Okay. We will get with you to clarify that. ","Jonathan Arnold ","And secondly, I see you removed the disclosures on New England and sensitivities and we realized the Mystic contracts out in 2022. But is that just small enough than to make it simpler or something else going on there?","Chris Crane","There is really nothing else going on, Jon. That we made a decision to collapse the New England region into Open Gross Margin, because, with the changes to that facility and the inputs of Gas and so on, and the associated contract change, the volume of our power generation output is falling. ","And then, you\u2019ve got the gas acquisition of Everett that we\u2019ve talked about and that would all factor into that EREV calculation and you would see changes that were quite variable quarter-to-quarter. Most importantly, the overall gross margin is very small compared to the total gross margin we provide you in the disclosure. ","Jonathan Arnold ","Perfect. Okay, thank you. And then, could \u2013 I don\u2019t know, this is timely or not but, Chris any update on sort of efforts to engage the legislature in Illinois coalition building, et cetera. We did notice the bill that seem to be very \u2013 renewables-only got floated this week. So I was just curious if you have any comments you\u2019d like to share on that? ","Chris Crane","Yes, it\u2019s very, very early in the legislative cycle. As you can imagine, we work within the coalitions, within the state on what\u2019s needed to continue to advance the environmental stakeholders, the customers and sound investments. ","So, we have our folks communicating in those coalitions and communicating with the legislative folks. It\u2019s premature to say, what it looks like at the end of the day. But they are at the beginning of the f the sausage-making right now. And we will continue to have productive conversations. ","Jonathan Arnold ","In the FERC order, sort of a pre-requisite for actually something happening this year? ","Chris Crane","Not on the utility side and we are looking at other methods on the generation side. The FERC order definitely would be helpful to get out in a timely manner. But we don\u2019t need it. You can go to use the current statute and achieve what we think we can do \u2013 want to do.","Jonathan Arnold ","Okay, I\u2019ll leave with that. Thank you, Chris.","Chris Crane","Thanks. ","Operator","Our final question comes from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Please go ahead. ","Praful Mehta ","Thanks so much. Hi, guys. ","Chris Crane","Hey, Praful. How are you?","Praful Mehta ","Good. Thanks for this marathon session. So quickly on PJM, I guess, one last piece that was left was Fast Start. So just wanted to get any color or a view on timing of when that will come. We\u2019ve been waiting for it for a while at this point.","Kathleen Barr\u00f3n","Yes, this is Kathleen. And I think that\u2019s within the scope of what I said earlier on the call. Unfortunately, there are \u2013 excuse me, a number of matters that are lagging and that\u2019s one of them. And I think the transitions at the commission have affected their ability to get big orders out. ","But just going back to the beginning of the Fast Start docket, recall, this is something that the FERC ask PJM to file. So, we continue to feel confident about how it will turn out even if it\u2019s going to take a little bit longer than we expected. ","Praful Mehta ","Gotcha. Fair enough. And then, Slide 15, that\u2019s a very helpful capital allocation slide that you provide. In that, if we think about all of these benefits that are potentially coming on the ExGen side, right with Fast Start, ORDC, ZEC, all of them are incremental to the plan. ","How would we think about the allocation given you\u2019ve kind hit your utility investment targets, you are hitting your debt reduction targets, where does the incremental capital that potentially comes through go in your mind going forward?","Chris Crane","Yes, the answer in my mind I think is very similar to what you saw with the plan \u2013 with the increase at the utilities. Anne talked about the way she is thinking about the three buckets of investment at our utilities. And the benefits to our customers as it relates to those three buckets. We would continue to look at ways as we see projects that are beneficial for that. ","We would continue to look at investment there and then I think, additionally, that incremental \u2013 those incremental dollars continue to provide us operating and strategic flexibility and we\u2019ve talked about what that\u2019s worth in the sense of our hedging and the opportunity to be more aggressive with that and other things. So, we are going to continue to work hard to get those and I think it gives us a lot of opportunity. ","Praful Mehta ","Gotcha. But share buyback is not one of those that\u2019s in the plan right now, or contemplated in the plan?","Chris Crane","Not contemplated in the plan, but all investments are bounced off to share buyback before they are made. ","Praful Mehta ","Gotcha. Perfect. Well, I appreciate it guys. Thank you so much. ","Chris Crane","Well, I want to thank everybody \u2013 all of you for participating today. I want to thank you our employees for another good year both operationally and financially. So with that, we will close out the call and all have a good weekend.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you, Mr. Ganti you may begin your conference.","Ravi Ganti","Thank you, Brit, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exelon\u2019s first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven\u2019t received it, the release is available on Exelon\u2019s website.","The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today\u2019s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today\u2019s 8-K and Exelon\u2019s other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management\u2019s projections, forecasts, and expectations, and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings.","Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s President and CEO; and Jack Thayer, Exelon\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They\u2019re joined by other members of Exelon\u2019s executive management team who will be available to answer your questions. We have currently scheduled 60 minutes for this call.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s CEO.","Christopher M. Crane","Thanks Ravi and good morning to everybody and thank you for joining us. We had a very successful first quarter; we delivered on our financial expectations while having great quarter from an operational perspective.","We had to make a hard decision, critical choice to resize our dividend within the quarter and if we struck the right balance between a strong balance sheet and returning value to the shareholder. It was the right decision to pursue our goal of long-term value return. And since January, the stock performance is indicative of the removal of the dividend uncertainty overhang, the beginning of the market recovery and in general a bullish view on natural gas.","From a financial perspective, the first quarter operating earnings as announced this morning was $0.70 per share. It\u2019s the top of our guidance range that we had previously given of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. Jack is going to provide more detail in his comments on the drivers around that.","Our second quarter guidance that we are providing is a range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share for operating earnings which allows us to reaffirm our year guidance of $2.35 to $2.65 per share. Operations remained strong while the full-year gross margin expectation at Constellation is marginally lower as you will see in a hedge disclosure. It\u2019s in line with our expectations, and Jack and Ken will provide more color during the call on the aspects of that. At present, we see no reason to depart from our full-year range.","Focusing on operational updates, the fleet operated at an excellent level in the quarter. The nuclear fleet capacity factor was $96.4 compared with $93.6 for the same quarter last year. Nuclear set first quarter fleet record for generation at ownership bringing our 2007 by some 575 gigawatt-hours, that\u2019s the fourth best quarter in the history of Exelon from a capacity factor standpoint. Our fossil and renewable fleet had a strong quarter as well, with the fossil availability of 98.4% in solar and wind energy capture rate at 94.9%. BGE throughout the quarter had a very constructive rate case and Jack is going to provide some more details on that.","Switching to Illinois, SB 9 Illinois excuse me, we hope will be enacted this year. We are on a good path there, we have a had it passed with, we have good majority in the Senate and the House; we are waiting on the Governor to act.","Once enacted on, we can start executing our plan of grid modernization included in the installation of the smart meters and improving the reliability of the infrastructure. Focusing on the market update, the power prices have improved since the beginning of the year as we\u2019ve all seen. We continue to monitor markets closely to form our hedging strategy, we do believe as we previously said, there is more upside remaining in the older years.","Gas prices have picked up in the near term, while holding a flat trajectory in the out years. However, there is more support for a bullish view towards gas in the forwards. The fundamental points to our existing view of the $4 to $6 an MMBtu for natural gas in the $15 to $16 range, we are constantly favoring the hedge program to these views. And Ken will be available to answer more questions in that area on the call.","As we focused our look towards the balance of the year, our highest priority is maintaining our focus on safety, operations and financial discipline. Delivering on the financial results we promised will help us realize the synergy targets for the successful merger. We are on track right now to complete the $550 million run rate on synergies by the end of 2015.","Looking at the growth project update, we continue to make progress on our projects that we previously announced. We successfully installed 69 megawatts of solar as part of our AVSR in the first quarter and expect to build-out another 132 megawatts in the balance of the year. The Smart Meter installation in two of the three utilities continues; BGE installed a 127,000 meter so far and have 150,000 are expected by year-end. At PECO, we\u2019ve installed a 158,000 during the first quarter with another 160,000 expected by mid-June and the ComEd installation schedule is predicted based on House Bill 9 approval as I previously mentioned. So overall very solid quarter continuing to deliver on the promises.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack to provide more details on the financial update.","Jonathan W. Thayer","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll now review the first quarter financial results, our second quarter guidance range, the updates to our hedge disclosures and discuss our balance sheet and cash flow outlook.","I\u2019ll start with our financial results on Slide 4. Operating earnings for the first quarter of this year were $0.70 per share at the top-end of our first quarter guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.85 per share that we reported during the first quarter of 2012. The key drivers of the reduction in earnings quarter-over-quarter were merger related share count differential and lower ExGen gross margin, primarily related to a combination of lower realized prices and lower capacity revenues. These impacts were partially offset by favorable weather of utilities and the addition of fourth quarter of earnings from legacy Constellation businesses.","We delivered earnings at the top end of our first quarter guidance range through a number of smaller positive variances that include our nuclear fleet achieving a 96.4% capacity factor and favorable interest on tax related items. We also benefitted from approximately $0.04 per share of favorable O&M timing variance, primarily related to projects and outage timing. We expect this timing benefit to reverse over the remainder of 2013.","Portfolio management results were unfavorable plan for the quarter, specifically we sold our access link early in the quarter did advance of an expected decline in prices due to moderate weather. Prices subsequently increased and are generating, we do not participate in this upward movement.","Our updated hedging disclosure reflects this first quarter weakness. Importantly, while our near-term headwind; this shift in pricing is a long-term benefit due to the high ratables hedging strategy we pursued for 2014 and beyond.","Starting with second quarter results, we will be able to update you on year-over-year progress for BGE and ExGen in a more comparable view similar to the sliding appendix detailing ComEd and PECO\u2019s quarter-over-quarter drivers. As you saw from our earnings release, our GAAP earnings for the first quarter are a loss $0.01 per share, which is steadily $0.01 lower than our non-GAAP results but in line with our expectations.","These items accounted for this variance. As you are recall during the first quarter, we disclosed that we will be taking a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $265 million or $0.31 per share in connection with our reevaluation of a lifetime exchange position from our ComEd asset sales in 1999.","The remaining two items are the amortization of commodity contract intangibles related to the merger and changes in the mark to market of our hedges in the first quarter. The market to market impact of a loss of $0.27 per share is expected given the increase in commodity prices during the first quarter.","For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. This compares to our realized earnings of $0.61 per share during the same period last year. The main driver for this decline are similar to first quarter explanations with power prices and capacity prices down from 2012 and includes the offset of improved rates at ComEd and BGE.","I want to remind you that in the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a write down of regulatory asset at ComEd based on the ICC order in May of 2012. This was partially reversed in the fourth quarter of 2012 after the October rehearing. For the full year 2013, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $2.35 to $2.65 per share. Now I\u2019ll provide the gross margin update for Exelon Generation.","Slide 5 provides the first quarter hedge disclosure compared to the data as of December 31, 2012. As you can see, forward power prices increased in nearly all regions, in particular West Hub and Ni-Hub increased by $2 per megawatt hour or more across all of the years. This increase reflects two key factors, rising natural gas prices and expansion of heat rates in these regions. Importantly, we believe that the markets are beginning to reflect some of the $3 to $6 per megawatt hour, a fundamental upside that we have discussed previously.","As for the end of the first quarter, we believe the upside is closer to $2 to $4 per megawatt hour. We still see a disconnect in lower heat rates compared to what a fundamental forecast would indicate given current natural gas prices, expected retirements and load assumptions. Importantly, ours is not the only voice highlighting the supply\/demand imbalance. We believe we are beginning to see the share being materialized due to several factors. The spot market saw increased weather driven volatility during the first quarter and it seems to be a moderately more bullish sentiment across the industry around the natural gas and power markets.","The increase in power prices drove increased open gross margin of approximately $350 million to $450 million per year. Factoring in the mark to market of existing hedges which decreased as prices mute higher, new hedging activity and changes to our targets we see a cumulative increase of approximately $350 million across the three years in hedged gross margin. You will notice that the Power New Business \/ To Go bucket shows a reduction across the years. It reflects the hedging activity that took place during this quarter for 2014 and 2015. In 2013, there is a $50 million reduction and expected portfolio management gross margin contributions for the reasons I discussed on Slide 4.","Financing activity in the products we choose to hedge reflect our belief that the prices will move even higher. We are approximately 3% behind ratable in 2014 and approximately 6% behind ratable in 2015. We continue to utilize natural gas sales and options in our hedging strategy to retain upside exposure to higher power prices and expanding heat rates while protecting against downside gas movements.","On Slide 6, we provide a review of our load expectations for the utilities. Overall, we see continued slow growth. In 2013, ComEd expects total load to be similar to 2012 results with only a small decline of 0.1% on a weather normal basis. This is in line with projections of moderate economic growth offset by growing energy efficiency.","PECO expects overall growth of 25% which is 1% better than we believe at the time of our year-end call. This reflects economic growth in the region and an overall employment growth outlook. BGE expects overall declines and low driven primarily by the bankruptcy of one of its largest industrial customers RG Steel. Excluding this bankruptcy, 2013 load for BGE would have seen growth of 0.4% over 2012 levels driven by customer growth and economy and offset by conservation programs.","Slide 7 provides an update of our cash flow expectations for this year. We still project strong cash from operations of $5.8 billion; this estimate is down slightly about $125 million from our original projections. Primary drivers decline include lower net income at excellent generation related to the previously mentioned revisions for our full-year portfolio management targets and timing of tax cash payments.","We anticipate lower capital spend this year and part due to the cancellation of the Dresden and Quad Cities MUR projects. On March 25 PECO announced that it will be utilizing its excess cash to redeem its preferred stock. The redemption date is today and the total stated value of preferred stock to be redeemed is $87 million.","As discussed previously, we also plan to call the $450 million of constellation junior subordinated hybrid debt this quarter with a coupon of [8.58%]. Additionally, you can see that we expect to end the year with $1.35 billion of cash across the company, the majority of which will be in held at ExGen given the size of that balance, we are reviewing the need to refinance $500 million of debt that is maturing in January of 2014. These actions were part of our plan to strengthen the balance sheet and maintain strong credit metrics as we mentioned during the year-end earnings call. Most importantly, all of our ratings and outlooks are now stable. In an effort to clarify some of the metrics, the rating agencies watch, we\u2019ve included a slide in the appendix showing the calculation of those metrics.","In closing on Slide 8, we look ahead to significant events for the remainder of the year. On May 24, the 2016\/2017 RPM Auction Results will be published. Results will largely depend on how much new generation bids in whether from new construction or through transmission access.","We expect a resolution of SB 9 in Illinois by the end of the second quarter, which if passed will increase operating revenues approximately $25 million and $65 million in 2013 and 2014 respectively. Additionally, under SB 9 we will increase capital expenditures by approximately $35 million and $45 million in 2013 and 2014 respectively.","We also recently filed our ComEd rate case, which ask for an increase of $311 million. This reflects actual 2012 expenses and investments and forecasted 2013 capital additions to our distribution network. The new rates are expected to take effect on January 01, 2014 after the ICCs review. This filing does not reflect the SB 9 legislation, which if it becomes effective would require us to update our filing.","We expect to file our next BGE rate case by the end of the second quarter. We\u2019re optimistic that we can build upon the constructive outcome from the last rate case. We received approximately 62% of our request for electric rate increase and 71% of our request for gas rate increase. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will aide in your modeling efforts.","And that concludes my comments. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Chris before we open the lines for Q&A.","Christopher M. Crane","Thanks, Jack. In conclusion, I want to reiterate a few things that you heard us say previously. We will continue down the path that we laid out on our February 7 call, which continues on with our primary goal remains strengthening the balance sheet, focusing on operations and looking for ways to improve operational efficiencies. We\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to grow the company, making opportunistic investments using our balance sheet strength were applicable and ensuring that actions will be accretive to the company, the company\u2019s financial step.","With that, we\u2019ll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from ISI Group.","Christopher M. Crane","","Hi Greg.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","So, this is the, I think this is good quarter by the way and we\u2019re happy to see that pricing is starting to cooperate with your thesis, few questions on those fronts, and on cash flow. So the power of new business to go versus the mark-to-market has just opening gross margin. Is it fair to presume that you\u2019ve lowered again your expectations for margins and or volumes given that out in 2013, 2014, and 2015, just given the persistently low level of pricing and low level of volatility as it relates to competitive energy supply?","Christopher M. Crane","","Yeah, Ken will address that and we will circle back if you have a cash flow question.","Kenneth W. Cornew","So Greg, that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s actually in 2013 we have reduced our target expectation for Power New Business \/ To Go essentially because we got defensive on natural gas prices early in the quarter and hedged the portfolio tightly and missed an opportunity to gain some upside from spot prices in the first quarter. In 2014 and 2015, it\u2019s actually a very different story. We have actually achieved new business targets as or better than expected in those years and when we do achieve those targets what we do is, we reduce the Power New Business \/ To Go line and it rolls into the mark to market of hedges. So our hedging position that we\u2019ve had on that associated we are taking advantage of upside in the power markets is benefiting us on those two years.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, great.","Jonathan W. Thayer","Follow-up on free cash?","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Yes. When I look at Page 18, where you show the build out to your consolidated cash flow outlook, there is a lot of what I would relatively small changes but the two big ones are $225 million reduction in expected CFO from ExGen, but then also a $325 million decline in expected other cash flows. Can you dig a little bit deeper into those two items?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Sure. So as we discussed previously, some puts and takes as you point out, so from a cash from operations roughly $125 million decline relative to the expectations primarily related to ExGen and tax timing, offset on the CapEx side by the cancellation of Dresden and Quad Cities MUR. The primary driver of the change in cash relative to the beginning of your forecast is lower financing of ComEd, a $175 million and BGE of $52.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","","I just want to understand why you know when course of this for the last several months, since you just gave us your fiscal year outlook recently. There has been such a dramatic change in the expected CFO from ExGen. Is it related to the hedging activity in the quarter that \u2013 in the first quarter that went against you on gas or is it sort of something else?","Christopher M. Crane","","The breakdown in the ExGen is roughly $250 million total change at ExGen\u2019s specifically roughly a third of that is cash tax timing, offset by about $150 million of cash related net income. On the positive reduction CapEx, which I described related to the MURs and then the increase in the dividend on the financing line, so that is $250 million.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","","Okay and then at the bottom the change in other, it was a $400 million held at the year-end call and it\u2019s now only $75 million.","Christopher M. Crane","","It\u2019s CP.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","","Okay thank you.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Ken, just looking at the move up in power prices and the strength, you said that you guys hedged more aggressively early in the quarter and last later. Is there any relationship between the factors you guys, you\u2019ve had some liquidity pressure out of the marketplace selling of that had an effect on power prices or did I misunderstand your first comments?","Kenneth W. Cornew","","Really when I was referred to hedging and it was associated with our 2013 decision. So we took a low 90% hedge position and took it to a high 90% hedge position in 2013 alone. We just \u2013 we got defensive on natural gas looking at early winter weather and obviously what\u2019s happened over the last five years, as indicated the risk of natural gas prices falling didn\u2019t happen, so we readjusted our portfolio in 2013.","In 2014 and 2015, our hedging posture has been consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about for many quarters now. We\u2019ve held our position of going behind ratable as Jack indicated by about 6% in 2015, we\u2019ve also held our position of utilizing natural gas and option to keep heat upside that\u2019s another probably 8% in that 2015 portfolio. So we are maintaining a substantial upside position...","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","(inaudible)","Christopher M. Crane","Yeah, so from a heat rate perspective, we are more like 14% to 15%.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Can you just give a little color on what you guys are seeing in the retail markets as far as the competitiveness of that? Is that landscape changing all with movement in prices and generally in the past with new energy when prices rose, you saw more margin pressure in the business. Is that showing up Exelon didn\u2019t look like it showed up in the hedging disclosure you guys gave for Non-Power New Business \/ To Go?","Christopher M. Crane","Dan, we\u2019ve seen the same behavior in the retail market essentially over the past several quarters of margins being on the low end of expected ranges or experienced ranges. What\u2019s interesting and maybe a little bit different about the first quarter this year is that customers are actually causing to decide to re-contract and buy power because for the first time in a long time prices have not dropped going through a winter and I believe a lot of customers are thinking that prices were going to go in a lower direction and it would be a great opportunity for them to lock in fixed price over the next couple of years. Prices have actually gone up. And now you see a little bit of pausing from especially commercial industrial contracting perspective. So very challenging and competitive environment remains, we\u2019ve maintained our expectations in the disclosure for this quarter and we\u2019ll continue to see how this shapes out.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning, guys.","Christopher M. Crane","Good morning, Jon.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Excuse the background noise, sorry about that. Staying on hedging, I just want to make sure I understand the terminology correctly. When you say you\u2019re 6% behind ratable, does that mean 6 percentage points lower than you would otherwise be or is it a percentage?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Its 6 percentage points lower than we\u2019d otherwise be.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you. And then on \u2013 is it reasonable to assume that you\u2019re 3% (inaudible) as you are looking at 16% which is obviously not on the slide you have, but you would be incrementally behind?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes, Jonathan, we will build a similar strategy and similar position in 16% as we have in 15% that\u2019s where we are right now.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","My questions go to the assumptions underlying the expectation of continued $2 to $4 upside in the round the clock PJM price post 2015. First on load growth, I wonder if you could tell me what your outlook is, I noticed that ComEd, PECO and BGE you have this large decline in load in \u201812 and you are not expecting much of the recovery if any in \u201813, what is your forecast for load growth across PJM in \u201814, \u201815?","Christopher M. Crane","Hugh, it is well under 1% at this point in our modeling. So we are not anticipating anything substantial or helpful on the load growth side when we are talking about our upside in power prices. It really is wholly driven by every time of the total asset.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Great. And then what is your expectation for I guess I would call share loss of load to increased renewable generation. To what extent do you think load and PJM will be incrementally supplied by renewable generation and what impact do you think that has on prices?","Christopher M. Crane","Hope I understand your question correctly, how much renewable generation do you think \u2013 are you asking that we have in our models?","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Yeah.","Christopher M. Crane","We obviously have seen the build out of wind generation at the end of 2012 and with the PTC extension continue to anticipate significant wind development going forward in the next few years. So again that is another incremental generation add to our models. And quite frankly, it\u2019s a conservative assumption of incremental additional win at significant levels and we still see the upside because of overtime.","","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Okay. And then final question on steam electric F1 guidelines have been published in their proposed form. Have you altered in any way your expectation of plant retirements and what is your expectation currently?","Christopher M. Crane","Our expectation of planned retirements is relatively consistent, here we have a little over 20,000 megawatts of expected retirement PJM, 47,000 in the entire piece of interconnect, and those assumptions had us move very much for us in the past few months.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research, LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. Just a question on the process on growth investments. Could you maybe give a little color kind of most likely areas that you would be looking at for growth investments and thoughts on, let\u2019s say you could signed $500 million investment, would you likely need to finance it. Have that have stock at this point or could you, things of all that or do you really need to keep bring down that in the next couple of years before you could do that. Maybe just a little color on kind on where you\u2019re on financing?","Christopher M. Crane","So, as far as the growth strategy and where we\u2019re focusing, we have significant area within the utilities continuing to build-out on the modernization, the Smart Meter installation and reinforcing the reliability of this system and we continue to make those significant investments.","If you go to the other side of the business, although we continue to look at mostly contracted type assets at this point and we\u2019ll continue on with some wind development and also the development in the solar area. There is about $2 billion to $3 billion of growth in the next five years that\u2019s within the plan right now.","And none of that requires equity issuance it is within our cash flow on the current balance sheet. In this forward year, we are not refinancing, or slowing the refinancing and or using cash to cover our capital obligations to strengthen the balance sheet. If something came along that was large enough, that we thought was the right strategic step, but more importantly met the right financial hurdles, that evaluation would take into consideration if equity was required to cover the dilutive effect of the equity. And we don\u2019t see anything around that right now, but that would be the hurdle that would have to be overcome before we would go there.","Jonathan W. Thayer","","I think Chris I\u2019m sorry, we have got the space in the balance sheet (inaudible) after that, we looked at the balance sheet and drove our margin.","","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research, LLC","Just to clarify the $2 billion to $3 billion is that \u2013 are those growth investments that are already in the CapEx plan, are those, would that include potentially new things that haven\u2019t been identified yet?","Jonathan W. Thayer","","There is cost in that for new things that have not been identified yet.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And is there a way to get a sense of how much are those versus kind of core the spending already in Illinois and things like that?","Jonathan W. Thayer","","The $2 billion, to $3 billion Steven is actually on the balance sheet for projects that have not been identified, that are not included in our long range plan, that would be incremental and they would be in the areas as Chris described.","Christopher M. Crane","I think what we can do is follow back up with you and show you what\u2019s broken down right now on the regulated side for CapEx. And what we know is in the pipeline on the generation side and then the balance sheet space above that for the plugs that we have for additional growth. We will pull that together.","Steven Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Hi, can you hear me?","Jonathan W. Thayer","","Yeah.","Christopher M. Crane","","Yeah.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Excellent. So first question here obviously has two sides to it, as you look at the 2 to 4, how much is attributable to changes in demand responsible? Obviously they can now set prices that seems pretty material. And then secondly on the other half, how you\u2019re thinking about changes in the added submission compliance in Illinois and the delay from 15 to 17 and how does that work into your math both with regards to moving from 3 to 6 and in the remaining 2 to 4 that remains out there if you will?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Julien, focusing on the 2 to 4 question first, we don\u2019t have any modeling of increased volatility associated with scarcity pricing context and as you said demand response energy bidding in setting price. This analysis is strictly about the generation stack in coal retirements and that kind of upside is incremental to the 2 to 4. So that\u2019s the first question.","The second question was about our assumptions of coal retirement. So we have taken into account the best available knowledge we have in the market about every coal plant. We did not estimate that all the coal plants you\u2019re referring to are going to be retired anyway. We run our models and don\u2019t see really any incremental change in our estimates from that information.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","And just clarifying question there. Clearly thrown as an incremental cost of dispatch is somewhat relevant to this conversation. How much of that element given now that they have a delay for two years have to play against your 2 to 4 or plays into your 2 to 4 today?","Christopher M. Crane","Little as none Julien.","","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","","Great, thank you very much for the clarification.","","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Just one follow-up, Jack, you mentioned given the cash position that you had, that you continue to assess coming to that refinancing and you\u2019ve just sort of thinking through your options, wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that as you look at your cash balance over time and you look at the upcoming debt retirements, just wasn\u2019t completely clear step, how to interpret the comments as you think about your options on the upcoming debt that\u2019s coming due?","","Jonathan W. Thayer","So Steven, you can see that in this year, we are using the $450 million to retire the 8.625 senior subordinated debt which is obviously a very accretive transaction given the current interest rate environment. We have roughly $615 million coming due at ExGen in 2014 and that $550 million at ExGen and another $800 million at OpCo that matures in 2015.","And part of the opportunity given the cash balance we have is to look at those maturities and determine whether it is appropriate. Given the other strategic calls on the cash that we look at that and balance that against calling those bonds as they mature and not refinancing them. Clearly if we do, do that then we have substantial room in the balance sheet for the types of strategic investments that Chris discussed earlier and that really goes into forming up that $3 billion of incremental capacity for the growth investment.","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay thank you and then more I think for Ken just following a little bit up on Julien\u2019s question on demand response, less on the energy side maybe little more in the capacity side, just curious to your take on the recent decision from FERC about basically delaying the PJM demand response, protocol changes and just generally curious as to your take on where is demand responses headed, have you seen, your more or less activity. What is your sense for the wins change on demand response and how that\u2019s impacting the other markets?","Joseph Dominguez","","This is Joe Dominguez. Let me talk first about the FERC ruling, we see that as a process ruling essentially what FERC was saying is that the PJM did not go through the appropriate process to make the kind of changes that we require to implement the modifications that it has proposed. We saw some put for those proposals and some of the FERC Commissioners, order is there but it was really a process decision that doesn\u2019t indicate a substantive view of the issue by FERC.","Christopher M. Crane","And Steven just on the demand response claims itself. The demand response business continues to be consistent and significant. Obviously, we don\u2019t expect to see the kind of growth we saw all over the past few years in demand response phase but there, in all our estimation there is still opportunity for growth in demand response business and we will see really how much clear is this.","","Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Excellent thank you very much.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman","Sachs.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Two questions, one on the regulated business and one on the non-reg. On ComEd just curious given the new legislation and assume that it becomes law either the Governor signs that or it becomes law with a veto override. Do you think that gives you the ability finally to earn your authorized on a forward test year forward rate base at ComEd? That\u2019s the question on the regulated side.","On the non-regulated side, we\u2019re seeing lots of development announcements or movement in PJM for new combined cycles. Not tons, but there is one or two companies privately held developers each looking to build a combined cycle or two or three, just curious your views on the economics of new combined cycle in PJM.","Christopher M. Crane","We\u2019ll let Anne cover the first part.","Anne R. Pramaggiore","","Hi, Michael, this is Anne Pramaggiore. Your question on the gap between the earn to allow ROE on ComEd, the legislation closes that gap. We still have a number of items on appeal from the first formula rate case filing back in November of 2011 and that constitute a portion of it. If we win those, we close the gap even further.","It will continue to be a gap left even after assuming we have positive results on those two outcomes. There are some structural items that the commission has historically does not put it up for covering. Some portion of advertising cost, there is a couple of items. So there is a piece in there that will have to deal with even after we get through the legislation and the court cases, but those two efforts will substantially close that gap.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it.","Christopher M. Crane","On the non-reg part, we are seeing OEM cost or construction cost coming down mostly because the technology, the unit ratings on the assets are getting a little bit larger so, the economics are improving but we still not see the market signals or the capacity market showing us that there would be economic at this point for us to be building something. So, there maybe other opinions on market forwards that the people are turned to be the first mover on but we\u2019re not seeing the market signals yet, it\u2019s, we justify us going in that direction.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That implies that some of the folks, I can pick of two privately held developers that are each looking to build at least one combined cycle if not two in Pennsylvania, do you worry that they\u2019re kind of jumping the gun a little bit in that, even if they build, even if they think the economics are good and you guys may not agree that it weighs on it everyone?","Christopher M. Crane","","No, what we worry about is as they try to bypass the rules of the capacity market or the revisions that we think are going through the capacity market. If they\u2019re planning up and (inaudible) costs as the rules, it\u2019s their option. We have still the low cost from an energy side, the low cost competitor access that we can compete with them on that side. And as long as they clarify the rules on the capacity side, we have no worry about them coming in.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay. Thanks guys, much appreciated.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","First question on the non-power margin business, that outlook remains the same for 2014, and 2015. How much visibility, do you really have on that business sitting here today? What\u2019s the best way to gage how accurate that outlook is?","Christopher M. Crane","Yeah, our outlook is consistent in the same on non-power business. A lot of that business is regular, natural gas, retail business that continues from a renewal perspective and it has been very consistent for us. We also have some other services businesses that will regularly go from To Go to execute it, but we\u2019ve been in these businesses for many years. And so we feel comfortable with those.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And Ken again to you, once would have thought how good its been that, some of the pickup in the forward floors has actually been due to the fact that in the near term gas prices have picked up, because of the unusually cold weather and as the weather settles down some of that may be given back. Do you mind to that or what do you think of that theory?","Kenneth W. Cornew","I do buy into a theory that says spot market prices do impact forward prices, but what we\u2019re really talking about is the relationship of natural gas to power price. And when natural gas prices are essentially flat from December 31 to March 31 and power prices went up, that doesn\u2019t associate with that period at all. So I think we are seeing more discussion in the market about this upside, we\u2019re not the only ones with the view anymore. And as trading activity increases or liquidity increases, we would expect we will continue to see more of this upside overtime.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And Chris, one question for you, as you look at your portfolio to date and you look at your mix, I know you\u2019ve talked about that in the past, are you comfortable that this is the right mix of rate versus non-rate to support both your dividend and your investment grid aspirations over the longer term period or do you think there maybe some changes at Quad at some point in the future.","Christopher M. Crane","No definitely we feel that we have the right mix and we have made the right call on the dividend that allows us to maintain a strong investment grade. As we discuss the sizing of the dividend, we are looking at the contribution of the regulated side on a more repetitive or consistent basis serving that while allowing the growth side, the competitive side to continue to utilize the balance sheet space that it creates in its own earnings. So we feel very comfortable that we have got into the right spot to weather multiple business cycles.","","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","And the volatility of earnings related to the commodity side, you are comfortable that that is the aspect of your portfolio?","","Christopher M. Crane","","Yes, we are very comfortable dealing with the volatility, we like for more volatility to come back, however we are very comfortable with the volatility there.","","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.","","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","","A quick follow-up on the non-power gross margin, and we see that didn\u2019t changed between December and March, how much of that is due to volume? Volumes went up and margins came down vice versa?","Christopher M. Crane","","I would say none of it due to volume. It is just a ratable non-power ratable non-power businesses that we execute on and when we execute on the numbers will move from to go tech.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","","Okay. When we look at the merger back a year ago, I think some of the synergies and you talked a lot about the retail wholesale hearing, how much have you realized of that, how much is there left to realize that and just characterize how you\u2019re seeing that part of the merger come through?","Christopher M. Crane","","In generation space that\u2019s part of your question, we have seen the benefits of having this combined businesses in the combined portfolio. We did see those benefits in our 2012 actual results. Obviously in 2013 you\u2019re hearing about a hedging position we took. That I think is going to result in the same kind of numbers as we had last year from a portfolio management perspective, but we still have a lot of work to do on integrating systems and integrating the platform, and we continue to work through that this year and we do expect to see consistently improved portfolio management and other earnings elements from the business when it\u2019s combined versus or not.","Jonathan W. Thayer","","As soon as we controlled last year, in each year it gets harder to segregate, you\u2019re not keeping separate books anymore but as we told you at the end of last year, your portfolio management on the integrated platform was another $400 million of gross margin. And as Ken said this year, we took a combined bet on minimizing risk of gas going down in the first quarter but we will continue to see the benefit of optimization and we\u2019ve already seen the benefits in reduced cost around liquidity as we collapsed those lines. So what we \u2013 the thesis of the merger has worked out as we projected.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","Could we see incremental upside to that 2 to 4 per megawatt hour number you\u2019ve given up, given the synergies? Is there still enough left to go that you could see your upside?","Jonathan W. Thayer","We are holding it to 2 to 4 and we will try not to change where it could be another $0.25 here \u2013 there is upside that that\u2019s in this market and there is in portfolio management and we\u2019ll continue to watch that report on it. But our disclosure is that have an expectations of these synergies already in.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","Great, very helpful and thanks.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Christopher M. Crane","","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Hey, how are you doing?","Christopher M. Crane","","Doing good.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Just really quickly, most of my questions have been answered. But just \u2013 and I apologize if I miss this. But [Brocard] looks like the hedged numbers went down and I know some of that probably has to do with the expected generation going up, but even sort of factoring for that? It appeared that \u2013 it appears that you guys have less hedge I guess is, I tried back into it? Sorry, go ahead.","Christopher M. Crane","","That\u2019s exactly right. We had an increase in expected generation from improved spots in 2014 and 2015, quite frankly, we did not hedge that increase. So by design the hedge disclosure is going to show that our hedge percentages have dropped to have more megawatts to sales and we have not sold them. We believe there is substantial upside in our cost relative to the current market prices then we\u2019re holding that position et cetera.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","It currently looks like actually the number might have changed. That\u2019s actually might have reduced your position, not just on a relative basis, because of the expected generation, but because it just looks like actually perhaps the absolute number had \u2013 but you actually reduced your hedge position even if you hadn\u2019t expected increase in generation fulfillment?","Christopher M. Crane","","No, Paul we didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. Okay, that\u2019s helpful, okay.","Christopher M. Crane","","We just held our position.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Christopher M. Crane","","Okay. Congratulations for those who were on the call. Thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to Exelon 2018 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jerome and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today's interactive broadcast. All lines have been place on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I'd like turn the show over to Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance. The floor is yours. ","Daniel Eggers","Thank you, Jerome. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section on Exelon's Web site. The earnings release and other matters which we'll discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast and expectations.","Today's presentation also references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the Appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We scheduled 45 minutes for today's call.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Chris Crane","Thanks, Dan, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. Flipping to slide five, we delivered another strong quarter with earnings again at the upper-end of our range, which allows us to raise the lower end of our full year guidance. The utilities performed well with strong earned ROEs and largely first quartile operations. As we stated previously, the Federal Courts of Appeal in Illinois and New York strongly affirm the legality of the ZEC.","And our focus on cost continues identifying an additional $200 million in gross savings, which are $150 million of that will flow to the bottom line, bringing our six-year total savings to more than $900 million. Combined, this performance demonstrates our growing value.","For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we are at $0.76 per share versus $0.85 per share last year. On a non-GAAP operating basis, we are at $0.80 per share, and again above the midpoint of our $0.80 to $0.90 range guidance that was provided.","Turning to slide six, our utilities continue to perform at higher levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making in technology and infrastructure continue to improve reliability, which leads to greater customer satisfaction, and ultimately supporting strong relations with our regulators and our legislators.","PECO and BG improved their JV power residential gas and electric scores over the last year with PECO receiving its highest ranking ever, placing second in the residential electric survey. Our customer service metrics is strong. BGE and ComEd are in the top decile for customer satisfaction, and PHI is in top decile for its service levels.","Each of our utilities achieved top quartile reliability performance in SAIFI, or outage duration in CAIDI, which is -- the outage frequency is SAIFI, and CAIDI which is outage duration. ComEd and PHI performed in top decile for CAIDI. SAIFI as we've discussed in the past is our highest priority and remains that our metrics have continued to improve since the beginning of the year.","At ExGen, in our third quarter was -- excuse me, 39.7 terawatt hours of capacity factor at 93.6%. During the fourth hottest summer in nearly 125 years, we performed at 96.7% capacity factor, and avoided 33 metric tons of carbon. Our gas and hydro fleet performed well, but below plan with economic dispatch match at 95.8%. This lower performance was primarily the result of our CCG's account Colorado Bend and Wolf Hollow being offline because of some turbine blades defects. The blades have been replaced. Wolf Hollow came back into service in late September. One of the Colorado Bend units returned to service in October, and the other will be back in service shortly. It's in the process of restart as we speak. We took advantage of the outage time performing normal maintenance that would have been required to have that shut down for next spring.","From a financial perspective, all repairs were covered under a warranty, and the markets impact from the plants being down are well within our full range outage contingency plan. The plants ran very well over the summer prior to the outages, and we're very pleased with the performance of the design and their durability. They remain an integral part of our Texas strategy.","Turning to slide seven, as you know, we've had a strong track record of finding efficiencies in the business and driving cost savings, which is why we created the business transformation team earlier this year to focus on our business services company. As part of that effort with additional savings from our nuclear fleet, we are announcing a $200 million reduction to our run rate 2021 costs of which $150 million will reach the bottom line at ExGen. Joe's going to cover this in more detail during his remarks.","I'll turn it now to the policy updates from that quarter and start with the ZEC programs. As I said both the Seventh and the Second Court of Appeals dismiss challenges to the ZEC programs in Illinois and in New York respectively. In doing so each court found that the states have a right to choose generation sources based on attributes they prefer such as environmental performance and that these programs are not tethered to the market. The plaintiffs are rehearing an Illinois case which the court denied last month. The rulings were consistent with our expectations we're happy with the resigning information on these importantly stay clean energy policies. In New Jersey, the process for implementation of the ZEC program that remains on track to take effect early in the second quarter of 2019.","The Board of Public Utilities has finished his hearings on implementation of the ZEC program and the utilities have well tariffs to recover the ZEC related charges. We expect BPU to approve the changes later this month On the federal policy front, we think that FERC's June order took an important step followed by empowering the states to continue prioritizing zero carbon energy throughout the state-led procurements outside of the PJM capacity module. Number of proposals were filed in response to the order, including from a diverse coalition of which Exelon is a member in PJM. We see all of the major proposals is putting our generation fleet in a better position financially than the current market construct. We are pleased to have followers part of a coalition to support the rights of states to advance their clean energy goals.","Slide 22 gives a lot more detail on the coalition, but it includes consumer, ratepayer, advocates, attorney generals, national environmental groups, renewable energy trade associations, public power and the other nuclear generators in PJM. Our proposal will provide states with flexibility to conduct a capacity procurement of resources they list to support for the public policy reasons, and would protect consumers for paying thrice for capacity resources fits straight to a balance and the FERC is looking for to ensure states can meet their environmental goals, while protecting the competitive market. We plagued the comments are due November 6, and it will be important for FERC to issue an order early next year to give the markets guidance going forward. As you know, we are still waiting for orders from FERC on the vast start and resiliency examination. ","But with that, now I'll turn it over to Joe to walk through the numbers. ","Joe Nigro","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. Turning to slide eight, we had another strong quarter financially delivering adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.88 per share, which is at the upper end of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. ","Exelon's utilities less Holding Company expenses earned a combined $0.55 per share. Compared to our plan, we benefited from reduced storm activity and favorable weather in our 00:10:17 non-decoupled jurisdiction including PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva Delaware.","Generation earned $0.33 per share in the third quarter which was slightly behind our plan. The third quarter was impacted by lot of realized lower realized ERCOT prices versus the end of the second quarter, lower-than-expected generation performance with the unplanned outages that ERCOT CCGT as just discussed as well as one at [indiscernible] in addition to higher allocated transition costs. These were partially offset by realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trust fund.","On slide nine, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.88 per share in the third quarter this year was $0.03 per share higher than the third quarter of 2017. Overall the utility earnings were collectively up $0.07 per share compared with last year driven primarily by higher rate base, new rates associated with completely rate cases, and favorable weather.","Generation earnings were down $0.03 per share compared with last year driven largely by the absence of EGTP gross margins from the deconsolidation in the fourth quarter of 2017, and higher planned nuclear outage days, partially offset by contribution from a full quarter of Illinois ZEC revenues and savings from tax reform.","Turning to slide 10, we are raising the lower end of our 2018 EPS guidance range from $2.90 to $3.20 per share to $3.05 to $3.20 per share. We are pleased with the strong operational results at both the utilities and generation businesses that are pushing us up into the upper half of our range, particularly as we have overcome unexpected headwind including the challenging winter storms.","Moving to slide 11, improved operation at PHI and positive rate case outcomes are driving better earned ROE. Pepco's higher ROE reflects last fall's distribution rate cases as well as the recent Pepco Maryland with DC settlement that took effect in June and August respectively. Delmarva's earned ROE include the benefits of interim rates came effective during the first quarter with final rates for Delmarva Electric effective September 1, and favorable weather at Delmarva, Delaware during the quarter.","At Atlantic City Electric, we saw higher earnings from last fall's rate case settlement as well as favorable weather during the quarter, which improves 12-month trailing ROEs significantly from last quarter. As we have previously discussed trailing 12-month ROEs for all of our PHI utilities should continue to improve next quarter as the FAS 109 charges from the fourth quarter of 2017 drop out of the calculation.","For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remained over 10% were modestly dipped from last quarter. Our overall earned ROEs for Exelon utilities were modestly higher than last quarter at 9.6% well within our earned ROE target of 9% to 10% that underlies our earnings outlook for 2019 and beyond. We are pleased with our overall utility performance but have plans for continued improvement to bring PHI closer to the rest of our utilities. ","Turning to slide 12, we remain busy on the regulatory front. On October 18, the Administrative Law Judges presiding over PECO's electric distribution base rate case recommended the settlement with all parties be approved. The deal provides for an increase of $96 million in annual electric distribution revenues offset by $71 million in tax saving benefits for customers for net $25 million revenue increase. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. ","On August 9, the DC commission approved the settlement that was reached in April based under $24.1 million revenue deduction after incorporating tax reform May 20 backed on August 30. A final order which received on August 21 to the settlement we reached in June on the Delaware, Delmarva electric distribution case. The case will provided $7 million revenue decrease including the benefits of capture firm for customers.","On September 7, Delmarva Delaware entered into a settlement agreement in pending gas distribution base rate case that provides for revenue decrease of $3.5 million including tax benefits for customers. A final order is expected in the fourth quarter. We also have number of rate cases still in progress. We expect an order for BG&E spending gas rate case in January of 2019.","As a reminder, the case include the request that $60.7 million increase to its gas revenues for infrastructure investments since 2015 and moving $21.7 million in revenue currently being recovered with the STRIDE surcharge engine into base rate. We expect to receive an order from the Illinois Commerce Commission on standard formula rate case in the fourth quarter. And finally, on August 21st Atlantic City Electric filed a distribution base rate case with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities seeking of a revenue increase of $109 million and we expect an order in the second half of 2019.","The utilities and the regulatory teams are doing a lot of hard work to improve system reliability and performance for our customers and for support of regulatory backdrop that in turn we helping the lift earned ROE source their allocated levels across the Exelon utility levels. More detail on the rate cases that are scheduled to be found on slide 24 through 30 in the appendix.","Turning to slide 13, we invested $1.4 billion in capital at the utilities during the third quarter and around $3.9 billion year-to-date. We remain confident in our ability to meet our $5.5 billion capital budget for 2018. This quarter I would like to feature two projects within our portfolio and utility investors. The first is the early completion of ComEd to $920 million Smart Meter Installation program. ComRD installed more than 4 million smart meters in just over seven years, which is three years ahead of the original schedule and more than $20 million under budget. To help put this program in to the context, our ComED installed on average 2,400 smart meters per day over that seven year span.","In fact, one of our workers personally installed over 25,000 meters as part of this program. The installation of smart meters on the ComEd System will allow customers to be better informed about their energy consumption that can help them save money and will allow ComEd to further improved it service offerings.","In addition, we tried over $100 million in annual operational savings, primarily from increased efficiencies in the field operations, such as meter reading and avoided truck rolls. The smart meter installation program is part of the $2.6 billion Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act Program.","The second project I want to highlight is Atlantic City Electrics Churchtown Substation Expansion project in Pennsville, New Jersey. This $50 million projects entailed equipment upgrades for reliability and 230 kV, 138 kV and 69 kV expansion for additional transmission capacity. Construction also included installation up 2.1 miles of transmission line consisting of 59 new structures. The expansion improves reliability for our customers by replacing and upgrading our stated equipment and by expanding regional transmission capacity which has the benefits of reducing congestion to our customers.","Turning to slide 14, relative to our last update, total gross margin was flat in 2018 and up $50 million in both 2019 and 2020, primarily as a result of our higher power. For 2018 open gross margin was up $100 million primarily due to higher NI Hub, PJM West Hub and New York Zone A prices and offset by weakening ERCOT spark spread.","Total gross margin is offset by lower mark-to-market of our hedging due to the higher price spikes. For 2019 and 2020, open gross margin was up $250 million and $100 million respectively with a higher PJM West Hub prices and stronger ERCOT spark spreads. In 2019, open gross margin was also up on higher NI Hub and New York Zone A prices. Similar to2018, the mark-to-market of our hedging is gambled in 2019 and 2020 due to higher prices. We also executed $50 million of Power New Business in both 2018 and 2019 and executed $50 million of non-Power New Business each year.","From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter in line with our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 9% to 12% behind ratable in 2019 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 when considering cross commodity hedges where we have increased our concentration.","Turning to slide 15, as Chris mentioned, we are announcing another round of OEM cost reductions as part of our continual efforts to evaluate our work practices, looking for ways to being more efficient teams and better in portraying evasion and technology.","With this new program, our gross run rate savings in 2021 will be $209 which we will ramp up over the next two years. These incremental savings will come from our Exelon Generation business primarily through even great efficiencies in our nuclear operations and at the Business Services Company or BSC, which is part of the transformation efforts that Jack has been leading. The $200 million of savings with the gross number with about half from ExGen and half from the BSC [indiscernible] and since BSC costs are shared roughly 50\/50 between Exelon Generation and Exelon Utility, we would expect our Utility customers to benefit from $50 million in annual savings over time, with the other $50 million flowing through Exelon Generation bottom line.","When we include the $50 million of incremental direct savings at ExGen, we expect a $150 million of savings to flow through our bottom line is 2021, relative to our previous guidance, which we show on the lower left chart.","Exelon continues to embrace the culture of cost discipline and operational excellence. These costs updates our consistent with these cultural values. If we look at all the cost savings amounts since 2015, we have now reduced the O&M by over $900 million. It's due to hard work of all of our employees, we [indiscernible] every day to run the company more efficiently, while I'm hearing to our commitments to safety, reliability and community stewardship.","Turning to slide 16, we remain committed to our strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings. And to that end since our last earnings call S&P has placed our ratings for ExGen index one corporate on credit watch positive, recognizing the improvements in overall strength of our balance sheet.","Turning to the metrics, our consolidating corporate credit metrics remain above our target ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. We are forecasting ExGen's leverage to be 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA at year-end 2018 which is below our long term target of 3.0 times. On a recourse debt basis, we are at 2.0 times, which is well below our target range. We will continue to manage our balance sheet at ExGen over time for the 3.0 times debt-to-EBITDA level, so look for us to focus on debt reduction at both the HoldCo and GenCo.","I will now turn the call back to Chris. Thank you.","Chris Crane","Thanks, Joe. Turning to slide 17, as we have shown you, we have a strong quarter financially and operationally. We continue to get stronger on both fronts. This is due to the hard work and dedication of all of our employees every day. We also had important wins and of course to preserve the ZEC programs, and are finding ways to operate more efficiently providing incremental cost savings as discussed.","Our value proposition remains unchanged. We're focused on growing our utilities starting at 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2021. We continue to use free cash flow from the GenCo up on the incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt over the next four years at the GenCo and HoldCo and funds part of the faster dividend growth rate.","We will stay focused on optimizing value at the ExGen by seeking fair compensation for our carbon free generation fleet, supporting proper price formation in PJM and resiliency efforts at FERC, and supporting capacity market reforms that will allow states to continue to protect citizens from carbon in air pollution, while benefiting from regional markets. We will close uneconomic and sell assets were it does not make sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans, and maximize value to generation to the load matching strategies We continue to sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics and grow our dividend consistently at 5% through 2020.","Operator, now we can take it -- open to the call up for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore. Greg, your line is now open.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning guys, couple of questions.","Chris Crane","Good morning.","Greg Gordon","First, on the quarter, everything seems really good on the utility side and the underlying operations at the GenCo look decent too, but it was a little squishy around some of those operational issues. Can you just talk us through that and get us comfortable that they're sort of temporal and not structural?","Chris Crane","Are you talking about the operational issues around the GenCo in the power\u2026","Greg Gordon","Yes, and Texas, the interruption in Massachusetts, the higher FDR costs. I just want to make sure we can be comfortable that they're not going to sort of run out into the future and impact your ability to get your numbers?","Chris Crane","Let me start out with the Texas assets. So, I'll let Joe fill in on the rest of it. Those GE 7HA.200, these were the first serial numbers one and two. We were aware as GE was that there was some difficulty with the first stage blades. We had approximated a run period that we could operate the assets before putting in the fix. The fix was already underway and then designed. GE did give us very strong warranties on those assets, and responded very well on the first failure on the one CT at Colorado Bend. We proactively shut the other three CTs down, replace them with the new design, had them back up and running, and as I said, we expect -- we're in the roll out phase now and the start-up phase of the fourth unit, and we feel confident in the design. GE has put us in inspection program together, that will be borescoping after so many hours of operation. They've responded well, the solid engineering confirmed by independent assessments, so we feel that that is behind us. And we'll be able to continue those assets to operate at incredibly high capacity factors and efficiencies going forward.","On the FDRs and the other issues, I'll let Joe cover it.","Joe Nigro","Yes. So Greg, I think first thing is as Chris mentioned the generation issues drove some of the underperformance at Exgen. In addition to that when you looked at how prices in Texas, at the end of June and where they realized for the quarter, there was an impact with the difference there. As you know, the spot market prices were lower than when we walked into the quarter.","On the transmission side, the costs were associated with orders for 494 at FERC, and that had a negative impact. So from our lens when you talk about the generation performance both at Mystic and at Ercot, those are one-time occurrences similarly on the transmission side. The favorability was driven on the realized liquid decommissioning trust gains. So I think when you look at it from our lens, you see these one-time items that are driving the overall results.","Greg Gordon","Great. Thanks. And one follow-up on Exgen and then one more if you let me, looking at the cost cuts, it's really quite an impressive, incremental change, you've got the costs declining from $4.65 billion to $4.175 billion in 2020 and a little bit more in 2021, $450 million savings, but that gross margins declined by $700 million. And so, skeptical investors look at this and say, \"Well, you guys are doing Yeoman's job here, right-sizing the cost structure, but earnings aren't getting better.\" I would argue that cost cuts are permanent than -- and these back-wardated [ph] power prices are hopefully temporary, but can you give us some confidence that there's positive operating leverage here as we move through time and that these lower commodity prices and capacity prices are not structural?","Chris Crane","We talked about this before that we've lacked liquidity in the out years. It's a softer market. Our fundamentals still tell us that this back-wardated curve is not what we'll see as the prompt years come in. And so, we're managing the book in that manner maintaining as much margin open and using cross commodity hedges to be able to manage that. We will constantly look at driving efficiencies. You can't have a company and operate with any aspect or entity within the company being inefficient. So, driving efficiencies has multiple benefits, but one of them is a reduction in expense, and we'll continue to focus on that as we serve the customer.","As far as the market issues, Jim or Joe, do you want to cover any more on that?","Jim McHugh","Yes. I think the only one I would add about the backwardation of the curve is, with the next couple of years showing 25 and 24 deal like in liquidity we're seeing net retirements of new builds over the next year between 20 and 23 that would lead us to believe that backwardation won't really subside. We've seen stock prices and I have even in some of the lowest delivered fuel price years cleared north of $26, $27. So you know the backwardation to your point is seems temporal great.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And then final question is you know given that the balance sheet is so strong and that the rating agencies are finally coming around to considering higher credit ratings how much balance sheet capacity does that create and\/or does it give you more latitude to have a more aggressive risk management policy and take hedge less and take more of your power into the spot and therefore try to get those better prices?","Joe Nigro","Greg, it's Joe. The short answer is with that balance sheet capacity we can't be more aggressive. And as I mentioned in my remarks when you look at how far behind we are a ratable plan and when you overlay the fact that we're using gas as a proxy for power we are carrying a very long opening power position in 2019 and 2020, and when we're able to do that think given the strength of the balance sheet that we have. We continue to challenge ourselves in this regard as well. And as Jim mentioned on our use of power, we're going to continue to be constructive in the way we manage the portfolio relative to what we think fair value is in the out years and that leverage on the balance sheet allows us to do that. ","Greg Gordon","Thank you, guys.","Joe Nigro","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Thank you, Greg. Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien, your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Chris Crane","Good morning. How are you doing?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good, excellent. So I wanted to follow a little bit up on the utility activities, obviously good progress of THI, and again but I wanted to elaborate a little bit further on this. Obviously the cost reductions of say $50ish million accrued in the utilities. How does that play out in terms of again increasing your ROE, right, I gather the bulk of that would be moving back to customers over time, although clearly you're under earning relative to authorized level still. And then in tandem with that question if you could elaborate a little more on the sort of initial utility CapEx planning, certainly there is growing discussion of legislation in Illinois as well as a litany of other smaller programs. I think you've already alluded to a little bit elsewhere across your utility system?","Chris Crane","Yes, I'll let Anne take that.","Anne Pramaggiore","Sure. Good morning, Julien. Yes, so a couple of responses to your questions. As we think about moving forward, obviously we're going to blend $50 million into the LRP over time, and it's not sitting with there right now, but we'll look at that as we do the next LRP iteration. And certainly our focus on O&M is to be flat-to-declining at the utilities and that that's the goal as we move forward to manage that side of the equation. As we think about what we're doing on ROEs and sort of developing that at the PHI utilities and the other utilities, you know the first thing we're doing is to looking at how -- we're filing annually how do we reduce lag? What are the ways is we file it annually, we've got to stay our provision at DPL until 2020, but with the rest of the utilities we'll be filing annually. We're looking at other mechanisms to reduce lag riders. We've got the stride rider in Maryland, disk rider in Delaware and the IIT rider in New Jersey that we're looking to place about $358 million of capital investment in right now Interim rates at New Jersey is helping us to close that lag gap, and we're looking at multiyear rate plan in DC. We've been invited to make that filing, and we'll be doing that shortly. So we've just got an outright provision at PECO authority for the commission to look at that. So that's something we'll be looking at going forward. ","So those are all the ways we're looking to close in on that ROE number. Obviously, we're looking at lags are biggest sort of currency allowed GAAP that also looking at other disallowances too, but really trying to take enough on the lag. So that's how we're thinking about on the ROE going forward. On the capital side, the question that you asked, we've got - we look at $5 billion a year, a little bit plus north of that going forward for the foreseeable future. ","We have continuing modernization work at the utilities. PECO afford 12-kV conversions were closer work, at ComEd, we've got the 00:36:31 voltage optimization work that's about $500 million right there. BG&E's got big DaaS investment, and PHI's got a lot of material condition work 00:36:41 refurbishments, substation rebuilds, and that sort of things. We've got $1.5 billion in our gas program over the next LRP period. We've got close to a $1 billion in security programs across the utilities over the LRP. So there's a lot of work to do. We always, always book-ended with questions of affordability, and that's why we stay tight on O&M. And we look at energy efficiency programs to give customers the ability to reduce usage and manage those more tightly. So we're always looking at the affordability side of it and our utilities fit pretty nicely, when you look at the national average on a percentage of income or percentage of proportion of build to income. We're pretty good, we're below the national average on four and we're right at the national average on the other two builds. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. A quick clarification as a follow up here in PJM, I know I appreciate your comments at the outside. Just timing related, how do you see this going down with respect to a, getting an approval out of FERC, but then b, actually implementing the MOPR just real quickly if you can?","Kathleen Barr\u00f3n","Hi, Julien, it's Kathleen. I can take that question. As you know, the five comments are going into FERC on November 6 with the expectation that the commission would address the paper hearing sometime in the January timeframe. I think the commission is well aware that the market is looking for guidance. As Chris said on what the rules are going to be going forward and importantly the states need to know what changes they need to make to their clean energy policies to accommodate the new rules coming out of FERC.","So we will look to them to provide that guidance in the January timeframe. As you know, we have to leave the auction until August to give states sometime to react, not just your question was specific to MOPR, but important for us is the ability of states to carve out the [indiscernible] they wish to support and to procure them directly to state led procurement that is going to be an important change that we're looking for FERC to make in the next order based on the record in front of them as overwhelming amount of support from all supporters of the stakeholder community and the states. To put that change into the tariff and to give states options going forward to continue to support the clean generation that will help them achieve their carbon reduction goals.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So you don't see an issue with respect to getting clarity out of the states sometime?","Kathleen Barr\u00f3n","Obviously the states have different structures that will need to examine and obviously the states have different structures, that they'll need to examine and some may be able to use existing structure, some may need to adopt new structures, including through legislation. So there will be a in the states where there is a need for legislation a premium on moving quickly. Now that being said, I think it's also incumbent our effort to take that into account and to make sure that they have adequate time before the rules change in the tariff.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Julien. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Steve your line is now open.","Steve Fleishman","Thank you. I will actually just ask one question. The PGM from a standpoint of not obviously you have different stakeholders in relative here your states customers, investors et cetera. Just from an investor standpoint and not everyone else, do you see the changes as proposed or as you would like to see them being kind of good for shareholders, neutral how should we think of it, just from an investor standpoint?","Chris Crane","No, we definitely see this as a positive to create clarity and a more rewarding market going forward. We've lacked the clarity, we've [indiscernible] the times on programs, I think this is where we'll be able to create clarity, capital allotment will allocation will be much clear on what we're - where we'll be putting capital, what units will be operating, and what units won't be operating. So, but we see this as definitely a benefit to the markets which will be a benefit to the consumer, which will be a benefit to the shareholder. ","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Steve. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Michael, your line is now open.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Chris Crane","Hey, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Hey, two quick questions. The first one is do you think that the uncertainty surrounding FERC and surrounding new rules for capacity and energy taking also some uncertainty is delaying a new build or new start construction plans, if this is going to have an effect on tightening the market going over the next year or two. And my second question, I'll just ask it right now is a public service enterprise group just announced that they're pulling out of the retail business. Is this a potential opportunity for Constellation? ","Chris Crane","First question, new builds are driven based off of market needs in economics and unless we get the economics to support new asset entry, you will get to see what we've seen in the last couple of years, the decline then we have to see what comes out of the resiliency review on how the market values different sources from fixed view. So, there will be an evolution before we'll see a real opening or a market response to the demand need for assets or investments to be made to come in. It's basic economics right now. The market is barely supporting the assets that are operating today. So, why would you invest into new assets when you are not going to get a recovery or return on your capital? Just a second you can\u2026","Michael Weinstein","Okay, understood.","Chris Crane","-- into new assets when you are not going to get a recovery or return on your capital. ","Michael Weinstein","Okay.","Jim McHugh","Hi, Michael, it's Jim here. I can speak to that question. I think you know with the announcements of folks leaving or coming into the retail market, we're always on top of that and looking for opportunities to look for value and acquire books of business. In this case, I think you know if you think it's noted, that they're going to supply their contracts as they roll off. We'll obviously there to serve customers as the number one C&I customer and the number two resi customer in the country, so a lot for the business and they will alone. I think for us, we have that scale, we've developed that scale over the years through acquisitions and in organic growth and our platform is very capable of acquiring new customers and retaining existing customers pretty easily. We've been having a lot of success also just finding new products and solutions for customers in both the residential space and C&I space, so we'll keep taking advantage of those opportunities that are in front of us. ","Michael Weinstein","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, Michael. Your next question comes from the line as Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Jonathan, your line is now open. ","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys.","Chris Crane","Hi, Jon.","Jonathan Arnold","Just to pick up on the discussion around the state legislation and potentially not leading legislation, and Kathleen I heard your comments that you know there could be different answers depending on which state you're talking about. But is it fair to say, the way you said today that you think Illinois would have to legislate and then I'm curious, what you think about the state of play in New Jersey?","Kathleen Barr\u00f3n","You're correct, Jonathan. I agree with your assessment in Illinois, there will be a need for legislation legislation to adjust those changes in rules. And I think a positive for us is that we are seeing not just here but across the country our growing sentiment among environmental groups and policymakers that the fastest and cheapest path to de-carbonizing is a policy that uses all zero carbon resources. And so to the extent states want to act to increase their clean energy ambition. We would be expected -- we would expect that all assets including ours would be able to participate in that type of policy as FERC for allowing the states to go ahead and procure a clean capacity directly allows them to do so in a way that's going to be able to keep costs down per customers and achieve clean energy goals at the same time.","So we would look to that kind of structure to the extent you know the FERC puts this car down in the tariff you know in Illinois. And here in New Jersey given the way that the state law is written there and the authority at that DPU level to do the capacity procurement through the existing BGS structure, there would not need - there would not be a need for a incremental legislation to allow that state's procurement of that to flow through the BGS. So that's why I said I think the answer is different depending on which jurisdiction you're in.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, great. I was just waiting to see if you provide that on the individual states. So thank you. Could I just ask one quick follow-up on the cost savings, you've obviously laid out how you expect that to be timed the Q3 2018 cost reductions? Can you remind us how much of the $250 million you've announced last year was flowing into Exgen and maybe what the sort of sequencing is there in terms of how those ramp up as we're trying to unravel the numbers I guess is slide 15.","Chris Crane","Yes, that is in a numbers. I think we're looking for the page now Joe's got it.","Joe Nigro","The 250 last year all of it is flowing into ExGen, the reductions were taken at ExGen across the platform nuclear constellation in our\u2026","Jonathan Arnold","And the timing, Joe, is it kind of across the period until 2020 or most of it going to already there in\u2026 ","Joe Nigro","2019, you'll get to run rate year.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. All right. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you, Jonathan. That concludes the question and answer session of today's webcast. I'll hand the call over back to Mr. Chris Crane, CEO of Exelon Corporation.","Chris Crane","Thanks again everybody for joining. Thanks for the questions. Hopefully, we covered everything. Any other concerns, please get a hold of IR or myself, and we'd be glad to continue to discuss them, but thanks to the team.

Thank you.","I'd now like to turn today's conference over to Francis Idehen. Thank you, you may begin.","Francis Idehen - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Ali. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining for our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; Joe Nigro, CEO of Constellation; and Jack Thayer, Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.","Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material, comments made during this call, and in the risk factors section on the 10-K which we filed in February, as well as in the earnings release and the 10-Q, which we expect to file later today.","Please refer to the 10-K, today's 8-K and 10-Q, and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause the results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.

I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Francis, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with our earnings coming in at $0.59 per share, surpassing our guidance of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. You'll hear more from Jack in a minute on the specifics, and Joe Nigro will also provide some color around the performance.","We've seen a number of positive developments that affect various business this quarter. The two primary catalysts for us this year are the PHI acquisition and the capacity market auctions. We received approval from the merger since our last call in Maryland in May, and leaving D.C., Washington, D.C. as our only outstanding jurisdiction to close the merger, which we expect to hear from soon and we're looking forward to a positive outcome there. Upon closing the merger, our focus will shift to the integration of PHI Utilities into the Exelon Utilities to align our operations to better serve the PHI customers base.","Another major catalyst is the capacity performance revisions that have been made. While we continue to believe that FERC came to the right conclusion, putting reliability at the center of its planning process to ensure that customers in the region are well served, we always were aware that DR and Energy Efficiency were in the 2018-2019 auction. The most recent change that allows DR and Energy Efficiency to provide \u2013 to participate in the transition auctions, we believe to be non-material to the outcome.","We are disappointed in the delay, but we think that we'll be on the right track into recognize the value of our highly reliable fleet going forward. And we remain confident that the capacity construct is the best way to protect the grid as we await further clarification on the timing of these transition auctions. I think we're getting that in the last days. So, by the September timeframe, we should have clarity on the value proposition, along with the reliability measures being enacted.","In Illinois, the legislative session ended without a resolution on the market redesign for the Low Carbon standard, the Low Carbon Portfolio standard. We were disappointed that we were not able to get this outcome before the session ended, but understand where the state is focused right now on its budget priorities. The nuclear plants provide significant value to the state and its economy, and it's mostly important to its consumers.","Looking ahead, we have certain regulatory and operational triggers in September that require us to make some tough choices on the specific assets this fall, particularly in light of the continued pressure on the power markets. So we are continuing on with our disciplined plan on evaluating the assets and their likelihood to stay within the stack, and we'll bring that to closure with our decision in September.","Despite these market challenges, we continue to find ways to create value in our Constellation business, which Joe is going to talk about shortly. Part of our resilience to the power market weakness is driven by our ability to capitalize on our generation to load strategy. And this quarter, we showed the benefit from the lower cost to serve load. And the \u2013 increasing our utility business has been able to reduce the overall volatility at the enterprise level and deliver growth.","You can expect that even more to be true over time. Not only is it shifting our business mix with the acquisition of PHI, but it also, with our infrastructure improvement investments, we're investing $16 billion in our existing utilities over the next five years, which provides respectable growth rates, and roughly another $7 billion with the addition of PHI.","I want to remind everybody that we can perform well even with a rising interest rate environment, which is typically a headwind in our industry. This is because our EPS is positively correlated to interest rates, due to both ComEd's formula rate and ROE being tied to the 30-year Treasury rate, as well as the discount of our pension \u2013 discounting the rates of our pension liability. Overall, we are positive the company is able to provide more stable and durable earnings streams for our shareholders with our operational expertise in driving performance across the enterprise.","With that, I'll turn it over to Joe, who will discuss the markets. He's followed by Jack on the financial performance.","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. The Constellation business has continued to perform well in 2015 as a result of our generation to load matching strategy. My comments today will address market events during the second quarter, and what they mean for our commercial business going forward, including our hedging strategy in our updated disclosures.","Starting with slide four, the spot power markets in the second quarter have been defined by mild weather and lower natural gas prices, which drove the price in power considerably lower than in 2014 across all of PJM. The impact of low spot market conditions has carried through to the forward markets, with prices down approximately $0.45 per megawatt hour in 2016 and $1 per megawatt hour in 2017, at both PJM West Hub and NiHub since the end of the first quarter. The lack of liquidity in the forward markets has exacerbated the drops in power prices and heat rates, with the forward markets exhibiting volatile price moves on very little trading volumes for calendar 2017 and beyond, especially at NiHub.","During the quarter, our hedging activities for 2016 to 2018 were executed through our retail and wholesale load businesses rather than on the over-the-counter market. Our fundamental view of power prices has not changed, but given the drop in market prices, there is a greater gap between the market and our fundamental view due to current natural gas prices, expected retirements, new generation resources, and load assumptions.","Moving to slide five, I will discuss the forward market and its impacts on our hedging profile. During the second quarter we maintained our behind ratable strategy and increased our cross-commodity hedge position to increase exposure to power price upside. We have successfully used this behind ratable hedging strategy in the past when our view showed upside in the market. We are 4% to 5% behind ratable in 2016 and 2017, and 7% to 8% behind ratable if you will remove our cross-commodity hedges at NiHub. We are confident in our ability to adjust our hedging strategies to capitalize on our fundamental view.","Turning to slide six, I will review our updated hedge disclosure and some key changes since the end of the first quarter. In 2015 we have a net $50 million increase to total gross margin since the end of the first quarter, driven primarily by strong performance and execution. We executed on $200 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business during the quarter. Based on 2015 performance to date and expectations for the full year, we have increased our power new business target by $50 million.","Our generation to load strategy was successful last year during the extreme polar vortex conditions, and it's serving us well this year under weaker load and price conditions. It is further augmented by strong performance from our portfolio optimization activities and our Integrys acquisition.","For 2016, we saw prices decrease across most regions, decreasing around $0.45 per megawatt-hour in both the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest. This resulted in a decrease in our open gross margin of approximately $200 million, which was offset by our hedging activities. During the quarter we executed $100 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business, and are raising our power new business targets by $50 million additional due to commercial opportunities, for a gross margin increase of $50 million in 2016.","For 2017, prices decreased by approximately $1 per megawatt hour in both the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. This resulted in a decrease of $300 million in our open gross margins. Despite the drop in prices, our total gross margin is only down $50 million due to our hedged position and an increase in our power new business target of $100 million in case we have line of sight into additional commercial opportunities.","Since the beginning of the year, prices have fallen due to mild weather, lower gas prices, lower load demand in the Midwest, and a lack of liquidity in the markets. Prices have fallen more in 2017 and beyond than in 2016. Although this weakness in the spot market has impacted forward markets, we are confident in our fundamental view of the gas and power markets and are positioning our portfolio to take advantage of this.","Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter. My remarks will cover our financial results for the quarter, third quarter guidance range, and our cash outlook. Starting with our second quarter results on slide seven, Exelon exceeded our guidance range and delivered earnings of $0.59 per share. This compares to $0.51 per share for the second quarter of 2014. Exelon's Utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.25 per share and were flat to the second quarter of last year.","During the quarter, we saw favorable weather at PECO and unfavorable weather at ComEd. Cooling degree days were up nearly 37% from the prior year and 47.4% above normal in Southeastern Pennsylvania, and down 34% from the prior year and 21.6% below normal in Northern Illinois.","Distribution revenues at ComEd and BGE were higher quarter-over-quarter. In addition, BGE had a decrease in uncollectible accounts expense compared to the second quarter of 2014. Exelon Generation had another strong quarter, delivering earnings of $0.36 per share, $0.09 higher than the same period last year. As Joe mentioned, our generation to load matching strategy continues to prove effective. We benefited from a lower cost to serve both our retail and wholesale customers, and had strong performance from our portfolio management team.","In addition, compared to the second quarter of 2014 we had fewer outage days at our nuclear plants, which had a positive contribution from the Integrys acquisition, higher realized nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains, and received additional benefits quarter-over-quarter from the cancellation of the DOE spent nuclear fee. These positive factors were partially offset by higher tax and interest expense. More detail on the quarter-over-quarter drivers for each operating company can be found on slides 18 and 19 in the appendix.","For the third quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Accounting for the impact of the increased share count and the debt associated with the Pepco Holdings transaction, and assuming the transaction closes in the third quarter, we are narrowing our full-year guidance from $2.25 to $2.55 per share, to $2.35 to $2.55 per share. Our guidance does not assume that bonus depreciation is extended.","Slide eight provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. We've simplified the format of our slide to provide a clearer view of our cash flow at each operating company, including explicitly showing free cash flow. We project cash from operations of $6.6 billion. We project free cash flow of $900 million at Generation in 2015. 80% of our total growth capital expenditures are being invested in our utilities over the next three years, which will provide stable earnings growth.","In June we completed the debt portion of our financing for the Pepco transaction by issuing $4.2 billion in senior notes, with the majority of these proceeds being used to fund the transaction. Strong market demand allowed us to upsize the offering, enabling us to pull forward some future-planned corporate debt issuances. We issued across the tenor spectrum with an average maturity of approximately 14 years and an average weighted average coupon of 3.79%.","Earlier this month we completed the settlement of the equity forward transaction. The combination of these financings allows us to close the merger quickly upon receiving approval from the D.C. Public Service Commission. Our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the ability to invest and grow our business.","As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. Thank you, and we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question will come from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good morning.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Couple of questions. First, when you talk about commercial opportunities, in the context of your comfort level raising your guidance for power new business\/to go, are we talking about sort of the inherent counter-cyclicality of the margins in that business in the low wholesale environment, i.e., are we moving closer off the $2 floor in margins and closer to the $4 sort of peak of the cycle margins that you see in that business historically, or is it simply new customers, more volumes than you had projected in either the gas or the electric business?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Joe?","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Yeah, Greg. In this specific instance, specifically for 2016 where we're raising our power new business\/to go by $50 million and 2017 by $100 million, it's really \u2013 it's not related to those load margins. It's more specifically related to some proprietary structured commercial opportunities that we have really solid line of sight into on the wholesale side of the business, quite frankly.","To your point though, I think it's important to note we have raised our targets each \u2013 $50 million each quarter for 2015, for a total of $100 million so far year-to-date. And a lot of that has been driven by really three things. One is the monetization of loads that we sold at higher prices last year. So, we have seen increased value from that load-serving business, some of our optimization activities. And then we went in, as you saw from our disclosures last quarter, we went in with a short bias with a backstop of our own generation, and given the results of market prices in 2015 to date, that's performed well.","We would only look to raise those targets, the power\/to go targets or non-power\/to go targets, if we have good line of sight into specific opportunities. And in this case, we do.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Follow-up to that. If these are fairly chunky opportunities and you win them, will we get a sort of a discrete disclosure or would that just \u2013 would we get \u2013 would you just update it on a quarterly basis as per your usual, moving from to go to, into the hedges?","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Yeah. Yeah. We'll disclose that when the negotiations are complete.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Greg, it will be in the MD&A disclosure in our interview (19:24), when it occurs.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. Second question. In light of economic conditions in Texas, most of your investors would probably rather see you pull the plug on this gas-fired project that you're pursuing. What gives you the confidence that the through-the-cycle economics of that investment are still worth going forward in this environment?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So as we said, we've got a very good deal on acquiring these assets on our brownfield site. Minimal infrastructure investment. They still have a double digit IRR with these market forwards. If you just projected we stay here for 10 years, and then plug the fundamentals in after, we're still at a double-digit IRR. This is a solid investment. These are going to be dispatched first. They're the highly efficient, air-cooled, and at the right price.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Concise answer. Thank you. Take care.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","First to Jack, clarification. So in the updated 2015 guidance, are you including some amount of POM, both the business and the financing costs? And if so, is it positive or negative within the year?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","So Steve, we are including \u2013 we are including the equity and the debt associated with the PHI acquisition. So for share count purposes, that incorporates a weighted average share base of 892 million shares. It does assume the third quarter close of PHI. But there is a measure of dilution this year that's related to the increased share count, the debt, and as we pursue rate cases on PHI, improve their revenues and earnings, we'll see the accretion that we anticipate with that transaction in future periods.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So just to clarify, when you net for this short period into year-end, when you net POM revenue and the financing cost, it's actually \u2013 your numbers would have been higher in this guidance if you hadn't included that.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Modestly, Steve.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. But then we'll get the...","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","It (22:02), but not materially so.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","But the future accretion guidance that you gave, I think, at the last quarter, or recent commentary, that's still good for future years?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","The impact on rate cases and the deferral of those rate cases modestly impacts the accretion, but we're still at the \u2013 as we disclosed at the last quarter, we're still at the sort of bottom end of the range in 2017 that we gave.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so, it's 2018 to get to that \u2013 more to that midpoint of the run rate that we talked about.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. But you said that \u2013 you clarified that, I think, the last call or so. That's not new. Okay.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So, $0.15 in 2017, and you'll see us head to the upper end in 2018.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Second question is just with respect to the power views. I kind of feel like just, the last few calls you've been a little bit more mixed on your power views. You're a lot more bullish right now, at least, I guess, with respect to NiHub. Is that mainly just a fact that you had to pull back as of Q2 end, and so you're just more bullish because the starting price is lower, or are you more bullish even if the prices had stayed flat?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's, the prices have gone lower. We're more bullish, they're non-sustainable at this level.","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Yeah. And, Steve, what I would say is, our view of the absolute value of power price hasn't changed quarter-over-quarter, and what's changed is we saw a material drop in the back end of the power curve and I'm talking to NiHub, but it's attributable to West Hub as well, but our upside is really baked at NiHub where we see material upside as you move out into that 2018, 2019 timeframe.","We see upside as well in that 2016, 2017 period, and what's changed is the market has fallen so much, quarter-over-quarter; our absolute view of power price hasn't changed. So that spread has gone wider. And when we look at our fundamental models at NiHub, in particular, we see a lot of value that's still to be derived, and that's due to the changing dispatch stack and some of the other things that we've talked about previously.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Talk about the lack of liquidity.","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Yeah, the liquidity piece of it is a big part of it, Steve. We had a $0.40 \u2013 approximately $0.40 a megawatt-hour drop in PJM, in West Hub and NiHub in calendar 2016. That's the most liquid period on the forward curve. When we've pulled data and we have access to and look at what's going on in the out-years, 2018, 2019, 2020 where we saw a material drop in prices, there is absolutely nothing trading at NiHub.","There had been some few sporadic trades at West Hub, and you see the market set prices off of those trades. And our view is through time, that spread relationship between the West Hub and NiHub is going to collapse because of the retirements on the western side, the new builds on the eastern side, and that's why we think there is material upside. But our fundamental absolute view on power price hasn't changed. It's just the way the market reacted quarter-over-quarter.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Daniel Eggery (sic) [Daniel Eggers] (25:35) with Credit Suisse.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, good morning, guys. On Pepco, could we just talk about the process? So assuming that the D.C. decision comes soon, what is the process for closing from this point, and what bearing does the Maryland appeal have on your ability to close right now?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to get Darryl Bradford to cover that.","Darryl M. Bradford - Executive Vice President & General Counsel","Hey, Steve.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's Dan.","Darryl M. Bradford - Executive Vice President & General Counsel","I'm sorry. Dan, we expect to \u2013 assuming a acceptable order from the D.C. Commission, we expect to close promptly after that order. Our contract would indicate that that will take place within 48 hours of approval by the D.C. commission.","And we don't think that the Maryland motion should be any bar to us closing. We don't believe that that motion has any merit whatsoever. As you know, the alleged conflict of interest of one of the commissioners having a preliminary interviewing discussion, which she stopped, with a non-party, isn't a basis under Maryland law to question the independence of that decision, let alone to stay the proceedings.","No court in Maryland and no commission in Maryland has ever suggested there's a conflict with the commissioner of any agency having a conversation with a non-party. Particularly where, as here, Exelon is one of some 45 board members, 140 members in an agency that includes public interest groups like Public Citizen, which was a party below and was the first one to raise this conflict issue.","So we don't think that that motion has any merit. We filed a response yesterday with the court, and we plan to go ahead and close promptly after the D.C. commission issues an order, assuming that that order has acceptable conditions. And we have faith that the D.C. commission will do the right thing. We think we've put in a strong case with a lot of benefits for customers and protections for customers. And we look forward to a prompt closing.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And then I guess just on the nuclear plants in Illinois with PJM, I guess, probably moving the closure date to October. That's still probably before Illinois can act legislatively. With the drop in the forward curves, is there a practical way where you can look at those plants and think that they stay economic without some sort of legislation in Illinois? And does that force your hand come October?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The capacity market fixes, focused on reliability, will not be enough to keep all the units economically viable. It does give us some support for the investments that we continue to make on the assets to maintain the reliability but it's not totally there. We need a market fix in Illinois to stop the non-competitive nature of the market. And short of the legislation to fix that, we will have to make decisions on retiring assets that are not economically viable.","As we talked about previously, we have requirements around notification to PJM of our intent to retire units. It's an 18-month notification. We also have commitments around when we have to notify of our availability for the 2018-2019 auction in participation on that. And very importantly, we have to order and design cores that \u2013 fuel cores that take a while for us to \u2013 or 2019-2020 auction instead of 2018-2019, 2019-2020 auction, our participation there. And we have to order the cores, and there's a long lead time there. Are we going to run for an additional year or are we going to run for a longer period of time? And that's a very expensive decision to make.","So, at least on the PJM (30:34) we'll make the decision, the final decision, if we're going to do that, in the September timeframe. We've been in consultation with the Board and we'll continue to consult with the Board, and where management's made their decision we'll pass that to the Board for the final approval in that timeframe, and continue with the outreach to our stakeholders.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Chris, just given the fact that you're not going to have legislation realistically done before September, and you kind of laid out the other challenges, doesn't it \u2013 what would cause you to not close the plants come September, based on the fact pattern you just laid out for us?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If the units clear the 2018-2019 auction, that would show that they're financially viable. That is a long shot in our opinion, just because of the cost structure and how the forwards have continued to collapse at the bus at a couple of these units. We've got the transmission constraints, we've got the overproduction and importation of wind that not only drops the spot but continues to collapse the forward curve. The disconnect between NiHub and the bus at some of these units is $6, $7. And we have worked very closely with all the stakeholders involved for over a year and a half on trying to come to resolution, and it is the time that we'll have to make the decision after we see what happens with the capacity auctions.","We don't take the decision lightly. We understand the effect that we have on the communities and potential effect on employees, but this has been a long-term issue that we've been evaluating and trying to come to resolution, and we're staying within the timeline. Actually, we extended our timeline last year to give more time to come up with the proper market fixes, and to be compensated adequately for operating these units versus subsidizing a low-cost market.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And I don't mean to beat this to death (32:49) for this, but would closing a Quad or a Clinton show up noticeably as accretive to you guys on 2017 numbers?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't \u2013 we have not looked at that, and don't look at it. We analyze the plants as a standalone in their own economics, so it's about a plant losing money. We have not evaluated; others have and others have talked about the impact to consumers on those units closing. The state itself did that assessment, and there is some material impact on the consumer, but we have not evaluated anything specific to Exelon.","Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","One \u2013 just \u2013 given your comments about liquidity in the forward curve, is it fair to assume that you've probably not done much in the way of 2018 hedging yet? Because ordinarily you would have been a couple of quarters into it. Just curious if you could give us any insight?","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Yeah, Jonathan. We are behind our ratable sales plan in 2018. As you know, we have a very big load-serving book of business, so we've captured opportunities, both in our retail and wholesale load-serving businesses to the extent possible, in 2018. And in addition, at times, as we've spoken about in other years, we used the gas market as well. But to sell straight OTC power in 2018, we've not done much, if any, of that at all.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just to revisit the commercial opportunities comment. Can you give us any insight as to what kind of opportunities you're talking about? And is it, are they the result of others pulling back from the market, or just successful discussions with potential clients I guess?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's early on that one, Jonathan. We'll do the full disclosure when we complete the negotiations.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Sorry to re-ask that. And then, Chris, at the outset, you made the comment that you saw the inclusion of DR in the transition auctions as being, I think you said, nonmaterial to the outcome?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Could you share a bit more of your kind of logic and thought process behind that statement?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Joe?","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Jonathan, it's Joe. First of all, we lost over $1 billion of market cap post the announcement of that, of the inclusion of DR in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. And we really thought it was a little bit of an overreaction. As Chris mentioned, we're disappointed in the delay, but we don't believe there's going to be a material impact to either of those transition auctions. As you're aware, DR was already included in 2018-2019 and beyond.","The reason why we don't think it's a material impact in the transition auctions is really related to how the auctions themselves cleared on the base residual, and the separation in price in 2016-2017 on one side, and then the amount of DR that clears in the 2017-2018 auction, and when we put that all into our models, it's very similar to what we've read, quite frankly, from a lot of what's been written by the equity community, that it's going to be a limited impact.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Julien Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Hey, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. So, first quick question and it does kind of rehash a little bit here, but on the fundamental upside you're talking about, just to be clear, what does that assume in terms of retirements, just to be clear? Your own retirements, particularly as you're thinking about the life of your portfolio here in the back half of the year?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We have not evaluated the potential retirement of any our assets on market-forward prices. And, so this is just based off of fundamentals of what has been announced, and what we see for retirements, what we see for the economic viability of the existing fleet in what they would have to clear to stay viable going forward. So it's not a sustainable market forward with the asset mix that's currently in. It has nothing to do with any forward decision we would make.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. So just to be clear, nuclear retirements would be incremental to your fundamental upside?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't know that. We have not analyzed it and I wouldn't want to project one way or the other. It's, there are two different things. The nuclear asset retirement is based off of the economic viability of the asset on the stand-alone. And we have had losses and free cash flow losses in the trailing five years of some significance. And we project going forward with these market forwards, them to be even worse than they were a year ago, which is driving us to make that decision. It is not based off of any potential impact on the market forwards or the rest of the fleet's viability.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then two subsequent questions here. First, in terms of the FCF losses, what would you estimate those as being, both for the eastern portfolio and for the ComEd portfolio as it stands today? And then secondly, tied into that, as you evaluate the remaining life of some of these assets, would you imagine layering one announcement after another? So I suppose specifically, there's a timing issue related to ordering new cores. I imagine certain units have to get those orders in before others. Could we see one nuclear retirement and then subsequently, depending on what happens in the legislative arena, et cetera, see further announcements later this year, in trying to reconcile the bigger issues around FCF deficit?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We've discussed fairly openly the units, the affected units. PJM's rules require us an earlier notification than MISO's rules. And so, we would be moving forward, if we have to, on PJM units before MISO units. We don't project a MISO decision until beginning of next year, looking at the opportunities we have with that unit either through legislation or other mechanisms, to secure the required revenues that we need there.","We've talked about New York units. We're still working with our partners in our stakeholders in New York to look at, is there a viable way beyond \u2013 a reliability must-run situation to maintain economic viability there? And the final asset that's been in discussion is Oyster Creek, which we've already had an agreed-upon early retirement date at the end of 2019. So, short of the \u2013 short of a, some type of failure that was a costly failure on the unit, we would run into that period to allow adequate transition, utilization of the fuel, and adequate transition of our employee base to other facilities.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. But just to be clear about the MISO unit there, depending on the success this year in the legislative arena, would that drive that decision?","Christopher M. Crane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It would have a \u2013 it would heavily weight our decision.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one final question. Your final question will come from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. I wanted to get a little bit more color on the Pepco approval process here, and the court challenge, than what you've already talked about. Do you have any sense of the precedent, or a precedent, for actually staying a commission order? Obviously you disagree with the merit of this case. But you do you have any precedent there, and what would be the path forward if it was not stayed, and you got the decision out of D.C.?","Darryl M. Bradford - Executive Vice President & General Counsel","Thanks. It's Darryl again. Yeah, the precedent on a stay is very clear in Maryland. It's an extraordinary remedy. It is rarely granted. You have to show a likelihood of success on the merits. And the motion does not, on the merits of the underlying merger, raise any issues whatsoever. The only issue that raises is this specious purported conflict claim, which we think is very, very weak. So, we don't think they've attempted to meet that.","They would also have to show irreparable harm, which \u2013 they spend a paragraph trying to satisfy that. It's really not very persuasive, in our view. They would have to show that a stay is in the public interest. And, of course, not only has the Maryland Commission, but the New Jersey Commission, the FERC, the Delaware Commission have all found that this merger is in the public interest. And they'd also have to show that the hardships favor them, and in our pleading we lay out why disrupting \u2013 the hardship of potentially disrupting a $7 billion merger outweighs any hardships that would occur from the grant of the stay.","So we think it's an extraordinary remedy. We don't think that they've come close to meeting those standards in any respect. And the law is also very clear that in Maryland, it's not a balancing. They have to satisfy each and every one of those elements, and in this case, in our view, they haven't satisfied any of them. So, that leaves us in a position where, upon D.C. approval, and assuming that the court agrees with the pleading we filed yesterday and doesn't grant a stay, that promptly upon the D.C. Commission joining the other commissions in finding that this is in the public interest, and assuming that any conditions it imposes are not unduly burdensome, that we would close promptly.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then, is there \u2013 or my understanding is that D.C. has to rule by the end of August. Is there any flexibility around that timing? Can they extend that again?","Darryl M. Bradford - Executive Vice President & General Counsel","Yeah. There is no clock in D.C., so they are not under any time constraint. Generally, the D.C. Commission has ruled within 90 days of something being fully briefed and submitted to them. This was fully briefed at the end of May. So that 90 days would end at the end of August. I think that's where that date comes from. Obviously, we're hopeful that sooner is better than later, but that will be up to the D.C. Commission, and they'll rule when they have finished their work. They are, I think, acutely aware that a lot of people are looking for a decision from them, and they understand that. But they will take the time that they deem necessary in order to do their job right.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then if I could, real quick, Joe, I just wanted to follow up, you've mentioned lack of liquidity in the forward markets a couple of times on the call here. Is this a lack of liquidity that exceeds just the general nature of these markets and what you've seen historically? Has that increased, and if that is the case, do you have an opinion as to why there might be so few trades going on out there?","Joseph Nigro - Executive Vice President, Exelon; Chief Executive Officer, Constellation, Exelon Corp.","Yeah, I think it's probably worse than it has been historically. And I think some of it is, there is just no natural buyers out on, that far out on the forward curve, as I said. The back end of the forward curve was dropped much more than in like 2016, where there were more natural buyers, whether we talk about retail or speculators or other participants. So I think with some of the folks that used to participate in the markets not doing that, some on the banking side and others, I think it's had a material impact.","Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And that will conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.

My name is Natalie and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Call for Exelon Corporation. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.Mr. Ravi Ganti, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.Ravi GantiThank you, Natalie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exelon\u2019s fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven\u2019t received it, the release is available on Exelon website. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today\u2019s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today\u2019s 8-K and Exelon\u2019s other filings for discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management\u2019s projections, forecasts and expectations and for reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings.Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s President and CEO; and Jack Thayer, Exelon\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They\u2019re joined by other members of Exelon\u2019s executive management team who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call.I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s CEO.Christopher M. CraneThanks, Ravi. Good morning, everyone. Today I\u2019ll review the 2012 operating results, introduce our 2013 earnings guidance and announce our new dividend policy. Looking at 2012, it was an important and eventful year for Exelon. In March we completed our successful merger with Constellation, in addition to over $550 million in expected synergies, the transaction resulted in commercial balance of generation and load helping reduce earnings volatility in our merchant business.Exelon\u2019s ability to deliver on operational excellence was once again evident in 2012 and I will share some of those highlights a bit later. As you know 2012 was a difficult year on the economic front for our sector. Some of this significant challenges include in lower commodity prices, reduced load growth expectations, margin compression in retail and major storms in two of our service areas.In the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded earnings of $0.64 per share and a full-year operating earnings of $2.85. These results fell within our guidance range. Q4 earning reflect $0.05 of cost at PECO BGE due to the effect of hurricane Sandy, which was in line with our preliminary estimate, add its peak PECO and BGE had service interruptions to over 1.2 million customers. Our crews worked to restore power to not only those in our service territories, but also those in New York and New Jersey as well. All three utilities received awards in recognition of their exceptional response efforts from EEI, in January.Our nuclear fleet capacity factor for 2012 came into shy of 93%, capping another year of good fleet performance. On our Q3 earnings call, we mentioned the Illinois Commerce Commission decision regarding the pension asset added $0.10 of earnings in 2012 for ComEd versus the guidance we provided at Analysts Day.We continued our growth during 2012, we added nearly 500 megawatts of new clean generation that included 400 megawatts in wind, 330 megawatts in solar and 60 megawatts in nuclear operates. Finally, we achieved our 2012 on a synergy goal of $170 million and to complete the actions to lock in on $350 million of the $550 million expected run rate savings.For the 2013 outlook, today we\u2019re introducing our operating earnings guidance for 2013, we expect our operating earnings range to be in the $2.35 to $2.65 per share and our first quarter guidance is $0.60 to $0.70 a share. Jack will provide you more color on that later in the call.Let me discuss our view on the near-term market dynamics, both the spot and the forward commodity price has suffered large drops in 2012. Natural gas spot prices dipped to a low of $1.81 in MMBtu levels and that had not been seen for a decade. While the forwards traded in the mid $3 to $4 range, more recently the prospects of slow economy recovery and plentiful gas supplies have kept the forward markets for power and gas relatively steady at the depressed levels.In response to the lower forward prices and weaker financial expectations, we took several steps during 2012 to maintain our $2.10 dividend and strengthen our credit metrics. Most significantly we reduced our growth investment plans by $2.3 billion during the year by delaying or canceling nuclear upgrade projects and removing other investment targets.We said in November that we needed the forward power markets to show evidence of $3 to $6 fundamental upside to give us confidence that further actions would not need to be taken to strengthen our balance sheet. While we waited for the market to rebound to begin during the last quarter of 2012 and earlier this year, we reexamined our financial priorities in our dividend practice.We believe that our dividend should be sized to reflect our business model and keep our balance sheet strong. We also think that the dividend might be sized to allow us capacity and flexibility to pursue growth that will enhance the company's long-term value. While we remain confident that there is $3 to $6 of megawatt hour of fundamental upside in the market, it is increasingly clear that we will not see the upside as soon as we had expected.The applied heat rate in NiHub and West Hub forward markets are essentially the same or lower compared to the settled heat rates in 2010 and '11. This is despite announcements of approximately 19,000 megawatts of coal have retired or will retire in PJM by 2015.When this supply exits the generation stack, marked heat rates should arise, but we observe that this is not yet reflected in the forward prices. The change in the stack will eventually cause spot heat rates to arise which will then reflect in the forwards as liquidity improves.Right now, however, it appears that few buyers want to pay share value to insulate their exposure to supply shift. They would rather wait and see as evidence by the power prices and the margins that we're observing today.These market dynamics have brought us to a point where we no longer should add debt to our balance sheet to preserve the current dividend and put our credit metrics at risk. Investment grade rating is a top priority for us and it's critical to preserving our business and financial flexibility, efficient capital market access, enhanced business opportunities and efficiently manage our liquidity requirements.Without near-term market recovery and a strong desire to resolve the uncertainty of our dividend, our Board and I have determined now it's time to act. This was a tough decision for all of us. We recognize the value of the dividend to our investors. We analyzed several scenarios and determined that this action will provide the investor with a stable, sustainable dividend and capacity for growth and long-term values.We have an opportunity to invest in growth. We cannot do that efficiently if we're leaning on a balance sheet to maintain an 80% to 90% payout level. We are acting now to right-size our dividend to be more aligned with the commodity sensitive nature of our business. After assuring that we have had a strong balance sheet and credit metrics, we'll renew our focus on investing in future growth to enhance long-term shareholder value.With this background in mind, our Board met earlier this week to make a determination on the dividend. Exelon's Board of Directors has declared the first quarter dividend for 2013 of $0.525 \u2013 I'm saying this wrong, let me get it right. $0.525 per share and approved a revised dividend level going forward though it's vision is based off a rigorous financial analysis and internal review process.The first quarter dividend reflects a previous of that level of $2.10 a share on an annualized basis while a new dividend level contemplates our regular dividend of $0.31 quarterly dividend beginning in the second quarter of 2013 or $1.24 per share on an annualized basis. We intend to maintain our normal cadence of quarterly dividend declarations by the Board, so the Board will take formal action to clear the dividend next \u2013 the next dividend in the second quarter.Central to our analysis and recommendation to the Board was our ability to achieve and maintain our financial priorities under sustained stress gas in power priced environments and a one time operational and financial risks. While the dividend analysis used the bottoms-up approach we also noted that the final sizing and payout ratios well with in line with our peers. Jack, will address some of the details behind the analysis in his remarks.Let me now discuss Exelon\u2019s sustainable growth platform and think about \u2013 and our thinking about the future. Exelon\u2019s value proposition and competitive advantage comes from our scope and scale across the energy value chain and our core strength of operational excellence and financial discipline. Our broad scope from upstream business to beyond the meter in everything and between offers a broad range of investment opportunities and allows us to prioritize the deployment of capital efficiently. Similarly, our expansive scale provides the ability to be highly competitive by capturing synergies to the economy of scale.I want to remind you that investing for growth is not new to us. Exelon has a proven track record where we have demonstrated our competitive advantage, our core strengths and our expertise to grow our portfolio and return value to our investors. We have a disciplined rigorous approach to evaluating our growth opportunities; target opportunities are scrutinized through a series of steps using criteria, including financial metrics, portfolio diversification, regulatory environmental considerations.Over the last three years, we've invested over $6 billion across the energy value chain, the organic growth and M&A, which does not include our merger with constellation. This includes upstream activities, conventional gas fire generation, nuclear outbreaks, renewable generation, investment in our utilities and expansion into our retail platform. These investments have proved returns in excess of the cost of capital and will be accretive from free cash flow, earnings and credit metrics perspective. We look across the entire energy value chain for opportunities to invest.A particular interest to us in the current environment are asset\u2019s that add stable cash flows; these could include contracted generation, both conventional and renewable regulated revenues from our utility investments. We expect to invest excess cash opportunistically after meeting our balance sheet, base capital and dividend needs. We will continue to follow our disciplined approach to investment that has served us well in the past and expect to see returns in excess of our cost of capital.The updated dividend that I am announcing today coupled with our sustainable approach to growth investments should provide our investors with significant value in the form of a healthy balance sheet, sustainable dividend and participation in earnings growth from incremental investments.Now we will turn over to Jack, and he can provide more details on the dividend sizing and walk through the earnings guidance for 2013.Jonathan W. ThayerThank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. My comments will first provide a few more thoughts on the dividend analysis and then conclude with some insight on 2013 guidance and cash outlook.Slide 5, outlines the financial priorities that are the foundation of the value creation framework, our analysis and our decision making. As you recall, we outlined three priorities on the third quarter earnings call. First, our main investment grade across all registrants. Second, return value through our divided; and third, deploy free cash flow to grow and create value.Maintaining our investment grade rating remains our top priority and is crucial to our strategy. When we combine priorities two and three into a comprehensive value creation framework that includes a new sustainable dividend and the ability to leverage remaining available cash and balance sheet capacity to grow earnings and enhance shareholder value. Depending on the circumstances, these value creating opportunities may include investment and growth, reducing our long-term debt, dividend growth, and share repurchases.As Chris, mentioned we made several difficult decisions in 2012 to maintain our focused financial priorities. Addressing the dividend became the necessary next step to ensure that we can comfortably maintain the priorities going forward. It is important to note that this is an action we only want to take once. I will talk about our approach to developing and our confidence in the revised dividend policy on slide 6.The foundation of our analysis was a long range financial plan that we developed in the fall. Our first bottoms-up plan since integrating the two companies. Our focus then turned to the stress cases where we analyzed many scenarios within three categories. First, a sustained commodity price stress based on constant $3 per MMBtu gas. Second, other commercial and new business risks. And third, large one-time impacts such as like-kind exchange liability which we updated in our Form 8-K last week.The stress case scenarios formed the basis against which we tested the sustainability of the dividend and our investment grade credit metrics. We are able to meet our financial priorities under each of these stress case scenarios and we're confident the new dividend is sustainable.While we've tended to focus on FFO to debt targets in our discussions with you, internally we target a more comprehensive set of metrics including each rating agency\u2019s respective criteria. In sizing the dividend we have evaluated each agency full set of metrics under a number of scenarios including the stress cases I just discussed.This rigorous process culminated in a dividend policy with six guiding principles. First, maintain investment grade credit ratings at all OpCo. Second, ensure the new dividend rate is sustainable. Third, that it's funded by both the regulated utilities and the unregulated business. Fourth, it provides capital capacity for value enhancing growth opportunities. Fifth, that is allows for the opportunity to grow the dividend over time with increases supported largely by earnings growth at the utilities. And lastly, that the new dividend rate offers a competitive value proposition relative to other integrated comparables.Applying this policy resulted in a new dividend of $1.24 per share based on the following sum of the parts methodology. The utilities will continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% in line with regulated peers. This provides a strong foundation for dividend support and maintains the utilities' ability to reinvest in their territories. The utility target was based on a steady-state recognizing that BGE is restricted from paying a dividend until 2015.ExGen's dividend contribution is not based on a specific payout target. Instead we sized it to be sustainable under a stress case in both the credit metric and cash flow perspective. We targeted credit metrics supportive of mid to high BBB and ExGen throughout commodity cycle. Among the key metrics we analyzed were FFO to debt, with retained cash flow defined as FFO less dividends and positive free cash flow defined as cash from operations less CapEx and dividends.Finally, we benchmarked against a series of peer sets from competitive integrateds to other commodity-driven peers such as metals, specialty chemicals and refineries. The new dividend remains competitive on a payout ratio in both base and stress scenarios against this peer set. In short, it allows us to deliver on our key financial priorities, maintaining investment grade ratings and reinvesting available growth capacity to create value for our shareholders through the commodity cycle.On slide 7, I will now turn the focus to the 2013 outlook. The 2013 earnings guidance of $2.35 to $2.65 per share that Chris introduced is not directly comparable to the composition of the 2012 results due to the merger, as a full year of earnings is offset by a higher share count in 2013. However, we have included year-over-year earnings bridges in the appendix of today's presentation that improve the transparency of our earnings expectations for each OpCo. I will comment on a few of the key drivers.As you would expect, lower commodity prices and market conditions are the primary driver of lower expected ExGen earnings of 2013 as compared with 2012 results. On a positive note, as Chris referenced earlier, we are seeing the benefits of our growth projects which are providing a steady contribution to earnings and cash flow. To that end, you will also see that O&M and appreciation expenses at ExGen are increasing.The revenue contributions with the projects, which are in the ExGen RNF driver are along with the tax that is more than offset these higher costs. In addition to the project related cost of ExGen, O&M expense increases in 2013 are driven by inflation across all OpCos as well as to a lesser extend pension and OPEB.O&M synergy savings, which are ahead of schedule with $355 million plan for 2013 are offsetting a portion of these higher costs as we reported a $170 million of synergies in 2012. Higher depreciation expense is due to several projects coming online, including portions of AVSR1 and several win projects. The utility \u2013 the utilities as a whole are expected to contribute as similar level of earnings in 2013, with a full-year of BGE being offset by higher average share count at all OpCos. We\u2019ve included a detailed driver page in the appendix of slide 19 to help you with our year-over-year O&M comparisons.The last point related to 2013 is that we intend to record a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $270 million in the first quarter, in connection with a reevaluation of the like-kind exchange position. The Form 8-K that we filed on January 31st provides the details behind the reevaluation. This chart will not be reflected in operating earnings, so it is not been included in the guidance range of $2.35 and $2.65 per share. As of March 31, 2013, the potential cash outflow maybe as much as $860 million in the event we\u2019re unsuccessful in the upcoming litigation. We expect that commence later this year, and it take three to five years to resolve.Moving to slide 8, I will highlight a couple of points related to ExGen RNF. Slide 8 provides the year-end hedge disclosures compared to the data as of September 30th. Forward prices declined at West Hub and NiHub by an average of $1.50 and $0.50 per megawatt hour respectively, which brought down open gross margin by $150 million to $200 million a year. Although this is mostly offset in the mark-to-market of our hedges.Power New Business \/ To Go has come down in 2014 and 2015, primarily because we revised our retail expectations.With height in competition and the impact of low prices and volatility, we observed retail margins right around the bottom of our prior expectation of $2 to $4 per megawatt hour for the full-year 2012 and below the low-end of the range in the fourth quarter of 2012. It\u2019s also important to note that we have not changed our rate of our hedging policy in light of the dividend change, but we still retain flexibility on our hedging actions within the policy.On slide 9, I\u2019ll wrap up with a few highlights related to our 2013 cash flow expectations. Cash from operations is expected to be nearly $6 billion which includes our plan pension and OPEB contribution of $550 million in line with what we showed at EEI. Of this amount, roughly half is related to pension and reflects our $250 million level funding strategy and our largest pension. This strategy will stabilize cash flows and reduce volatility for our largest plan.2013 CapEx plans are largely consistent with the estimates provided at EEI and are also outlined in detail in the appendix on slide 20. One item of note is that ExGen\u2019s capital plan includes an estimate for Fukushima response cost of roughly $350 million over the next five years, which assumes filtered vents are not required. This was the end of base CapEx we presented at EEI, and we are breaking this out separately for the first time to increase transparency.We estimate filtered vents would require an additional $15 million to $20 million per unit of capital cost and our eleven Mark 1 and 2 units and we expect the NRC\u2019s ruling on this matter in the first quarter. Our O&M outlook also includes Fukushima response cost of less than $50 million in total over the next five years, which would not change with the inclusion of the filtered vents.Lastly as it relates to financing, the debt increase at ExGen in 2013 is related to plant project financing tied to our existing wind portfolio along with continued draws on our DOE loan guarantee to fund the AVSR solar project.In closing the appendix include several schedules that will aid you in your modeling efforts including load expectations, capital expenditures, tax rate assumptions by outlook. That concludes my comments.I'll now turn the presentation over to Chris for a few closing comments before we open the line for Q&A. Chris.Christopher M. CraneThanks, Jack. So, with the tough decision on the dividend behind us, I am more confident than ever now in our ability to deliver value for you going forward. Exelon is strategically positioned with a strong balance sheet, a sustainable dividend and now more capacity to invest in growth. We have the best team, the best assets and the best prospects of any company in the industry.While the power markets may take time to turn around, we have positioned ourselves to maintain financial strength while investing in growth that will deliver value. Over the years we have shown that we can do that and we expect to invest to create incremental value for our shareholders going forward.So with that, we'll open it up to Q&A.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). We ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of [Steven Berg].Christopher M. CraneHi, Steve.Unidentified AnalystHi. I wanted to go back, Chris, you had talked a bit about the strategy and had sort of discussed the risk tolerance on that. I just wanted to make sure that I had understood clearly that. Can you talk just a bit more about -- as you think about the degree of merchant risk that you're willing to take as you think about using your excess cash flow to grow the business over time? And how you assess those versus say more contracted opportunities?Christopher M. CraneYeah. At this point we would be looking at more certainty in returns. Well, I think we have adequate risk in the portfolio at this point, so it would be more around contracted assets, renewables that are contracted, making investments in that area. But the big opportunity that we have is the growing investments we can make in the utilities. So, it would always be about value and how we think it fits in the portfolio. So, I would not rule out a merchant opportunity if it was the right opportunity, but that would not be our priority at this point.Unidentified AnalystIt makes sense, understood. And just as a follow-up, Chris, maybe just talking more broadly, there is \u2013 President Obama mentioned carbon regulation effectively recently and I was just curious from \u2013 as you all look at the landscape and the potential for carbon regulation, what's your sense of the landscape or the prospects for carbon regulation over time?Christopher M. CraneI think there's going to be a lot of battling over the next four years in Washington. It's very hard to predict that they would be able to produce anything. It is not something that we're basing ourselves on right now. I think the regulation would have a fight. We would like to see a bipartisan approach to deal with the environmental issues and would hope at some point that that will happen, but not a strong likelihood right now. David or Joe, do you want to add anything to that.Joseph DominguezChris, I think you covered it. It's Joe. I think there's a lot of different proposals out there right now for greenhouse gas regulation of existing sources. We think that's going to take a number of years to sort itself out. We are aware that NRDC and others have put forward some proposals and undoubtedly we will see some new proposals in the coming months. And we would expect the EPA to take its time with this.Unidentified AnalystWell said. Thank you very much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon [ISI Group].Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.Thanks. Good morning.Christopher M. CraneHey, Greg.Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.Jack, I know that you went over what sounds like an extremely rigorous thought process in terms of sizing the dividend. Will this policy change previewed with the rating agencies or are we going to now sort of -- is this the first time they're seeing your velocity on the new payout?Jonathan W. ThayerGreg, as you might imagine, we've had rather extensive dialogue with all of the constituent agencies on this topic and throughout the year. It certainly was developed and deliberated. The stress cases were analyzed and reviewed and shared with them. And I would expect that their commentary on our actions announced today will incorporate their thoughts on the impact on the dividend reduction on our overall credit outlook and ratings.Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.Thanks. And as a follow-up, I noticed that the hedge profile in NiHub has increased modestly since the last at closure, but at the same time when I look at the sensitivity that you guys disclosed to a $5 change plus or minus to power prices. And unless I\u2019m reading it wrong, your 2014 and 2015 exposure is higher now, than it was in the last quarterly disclosure. Is that reflective of a hedging strategy where you\u2019re trying to express here, your view that greater or too low when you\u2019re keeping your heat rate position open?Christopher M. CraneLet Ken touch that.Kenneth W. CornewGreg, you\u2019re spot on. We \u2013as we talked about, we clearly see that there is upside in the market existing heat rates. We have adjusted our hedging strategies to heat more heat rate upside than we actually had the quarter before, that\u2019s a combination of slowing down our hedging, putting on some more put option, positions, and selling some gas. So we\u2019ve shifted our strategy and our confidence in that heat rate upside is there and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in our hedge [disclosure].Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.Thank you, gentlemen.Christopher M. CraneThanks, Greg.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers.Christopher M. CraneHey, Dan.Daniel Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research DivisionHi. Good morning, guys. Could you talk a little bit about your expectations with power markets and what\u2019s changed from three months ago to get to the dividend reduction decision?Christopher M. CraneKen?Kenneth W. CornewMaybe we \u2013 as I just said, we continue, our models continue to rationalize significant upside particularly in NiHub and quite frankly in the East especially New York, New England and PJM in Mid-Atlantic. We\u2019re seeing it in the power markets, we\u2019re still at a point where we\u2019re two plus years out. The buyers and sellers haven\u2019t really come together on that view yet. We\u2019re starting to see some others talk about this upside. So, I really do think its there. I think it will rationalize in the spot market as we see units roll off and get to more volatile higher load periods like this summer. I would expect, we\u2019re going to see some improvement in heat rates as we\u2019re actually seeing right now this winter and that should start to reflect itself in the market on the power side.Daniel Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research DivisionOkay. And now just on the hedging policy, I know you guys are going to keep it there, it sounds like you\u2019re going to keep it pretty consistent with history. Did the agencies suggest more flexibility in how you hedge going forward with the lower dividend or they still kind of look for you guys to making the policy you have placed for the last couple of years?Kenneth W. CornewDan, I\u2019d say they take great confidence in the ratable strategy that we historically pursued and anticipate continuing to pursue. Importantly we do have flexibility within that ratable policy that affords us the opportunity to the extent that we see relative to our fundamental view prices higher or lower to express a point of view within our roughly 10% band either side. And I think we\u2019d expect to continue that going forward. Certainly with the resized dividend, I would expect a commentary from the agencies [afford us] more flexibility broadly in how we\u2019re approaching our growth opportunities and other elements relative to where we might have been under the legacy (indiscernible) rate.Christopher M. CraneAnd being in our \u2013 you could see it in our hedge disclosure are \u2013 we\u2019re lagging behind ratable by 3% or 4% now. We actually \u2013 we\u2019re taking about a little more than that. We saw some uptick in November in the markets and we\u2019re seeing some positive stuff right now in the market. So, we will continue to take advantage of those kinds of moves, but I would expect, we will continue to keep a bit of a more open position and particularly a bigger heat rate position going forward.Daniel Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research DivisionOkay. Thank you, guys.Christopher M. CraneThanks, Dan.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold.Christopher M. CraneHey, Jonathan.Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionHi, good morning guys. Can you hear me?Christopher M. CraneYeah.Jonathan W. ThayerYeah.Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionMy question has to do with the stress case that you looked at and, could you make some comments around how you thought about retail margins in that stress case and perhaps, you know just some kind of little update on what you\u2019re seeing in the retail, if I know last quarter you were talking about some competitive behavior on the part of some others, so maybe an update there and then on the stress?Christopher M. CraneLet me have Jack, cover the basis for the stress case, and then Ken, can put some color around the retail margins.Jonathan W. ThayerJonathan here. The questions you\u2019re asking get exactly to the bottom of the sustainability question that was front and foremost in our minds as we developed the policy internally, we reviewed it with the agencies and we reviewed it with our Board. We started with a power stress and that was built on a sustained $3 gas environment throughout the curve. Importantly, it's stress to power as well. So it's not just an expression of view exclusively on gas but also an expression on stress heat rates and power out the curve. We didn't stop there.So, in addition to that, as you mentioned in your question around retail margins, we looked at certain business stresses to the extent that we had certain business pressures, whether that was from a margin perspective, whether that was from an operational O&M perspective or other elements within the regulatory environment, we looked at this stresses as well in addition to and on top of the power price stress.And then we looked at certain one-time events or significant events and attributed $1 stress against that as well looking to sustain, for simplicity, 27% or better FFO to debt metric in all stress environments. So, to the extent that we're unsuccessful with the like-kind exchange or there are other exogenous events like Fukushima that aren't currently contemplated in our business plan that we are north of that 27% FFO to debt in all circumstances. And so on the basis of those stresses that I think we can say with great confidence that this is a very sustainable dividend level and it's the right dividend level.Kenneth W. CornewJon, just to add to that, natural gas stressed to $3. That's a full reverse stress and we hit power prices even much harder than what we saw in August of last summer in our stress scenarios. We obviously have a hedging program that limits our risk to spot market prices. Jack talked about one-time shocked. We looked at scenarios that stressed or shocked our new business targets.On the commercial side, so we have done a rigorous and thorough analysis of this. I would like to remind everyone we don't have your assets, we have nuclear assets that run at high capacity factors and creates substantial margin even in stress situations. We have a lot of contracted renewables. So we have a well positioned hedged and cost-based portfolio that obviously we had to look at when coming up with our dividend policy.On retail margins, I would say and reiterate exactly what Jack was saying in his opening remarks. We have seen margins get to that low end of the $2 to $4 range we talked about. It is a hyper competitive market rate now. There is a lot of activity to grab market share in both mass markets and commercial industrial space. We remained disciplined. Our plan and our hedge disclosure projects that we'll be in this environment for some time and slowly creep back up to the middle of that range.Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionThank you. Could I follow-up just on the heat rate gas discussion?Christopher M. CraneSure.Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionThe question -- it sounds like what you're talking about is you stressed gas and heat rates in a way that maybe they haven't been stressed at the same time in recent experience in the forward curve. Is that correct? Because obviously when prior to -- power prices were low last summer, gas prices were low and heat rates actually weren't that low. So am I understanding that right that you've sort of assumed both bad things happen at the same time in a way that generally doesn't happen?Christopher M. CraneA few are, Jonathan, and that's what I meant by -- we stressed that it was power price [Technical Difficulty] beyond that August price situation we saw in the forwards. But you're right, heat rates were a little higher because they're going to move up when natural gas drops to extremely low levels. So, we really had heat rates and gas at the same time in our stress analysis. And again, we also shocked with just some time event stresses as well.Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Chin [Citigroup Inc].Christopher M. CraneHi, Brian.Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc.Hi. Good morning.Christopher M. CraneGood morning.Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc.I'd like to ask one more follow-up on the retail margin question. In the past, you signaled that you thought at the backend of your gross margin forecast to reach our margin levels would get up to somewhere in the mid single digits roughly around the $5 per megawatt hour range. Did you adjust that downwards in the backend of the gross margin outlook and to what extend?Christopher M. CraneBrian, I will speak for the past year in which, we\u2019ve come together as a Company. We\u2019ve been in the $2 to $4 and we have projected growth in our business based on gaining more market share and volume and seeing new customers come to market. We have dropped our projections of margin based on what we\u2019re seeing the market. We have to remain disciplined in that way and we\u2019re being disciplined about how low we will go on margins. So to that extend its going to impact our volumes as well. So we \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re up at that $5 range. We\u2019re in the $2 to $4 range and as I said previously, thinking lower end in the next couple of years, moving to the middle of that range in \u201915 and beyond.Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc.Great. Thanks. And then one last question on this, did you change your retail volume assumptions as well versus past disclosures and to what extend did you change them, if you did?Christopher M. CraneSo we did release retail volume assumptions in our original Analysts Day last year. We revised them at EEI and we will continue to provide you once a year a volume projection on the retail side. Obviously from a quarter-to-quarter perspective, we continue to look at what we\u2019re actually executing. But we expect to execute based on the margins and the environment and put that in our hedge disclosure.Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc.So then should I presume that since we have not gotten a volume update since EEI that volume disclosures given at EEI, the ones that are included in this margin outlook?Christopher M. CraneThat\u2019s just \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t assume that. As I said, we do update internally our volume assumptions. I\u2019d say we probably soften those volumes a little bit, but there is a long way to go this year in the buying season for retail. So we will just keep you updated quarter-to-quarter on that \u2013 in the hedge disclosure.Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc.I appreciate it. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne.Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLCHey. The retail supply business is one of supplying shaped full requirements product in a competitive environment, and it's not without risk as Gexa and others demonstrated in Texas a couple of summers ago. At a $2 margin which you think might persist for several quarters in a very competitive environment where there\u2019s going to be a temptation to win contracts at low prices. Do you feel that you\u2019re being compensated for the risk that you\u2019re taking, and if not, is there any adjustment to your longer term strategy?Christopher M. CraneSo Hugh, when we talk about our margins in the retail business we already build up our cost base that prices the risk you\u2019re talking about. And clearly as we\u2019ve seen this steady decline in power market that the separation between supply and demand, low volatility, there\u2019s potentially in the market an expectation that, that risk is lower than we think it otherwise could be particularly as you see units retire and volatility start to come in the deep season\u2019s again; so we priced that risk how we see it going forward, with our models, our projections and understand how the market is pricing it, and we remain disciplined in focusing on top of that. To the extent our competitors aren\u2019t doing that, there could be more risk in what they\u2019re selling.Joseph DominguezTo cover the optionality of the portfolio management too.Christopher M. CraneAnd our portfolio is second to none in terms of it's capability to handle this kind of obligation, this load serving business. We have substantial base load power as you know but we also have substantial intermediate and peaking assets that we quite frankly love to monetize in this load following product. The value of those assets is their capability to follow load and demand and deal with volatility in the marketplace, and to the extent we can\u2019t give that kind of pricing in the wholesale market in more simple product structures we like to sell it from a load perspective, and we are getting margin on top of that in our retail business. So, this retail business and that product is very important to us and we think we\u2019re very good at managing it.Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLCGreat, thanks. That\u2019s very helpful.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jay Dobson.Christopher M. CraneHi, Jay.Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities IncMaybe a question for Jack but it will probably fall to Ken as well. As you looked at the stress case and understand that was probably just a discrete point in time that you looked at it, as you looked at the overall portfolio, what did those stress levels indicate for sort of individual assets? And I guess I'm thinking more about the nuclear side but maybe across the portfolio, and I guess explicitly what I'm asking is, did it appear to put any assets at risk of retirement from economic basis if in fact that stress case persisted for some period of time?Christopher M. CraneThis is Chris. The evaluation was done on a fully basis not an asset basis, so it was a bottom-up on fleet basis. And again in that stress case, it's a low probability but that's why we call it the stress case. We're to address the question behind the behind. We continue to believe that our assets are some of the lowest cost, most dispatchable baseload asset and don't have any plans at this point of early shutdown on them.We'll continue to do an annual evaluation on our assets and if we see continued degradation or we saw issues where subsidized generation is continuing to cause us a problem, over development of wind is causing us a problem, surely we would have to take actions, but we do not see that at this point. We continue to fight.All initiatives that put them at risk and will be outspoken on that like the PTC or the issues that are driving us to want to do the MOPR or individual states thinking that creating jobs is a good thing by developing subsidized generation when it could have the effect eventually of shutting down one of these plants. But nothing that we see today would drive us to do that unless we see further degradation.Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities IncThat's great. Thanks Chris. And I guess the other side of that then talked a little bit about sort of growth, if in fact the environment improves, maybe outline for us sort of -- what that environment has to look like for you to start deploying more of that growth capital away from some of these contracted renewables and regulated investments in your portfolio?Christopher M. CraneWe need to see that $3 to $5 coming into the market which for us is about $1 billion in gross margin. That's a sure enough signal to say that the market is coming back, load growth is coming back or the market is tightening and we would want to take on those investments that potentially have a period of dilution but we can have a level of certainty to their contribution to earnings and free cash flow over the investment period. So, that's how I'm looking at it right now.Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities IncOkay, great. Thanks so much for the answers.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.].Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionHi, guys. Two questions, one high level, one maybe a little detailed. High-level question, when you look out and just trying to think about earnings, right, because that tends to be what drives stocks and drive sectors; at what point do you see a positive turn in earnings, meaning at what point do you think you grow again from just an earnings perspective? That's the first question. Second question, when you look at the planning parameters as well as the deficiency notice regarding MOPR that came out this week, just high-level views thinking about the PJM auctions?Christopher M. CraneLet me get Jack to handle the first part and Joe Dominguez who's in our Washington office will cover the second part.Jonathan W. ThayerSo, Michael, the answer to your question is highly dependent on what we do with the available cash flow, forward excess cash flow for redeployment. Obviously in the first couple of years, we have a number of maturities on the bond side that we would look to potentially retire and that's an element of our strengthening of the balance sheet and using the incremental proceeds from reducing the dividend to sure up that balance sheet, I think creates a long-term sustainable basis on which to invest for growth. And that's probably more of a '13, '14 phenomenon. We are creating now $700 million plus of incremental cash flow available for redeployment. And as we've discussed, depending on circumstances we can redeploy that in any number of ways. How we redeploy that, it's going to have a significant impact on when we turn the corner on earnings. Obviously if we\u2019re getting the $3 to $5 that Chris discussed, that too will have a material impact, given our sensitivity to power prices in that outer part of the curve as well. So, I think there\u2019s a lot of reasons for optimism around earnings growth based both on investment, but also long-term exposure to power prices.And then as Chris mentioned, there is the opportunity to perfect the regulatory environments in certain of our jurisdictions. Certainly we\u2019re presuming those activities in Illinois, in the ComEd territory. We have a rate case that should conclude here shortly in Maryland and a lot of positive steps have been made with regard to improving the dialogue with the commission there and with the state. And I think we\u2019ve a lot of opportunity on that side as well as transmission investments to really grow the contracted and regulated elements of our business. So, I guess to sum it up, it's not just the opportunity to grow earnings, but also the visibility and multiple associated with those earnings that ultimately are going to translate the value for your \u2013 for the shareholders you assist. Joe, you want to cover the second half?Joseph DominguezYeah, sure Chris. I am going to start off with the MOPR discussion and probably lean on Ken a little bit to talk a little bit about the planning parameters and what our expectations are for RPM. We were obviously expecting a decision this week from FERC and we did not get one. We got the deficiency letter instead, which asks some questions that really go to the heart, I think of this new MOPR that has been proposed by PJM. We still see a pathway to a resolution of that case before the auction. We've had a number of conversations with stakeholders and with PJM we think the questions that FERC has asked are going to be answered relatively quickly. I don\u2019t have a timeframe for that, but I think you\u2019re going to see a fairly, timely response by PJM.And as I said, I think we remain on a pathway to getting an answer before the auction and we remain of the view that the revised MOPR will be approved by FERC. And quite obviously we had hoped to have that well in advance, and I think we may see over the next couple of months this bifurcated process where PJM moves forward with the existing tariff and also plans for the revised tariff. That complicated their life, but I don\u2019t see anything about the deficiency letter as changing the path forward. And as I said, continue to see that being decided before the auction. Ken?Kenneth W. CornewSo, Michael, there are a lot of things that drive obviously what RPM results are, and they can move in different directions. I would say from a demand response perspective, we saw a constructive bidding behavior last year, I\u2019d expect to see that again. New generation wise there could be some new generation, and Joe mentioned the MOPR issue, but we would expect that potentially there is some new generation that shows up. Energy efficiency probably might actually go down because it's now related in the load forecast after a certain amount of time. And from a planning parameter perspective, what's most interesting to us is we do see the parameters indicating more constrained in the eastern zones, in the constrained capacity zones except for (indiscernible) we saw a little less constraint in the (indiscernible) zone. So, this auction from my perspective is kind of a plus minus from the last auction.Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionGot it, okay. And finally and this one\u2019s really for Chris, in some of your points you talked about wanting to grow some of the contracted businesses. I think you pointed out the regulated side, you pointed out renewables or other contracted assets. How does the M&A factor into that?Christopher M. CraneWe always are looking for opportunities, and we would be open to future opportunity. Our number one priority is completing the integration of our last merger and we should be up from the IT system side pretty well complete by the end of the year on a single platform not only in Jack\u2019s area in the financials, but in Ken\u2019s area in the trading arena. And when we know we've got everything managed right, we could do another one if something came along. But the day-to-day focus is on the organic growth.Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionGot it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Much appreciate it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith [UBS Investment Bank].Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment BankHi. Good morning.Christopher M. CraneGood morning.Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment BankFirst, a little bit of a follow-up on the free cash flow generation and sort of the flexibility you have. I'd just be curious, how much flexibility would you be willing to use kind of status quo as we stand today? You talked about $700 million before, but if I read between the lines that was versus the prior dividend, if you will; so how much today, if you will? And specifically what I was curious, you've discussed before retail and the need to backstop that, potentially with more peaking assets. I'd be curious given sort of your updated retail thoughts, do you still anticipate perhaps pursuing further peaking assets to backstop those opportunities, or at this point would that be a little bit off the table given updated volume expectations, et cetera?Christopher M. CraneLet me cover the second half of the question and I'll let Jack go back to the first. The portfolio right now that we have is matching -- the generation assets is matching the portfolio needs. Besides the Texas market, you really don't see any need in the marketplace to be developing any new assets. And we would probably look at a peaker if it came on the market, but it would have to go through the hurdles, as I talked about earlier. In the portfolio, folks would have to buy in that they could add value with it. So, you wouldn't put it off forever, but just don't see the conditions right now driving us to build or buy peaking assets. Jack, you want to\u2026Jonathan W. ThayerSure. So Julien, if I understand your question, obviously we'll be paying out at the current level the dividend for the first quarter. So there's about a $550 million improvement in cash flow in 2013 and that grows to $700 million on a full year basis throughout. What my comments were really specific too were, was the incremental capacity that's created from that reduction in dividend payout rate. And to the extent in the early years we're using that to retire existing debt as it matures and those in and of themselves can be highly accretive.As an example, we have a hybrid that matures in 2013 and we will be retiring that. That's an [8.58%] coupon. So obviously relative to today's current interest rate environment, that's obviously a very sad day for those holders, a very positive day for us. But to the extent that we utilize the opportunity to retire debt in the early part, strengthen the balance sheet and then turn that $700 million of excess cash capacity, as Chris mentioned, towards organic opportunities internally whether that be investment in renewable, investment in utilities or investment in other areas of the company. And we do believe that should be a meaningful driver of earnings throughout the five-year plan.Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment BankGreat. Just a quick follow-up. You talk about deploying cash a little bit more aggressively once you see the $3 to $5 or $3 to $6 upside. I'd be curious, we've heard some changes of late or potential changes in Illinois, state-specific standards. Does that change the timing at all when you think about when you get this upside, or is it still very much predicated on MATS 2015 kind of happening?Jonathan W. ThayerI think at this point I'd say we're -- while we believe that upside will materialize, if not currently baked into our long-range plans. To the extent it does, obviously that's incremental cash flow to redeploy, as Chris mentioned. And given that that would signal a rationalization of the merchant power market, could that orient towards merchant investments, as Chris discussed, that's an opportunity. But I think it's fair to say we have a lot of optionality around where we deploy our excess capital. As Chris mentioned in his remarks, we're in a broad array of the value chain within this sector and we look at a lot of opportunities and we\u2019re very selective and value oriented and have a good track record of investing at above hurdle rates and driving real free cash flow in earnings growth. So, I think we\u2019re quite excited by that opportunity.Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment BankGreat. Congrats.Ravi GantiOperator, that brings us to the end of the call. I think we\u2019re not taking anymore questions at this point.Christopher M. CraneOkay. Thanks everybody for joining the call. Any questions you can get hold of Ravi. I\u2019m glad to fill in any blanks. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"8591":["Exelon Corp.

My name is Kayla and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Exelon Corporation 2017 Q2 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference, sir.","Daniel L. Eggers - Exelon Corp.","Thank you, Kayla. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; Joe Dominguez, Executive Vice President, Government and Regulatory Affairs and Public Policy; and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call.","Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussion of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Thanks, Dan. And good morning and thank you, all, for joining us. We're pleased to deliver another good quarter. We achieved strong financial results, while continuing to enhance our operational performance and make significant gains on the policy front.","I'll begin by highlighting our financial performance and then briefly discuss some of the key policy and strategic objectives that are top of mind to many of you and us. Joe Dominguez will then cover in more detail the status of our recent wins in New York and Illinois, as well as our thoughts on potential PJM market reforms. Jack will walk you through the numbers.","As shown on slide 5, on a GAAP basis, in the second quarter, we earned $0.09 per share versus $0.29 last year. On an operating basis, we earned $0.54 per share versus $0.65 last year, which is near the top of our $0.45 to $0.55 guidance range. These are strong results relative to our expectations and led by ExGen.","Moving to slide 6. We continue to execute very well operationally with the second quarter extending some of the best-evers. On our color block chart shows key operating and customer satisfaction benchmarks for the utilities. Legacy Exelon Utilities again remained almost entirely in the first quartile, BGE and ComEd achieving first decile in CAIDI performance. BGE also delivered its best-ever SAIFI and CAIDI performance, and ComEd experienced its best-ever SAIFI performance.","And I'm proud to say that Pepco was identified in the J.D. Power study as one of the most improved utilities in customer satisfaction from 2016 to 2017. This is a great achievement and shows we are delivering on our commitments to our customers.","The scale of Exelon Utilities platform again significantly benefited our customers in the second quarter. We leveraged our management model and our geographic overlap to deliver better and faster service, particularly in the East. For example, in May, we dispatched Delmarva and PECO crews to assist BGE with the restoration of a multi-day natural gas outage that affected customers in West Baltimore.","The assistance provided by the other crews not only helped to reduce the outage time by a full day, but also allowed BGE to operate the balance of the system safely with a 100% gas odor response during the outage. We're glad to see our customers are benefiting from the Exelon Utility platform.","The nuclear team also had a great quarter. They achieved 90.9% capacity factor and completed six refueling outages. Nine Mile 1 registered its shortest outage duration on record.","In the power business, our assets performed well. Our two new Texas CCGTs, about 2,200 megawatts, are now online and fully operational. These plants are state-of-the-art and able to ramp up quickly to better serve the load that may come with the hot summer weather in Texas.","Moving to slide 7. We have seen several key developments in markets and regulatory matters. We had significant wins on the ZEC programs. As many of you already know, we prevailed on our motions to dismiss in both Illinois and New York, with both judges finding in favor on standing and legal merits.","These wins are strong affirmations of the ZEC program design. More importantly, these wins will support the continued operation of at-risk nuclear plants providing clean, affordable energy for our customers for many years to come. Needless to say, we are pleased with the results. Joe Dominguez will cover more of the details in a few minutes.","With respect to PHI, we wrapped up our first cycle of rate cases as part of Exelon with the DC order last week. Jack will discuss in more detail, but we're happy with the progress we're making at PHI operationally and on the regulatory front. We are pleased that in July the DC Court of Appeals affirmed the DC Commission approval of the PHI merger, resolving an open item.","PJM capacity results were announced on May 23 in all of our nuclear plants and PJM cleared the auction, except Quad Cities and Three Mile Island. The RPM results show considerable variability by year in the RTO zone. However, our disciplined bidding approach in recent years continues to provide greater stability in realized capacity revenues, which Jack will discuss shortly.","With Three Mile Island failing to clear PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive auction, we came to the difficult decision to close the plant in September of 2019 at the end of the next fuel cycle. A program that fairly compensates the plants for zero-emission energy, similar to what we have seen in New York and Illinois, is needed in order to continue operations.","It's important to note that the economic challenges facing TMI impact all nuclear plants in Pennsylvania. We remain hopeful that the state policymakers can find a solution that preserves these important assets. The total Pennsylvania nuclear fleet injects $2 billion into the state's economy each year and supports 1,600 direct and indirect jobs.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Dominguez, who will provide some details on ZEC challenges and other items.","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everybody. As Chris said, I'm going to cover the ZEC rulings, the current status of ZEC legislative efforts in other states, the DOE study, and PJM operational and market reforms.","Let me start with the court cases. Obviously, we're pleased with the decisions in the district courts. The Illinois District Court decision has been appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. We expect the New York Court's decision to be appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.","I want to make a couple of points about why we are very confident in the ultimate outcome of those cases. First, the district court decided these cases at a very preliminary stage, where as a legal matter the courts had to assume all of the facts that the plaintiffs pled were accurate. Those facts were not accurate. But even under the plaintiff's versions of the case, the courts found that they had no legal claim whatsoever.","Second, as you may know, often times where a party prevails in a case on a procedural or standing issue, the court will not proceed to decide the substantive legal issues. That wasn't the case here. In both decisions, the district courts rejected the entire waterfront of the plaintiff's claims through the substantive and procedural issues. I think that speaks to how high a hill they will need to climb on appeal to reverse those decisions.","At the heart of it, the decisions reject the plaintiff's arguments that state policies that favor cleaner sources of generation violate federal wholesale markets. The district court for the Southern District of New York summed it up this way. It said that competing generators have no complaint that they don't qualify for state programs because \"they made business decisions about how they generate electricity.\"","Policymakers and customers increasingly want reliable, low-cost, zero-emission electricity. That's what we do at Exelon. The ZEC policies begin to recognize that nuclear energy plays an important role in meeting those customer needs and we're going to continue to advance that argument in Pennsylvania and other states. We're actively developing coalitions and we're working with policymakers to educate them on the issues. And as Chris said, the issues don't just face TMI but the entire nuclear industry as a whole and the entire industry, of course, in Pennsylvania.","Let me be clear, we're not just working on ZEC issues. We don't think that's the only approach. We have said for a long time that we think that the best market outcome is to price attributes directly into the market in the case of greenhouse gases and price on carbon. And it's more clear to us now than ever that federal wholesale markets need to evolve to fully incorporate attributes like resiliency, fuel diversity, and environmental qualities of the generation resources.","If the markets don't evolve, then the markets are going to have a diminished role in energy policy going forward. I know that in the past we fielded questions on these calls about whether as a company we remain committed to markets. We are committed but the markets have to be well-functioning. Our commitment to markets only extends so far as it provides the best outcomes for our customers.","We have said for years that the markets have problems. Those problems are undisputed. We have had many workshops at FERC and other places talking about price formation as an example. Yet those issues have remained unresolved, and the consequence has been that some of the most valuable resources for our customers are being forced out by a market that hasn't been working. That's why we feel confident that the DOE study and a reconstituted quorum at FERC is going to address some of these longstanding issues.","Now, let me talk about the study and some of the PJM market reforms that I'm hinting at here. As you know, the study has been worked on for a number of months. Everybody wants to see it. We hope to see it at some point in time this month. We think that it is going to focus on baseload resources, on the critical role of nuclear and the critical role of other fuel sources that have resilient on-site fuel. We think that the DOE study is important because it will frame the objectives for the administration for the next four years and we think it's going to be an important signpost to inform the agenda at FERC.","Here's what we hope to see in the report. First, we want to see a recognition of the value of nuclear and an appreciation of the state programs in Illinois, New York and the other places that are going to adopt these programs.","Let me be specific. We expect the FERC to respect those programs and not to tamper with the functioning. There are a couple of MOPR complaints that need to be addressed. The ISOs do not support those complaints, but that is on the docket and ready for action by a new FERC. And we have talked to the Department of Energy about those issues and we've had productive conversations.","The second issue is that we need to look at the market design changes that have been long pending. As many of you know, PJM has recently put out a white paper on this issue, talking about energy price formation primarily in the off-peak hours, and the need for all forms of generation to be able to set price.","From our perspective, this is a very important issue, and we appreciate PJM's timeline which calls for a FERC filing sometime in the first quarter of 2018 and full implementation of the market reforms by the summer of 2018. We're going to push very hard to make sure that happens.","Third, we hope the Department of Energy puts a spotlight on the issue of resiliency. Let me spend a moment talking about that. We have talked about reliability in the form of being able to run the system even in the event that we have major electrical components that fail. But as increasingly the system depends on both intermittent generation and natural gas-fired generation that don't have the ability to secure fuel for long-term operations, we need to make sure that our customers get electricity even in the event of a long-term disruption of the natural gas pipeline system. That's something that currently is not being modeled and needs to be modeled.","So, PJM has recently put out a white paper on this subject with a schedule of activities. The first activity is to address operational reserves beginning this winter. Importantly, that doesn't require any FERC activity or any stakeholder support. That within the tariff is within PJM's full province. And again, we are pushing to make sure these things are done. That's an important start and should begin to be reflected in pricing this winter for baseload resources that provide the kind of resiliency that I'm talking about.","But that's not the end of this subject. We have to, as an industry and as a country, come to grips with this potential risk to our system and examine the possibility of multiple pipeline failures. And the policies that come from that should favor fuel generation sources that have on-site fuel, like nuclear plants, that could run for a year or two in the event of these emergencies.","So we're going to continue to focus on that, and those are really the three areas that we're hoping that the DOE will provide some guidance on. So, obviously, we have a lot going on in the policy space, we're making very good progress, but a lot of work remains to be done.","I'll look forward to taking your questions after Jack concludes his part of the presentation.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Great. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our second quarter results, an overview of our current rate cases, an update of our gross margin disclosures and a review of some of the key events that occurred this quarter.","On slide 9, as Chris mentioned earlier, we had a strong second quarter financially and operationally across the company. Our non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.54 per share, near the top of our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. Exelon's Utilities less HoldCo expenses delivered a combined $0.33 per share. Relative to plan, utility results were slightly favorable, primarily driven by O&M timing across all of the utilities.","Generation earned $0.22 per share in the second quarter. This was favorable versus the plan, driven by the timing of O&M and realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trusts. Our nuclear plants had another strong quarter with higher capacity factors than budgeted, and the Constellation team continued to deliver strong results with good customer wins.","Turning to slide 10. The $0.54 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2016. Overall, the utilities benefited from increased rates and higher rate base, partly offset by year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down year-over-year, primarily on the known impacts of lower power price realization and more planned refueling outages, partly offset by New York ZEC revenues.","On slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $1.19 per share are $0.14 per share lower than the same period last year. The decrease is primarily driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by the New York ZEC revenues, with partial offsets from our utilities with higher rates supporting our ongoing reliability investments and a full-year contribution from PHI.","Turning to slide 12, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance range of $2.50 to $2.80 per share. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share in the third quarter, compared with $0.91 per share last year. Our third quarter results will include a full quarter of contributions from the New York ZEC program that started on April 1.","In Illinois, the ZEC program went into effect on June 1, but the ICC has yet to conduct its ZEC procurement process. It's anticipated that the procurement events and the execution of contracts with winning ZEC suppliers will occur in the fourth quarter. Therefore, no revenues will be recognized until that process concludes. We would then include all of the Illinois ZEC revenues retroactive to June 1.","Moving to slide 13. Our utilities continued to execute, delivering strong earned returns in the quarter in addition to strong customer-focused operational performance. Looking at the trailing 12-month book ROEs, at PHI we saw some of the utilities register lower trailing ROEs relative to what we showed last quarter. The degradation was expected, primarily due to the timing of equity infusions that Exelon made into PHI in 2016 following the merger close.","For the legacy Exelon Utilities, our earned ROEs remain over 10%, lifting the consolidated Exelon Utilities platform to nearly 10%, including PHI. We still have work to do with the utilities to continue improving the product we're delivering to our customers, but we're happy with where the overall business is performing. As we've said before, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the plan that we put in place at PHI.","On slide 14, we updated the status of our rate cases. Since our first quarter call, the unanimous settlements in Delmarva, Delaware electric and gas cases were approved, with a combined revenue increase of $36 million. We also received a commission decision in the Pepco DC rate case during the quarter with a revenue increase of $37 million.","We've now completed our first cycle of planned rate cases in the PHI jurisdictions, with the second cycle already underway. We filed rate cases at ACE and Pepco Maryland last quarter, and just recently filed again at Delmarva Maryland during the second quarter. Combined, we are currently asking for $168 million in revenues, which reflect recovery on multiple years of capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions.","We expect the final ruling on Pepco Maryland in the fourth quarter of this year, and decisions on ACE and Delmarva Maryland in the first quarter of 2018. We plan to file second rate cases in the remaining PHI jurisdictions later in 2017, and expect to have them resolved by the end of 2018, helping to put us in a position to earn our targeted ROEs in 2019.","We're proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI's revenues and earned ROEs back on course, while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on slides 35 through 42 in the appendix.","Turning to slide 15. The PJM base residual auction results were announced in May. We cleared 16.2 gigawatts of capacity in the auction, with the bulk of our capacity clearing in the ComEd and Eastern MAAC zones, which cleared above the rest of RTO pricing at $188 per megawatt day.","We continue to follow a disciplined approach to bidding our plants based on their specific cost profiles. We believe this bidding discipline is the right strategy for our plants and has led to more stability in our capacity revenue streams than seen in other generators that have not been as disciplined.","Our Three Mile Island nuclear plant failed to clear in the PJM capacity auction for the third consecutive year with this auction. We've been losing both cash and earnings at the plant in recent years, and do not see a path to profitability as the market backdrop exists today. Accordingly, earlier in the quarter, we announced plans to retire the plant in the fall of 2019. We are engaged with stakeholders in Pennsylvania to find ways to preserve the plant, but we're still early in that process.","From a financial perspective, the closure will add $0.04 to $0.07 per share of EPS annually beyond 2019 depending on the refueling year. We expect to realize positive cumulative cash flows of approximately $225 million through 2021 with the closure.","Slide 16 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. In 2017, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter, we executed on $200 million of power new business and $50 million of non-power new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well-balanced on our generation to load matching strategy.","Total gross margin decreased in the second quarter by $150 million in 2018 due to the removal of EGTP from a portfolio as well as the impacts of lower capacity revenues in MISO and New York. Total gross margin in 2019 is down $150 million from last quarter, driven by the removal of EGTP from the portfolio and the forecasted closure of TMI in September of 2019.","Let me be clear that, although gross margin is down due to the divesture of EGTP and plant closure of TMI, the impacts of both are accretive to EPS and cash flow. The elimination of EGTP lowers gross margin by roughly $100 million in 2018 and 2019, but is EPS-accretive by $0.02 to $0.03 per share in each of those years. So there are cost offsets you should consider.","And while we do not expect to close TMI until the fall of 2019, the retirement lowers our 2019 gross margin by roughly $50 million, although the EPS impact is roughly $0.05 positive. And as I said earlier, the retirement will be $0.04 to $0.07 EPS-accretive annually beyond 2019 depending on the refueling year.","From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018, and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. The majority of our length is concentrated in the Midwest to align with our fundamental view of spot market upside in NiHub. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals.","Turning to slide 17. On the topic of power market forwards, you have heard us and many others talk about the reduced liquidity in the forward power curves that arguably can create price distortions. We do not mean for this chart to be comprehensive, but it's illustrative of what has been happening in the forward power markets.","The top chart shows the volumes created on a cumulative two- and five-year forward period for PJM West on peak power using a six-month average to smooth some of the seasonal volatility. I would flag in this context that overall volumes have been on a pretty consistent decline, both in absolute terms and particularly when looking beyond two years, which can be seen in the narrowing of the two lines on the chart. Arguably more interesting when thinking about forward power price transparency is the amount of transactions in those years.","Looking at the lower right chart, prompt year volumes are over 71% of the five-year cumulative volumes, with 2019 representing another 23%. The volumes created in 2020 and beyond are only 6% of the total volumes, with 2021 nearly non-existent. Compared to last year, total volumes are lower and the amount of volumes in the out-years is even less.","We wanted to share some of this data with you, particularly as folks were thinking more about the roll forward of 2020 earnings estimates. We would note that our fundamentals group has a more constructive view on power markets than these illiquid forward curves suggest, but we appreciate that there is perceived safety in using the forwards. However, when running your numbers, we would just encourage you all to appreciate what is underpinning those forward prices.","Turning to slide 18, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade rating. We have now removed EGTP from our credit metrics, which in turn has improved our consolidated net debt to EBITDA at year-end 2017 to 2.9 times, which is below our target of 3 times. If we focus only on recourse debt, our leverage is at 2.5 times EBITDA. We're pleased with the improvements in our balance sheet and we'll continue to focus on a combination of debt pay-down between ExGen and the holding company.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Chris.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Thanks, Jack. In closing, I'd like to remind you all that Exelon's success is a direct result of our people and the culture of performance and service that we've created as an organization. In June, we held our sixth Exelon Innovation Expo in Washington D.C. This annual event brings together employees, vendors, and other key stakeholders to share all the ways Exelon is working to embrace and advance the future of the energy industry. The expo is also an excellent opportunities for our employees across the company to share ideas, explore new technologies, drive collaboration, and push each other to do even better for our customers.","On slide 20, Exelon culture is also built on serving our communities, both externally and internally. We accomplished a lot on this front during the quarter and several awards really do stand out. First, Exelon is being added to the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which recognizes companies that spend over $1 billion with Tier 1 diverse and minority-owned suppliers.","In 2016, we spent nearly $2 million with these important partners. We are only one of 27 companies to be named to the roundtable, and the only utility or energy company. I especially want to thank Bill Von Hoene and Bridget Reidy for their leadership on expanding our supplier base to benefit our communities.","For the first time, Points of Light named us to the Civic 50, which recognizes the 50 most community-minded public and private companies in the United States. Our company strives everyday to better serve our communities, so this award is especially gratifying.","We're also named to DiversityInc's Top 50 Companies for Diversity, adding to our previous position as the best utility. We embrace diversity in all forms, so this represents an important distinction for our company.","On slide 21, the value proposition. We once again want to reiterate our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to the investors. We continue to grow the utility rate base at 6.5% annually through 2020 and regulated EPS by 6% to 8% annually through 2020, through capital investments that directly benefit our customers in each of our jurisdictions.","We continue to use the free cash flow generated at ExGen to fund incremental utility needs at the Utilities of $2.5 billion and pay down approximately $3 billion of debt over the next four years at ExGen and the holding companies.","We're focused on optimizing the value for our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans, and maximizing value through the gen-to-load matching strategy. We will continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics and growing our dividend in a consistent, visible manner.","So I'd like to thank you, all, for joining again and for your interest. And now, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I think you covered this in the script, but I just wanted to make sure I heard it clearly. You went through the puts and takes associated with the changes in the gross margin outlook. And despite it being lower, a lot of that is coming from assets that are removed from the portfolio. And then there's obviously offsetting costs below the line that make that cash and earnings accretive.","So you don't have the slide in your deck, but you've periodically put it in the slide that shows the 2017 to 2020 ExGen free cash flow profile. Should I presume that you're still on track to generate enough cash to create the $2.8 billion to $3.2 billion in ExGen\/HoldCo debt reduction that you've articulated?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Yes.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Greg, we've been \u2013 yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then my second question is, given that how much you've improved your debt to EBITDA, both on a recourse and non-recourse basis, I know that you've talked about thinking about pivoting from ExGen debt reduction to parent debt reduction. But there's also a point in time here in the future where I think you guys were going to revisit the board with a conversation about the dividend growth rate.","So, given that you seem to be ahead of schedule on achieving your debt reduction goals, can you give us an update on how you're contemplating the conversation around the dividend to evolve?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","So, as we've discussed in previous calls, we gave you a three-year window, a three-year look on our dividend and the annual increase. We'll be in discussion with the board through the next couple of board meetings on what our continued dividend strategy would be for a period of time. We'd like to give you a three- to five-year look ahead and that would be timed somewhere around in the first quarter, as the board deliberates on that.","So we are balancing, looking at (32:27) the strong balance sheet, any drag from interest expense at the HoldCo, the value that we can create through either dividend increase or debt reduction. It's top of mind and going through the analysis phase right now, and hope we'll be able to give you positive news very soon.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. One final question. From time-to-time, investors contemplate with a greater or lesser degree of certitude the thought process around whether you guys would ever consider splitting ExGen from the Utility business and under what circumstances that would be appropriate? And I guess, the water cooler talk around that, frankly, went up demonstrably after the successful floatation of Vistra on the New York Stock Exchange and the valuation at which they're trading.","Can you talk about how you think about and contemplate sort of significant long-term changes in strategy like that and whether that is, in fact, something that would be now an increased probability, given the facts as they lay today?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. I wouldn't say there's an increased probability. As you would imagine, we need to look at our business strategy on some routine basis, as we do. We look at the combination of the ExGen and the Utility business right now, and our capabilities, while maintaining strong balance sheets, be able to do significant investment for our customers around reliability and innovation on the Utilities. So, having a free cash flow machine that's being given more certainty on its capabilities by programs like the ZEC and the fantastic work that Constellation achieves through the margins that they create, we like what we're doing right now.","What we have said in the past is we believe that we're undervalued and that we need to be seeing that value increase in the market as we make these accomplishments. We felt we're at a prove-me (34:51) state on PHI that not only do we have to integrate them successfully into our management model and drive the performance to our operational standards that we've set at the other Exelon utilities, but also achieve what is a fair and reasonable recovery on rate cases. And we're executing on that now. And I think we're proving ourselves. And we think that that should be translated into a more reasonable valuation not only at the Utility level, but at the ExGen level.","So we'll strive to continue to really achieve some lofty goals and secure what we think is solid revenues and be able to reinvest those revenues into creating greater returns for the investors.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Hey, Jon.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, Greg asked one of my questions, the strategy question. But if I could just \u2013 is there a timeframe, Chris, on when you would want to see that sort of realization and validation of your strategy and value? What sort of timeframe would you kind of want to succeed by before you'd consider an alternative?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. I think, Jonathan, we're seeing it this year. You can see that the stock is starting to perform better, which reflects a better valuation. We think there's more room to grow over the next year to two years, as our programs are solidified around the nuclear assets and new potential programs are put in place around price formation and other value-creating mechanisms.","The multiple that we see at the Genco should improve. We differentiate our sales from any other merchant generator with not only the class of assets we have, but the programs that recognize those class of assets. So we should see those come to strong fruition over the next year to two, and we'd like to see the compensation for it.","We also believe that we're doing a really great job on what we've committed to to the customers around reliability and service at all our utilities and gaining fair returns. Catching up a little bit on the PHI utilities in productive rate cases should also be a catalyst for achieving a better multiple on the EPS. So, next couple of years, we should be where we want to be at.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So is it fair to say that P\/E multiple is your main yardstick, then, you're looking at in terms of determining whether you've closed the gap to your satisfaction?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Well, as you do, we do a sum of the parts and look at the valuations and look at where we think we should be. That is one of the indicators. But the EBITDA multiple on the Genco is also a key indicator for us.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. And just on one smaller item. It looked like the financing needs at ExGen versus last quarter for this year came down about $300 million. Is that to do with asset sale or something else, what's driving that change? The cash flows...","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","It's the proceeds from the joint venture.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But the number is lower, though, Jack, is the...","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","We had a tax gain on the sale.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I got it. Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Couple quick questions. The comments on 2020 and the forwards, I guess we'll see in time, but just in the event that your fundamentals are wrong and the forwards are right, is there more that the company can do on costs and the like to deal with that?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Steve, it's Jack. We have a long history of being proactive on costs. And our cost reduction programs are just generally part of our corporate DNA. So, over the past five years, we've saved $500 million of synergies from the Constellation merger, another $75 million from the integration of CENG. $350 million of cost reductions from our November 2015 program, another $125 million of savings from the November 2016 program, and we're on target for $130 million of synergies from the PHI deal.","And just from a philosophical standpoint, we manage our business for the worst, Steve, while expecting a better outcome. And you can and should expect us to continue focusing on opportunities to run our business more efficiently and pull out additional costs.","We view cost management as incremental each year and building on what we've already done rather than a big one-time transformative event. Our regular increases in cost savings opportunities we think have added up to real economic value, and you should continue to see us focus on continuous improvement and driving further savings in the future.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Good. And then, just on the PJM market structure changes, any sense on what they could possibly do to market pricing? Like, how much they could impact market?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Joe?","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. Steve, we're not there yet. We're evaluating that, but we need some more details out of PJM around the program design. I think, as a general matter, you'll see some improvement in around-the-clock energy, specifically off-peak. And you'll see some benefits for the consumer on the capacity market side as those prices ought to go down.","But for machines that drive most of their revenue in the energy market like the nuclear machines, this will be a good outcome and we'll be supportive of keeping those lowest cost options available for our customers long-term.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. One final question, I guess, maybe for Chris. Just with the announcement earlier this week of the summer shutdown or abandonment, I'm just curious kind of from a nuclear support overall, does this better make your case of supporting existing nuclear or does it somehow make the other case that this is going to phase out over time anyway? Just thoughts there.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","No, I think there are two different issues. One, it's not good for the industry to have the next wave of plants go through financial stress and the mismanagement by the suppliers to the industry. That is unfortunate. And we understand the decision that's been made to not go forward with the risks that they still have around it and the financial burdens that it would create for their customers. So, that's one thing.","If you look at what we're talking about with our nuclear assets, they are definitely providing a product and a service unlike any other generating assets, not only is it the reliability that we load a core for 18 to 24 months and they can run through any weather cycle and are not dependent on a fuel delivery that allows a baseload generation, a level of reliability to the system.","The compensation that should be sought and granted for their environmental benefits to the communities they serve. An example of Illinois' power stack, 60% of the power in Illinois is carbon-free. 90% of that comes from the nuclear facilities. It allows the state to make its goals that it wants to make on carbon reduction. And without these assets being fairly compensated, that would go in the opposite direction.","And finally, these assets that do provide the societal benefit around carbon and the societal benefit around reliability and sustainable national security, they also are great economic supporters of the communities they serve, the tax bases for the schools, the parks, the employment base. So, on many levels, they've been evaluated as critical and should be compensated for the lifespan that they have remaining to provide a bridge to what could be that source of energy that provides that same level of the great attributes going forward.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Morning.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Morning. So, looking on the ZEC, has the win in New York and Illinois help set the framework or ease the discussion with other states, as in are you having more productive conversations given the legal win?","And secondly, I guess linked with that, if it does roll out in other states over time, how do you think about capital allocation at that point, given you've already kind of hit your metrics from a credit perspective at ExGen with the current plan? Is it more just de-leveraging at the parent company or what else do you think in terms of capital allocation?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","I'll let Joe cover the first part and Jack can go through our plans on the second part.","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","Yeah, I think the answer to the first part is yes. It does provide a bit of a catalyst for better discussions in other states. One of the themes that the opponents often roll at is that these policies have questionable legal merit. And so they talk to politicians and they say, why would you take a tough vote on this only to have it overturned in the court.","So these decisions resolve that issue and we expect, as these decisions get solidified in the appellate courts, that it'll provide additional catalysts for those discussions in other states.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","And then, Praful, just in terms of capital allocation, as you mentioned, our balance sheet is in a stronger position this quarter than it was last quarter. We're effectively at the target that we set in the fall of last year. And what that allows us to do is much greater flexibility on where we focus our debt retirement plan.","So I think you'll see us, depending on maturities, look at both the holding company as well as ExGen for future retirements. And it obviously gives us a much greater degree of visibility and certainty around those cash flows, which I think plays into Chris's response on the valuation. We would expect that the valuation metrics for our generation company reflect the reduced volatility that's associated with these important assets.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. But then, after the debt reduction targets are hit at the HoldCo, from either buyback or even dividend perspective, is that on the table as well?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","I'd say we have plenty of holding company debt to retire and that provides us with considerable flexibility, and it's one of the items we'll be looking at, as Chris mentioned, in our review with the board of the outlook for the company and its strategic plan around dividend and other capital allocation decisions.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. And secondly, just the interesting slide you provided on the market liquidity and what that means in terms of forward curve, does that also mean that acquiring more retail footprint or a larger retail footprint is a good way to mitigate some of those liquidity risks, given forward curves are just not there and you need to hedge? Or do you think this will just play out with spot prices being higher than forward curves over time?","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Praful, good morning. It's Joe Nigro. It does imply that the best way for us to get to market with our generation is through our load serving business. As you know, we have a very substantial commercial, industrial and residential business, and that we also participate in all the wholesale load serving auctions, and we'll continue to do that.","And our portfolio of output on the generation side is well-balanced with our power load portfolio. And we use the standard product market to what I would call filling gaps geographically or for timing or other things. But the balance with our gen-to-load matching strategy is very strong and we'll continue to do that.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. So you don't need incremental retail at this point. What you have already is fully matched is what you think.","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","If we see an opportunity and it makes economic sense, I think you've seen in the past with the acquisitions of both Integrys as well as ConEd, they've been value enhancing to the bottom line and we've been disciplined in how we'll do it and we'll continue to take that approach. And if there's an opportunity in the future to bolt-on more retail, it'd be a good fit for our portfolio, we would definitely do that.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys. Hey. Just to follow up a couple of earlier questions. Could ExGen be spun just publicly, even a small amount of it, just to establish that independent validation evaluation, and while still enabling you to benefit from its cash flows and other innovation benefits at the Utilities?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","We'd have to think through that one. Right now, we have a very solid strategy on growth and value creation with the ExGen cash flows. So it differentiates us and we're not issuing equity at the holding company to support this growth. There's no dilution coming in with this growth. It is very strong organic growth. We're adding another PHI over the next couple of years without paying a premium.","So, in Q2, want to validate its value by spinning it off would not be probably the approach that we would go for. If we ever found that the value is constrained or our strategic growth was hampered based off of the companies being together, you could have that conversation to create value. But there's no reason that having them together and using the synergies that we have between having the two companies, that we shouldn't be valued fairly for that as we execute on our strategic plan.","So, could you physically possibly spin a Genco? You could, and then you'd have to consider when you did that what's its investment grade, what's the impediment on its trading business, what's the issue with going to the capital markets to maintain your nuclear plant, all kinds of hair around that.","But we like what we're doing right now. We like the way that we're creating the value. And we think we are differentiating ourselves, as I've said, from any other merchant generator in the business. Strong balance sheets, different class of assets, fairly \u2013 very well run, and fairly matched to our load book.","So we like where we're at and wouldn't speculate on anything else, and really can see the value creation and want the market to recognize it as we do execute on what we say. We tell you we're going do something, we do it, and it comes in in value creation to you.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And also, just to clarify on Jack's earlier remarks, with ExGen's projected gross margins a bit lower in the forward curve and also from the removal of other assets, the offset that allows you to achieve $3 billion of debt pay-down, that that target has not been changed, it's mostly efficiencies, cost savings, and that kind of thing?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","It hasn't been changed.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","It's cash flow-positive, the retirement of TMI.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Yeah.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","It's...","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","$225 million through 2021. With EGTP, we have the debt \u2013 what's that?","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","JV.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","All right. And we have the proceeds from the renewables JV. Where EGTP is $0.02 to $0.03 accretive, TMI is $0.04 to $0.07 accretive. So I think we're very comfortable with our outlook for free cash flow. And we'd expect to update the number that we provide in the Q4 call in next year.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Morning, guys.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Hey, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, most of my questions were answered. But let me ask, what's sort of the viability within your long-term plans around Colorado Bend and Wolf Hollow, especially given the fact that you're doing much more contracted cash flows at ExGen? Is there an opportunity to either look to hedge these out with the munis or sell it to other IPPs?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","These are assets that are unlike the rest of the stack in Texas with their efficiency, their flexibility on ramping. They do provide a good support to our load book. We built them from way below what market costs are for greenfield sites or even brownfield sites, with our work through our venture with GE and our contractors. So they were built at a good price. They operate very well. We do have a load book in Texas that they serve well. And there's no need, as you can see from our debt metrics, for a fire sale.","So our origination folks are constantly looking at longer-term contract sales, and they'll be doing that as they continue in Texas and match some of the book that we have to those potentials.","So, Joe can add any more onto that.","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","No, I think you covered it, Chris. I think the big thing is, when you think about what we're doing with the disposition of the assets we currently own in EGTP, the fill-in of these two assets to our load book is very helpful when you think about the volatility in Texas and you think about ancillary services and how these units are able to ramp in such quick rates. I think it's a very nice fit.","And from an origination perspective, as Chris said, we look at all corners of the market and we serve all types of customers and we're open to all opportunities. and we'll continue to explore those, especially with these two new state-of-the-art assets.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And then, Joe, might as well just ask you is, with the pending potential policy initiatives in Pennsylvania, and obviously made some great headwinds in Illinois and New York, how are you sort of thinking about you layering on hedges in Pennsylvania pending potential legislation that may come about?","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. We think about that a lot, and we've talked quite a bit about how we run our hedging program. It's not an independent decision. We work very closely with all the finance organizations, the risk management organization. And we have a program where we're looking at the needs of the cash flows and the earnings of the company, and we match our hedging profile to that, and make sure that we can maintain the credit ratings that we have and we focus on our liquidity. And all of those things put together drive some of the decisions with our program.","As you can tell, looking at our numbers, we're well behind our ratable hedging plan in both 2018 and 2019, and you could see that's the case in the Midwest and that's the case in Texas as well. And it aligns to our market views. But those aren't independent decisions. They're tied in directly with what we're doing with debt reduction and managing our balance sheet, and we will continue to do that.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Terrific. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. So, one more question about the retail book. So I understand that this is a preferred way of hedging your generation portfolio, but most of your retail book is C&I and those are sophisticated customers who basically look at the forward curve and then add probably a margin to what they see in the curve. So, that wouldn't necessarily help you with the forward curve not fully reflecting supply and demand fundamentals. So, how about shifting maybe towards mass retail customers or increasing your presence in that business?","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","We are the fifth largest residential marketer in the country now on the power side, and we will continue to focus on growing that business, similar to the way we're continuing to focus to grow our commercial industrial business.","Like C&I marketing, it is a competitive market and you have headroom that you have to take into account and customer behavior. But we continue to focus on all of that and our mass market business continues to grow each year and we've been very successful on that regard and we'll continue to push it.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","With reasonable margins.","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Absolutely.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","The discipline that's required to continue to grow in residential versus some competitors that may not have the same pricing margin, we don't need to chase volume, we chase margin.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And the second question is about your disclosures for ExGen. So, obviously, as you're pointing out with retirements or deconsolidations of your gas plants in Texas, there's an offsetting change in O&M. Why not show EBITDA projections instead of gross margin? Just to capture that O&M production which would then fully show the financial backdrop that the business has?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","So, Angie, we think we give you transparency into the operating costs of the company. We update that on an annual basis at the beginning of any given year. And you can back into effectively the operating costs of EGTP and TMI with the EPS disclosure that we give you. And then, I guess, finally, we give you some incremental data on slide 33 that also should help you.","So I think we're very comfortable with the gross margin disclosures that we have. It allows us to update it on a quarterly basis without having to update the entirety of the income statement, and that's the plan going forward.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Well, I'd like to thank you, all, for your interest in joining us today on the earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at the fall conferences and hear your questions on the earnings call in November. So, thank you very much and that will end the call.","Operator","This is the end of today's call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."],"8586":["Exelon Corp.

[Operator Instructions].","Thank you, I will now turn the conference over to Francis Idehen. Please go ahead.","Francis Idehen","Thank you Dushyanta. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2015 earnings call.","Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; Joe Nigro, CEO of Constellation; and Jack Thayer, Chief Financial Officer. We are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.","Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material, comments made during this call, and in the risk factors section on the 10-K which we filed in February, as well as in the earnings release and the 10-Q, which we expect to file later today.","Please refer to the 10-K, today's 8-K and 10-Q, and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations.

We've scheduled one hour for today's call.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Christopher Crane","Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. We're pleased to deliver another very strong and what's been a very good year for us thus far. First, I'll highlight our financial and operational performance and then I'll switch over to our key strategic objectives.","On the financial front we're reporting operating earnings of $0.83 per share over 6% EPS growth versus the same period last year and above our guidance range. Despite the delays in closing PHI which I'll address further, we're still on track to deliver our best year of earnings since 2012. We are raising our guidance range to 240 to 260 and Jack will provide more details on the financial performance during his remarks.","It's been a phenomenal year across our companies. At the utilities we're set to invest $3.7 billion this year and needed infrastructure and enhancements and grid reliability and resiliency modifications. Part of more than the $16 billion investment that's planned over the next five years. This includes our smart meter installation program which we now have completed nearly 5.5 million gas and electric installations across our operating companies. Our utilities will exceed $1 billion in net income in 2015, driven by industry leading operational performance with each utility achieving first quartile safety, first and second quartile safety results and ranking in first quartile in customer satisfaction. We reached the settlement at PECO in its recent rate case filing which follows the BGE recent unanimous rate case settlement in Maryland. This highlights how strong operational performance supports recovery and constructive regulatory environments.","On the generation side of the business we had another solid quarter of operations performance. Nuclear capacity factor was 95.5, power dispatch match was 99%, renewable energy captures was 94.8%. We also had great execution in Constellation this quarter showing the value of our generation to lower matching strategy. And our ability to optimize our portfolio even during adverse market conditions in a way that contributes meaningfully to our earnings.","The breadth of the consolation platform gives us multiple scales to market. We are the number one retail electric provider and well ahead of our nearest competitor. We serve nearly 200 kilowatt hours of wholesale and retail load and we are also a top 10 marketer of gas in the U.S. delivering 46 Bcf of gas daily. On both side of the company we continue to run the business at high levels of performance and the results are evident in this year\u2019s earnings.","Now I want to discuss three key initiatives we have been working on this year, capacity performance, the low carbon portfolio standard in the Pepco Holdings merger. Starting with capacity performance, PJM capacity performance design went at implementation this year\u2019s auctions with constructive results. We are pleased with the outcome of the capacity auctions. The new penalty structural hold generators accountable reliability to the benefit of customers.","For the 1819 auction we cleared a significant number of megawatts at higher price zones that in these prices exceeded at our own internal expectations. The transition auctions better reflect the value of the reliability of our nuclear units that they provide to the grid. Our next major initiative was getting a low power portfolio standard past.","We came into the year advocating for a better market design in Illinois one that would level the playing field for nuclear energy as a key resource in the state. We worked hard to introduce the carbon standard earlier this year however the political situation in the state has made the budget the soul focus leaving little opportunity for progress on energy legislation.","We are disappointed that we have not made a progress on this front however the overall outlook for the nuclear fleet has improved as a result of policy and market factors namely the constructive results of the capacity auction, the positive results from Illinois power agencies capacity procurement for 2016, the long term impact on the environmental protection agency\u2019s new carbon reduction rules.","As a result we have decided as announced to defer another year\u2019s decision about the future quad [ph] having said that, the low carbon portfolio standard remains a good policy for Illinois and a priority for Illinois. On our last key initiative was the Pepco acquisition. Let me take time to share our perspective on where we're at with the deal. We are very excited we reached the settlement with the Government of the District of Colombia, the Office of People\u2019s Council, the Office of the Attorney General and others in D.C.","The settlement includes commitments to provide a substantially enhanced benefits to the consumer and businesses in the district, it includes bill credits, low income assistance and fewer and shorter outages, a clear greener D.C. and investment in local jobs in the local economy. The settlement package was specifically shaped to address the concerns articulated by the D.C. Public Service Commission in its August quarter.","As you\u2019ve seen we have improved the reliability and the customer satisfaction at BGE and see the benefits of those performance improvements reflected in regulatory outcomes. We look forward to the opportunity to do the same with the Pepco family of utilities. The deal remains an important strategic element to the future of excellent allowing us to shift our business mix to a more regulated and durable earning stream.","We realize the deal has taken longer than expected and we know that is required patience for many parties especially our investors as we work to complete it. We received an order from the D.C. Public Service Commission two days ago that moves us in the right direction. The Commission granted our request to reopen the record and consider the settlement in the existing doc, a schedule that was set that is in line with our proposed timeline. And the commission is committed to consider the settlement in a fashion that is open, transparent and fair. We appreciate the commission\u2019s commitment to ruling on the merger in a timely manner and we ask for your support as we get this across the finish line. It has been a busy year and we've accomplished a lot and there is a lot left to be done.","In particular we're embarking on a large scale cost management initiative. We'll provide more details at the EEI financial conference. We are pleased with the performance we've delivered for the shareholders this year despite the significant market and regulatory headwinds as we always were working hard to serve our customers and the communities that where we serve better.","I'll now turn the call over to Joe, who will discuss the markets.","Joseph Nigro","Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. The Constellation business had another strong quarter outperforming our targets. Our portfolio management team performed very well and as Chris mentioned our retail and wholesale business is having a very strong year.","In addition, our core strategy of matching our generation fleet with our load business continues to provide significant value for our shareholders. It has been paying off across the volatility and price spectrum. We have captured higher prices for our generation during periods of extreme weather while managing our load obligations and we've captured higher margins during low volatility period like this summer as we've realized lower cost to serve our customers. It also provides us with an important channel to market for our hedging activities which is important in times of low liquidity and in places where there is not an active market.","Our past results and our current hedge disclosure show that our business can drive in either market environment and provide a great deal of value to the enterprise. My comments today will focus on power and gas markets during the quarter and our fundamental view. The recent PJM capacity performance auction and our hedge disclosures in hedging activity.","Turning to the power markets on slide four. NiHub remains undervalued even independent of gas prices. PJM West price is more fairly valued when accounting for the new generation underdevelopment and expected in the East. Our fundamental view of power prices remained unchanged in addition we especially see upside in the non-winter months and during off peak hours.","The difference between our fundamental view and the near term forward market prices of NiHub is primarily driven by changes in dispatch stat [ph]. Additionally fuel and coal markets are in contango while power is backwardated which is unusual. We think this is also contributing to lower prices in our views with support.","During this summer, the impacts of a change in the stack were massed across the power pool because we did not see the peak loads that were expected and delivered natural gas prices were extremely low. While we saw price rebates [ph] continue to deliver high, the absolute price was driven lower by steel price [ph].","If we extended this picture on this slide further out in the curve you would see an even greater disconnect between the forward curve and our fundamental view driven mostly by a lack of liquidity. This lack of liquidity at NiHub is in most years and we are seeing it in West Southern 2019 and beyond in particular. Because it is lack of liquidity our hedging activity is mostly continued to be down for our load business and not over the calendar markets.","We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views of the market and in 2017 remain behind ratable with 6% to 9% of power exposure. We are even further behind ratable in the Midwest with power exposure 17% to 20%. This strategy exposes us to the significant upside we still see in that market. While partially protecting us for many further degradation of natural gas prices through our cross commodity hedging.","Before turning to the hedge disclosure itself, I'd like to touch on the recent PJM capacity auctions. Chris covered the results of the auction a few minutes ago. So I'll focus on the key takeaways from the auction. The biggest impact was getting behavior. In the 1819 base residual auction and the transition auction we saw market participants bidding in a more disciplined manner and recognizing the risks with penalties for non-performance. In addition about half the new builds cleared versus what we saw in the 1718 auction.","And finally, the vast majority of demand response clearly the base product which may have read through value as PJM transitions to 100% capacity for performance product in two years. As I mentioned earlier our load business remain solid. Our originations have been strong and our generation to load matching strategy has worked well throughout the year. You can see the impact of this strategy throughout the gross margin disclosures. In 2015 we have a net $200 million increase in total gross margins since the end of the second quarter. We started the third quarter with a $100 million power new business target remaining for the year. We had strong performance during the quarter executing 200 million in power new business with the majority realized in the quarter.","As a result of this performance we raised our power new business target by a $150 million resulting in only $50 million of power new business to go from the fourth quarter. Our performance was driven by our generation to load matching strategy including a load across to serve our load across the portfolio and our position management activity showed by through the backstop of our generation.","As an example [indiscernible] experience quite a bit heat in early August and we saw the reserve margins in ERCOT come in as much as 10% lower than projected on those days. Spot prices increased and we benefited in capturing value from this move. As a result, we are also seeing upward movement in ERCOT pricing in the forward curve.","In 2016, the impact of capacity performance auction increased total gross margin by $150 million this was partially offset by market price decline net of hedges of 50 million. During the quarter we executed on a $150 million of new business and are raising our 2016 power new business target by $200 million to $500 million total remaining. This compares to a $400 million new business target to go for 2015 at the same point last year. We are confident we can make this new target next year given our performance this year and the addition of the Integrys acquisition. Our total gross margin increased by 200 million to $7.8 billion.","Capacity performance results added 300 million to total gross margin which was partially offset by a $100 million decrease due to the impact of lower prices on our open generation net of hedging. During the quarter we executed $100 million in power new business. We are confident that we have the right hedging strategies to capture the upside we see coming in the market and we have proven that our generation to load matching strategy brings value in both low the high volatility environments.","I'll now turn it over to Jack to discuss the financial results for the quarter.","Jonathan Thayer","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Chris and Joe stated we had another strong quarter financially and operationally. My remarks will focus on our financial results for the quarter, our full year guidance range, and provide an update on our cash outlook for 2015.","Starting with our third quarter results on slide six, Exelon delivered earnings of $0.83 per share exceeding our guidance range by $0.08. This compares to $0.78 per share for the third quarter of 2014. Exelon's Utilities delivered combined earnings of $0.33 per share outperforming the third quarter of last year by $0.04.","During the quarter, we saw favorable weather at both PECO and ComEd. Cooling degree days were up 30% from the prior year and 28% above normal in Southeastern Pennsylvania and up 18% from the prior year and 3% above normal in Northern Illinois.","Distribution revenues at both ComEd and BGE were higher quarter-over-quarter reflecting the impacts of increased capital investment and higher rates respectively. On September 10th, PECO reached a settlement on its rate case filing. They agreed upon revenue requirement increase of $127 million represent 67% of the original proposal. The Pennsylvania PUCs decision is expected in December of this year with rates going into effect on January 1, 2016. The Pennsylvania PUC recently approved the new system 2020 plan which will lead to an additional $275 million being invested during the next five years to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to storm damage.","An order on commence annual formula rate filing is expected to issue by the ICC in early to mid-December. As a reminder ComEd requested a revenue decrease of $55 million in its current filing. This reduction reflects the continued focus on cost management and operational efficiencies that are being realized from a stronger more reliable grade with fewer outages. More detail on each of these rate cases can be found in the appendix on slides 19 through 21.","Turning to slide [ph] generation, it had another strong quarter delivering earnings of $0.55 per share, $0.05 higher than the same period last year. As Joe mentioned, our generation to load matching strategy continues to provide value for our business and our shareholders. We benefited from a lower comp to serve both our retail and wholesale customers and had another strong quarter of performance from our portfolio management team.","In addition, compared to the third quarter of 2014, we had a positive contribution from the Integrys acquisition. These positive factors were partially offset by realized Nuclear Decommissioning Trust fund losses in 2015 as compared to gains in 2014 and the impacts of the divestitures of certain generating assets in 2014.","Last week, we filed a settlement agreement with New York PSC and FERC in regards to our Guinea [ph] facility. The new agreement shortens the RSSA period by 18 months includes more market based revenue and requires that any expansion must be justified by a study. The settlement is still subject to approval by both the FERC and the New York PSC. While we are pleased with the negotiated RSSA will allow Guinea [ph] continue to powering the grid in the local economy until 2017 it's only a temporary solution to a long-term problem.","Single unit nuclear facilities like Guinea [ph] faced significant economic challenges brought on by four market conditions and a lack of energy policies that properly value the clean and reliable energy that nuclear provides. More detail on the quarter-over-quarter drivers for each operating company to be found on slide 17 and 18 in the appendix.","As Chris mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance range for earnings to $2.40 to $2.60 per share. At the beginning of the year, we provided a standalone guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. We narrow the range on our second quarter earnings call to $2.35 to $2.55. This guidance range included the impacts of the debt and share dilution from the PHI merger and assume that the merger would close during the third quarter.","Since the merger did not close, we have $0.13 of earnings drag from the interest expense and share dilution. Without this drag, we would have expected full year earnings to exceed the top end of our new guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share due to strong performance of both the Utilities and Constellation this year. Consistent with our past practice, our guidance range does not include the impact of an extension of bonus depreciation which we would expect to be around $0.08 decrease per share.","Nonetheless, we are comfortable that we will still be in the guidance range even if bonus depreciation were to be extended.","Turning back to Pepco for a minute. We will need our original deal case accretion of $0.15 to $0.20. However, it will be push back until 2019. In addition, we expect the impacts in the merger to be neutral in 2017 and $0.07 to $0.12 accretive in 2018. These changes are primarily due to the delay in closing the merger, the consequent updates to PHI\u2019s business plan as a result of this delay and due to the meaningful improvement in Exelon's business plan. The deal remains critically important to our long-term strategy.","Slide seven provides an update on our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of $6.8 billion across our businesses and free cash flow of $925 million at generation in 2015. As you can see our projected earnings cash balance is roughly $9.6 billion for the year, most of this is related to the fact that we\u2019ve raised the funds necessary to close the Pepco merger which as you know has been delayed.","$2.5 billion of the debt was subject to redemption if the merger does not close by December 31st. Yesterday we announced the debt exchange offering to amend the mandatory redemption date in those notes. This action will minimize our refinancing risk and allow our bondholders to stay invested in the bonds and year end approaches.","In closing, I want to reiterate that our company can perform well in a rising interest rate environment which is typically a headwind for our industry. This is because our earnings are positively correlated to interest rates due to both comments ROE being directly tied to the 30 year treasury rate as well as the discounting of our pension liabilities.","As a general rule, every 25 basis point increase in interest rates equates to roughly $0.02 of consolidated earnings uplift related to ComEd in the pension.","Thank you and we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers","Just Jack taking a before you left off on the Pepco accretion numbers. You guys are going to have $0.13 of drag because of the equity and the debt associated with the acquisition. If we look at '16, how much of that $0.13 gets offset I guess on a year-over-year base if we're to step forward one year.","Jonathan Thayer","Dan we would anticipate that the transaction would close towards the end of the first quarter and the transaction will be modestly diluted to --.","Dan Eggers","Including $0.13 or net of the $0.13?","Jonathan Thayer","Including the impact of the shares and debt issue, so it inclusive of that $0.13 expense associated with interest and increase shares.","Dan Eggers","Okay. If I go I guess next question. On the Constellation side with the retail margins coming through. Can you guys give us some context is that how much contribution is coming from that business or where you guys sit in that historic margin range of $2 to $4 megawatt hour. Just so we can see a little better from the outside what's going on there.","Joseph Nigro","Yeah hi Dan, this is Joe. Good morning. In the let's start with the second question first. We are still well within that $2 to $4 range. It's above the $2 value and it's below the $4. Our commercial industrial originations remained solid and we're happy with that. As for the margin, I think about it more on a total portfolio basis, because there is retail margins of one component of it. The second thing is we serve a lot of wholesale polar load as well which have a different margin structure associated with them. But the money that we made in the third quarter which really driven by three key things. The first thing is that if you go back and look at our hedge disclosure again for the second quarter, we were effectively 100% hedged across our book for the year. And so we set up with the short buys recognized we had the backstop of our own generation to serve loaded market guide volatile.","The second thing is we cost it our loads when we sold them the risk premiums were much higher than what is realized in the spot market primarily driven by the low, low gas prices during the third quarter. And then the last thing is we took an opportunity when the prices dropped to hair cut during the summer to materially get our position in longer as we walked into August and then we saw some volatility. So we capitalized them that as well. So it's really been three components that drove the value.","Dan Eggers","Okay, got it. And I guess last question you maybe Chris or Jack is just on the decision to differ the nuclear plant closures. How much earnings drag should we assume is coming off those three plants in 2016? And given the delays in making decision what would actually get you guys the point to decide which higher in any of these assets that are making money.","Christopher Crane","So let's first talk about PJM and Quad and Byron. The CP auctions substantially changed the profile of cash flow and earnings. We have still need on the low power portfolio standard to cement the long-term viability of these assets. But Quad is just marginal flat on free cash flow. It just slightly dilutive on earnings. And if we can move the CP along, it will greatly improve that. Byron is in a little bit better shape based off of CP and we'll continue to watch that closely.","On Clinton we were prepared with no action taken on the capacity market to go forward with the retirement. We have seen a commitment and action at MISO to evaluate zone 4 as its only competitive, real competitive market to evaluate the redesign of the capacity construct that would adequately compensate the generators for the investors they are making. We've also seen positive signals from the state of Illinois by evaluating and starting workshops to evaluate the problem statement and workshops to look at potential fixes on Zone 4 in Southern Illinois. So now that we've seen some potential for improvement, we're willing to go another year.","At unit Clinton is one of our newest units in the fleet is got over 30 years of potential run left, with support coming from MISO and understanding the problem statement at - and the state now considering what should be done in the southern part to ensure reliability. We saw that as an enough promise to extent it one more year to see what we can do in 2016.","Dan Eggers","So that is your view that you'll have some sort of market reform in '16 I guess in the first half of '16 in MISO for those plants look viable or is it just the action that will get you comfortable even if it's not resolve.","Jonathan Thayer","We want to resolve in 2016. I don't know if it's going to be in the first half but it has got to get resolved in 2016 between the lower power portfolio standard and the capacity construct in MISO it is going to be imperative for us to go forward. Quad in the subsequent auction is cleared 16-17, 17-18. So we've got a blanket on that for couple of years but it did not cleared 18-19.","Dan Eggers","Okay, got it. Thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","Yeah, hi. Good morning. Couple of questions just on the [indiscernible] recent update that you gave, is the kind of push out of the accretion or just due to delays and closing and just more time to get the cost cuts and through and I guess maybe any rate relief through like the rate free is that you have. Is that the main difference?","Jonathan Thayer","That's part of it and the other part is our approved from the time we announced the merger and from when we talked about the LRP last year - last quarter excuse me, our position is improved. So there is a little bit of we're better than we were. And the delays is the other part of it.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then I guess just on the nuclear decision. And I would just wondered there is a little bit of kind of risk okay, you were crying wolf on this, because you talked about this for a while then you're not shutting this year. Just how is the risk of the shutting like real in '16 or what is different in terms of making this decision now. I mean gas prices are also a lot lower too.","Christopher Crane","Yes. So we opened the books to key stakeholders in the stake. They could see the red [ph] that was being produced by these assets. We were able to work with PJM and the other stakeholders on CP that gave us the improvement that we're not seeing the level of red [ph] or in some cases neutral on the assets. These are long lived assets and their big decisions to make we're not crying wolf we've actually got results. And if we can continue to get results these units will become profitable and be able to stay within the fleet. And the contributions they make to the communities that they serve. So this is not as backing down on a decision this is as making progress on a path that we define clearly at the beginning of this. If we cannot see progress we would shut the units down. We have seen progress and we continue to believe there is potential for more progress. If we do not see that progress, we will shut the plants down.","Steven Fleishman","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. A few questions, first back on [indiscernible] I have the good fortune of having follow them before you. You announced the acquisition and I have been keeping my model up to date. And it actually looks to me like their financial situation is materially degraded over the year or so year and half or so and through the time that\u2019s been caused by this delay they haven\u2019t gotten rate increases, they've got massive operating cost increase they\u2019ve added several hundred basis points of leverage to their balance sheet I mean they don\u2019t look like they are a viable entity in their current form if this deal doesn\u2019t close. So, it\u2019s part of this problem with the delay and the accretion that you\u2019re coming from a deeper hole?","Christopher Crane","If the delay in filing the rate cases has contributed to PHI\u2019s position that they\u2019re in now. They publicly spoke about what their future would be on a stand. We believe that once we are able to fold them into the fleet and drive the synergies and help support them with the operational performance that will give the environment for a fair regulatory recovery going forward. As we\u2019ve seen with BGE.","Greg Gordon","Yeah. I mean certainly as I have observed on a standalone basis they\u2019ve just seen a massive escalation in cost which I am sure you\u2019d be able to control much more readily given Exelon\u2019s playbook that should lead to a necessity from lower ask in terms of rate increases to get back to a decent return more to think correct?","Christopher Crane","Yeah. I mean that\u2019s part of the thesis in our filings and what we\u2019re able to do with the settlements we can drive the synergies with our platform that will reduce the request for needed scope of rate increases.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thanks. Going back to the $0.08 to impact to earnings from bonus depreciation Jack that\u2019s on this year\u2019s earnings and is that sort of lower rate base net of capital allocation and can you just walk us through how you do that calculation?","Jonathan Thayer","Sure. That would be Greg on 2015. The $0.08 would hit $0.07 at ExGen, it would hit a penny at ComEd importantly it would also improve our cash flow by $650 million and at ComEd we would see the impact of bonus depreciation would cause a $215 million reduction in ComEd's rate base.","Greg Gordon","So, what do you assume, you do with the 650 million in cash just becomes goes at the corporate general bucket or do you assume a specific offset in the denominator through much that reduction if you just less that, is that the answer?","Jonathan Thayer","Effectively, we would reinvest that back into the utilities part of our business to fund our capital plan.","Greg Gordon","Okay. And why is there such a big impact on ExGen?","Jonathan Thayer","It\u2019s the domestic production credits, there is a limit or they goes into place and as those bonus depreciation hits that limitations goes into effect and meaningfully hits our ExGen part of our business with somewhat unique with our exposure to this within the industry.","Greg Gordon","That hits your ability to consume production tax credits?","Jonathan Thayer","It\u2019s more, Tom do you want to - had a tax.","Unidentified Corporate Participant","As a generator, we\u2019re entitled to claim so called domestic production activities in - which has completed as a percentage of generation income so as bonus appreciation reduces that income or therefore reduces the related...","Greg Gordon","Okay, got it. Thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning guys.","Jonathan Thayer","Good morning John.","Jonathan Arnold","Quick question. I noticed that in your recast of the \u201815 guidance those now you obviously have the holdco drag which I apologize I missed this guessing in part of the financing on Pepco. But what would be we - that ride of - what\u2019s the reasonable run rate of holdco expense as we look for beyond this year?","Jonathan Thayer","So, Jonathan, we commented in our earning script that the equity and debt financing associated with PHI because we didn\u2019t close as anticipated in Q3 and would be a $0.13 drag on the year. So, our guidance contemplates that drag and incorporates that obviously. Prospectively, we would anticipate closing the transaction towards the end of the first quarter of 2016, we would get the benefit of Pepco\u2019s earnings and the pro forma would be modestly diluted for \u201816 until we as Chris mentioned execute the rate cases and grow the revenues and earnings at PHI over the course of the next several years.","Jonathan Arnold","And I had the comment about the $0.13 diluted that was a \u201815 comment or was it \u201816?","Jonathan Thayer","No that\u2019s a \u201815 comment Jonathan. 15, sorry 2015 drag in 2016 we have the benefits of PHI for three quarters.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, got it. So once you close will you start on that the holdco financing for that deal kind of into the segment or do you think you\u2019ll still have a discrete pair of drag that might be larger going forward?","Jonathan Thayer","We will incorporate the shares issued or we have the shares issued the 893 million shares in the share counts that will give us advisory for all of our business units and then we have the corporate moving company or holding company that will get allocated.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay so I should once we get into \u201817 let\u2019s say this parent segment the best guess is kind of flat?","Jonathan Thayer","Starting in \u201817 we\u2019ll start to see increase in going into \u201818 and very strong at the end of the LRP period.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, thank you guys. And then could I ask one other thing we saw this Maryland A.G. filing in the second quarter any thoughts around timing how concerned are you it might be Maryland that ends up throwing the rents in the work?","Jonathan Thayer","Darryl you want to cover that?","Darryl Bradford","Yeah Jonathan, this is Darryl Bradford. We have - the attorney general asked for leads to file [indiscernible] brief we\u2019re going to following on opposition today along with the Maryland Public Service Commission, why there'd be attorney general allow to file in that we feel that the Maryland decision is a very strong one the parties that are appealing and have a very heavy burden, go for its permit there will be a hearing in the Circuit Court on December 8 on this and we believe that decision was very solid and we believe that it will be of help.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hue Wynn [ph] with Bernstein.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide any high level perspectives on the cost cutting initiative that you had mentioned in the scripted remarks.","Christopher Crane","Yeah we\u2019re going to be putting out the details at EEI but we\u2019ve looked at our corporate center BSC business service cost, we\u2019re looking at a IT cost in some of the work that we can do there and also at the generating company so we should be able to provide more detail on that or we will be providing more detail in the year.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good morning.","Christopher Crane","Morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So first question going back to Pepco if you will, the 2019\u2019s figure what\u2019s embedded in there is that simply just closing on the transaction, executing status quo or are there rate case assumptions etcetera I was just trying to get a little bit more sense that far out in terms of what\u2019s baked in?","Jonathan Thayer","So there are rate case assumptions that we\u2019re taking straight out of PHI\u2019s RP. Once we close we\u2019ll be able to get deeper into those numbers in the drivers but it is based up of their assumptions on what they\u2019ll recover in rate cases and their assumption on cost in cost controls going forward. So we will be able to do more on that and provide updates when we get into the detail at the close.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. To a clarification it might be a little tricky first earned ROE\u2019s approximately I mean is it fair to say what I\u2019ll let you comment on that on the Pepco side and then separately as you think about this transaction you\u2019ve got I suppose the cost update coming at EEI, is there some fungibility between those two as well?","Jonathan Thayer","I'm sure there is because you are going to have the Massachusetts model will dictate the over hedge down to the specific company. So there should be with this improvement minor adjustments. But it would too early to speculate now on where there goes. On the ROE's the calculation would be straight out of the LRP that PHI is operating under now their LRP that will have to be updated post close with our assumptions of not only the cost reductions but the operational improvements.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. Last little question here. What is the creaks you guys filed an interesting 8-K recently regarding must offer requirements in 2019. Is there and ability to clip participate for a partial year and toward the subsequent capacity auction at all?","Jonathan Thayer","[Indiscernible] will take that.","Unidentified Corporate Participant","Hey, Julien, it's Joe [ph]. Julien we've looked at that that would be very difficult especially with the new CP environment. So you've seen our most [indiscernible] we don't intend to participate with that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Just wanted to clarify. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Christopher Crane","Good morning.","Ali Agha","First question, just wanted to clarify the $0.08 beep [ph] that you had in the third quarter above the high end of your guidance, was that all coming from the stronger performance at Constellation or what was the main driver there?","Jonathan Thayer","Ali it was both across the utility business as well as that constellation and nextgen part of our businesses. So we had strong weather and operating results at both PECO and ComEd and then we had good operating results at PJE and as Joe articulated in his discussion we had strong performance from the generating part of our company.","Ali Agha","Okay. Second question, this disconnect in pricing between your fundamental view of NiHub and the forwards we've been hearing that for the last several quarters now and this [Inaudible] happen during that - what is your opinion is going to trigger that to coincide? Is there just a search in demand, extreme weather, I mean like I said we've been seeing this for a while, what do you think will change that?","Joseph Nigro","Good morning. I think - it\u2019s Joe. I think there is a couple of things. But I think the biggest thing is there is a complete lack of liquidity in NiHub and especially when you get beyond like 2015-17 period. We think that when - with normal weather in 2016 we think NiHub is somewhat fairly value. But as you move out on the curve it gets materially undervalued and that's driven mostly by the lack of liquidity.","If you look at you have gas prices that are in a contango market and M3 is relevant because it's across the [indiscernible] a lot of hours setting price using M3 gas. So if you look at like 2016 to 2018 you've got $0.25 of value on the curve just associated - $0.40 of value associated with Henry hub prices and another $0.20 to $0.25 with M3. There are $0.65 a value in the gas curve and yet the power prices at NiHub today are $0.25 back warding. In addition closely contango as well so that part of it, the coal [ph] retirements part of it. We have seen heat rate expansion even at these low gas prices, we think some of that has been massed quite frankly by the fuel being so low. But when you put all that together in the complete lack of liquidity that's where we coming up with the driver of higher prices in the future.","Ali Agha","Understood. And the last question assuming these forward curve stay as they are and I know that at EEI you'll update your curves 18 to the mix as well. But when you look at - I mean you are showing us fairly flat margins 16 17, the cost saving that you are planning are they going to be strong enough so that just directionally GenCorp can a show a positive net income stream because depreciation another expansion are going up as well or are we still looking at flat to perhaps declining GenCorp profile given what the forward curves are telling us right now.","Jonathan Thayer","Ali, its Jack. I know that there is a lot of interest in us engaging on the cost reduction topic before EEI. But I think it's probably better to align our disclosure around that cost reduction effort with our outlook for 16 17 and 18 hedge disclosures. You'll obviously see the significant benefit of CP in that period aligned with the benefits of cost reduction. So the story is positive, we'd ask for your patience in terms of transparency around that until EEI.","Christopher Crane","The bottom line is we are seeing improvement over the LRP period.","Ali Agha","Okay. So from an Exelon perspective just directionally you would as we stand here today 18 19 earnings with that going there should be higher than where we are in '15. Is that a fair statement?","Jonathan Thayer","Yes.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call.

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Exelon Corporation 2017 Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Exelon, you may begin your conference.","Dan Eggers","Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Thayer, Exelon\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. They\u2019re joined by other members of Exelon\u2019s senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon\u2019s website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today\u2019s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today\u2019s material and comments made during this call.","Please refer to today\u2019s 8-K and Exelon\u2019s other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management\u2019s projections, forecasts and expectations. Today\u2019s presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s CEO.","Chris Crane","Thanks, Dan, and good morning and thank you, all, for joining us. We had a solid third quarter of 2017, with GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share, up versus the prior year. Our adjusted EPS was $0.85 as well, reaching the midpoint of our guidance. Strong utility and Genco performance more than offset headwinds from the mild summer weather that impacted our PECO, ACE utilities as well as volumes at Constellation.","As we head into year-end, we have a lot to be encouraged about. Our regulatory utilities are continuing to execute very well, running ahead of plan for the year operationally, we are performing in top quartile across most performance measures. We are registering significant improvements at PHI, even relative to last year. We are doing exactly what we said we would do as part of our merger commitments, improving performance and reliability for our customers. We are executing on our CapEx program for 2017. We\u2019re excited about the valuable technologies investments we\u2019re deploying to our customers\u2019 benefit.","The FERC is making strides to address pressing resiliency needs for the power system, we see that in a two-step process. Starting with empowering PJM to fix deficiencies in the power price formation by the summer of 2018, and then a longer term FERC process to address resiliency. The Department of Energy Section 403 filing noted a clause in the current price formation are part of the reason that nuclear units, the most resilient and cost effective Zero Emission resources in PJM are being lost of premature retirements.","Given our size of our PJM fleet, each dollar or megawatt hour of distortion caused by a flood market design undermines the Genco\u2019s economics by approximately $135 million per year on an unhedged basis. We believe that DOE\u2019s focus on price formation will lead to a successful process at FERC that will eliminate these distortions by the summer of 2018. We have not reflected the value of these reforms in our forecast that we\u2019re showing you today, but we do believe they could be a significant positive for us starting in 2018.","Finally, we are executing on our management plan, focused on strengthening our operation and continuing to find efficiencies. To that end, we lowered our costs by $250 million on a run-rate basis in 2020, primarily at the Genco, including today\u2019s announcement we\u2019re in our cost, our O&M cost versus planned by over $700 million annually from initiatives identified since 2015. We continue to challenge our businesses to evaluate cost and today\u2019s announcements savings are part of that ongoing effort.","We\u2019re confident in our previous announced plan to generate $6.8 billion of free cash flow at the Genco through 2020. That will fund our utility growth, grow the dividend and meet our debt reduction commitments. It is this deliberate work that positions us well to face some headwinds. After a series of mild summers and winters, we have seen decline in power market volatility, which is weighing on the forward price \u2013 power prices, impacting the Constellation business. Just as we experienced during periods of low volatility, we\u2019re again seeing less disciplined by some of the wholesale and retail competitors in the market as they become more aggressive with their pricing. We have been through low discipline, low volatility periods before, and they end up in the same way. Those without discipline fail, that is when we can grow our market share by winning business a good margins or acquiring low business is offered for sale.","We expect volatility to return to the markets with normal weather conditions, which will benefit our Constellation and Generation business. In the meantime, we remain disciplined in our bidding strategy and remain behind our ratable hedging in our generation. Last week, the Illinois Power Authority shifted its schedule for finalizing the procurement of the Illinois ZEC contracts by one month from late December 2017 to late January of 2018. Based on our assumptions, this delay will shift $0.09 of EPS from 2017 to 2018. Even with the unanticipated EPS shift, we\u2019re narrowing our 2017 guidance to $2.55 to $2.75 per share, keeping us on path to the midpoint of our original guidance at the utilities outperformed our plan.","Moving on to Slide 6, I want to highlight our excellent operational performance for the quarter. The color block chart continues to show strong quartile \u2013 top quartile performance across all of the utilities in most categories. I particularly want to call out the tremendous improvements at PHI compared to last year. With the 22% improvement in reliability, with PHI on track for their best year ever in reliability and a 17% improvement in speed of restoration of outages. Performance improvements like these really highlight the benefits going to our customers with the integration of PHI into Exelon. And finally, as in prior quarters, our best-in-class nuclear and power fleets performed with very high reliability in the quarter.","Moving to Slide 7. Now let me turn to the proposed rule issued by Secretary Perry in September. The order is aimed at protecting our customers from outages, resulting from man-made and natural interruptions on the gas system by preserving resilient generation sources, including nuclear. We commend the Secretary for focusing attention on the need to reform the energy markets, and ensure that our customers continue to benefit from the resilient system. FERC is currently considering the DOE\u2019s proposal, with the first round of comments filed on October 21, reply comments due on November 7 and the final order scheduled for December 11.","We have shared our perspective on this important policy initiative. First, we think the FERC should direct PJM to evaluate and correct any deficiencies they see in energy price formation, which have put baseload generation asset at a disadvantage. We believe timely action on price formation could be implemented by as early as mid-2018. These reforms will be valuable first step in preserving resilient baseload generation as well as delivering economic and environmental benefits, the nuclear power uniquely provide.","We expect 135 terawatt hours of our generation output in PJM to benefit from price uplift that were layer in over coming years at the existing hedges roll off. Second, we think FERC can take on \u2013 take the time to fully evaluate market reforms that will ensure power supply resiliency. This is a multi-fast that exercise that should take into account the cost and impact to our customers and economy of the long-term interruption of a natural gas fuel supply \u2013 interruption of the natural gas fuel supply.","We believe these are important issues that need to be addressed for our country\u2019s future, but they require more analysis to ensure the right reforms are implemented. We are encouraged by the process being made at FERC and PJM, support for price formation changes.","Between these efforts and state initiatives, we\u2019re optimistic about the path to preserve nuclear power plants and their critical economic environmental and reliability roles that they have in the communities that we serve.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jack to take us through the numbers.","Jack Thayer","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8. For the third quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.85 per share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Exelon\u2019s utilities less Holdco expenses delivered a combined $0.49 per share. Versus our plan, utility results were slightly favorable due to lower O&M and reduced storm activity over the third quarter.","Generation earned $0.36 per share, which was a little behind our plan. The third quarter was hurt by mild weather that reduced Constellation load volumes and a lack of price volatility, which reduced optimization opportunities. We did offset some weakness for payable O&M timing.","Turning to Slide 9. Our $0.85 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.06 per share lower than the third quarter of 2016. Overall, utilities benefited from improved earned ROEs and higher rate base, partly offset by adverse year-over-year weather impacts. ExGen was down primarily on lower power prices, lower load volumes due to mild weather and fewer optimization opportunities, partially offset by the addition of New York ZEC revenue and higher capacity prices.","Turning to Slide 10. We are updating our 2017 guidance range. We had expected the Illinois power authority to finalize procurement for the ZEC programs in December, which based on our assumptions, would have contributed $0.09 of EPS in 2017 since the revenues are retroactive to the beginning of program on June 1. However, last week, the Illinois power authority updated their schedule pushing the final contract date to January 30, 2018.","The delayed timing has no impact on the amount we expect to receive or our free cash flow outlook. But it will change the timing of earnings recognition, shifting EPS into 2018. With that in mind, we are updating our 2017 EPS guidance range, heightening the top and bottom of the range by a nickel. So we\u2019re now at $2.55 to $2.75 per share. Strong performance of utilities is allowing us to still target the midpoint of our original guidance range of absorbing the $0.09 of ZEC timing impact.","Moving to Slide 11. Our utilities continue to execute delivering strong earned returns in the quarter, in addition to the robust operational performance Chris already discussed. Looking at the trailing 12 month book ROEs, we saw improvement at PHI compared to last quarter across all jurisdictions except ACE, where they roll out favorable weather in the third quarter of 2016 for the less beneficial summer weather this year.","Our efforts to improve operations and the contributions from the rate cases resolved over the past year are driving a better earned ROEs at PHI. For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remained over 10%, but abated a bit from last quarter with less favorable year-over-year weather impacts at ComEd and PECO that you can see on Slide 9 quarter call.","Overall Exelon utilities ROEs are still nearly 10%, including PHI. We\u2019re proud of the performance of our overall utility business and we still see opportunity to improve our returns at the PHI utilities as we bring their performance to levels more consistent with the rest of our utilities.","On Slide 12, we update the status of our rate cases. At Atlantic City Electric, we reached a settlement for the second case in a row. The settlement provides a 4% rate increase, with new rates implemented earlier than what would have occurred if the case was fully litigated. The timing rate making in New Jersey is helping us make beneficial investments for our customers. While still a work-in-progress, the investments are having an impact with outages down 33% and average customer outage time down 35% compared to 2011.","We also received an order for Pepco Maryland that granted an electric distribution base rate increase of $32.4 million based on an allowed ROE of 9.5%. The improved electric delivery rates became effective on October 20, 2017. We filed rate cases in the third quarter for Delmarva Delaware electric and gas and expect orders by the third quarter of 2018. We\u2019re proud of the hard work from our utilities and regulatory teams. These efforts are helping to bring PHI\u2019s earned ROEs allowed levels while we simultaneously improve performance for our customers. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on Slides 34 to 42 in the Appendix.","Turning to Slide 13. We regularly update you on our progress on the regulatory front, but another essential aspect of the business is a effectively deploying capital on behalf of our customers. We\u2019re currently on course to deploy our targeted $5.3 billion of capital in 2017. We\u2019ve highlighted on this slide, two of the many notable projects we\u2019re developing to benefit our communities and customers.","The first is Pepco\u2019s Waterfront Substation. This substation is part of the larger capital grid project and is currently under construction with expected completion in 2017. Once complete, it will improve reliability to existing customers and support the plan growth in the Capitol Riverfront and Southwest Waterfront areas in the next 20 to 30 years. The other project I\u2019d like to highlight is ComEd\u2019s Grand Prairie Gateway transmission line that was energized earlier this year.","It\u2019s a $200 million, 60 mile-long transmission line in Northern Illinois that provide structural benefits to the market, resulting in lower energy and congestion charges to customers and an increased import capability of approximately 1,000 megawatts. Over the next 15 years, customers collectively will save over $120 million and carbon emissions will be reduced by nearly 500,000 tons. These are just a couple of examples of how we continue to invest prudently across all our utilities and look forward to sharing more as we go forward.","Slide 14 provides our gross margin update for ExGen. Before I get into the market developments impacting gross margins, let me first discuss the impacts from a shift and revenue recognition for the Illinois ZEC from 2017 to 2018, which we also show in the Waterfalls in Slide 21 in the appendix. The capacity in ZEC line declines by $150 million in 2017 and increases by a $150 million in 2018, offset by $50 million in other capacity declines, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment.","The rest of the bars help to then isolate movements in underline gross margin not related to ZEC timing. In 2017, gross margin is down $50 million compared to last quarter, partially reflecting the effect of the mild summer and reduced optimization opportunities. We are highly hedged for the rest of this year and are well balanced for our generation to load matching strategy.","Turning to 2018 and 2019, separate from the Illinois ZEC timing, our gross margin is down $200 million for each year and can be bucketed into two categories. The first relates business and our unhedged power position. We are lowering our assumptions from MISO and New York capacity prices based on recent spot year options and bilateral fields in the market. This lower the capacity in ZEC line by $50 million on a rounded basis from last quarter.","For 2018, the line shows up as a positive $100 million after the timing uplift from $150 million of Illinois ZEC, while the $50 million decline in 2019 just reflects the lower outlook for past revenues. During the third quarter, we also saw declines in energy prices, including some adverse news and basis differentials in the PJM east sum, which costs another $50 million in 2018 and 2019.","However, with the recent rally in power prices, we have already recovered about half of the $100 million of 2019 gross margin declines for Generation. We also see $100 million decline in gross margins in 2018 and 2019 from the Constellation business, reflected in the lower power new business to go live. A series of mild summers and winters have contributed to reduced power market volatility, which in turn is impacting the competitiveness of our load business.","As we\u2019ve witnessed in prior periods with low price volatility, some of our competitors are mispricing risk in an effort to win business. In the wholesale load business, we\u2019re seeing other players mispricing risks as we consider the market risk from weather volatility, basis variability and the likely impact of energy market reforms that Chris talked about earlier. Against this backdrop, we are clearing at margins near the low end of historical realizations.","In the C&I business, the consolidation of the suppliers since the polar vortex has led to better margin discipline with unit margins holding consistent with prior years. We are however, seeing revenue renewal rates compared to last couple of years, moving from something closer to 80% to low 70%.","These lower renewal rates, we still expect our volumes to be flat year-over-year whereas our previous guidance assumes higher renewal rates that will drive volume growth to Constellation in 2018 and 2019. Notably, even against the challenged market backdrop, we\u2019re holding volumes and margins flat, which is a testament to the strength of our retail platform and our disciplined approach to bidding business.","The updated gross margins for 2018 and 2019 incorporates C&I renewal rates from the low 70s and the wholesale margins hovering around the bottom end of what we\u2019ve realized over time. We\u2019ve been through these periods of low load pricing, lower load price in the past and as previously created opportunities for us. A return to normal weather will inject some power market volatility, which will positively impact forward power prices for Generation.","Retailers and wholesalers in mispriced risk have consistently been driven from the business when we go from a period of low volatility to a volatility event. When the market corrects, we\u2019ll be there to win business at good margins and grow volumes and market share, just as we had in the past. Even against the current market backdrop, Constellation continues to generate strong earnings and free cash flow. Our gen-to-load matching strategy remains it competitive advantage relative to our peers, contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring our generation output to market in a disciplined manner.","From a hedging perspective, we ended the quarter approximately 11% to 14% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 10% to 13% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals.","Spot natural gas prices this year at $3 per Mcf, which is $0.50 higher than last year in spite of mild weather this past winter and summer. However, these higher prices have provided only modest uplift to spot power prices this summer, while the forward prices have decreased slightly. We think that a return to more normal weather and volatility in the market will help reverse this. And as Chris discussed, we see a path power market reforms that represent real value uplift for us. We\u2019re maintaining a additional link to be able to monetize these reforms.","Turning to Slide 15. We continually challenge our organization to find operating efficiencies and focus on managing our cost. To that end, we\u2019re announcing another wave of O&M cost reductions, building on previous years\u2019 efforts. We will ramp these new initiatives over the next two years, as shown on the lower-right table, reaching a $250 million annual run rate in 2020. The savings will come primarily from ExGen and the corporate center. If you look at this initiative together with the programs we\u2019ve announced since 2015, we\u2019ll strip out over $700 million of annual run rate cost providing significant earnings of free cash flow benefits.","Turning to Slide 16. We appreciate that there are many puts and takes this year in ExGen, but have both benefited on our free cash flow outlook through 2020. When we take into account the movement in power price forwards through the end of October, updated gross margin outlook for Constellation, the benefit of further cost cuts, the early closure of TMI and exit of EGTP plants and changes to base CapEx in working capital associated with all these business updates, we remain confident in the free cash flow outlook and capital allocation commitments we made at the beginning of the year.","We\u2019re also committed to meeting or beating our 3 times debt-to-EBITDA target for ExGen\u2019s balance sheet, which we will meet over planning horizon. On the fourth quarter call, we will roll forward the free cash flow outlook for the next planning period.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Chris.","Chris Crane","Thanks, Jack. Turning to Slide 17, I want to take a moment to highlight the contributions made by Exelon and our employees to help the impact by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Exelon utilities sent more than 2,200 employees and contractors and support personnel from our six utilities to help with the recovery efforts at Hurricane Irma. Our crews travel to Florida and Georgia where they, for more than two weeks, worked in very difficult conditions. We\u2019re very proud of our employees and the hard work that they do to help the communities come back from after these disasters. A very special thanks to all those who helped in the restoration and support efforts.","Exelon employees also stepped up from a volunteer perspective. Our employees have donated their time and resources to communities impacted by the storms. We also had a number of our Constellation employees in Houston directly displaced by the storms and to see coworkers come to their aid illustrates the value that we embody here at Exelon.","Slide 18, we want to reinforce our value proposition, which remains the foundation of our commitment to our investors. We\u2019ve continued to grow the utilities rate base at 6.5% and the regulated EPS to 6% to 8% annually through 2020, underpinning the capital investments that directly benefit the customers in each of our jurisdictions. We continue to use free cash flow generated at the Genco to fund incremental equities at the utilities and pay down debt over the next four years at ExGen in the holding company.","We\u2019re focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans, and maximizing our value through gen-to-load matching strategies. We continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics and grow our dividend in a stable consistent manner. As many of you are aware, our dividend growth as of October end gets for 2.5% annually from 2016 through 2018. We are working with our board and expect to provide an update on a multiyear outlook for the dividend growth plan as part of our planning and budgeting process that are undertaking currently.","Before I go to questions, I want to come back to where we started off in the call. We have a number of positives underlying our outlook. The utilities are growing and executing well. We are confident that the FERC actions around resiliency will facilitate needed power price reforms in PJM that will fairly compensate our generating assets. We continue to improve operations where we\u2019re finding ways to run our business more efficiently and taking out an additional $250 million in cost as discussed. And we\u2019re still on track to generate $6.8 billion of free cash flow through 2020 at ExGen that will support our utility growth, reduce our debt and facilitate growing our dividend.","Thank you again for your interest and now we\u2019re ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI.","Chris Crane","Hey, Greg good morning.","Greg Gordon","So just to summarize here, you gave us a negative adjustment on several \u2013 I think ExGen that totaled $200 million, but since that mark, you\u2019ve seen $50 million come back. So 2019 is negative $150 million and if you achieved your cost-cutting goals, you essentially have eliminated that. And so we\u2019re at the push in 2019 with those offset, is that correct?","Jack Thayer","Yes, Greg. And I think as you think about it and you listen on our comments on the low volatility period we\u2019re in, we believe that with the return to normal weather and even potentially future volatility events that, that\u2019s decline in Constellation business could prove temporary. Obviously, the $250 million are permanent cost savings and capitalize all in terms of value creation.","Greg Gordon","Okay. So as per usual protocol, you\u2019re using the current forward curves for power \u2013 what the current margin outlook looks like for retail, you\u2019re not assuming any changes, no volatility premium coming back in the market, no PJM price reform, et cetera?","Joe Dominguez","Hi, Greg its Joe. Yes, we are using the current forward curves for power. I think the big thing to note on the retail side and Jack said this in his script, when we did our planning at the first of the year, our renewal rates for C&I power were up close to 80%. As was the case back in 2012 and 2013, we have seen a downturn in most renewal rates down close to the 70%. And we\u2019re marking this closer to that 70% number. I think the big thing though is back in 2012 and 2013, we saw power \u2013 C&I power margins dipped below $2 per megawatt hour. And we\u2019ve said historically our origination margins for that business are somewhere between $2 and $4. We\u2019re still within that $2 to $4 range.","So I think the big thing, the takeaway is, we\u2019re going to serve about 200 million-megawatt hours of load this year across our platform between retail and wholesale. And we expect to do the same thing next year. The thing is, we\u2019re just not going to achieve the growth that we expected in our C&I power business. And as Chris said and Jack said, the reason for that is, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent to chase the market. And we\u2019re going to remain disciplined what we think value is and that has served us well historically and quite frankly, has allowed us to acquire companies a few times as well. So we\u2019ll continue to remain disciplined.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Sorry, go ahead.","Chris Crane","I\u2019ve just said so, the beginning of the question, all the numbers that you hear are on the gross margin are marked at the end of third quarter. So it\u2019s the end of September 29 or 31, whatever the market closed on.","Greg Gordon","Got you. One \u2013 two more questions. One, looking at Slide 20, your cash flow profile, looks slightly better and looks like it\u2019s mainly coming from the utilities and specifically from ComEd. Can you comment on what the changes in the improved cash flow profile there?","Chris Crane","So it\u2019s primarily related to the collection of the ZEC regulatory asset as well as cash taxes.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Final question, when looking at your \u2013 at the value proposition you guys are delivering, if we get PJM price formation improvements and you hit on your other financial goals, you\u2019ll start to have a earnings growth profile that looks more comparable to the regulated peer group. They trade at 18 times earnings you\u2019re trading at 14 times current expectations. But your dividend growth \u2013 their dividend growth rates average around 5% and yours is 2.5%. I know you said you\u2019re reviewing this, but what do you need to see in terms of your financial outlook to be able to close or eliminate that dividend growth half gap, because I think it\u2019s one amongst several things that keeps your stock from trading at a higher valuation?","Chris Crane","Yes, great. We do believe we\u2019re undervalued. And everything that we\u2019re doing is to drive that improvement in valuation. As you can see from the free cash flow, the debt reduction plan, the recovery and rate case, we\u2019re positioning ourselves much better for a potential to have the board conversation in the upcoming LRP planning process to evaluate the dividend. And our expectation is \u2013 and has been since we have to cut the dividend four years ago is to get it back to build the business on a strong balance sheet to get the dividend to be in line with our peers. And that is our pursuit and as you can see from these numbers, things are improving that have us \u2013 able to have a much more positive conversation with the board. Ultimately, it\u2019s the board\u2019s discretion, but that\u2019s where we want to be.","Greg Gordon","Thank you very much. Have a great morning.","Chris Crane","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys.","Chris Crane","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold","I wanted to just make sure, at the beginning, Chris, I believe you just gave $1 of market price improvement sensitivity based of your volumes to PJM price reform was $135 million. Did I hear that correctly?","Chris Crane","Yes. For a $1 of fully opened position in PJM, 135 terawatt hours, $135 million, so you can \u2013 that was just the dollar reference.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. So my question is, I mean, as you look at the kinds of reforms that PJM is considering in flexible unit and the like, what\u2019s your view of the range of potential uplift to any translated into ATC basis that we would rather than view?","Joe Dominguez","Hey Jonathan, this is Joe. We\u2019re still waiting to see some additional details from PJM. But \u2013 and so we\u2019re not going to put out a number until we get all of those details. But I have seen the reports that a number of you have compiled on this subject with the range that is somewhere between $2 and $5 ATC movement as a result of the elimination and discrimination. And I think that\u2019s the right range to be thinking about and probably the middle part of that range makes a lot of sense to us.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. And then Chris, you\u2019ve said, I think earlier in the year, this dividend revisit in the longer-range growth outlook would be a Q1. And I believe what you\u2019ve just said is pretty consistent with that if you do at is part of the LRP. Is that correct?","Chris Crane","Yes. I think we\u2019ve said back in 2016 when we have our dividend strategy, we want to give you a multi-year plan. We gave you 2016 through 2018. That would be the time in the first quarter to be updating, in my belief, set the board\u2019s discussion, and where we go with that, but that would be our timing in my mind in our current plans and communicating with all of you.","Jonathan Arnold","What should we be expecting you to give us next week the EEI. No, no [indiscernible]","Chris Crane","Yes. EEI, I think we\u2019ll be able to have more of the one-on-one details, get into more of the details on the capital investments and the growth and the rate case strategies as we improve the customer experience at the utilities. We\u2019ll also have more time to go into the detail on the numbers on the free cash flow, debt reduction plans, and the optimization of gen-to-load growth. I\u2019m sure more people are going to want to talk in detail about the basis for our 250, and we can do the deep dive on that, but it will be detailed on what you\u2019re seeing today and an opportunity to have some one-on-one dialogue about it.","Jonathan Arnold","Great, thank you. And then I guess, just one other \u2013 did you have any thoughts? I know it\u2019s all a bit moving target you\u2019ve been talking. But what\u2019s your level of confidence that you\u2019re going to get to things that you want to see out of the tax reform?","Chris Crane","Well, its 11:15, I think or 11:30 Eastern when we see the draft. And we\u2019ll have to rally together with EEI and take a look at how \u2013 we as a sector have been positioned. Kind of early to say now if you\u2019ve gone over the last 24 hours, things have been all over the board. So I think to speculate, but we work together in a sector at EEI, and I\u2019m sure Tom Kuhn will be getting us all together and figure out. Our next steps as of the rewrites as they discuss our finalized and getting our input as a sector in there. We\u2019re totally unified at EEI on what we\u2019re looking for and what we think will benefit our customers the most in tax reform. So more to come on that, and maybe we\u2019ll have a little bit of insight of that in EEI as we work through the weekend and see the effect on the proposed and still we got to go back to this is proposed. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in D.C., but we\u2019ll be ready to talk about it more, as not only a company, but as a sector.","Jonathan Arnold","Sure. I\u2019m sorry to put you on spot on that on a real-time issue.","Chris Crane","No, that\u2019s okay.","Jonathan Arnold","Thank you, guys.","Chris Crane","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Yes. Hey, good morning, Chris.","Chris Crane","Hey, Steve.","Steve Fleishman","So just \u2013 curious how are you strategizing on your retail business with respect to these potential DOE, PJM changes? And are you doing things to make sure that you don\u2019t have like a big delay in capturing the uptick because of retail hedges, like are you making sure your back to backing your retail and the like I mean just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that?","Joe Dominguez","Hey Steve, good morning. It\u2019s a Joe. We are thinking about that and I think the first thing is, when as Jack said in his script and we said for a while, we\u2019re carrying the longer position relative to our ratable sales plan. So we have the opportunity to capture any upside associated with price increases related to the reforms you\u2019re talking about. I think specifically though the retail, there\u2019s a couple elements to that. The first one is, we\u2019ve done some preliminary remodeling and we take into account kind of the seasonality as well as the differences between on and off peak.","So we try to be more surgical in just saying, we\u2019re going to buyback this. We have a view of the things we need to do. I think as it specifically relates to our retail contracts there is two elements. One is obviously, we have contracts from the books already. And we have some hedges on the books already, so there will be a feathering in effect to the value proposition of this. But most importantly, from our perspective, I think one of the things we offer our customers, and it\u2019s really important, is transparency. And what I mean by that is, when they\u2019re signing a contract with us, they completely understand what they\u2019re doing and what the components of that are fixed-price and the components that are going to be passed through in time.","And I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s always the case across the industry. So from our perspective, there\u2019s lot of elements, and we are thinking about it and we are really managing our portfolio from a natural long position as well as the seasonality and the products. And we\u2019re keeping the customer in mind.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And just in terms of just the \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. In terms of just the power new business change that you made, what \u2013 your sense in making the change. Do you feel like you\u2019ve encompassed kind of a pretty conservative case here at this point, so that this doesn\u2019t become like a series of changes?","Chris Crane","Yes. I think \u2013 yes. The answer to your question is, yes. We think we\u2019ve covered it and I\u2019ll tell you why. When you look at it, it\u2019s really all driven by load business. About 60% of it\u2019s on our retail C&I business at about 40%. It\u2019s associated with our wholesale polar business and there\u2019s really two elements that is different one on each side. On the retail side, as we said, our renewal rates are lower than we expected them to be, but our margins are well within the range that we expect it. And that\u2019s very different when we have these challenges five years ago, where our margins and our renewal rates both dropped pretty appreciably.","On the wholesale side, it\u2019s much more of a margin story, where the volumes are there, but the margins are lower than they\u2019ve been historically. I mean, it\u2019s a very competitive environment. Quite frankly, it\u2019s being driven by a lot of smaller players on the retail side and not the bigger players. On the wholesale side, we\u2019ve seen kind of competition across the spectrum. But we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve captured the changes we need to make.","Steve Fleishman","Great. And I just finally \u2013 I guess in the hindsight, congratulations on adding your Texas gas plants months before all the coal plants shut. But \u2013 I\u2019m sure you planned that out. But did you plan that out? But, I\u2019m just curious given that fact just have your thoughts on the Texas kind of market and potential there changed for you? How you\u2019re thinking about that?","Joe Dominguez","It\u2019s Joe again. And we\u2019ve talked about this for a while. When you look at ERCOT reports on what they thought reserve margins were going to be. We never really thought they were going to get the generation group that they expected. And in our own modeling, we have sensitivities, we ran some sensitivities looking at the possibility for retirements. And if you look at our positioning in ERCOT, we\u2019re carrying a long position there relative to our ratable plan as well.","And we see the opportunity for volatility. I think this summer, we\u2019ve skewed the some, obviously, with the problems with the hurricane in August and, quite frankly, the biggest thing down there as we continue to see load growth, which is really important. And we don\u2019t see a lot of kind of newbuild of gas generation. You have continued growth on the renewable side, but it\u2019s more concentrated in South Texas than it is West Texas. And when you put all that together, we see the opportunity for increased volatility, and we think we have a fleet that will benefit that.","Steve Fleishman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning.","Chris Crane","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, so couple of quick questions, may be going back a little bit on some of the previous discussion here. But with respect to the dividend, how do you think do you think about the stability of cash in the various businesses the various businesses? Obviously, there\u2019s a certain legacy here, but how do you think about the stability from ZEC\u2019s and the retail business? And how do you think about that, at least into the conversation around dividend policy? i.e., can you bank on cash flows out of businesses that are not utilities and\/or think about of a higher payout on the core utilities?","Chris Crane","Sure. So \u2013 as we\u2019ve talked about 4 years ago, 4.5 years ago now, as we restructure the dividend and put our strategy and our focus on really growing the utility business through the acquisition of BGE and then the acquisition of PHI. And it was to theoretically watch the growth in those businesses and have a 70% \u2013 65% to 70% dividend policy, theoretically, at the utilities. Now you know that\u2019s going to cycle during different growth periods. But that was the way we had the dividend set to grow. In the first couple of years, we were starting to get closer to that, giving that accomplished in the early 20s. And so that\u2019s when we came up with the growth policy at 2.5%.","As you can see, the utilities are continuing to grow, although right now, it\u2019s taking cash infusion \u2013 equity infusion from the Holdco through the Genco. But they\u2019re continuing to grow. So our stability of the dividend is very well anchored. Our growth \u2013 potential growth for the dividend is well anchored. As we come through the last couple of years and started to see more reliable or consistent cash flows from the Genco on programs that compensate for the other benefits besides just the energy, you\u2019re seeing a potential that, that can be a dependable cash flow, that can be used for potential return of value to the shareholders.","So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it and we\u2019re presenting it to the board, but the cyclical nature of the commodity market will not leave us, but the certainty of that certain elements on those revenue streams give us the opportunity to look at the world a little bit differently. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ll continue to model it, and we\u2019ve gained greater flexibility with programs like the ZEC.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. And then, let me ask you this. With respect to the utilities, right? I know we\u2019ve had a lot of conversation on the other side of the business. But obviously, you\u2019ve had some reasonable success of late in ComEd around \u2013 how do you say, scaling some of the smart grid efforts? How do you see the ability scale that further? And obviously, this might be getting ahead of the annual process and the CapEx budget, et cetera. But maybe this is more to Anne and thinking about the ComEd prospects beyond 2020 here.","Chris Crane","So let me start off and I\u2019ll let Denis jump in here or Anne on the call. The advent of digitalization of the distribution system and the transmission system is offered us an opportunity for capital investments that directly benefit the customers and drive reliability. We have now put in communications backbones to reach smart meters to help us with fault isolators, fast reclosers, that\u2019s the kind of spend, along with replacing antiquated cable and updating the system with new components.","Now, as we go into the 2020 and beyond, there is a significant amount of work being done on what else can be done to develop into the smart city that we can better serve the communities while investing and driving efficiency into the systems. And the work that\u2019s being done on microgrids, the experimental work there, to see what the societal benefit in certain microgrids in certain locations.","What we can do to integrate with more of the community is there an assistance within the street light programs or assistance that we can provide with our infrastructure on the meter reading of water or gas or other types of systems is where we\u2019ll be going. And I think, this technology is morphing faster than it ever has in our sector. And with our design teams, data scientists, the work that we\u2019re doing on big data, digitization is going to provide us many opportunities for continuing to optimize the system for the customers\u2019 benefit. Denis, I don\u2019t know if I covered it or...","Denis O\u2019Brien","This is Dennis. Chris, I think you covered it pretty well. We\u2019re spending about $5 billion year-end capital. We still see opportunities to continue to invest in convergence relative to our systems to build the systems of the future, whether that\u2019s billing systems, transmissions data systems or others. We see opportunities to continue invest in resiliency and security. We\u2019re seeing opportunities relative to the transmission system as we look at resiliency and security and to build the transmission system of the future.","Chris hit on smart cities and other things like that. And the last thing as you look at the grid of the future and we think about distributed generation, in order to get our system ready for that, that really means about converting some of our lower-voltage circuits into higher-voltage circuits. And so that\u2019s an opportunity for further capital deployment. So we\u2019re deploying about $5 billion of capital a year. We see that continuing and see lots of opportunities to continue to invest in utilities as usual.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","But does that enable kind of accelerating CapEx spend overall? And perhaps, that the core of the question.","Chris Crane","I don\u2019t see \u2013 it\u2019s accelerating the plan. I think we\u2019re at a point that we\u2019re managing efficiently the spent that we have. We also have to balance the impact to the consumer. Spending capital for the sake as spending capital without finding the efficiencies in the delivery into the benefit of the customer, it wouldn\u2019t be prudent. Right now, the projects that we have on schedule, the cash flow that supports that are managed well and they do support what our bottom line. It needs to be as to the benefit of the customer.","Jack Thayer","And one thing I\u2019ll add to that. Our focus on we\u2019re 18 months into PHI acquisition. Our focus now is to get the performance to the right level. We had our best year ever in reliability at PHI last year, which we only had the company since March. We\u2019re going to blow it through that level of reliability this year in a good way. So the first couple of years, how do we get the performance to a good place? How do we write the image and reputation, and improve our regulatory outcomes at PHI.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you all.","Chris Crane","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Good morning and congratulations on the \u2013 announcements and the utility performance.","Chris Crane","Thank, Steve.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to drill into the idea of resiliency laid out as part of energy. Is there a way for us to conceptually think about the valued resiliency or a framework for assessing \u2013 how to appropriately value resiliency? It\u2019s been a tricky thing, I think, for all of us to really think through the high-level idea to make sense just sort of how to go about trying to value that. Is that any suggestions you have in thinking about that?","Joe Dominguez","Steve, it\u2019s Joe Dominguez. If you\u2019ve seen our fleeting, you know that we have a multi-phase process where, in the first instance, we need to get analytics from new RTOs. Can they run without pipelines? What\u2019s the impact for the consumers? We can move from there to design basis for the system that we think is going to iterate between NERC, FERC and kind of the Department of Energy sometime after we get the data.","In terms of how we ultimately implement that into the system, I think once we\u2019ve the design basis, is what we are trying to avoid, we will start looking at mitigation solutions, maybe the retention of additional fuel secure resources to avoid this outage risk. But I think it\u2019s premature to get there. One way you can think about is, though, you can take a look at the capacity performance program.","We were able to value the cost of incremental reliability associated with dual fuel. So if the design basis ultimately ends up being we need 90 days of fuel, we have a mathematical way of calculating what\u2019s the market solution to get dual fuel resources to 90 days of fuel with it. That would probably be the $8 or $10 of megawatt hour in terms of doing that based on the cost we saw in CPAY.","So that\u2019s one approach. But from our perspective, we need to drop back here, take a look at the data, make sure we have the right definition of resiliency, the right design basis and then we come back with market solutions or other solutions that we would ensure resources to mitigate that risk and provide the security we need that we provide to our end customers in the nation.","Chris Crane","And I think the key to that, what Joe said, is a market solution.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. Within that market construct that we have that makes sense. So I want to just shift over the retail business. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion on this call around. Just the competitive playing field, if we do see FERC performs on power price formation and if power prices do rise, would you expect to see a bit of a shakeout amongst smaller retail players? You are not backed up by physical generation. You may misprice the upside risk to power prices. How do you assuming again that we do see kind of formation we expect? Would you say a shakeout there?","Chris Crane","Yes. I think history tell us we would ends up in a volatility of event. And then go back for a number of years. We\u2019ve seen players whether the big or small, whether they are on the C&I side, the residential side or quite frankly, the power loads on the wholesale side. We\u2019ve seen folks who aggressively price the risk or the ultimate price to the customer have been hurt. And as I said, earlier, we had opportunities to acquire companies in that type of environment. We\u2019ve the opportunities to grow our business organically. And we think remaining disciplined to what we\u2019re doing is the right thing to do.","We still have almost 25% of the C&I market. We\u2019re the number one C&I marketer by a huge amounts. We\u2019re the third largest residential marketer in the United States and we compete in all the wholesale power options. So the underlying business is strong. The growth we expect we\u2019re not achieving and I think what discipline will serve us well and we have opportunity to capture some of that back when we see the volatility of event.","Stephen Byrd","That\u2019s great, that\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup.","Praful Mehta","Thanks. Good morning. So my question goes back a little bit to the dividend discussion. And what I was trying to connect the dots on was, you\u2019re already kind hitting your leverage targets, your free cash flow targets, right now, with the current plan. If you do have price reform and if you do have further ZECs coming from other states, then you have that incremental free cash flow. How should we think about that capital allocation? Is that more to both of dividend or way do you think that capital allocation go?","Jack Thayer","First of all, we will look at it in a disciplined way on what is the best way to return value to the shareholders, while maintaining our commitment to the customers. So the plan, as I said, earlier that we started out on over 4.5 years ago is working. We\u2019re reducing our debt. We\u2019re strengthening our balance sheet. We\u2019re reducing our cost. We\u2019re able to make solid investments in our utilities, and we\u2019ve been able to do a part of a dividend increase program as we were doing that.","As you can see, as we get stronger and stronger, opportunities for us to deploy the capital are coming our way, and we\u2019ll make sure that we will look at it in a disciplined fashion. If there are more accretive ways to spend the capital in the utilities, and in a low risk area, that will be something we look at. But as we\u2019ve committed previously, and as we\u2019ve signaled, it\u2019s a conversation that\u2019s ongoing right now. There is opportunities to revise the dividend policy and give you another multi-year plan as we work through the LRP planning process. And we work with our board heading into 2018.","Praful Mehta","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And secondly, in terms of the ZEC\u2019s, if you could just touch on how you think of ZEC\u2019s plays out in different states \u2013 in other states obviously, very high in there. And secondly, how does that fit in with the price formation and the DOE reform. Do you see them interacting? Or if you see them as completely independent?","Joe Dominguez","And this is Joe, again. We\u2019re pleased to see the upcoming in the Connecticut the other day, where all the different structure, the type of premises the same nuclear units are critical for our customers. And we need to preserve them. So that means as set forth on policy front there. We have been very productive discussions both in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. We\u2019ll continue to do that. In terms of the interaction, I see between programs, if we get an upside in price formation, I think that will ultimately be taken into account in the process. So it will not be a double dip here. If prices increase as result on price formation, the cost of the ZEC\u2019s or the cost of the support payments will go down. That\u2019s anticipated.","Praful Mehta","Got it. And you think that\u2019s a dollar per dollar adjustment? Or do you think there\u2019s some benefit that you do keep?","Joe Dominguez","No. I think it\u2019s a dollar per dollar adjustment.","Praful Mehta","Got it. That\u2019s super helpful guys. Thanks so much.","Operator","And for closing remarks.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Idehen, you may begin your conference.","Francis Idehen","Thank you, Reshira. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Jack Thayer, Exelon\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, and Ken Cornew, President and CEO of Exelon Generation. They are joined by other members of Exelon\u2019s senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earning release this morning along with a presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon\u2019s Web site. The earnings release and other matters that we discuss during today\u2019s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could defer from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material, comments made during this call and in the risk factors section of the earnings release. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon\u2019s other fillings for a discussion of factors that may cause the results to differ from management's projections, forecasts, and expectations.","Today\u2019s presentation also includes references to adjusted opening earnings which is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the GAAP earnings. We have scheduled 60 minutes for today's call.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Chris Crane","Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining the call. We had another strong quarter from an operational perspective as well as a financial perspective. As we announced this morning, our operating earnings of $0.78 per share beat expectations and we remain on track to deliver on our financial goals for the year.","Jack's going to discuss the financial performance in more detail in a minute. I am going to just focus on the broader strategy and operational issues. Our strategy continues to leverage the integrated business model that creates value using our strong balance sheet to invest in both regulated and competitive businesses to drive growth. Our investment in Pepco Holdings, Integrys and most recently the two Texas gas plants confirm our commitment to grow on both our regulated and our unregulated side of the business.","Through this model our utilities contribute to earnings stability and provide dividend support while our competitive business provides exposure to market power upside. We are not just resting on the market power to turn around, we are continuing to invest in our core markets and competencies while pursuing opportunities to innovate in adjacent areas. And Ken will elaborate on that when I finish, in how we think about these markets.","We own our assets that are more valuable to others -- when we own assets that are more valuable to others, then we will take a look at selling them as we continue to focus on our recycling of capital into stronger investments. You have seen evidence of that with our announcements on our asset sales this year and we will continue to optimize our portfolio going forward. What drives our success is our focus on operational excellence. Our nuclear fleet continues to run at high capacity factors, 96.5 for the quarter. Our power fleet had a 98.8 dispatch match in our renewable energy capture rate was 94.9.","We also achieved very strong operational metrics in our utilities. Many of our growth areas we are pursuing, such as Pepco Holdings and the Texas gas projects, are directly tied to our ability to operate across our business at consistently high levels.","Switching gears, I want to quickly discuss the capacity market design proposals. There has been a lot of progress at PJM in developing a new capacity performance product and making other designs changes. We are encouraged by PJM's acknowledgment of the value and reliability that comes from firm fuel, particularly given our nuclear units performance and their minimal additional cost of compliance for us for this proposed product. We are keeping a close watch on how the proposal evolves over the next several months and we will continue to remain engaged.","On the Pepco Holding front, we continue to work through various regulatory approval processes. We received approval from Virginia earlier this month and we are working collaboratively with the other jurisdictions. We remain on track to close the transaction in the second or third quarter of 2015. On the nuclear front in Illinois particularly, we continue to engage with the stakeholders as the process goes forward on recognizing the value and the environmental benefit and the economic benefit of these plants to the state. That process as we have said before will continue to work through 2015.","In closing, we are pleased with the results of the quarter. Exelon is operationally strong and positioned to deliver earnings expectations for the full year. We remain committed to deliver sustainable income and provide access to growth opportunities across the energy value chain.","With that, I will turn it over to Ken to discuss in more detail what we're doing with our competitive generation business.","Ken Cornew","Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. We had a very productive quarter at Exelon Generation announcing several development projects and an acquisition. Each of these initiatives leverages our operating and commercial expertise. We are investing in our core business and markets as well as adjacent markets to increase value. We are positioning Exelon to be at the forefront of and capitalize on the evolving energy landscape. We are pursuing investments that meet customer demands across both the electricity and gas value chains.","Along those lines, last month we announced plans to build two CCGTs in Texas using a new GE technology that will make them among the cleanest, most efficient CCGTs in the state and in the nation. The units will be located on existing Exelon sites and will have a combined capacity of over 2000 megawatts, allowing us to build them for more attractive price relative to other new builds in the region. These first of a kind GE gas turbines will provide the highest efficiency and best operational flexibility in the market. The units are designed to ramp faster than any other see CCGT turbines allowing us to better capture market volatility and price movements.","Importantly, being mindful of increased water efficiency in drought prone Texas, these units will be cooled with air instead of water. We expect construction to begin next year and commercial operation in 2017.","Earlier this month we also announced an investment in NET Power. A first of a kind demonstration power plant in Texas that uses carbon dioxide as part of the combustion cycle and produces zero atmospheric emissions. The technology will ultimately produce pipeline quality CO2 that can be sequestered or used in various industrial processes including enhanced oil recovery. This technology is a potential game changer in reducing carbon emissions from power generation and is another step towards Exelon's vision of a clean innovative energy future.","Finally, as you know, we announced the acquisition of Integrys Energy Services at the beginning of the quarter and expect to close that transaction in November. The combination creates a stronger, more diverse business that is well positioned to compete for customers in retail electricity and gas markets across the country. It vastly expands our gas portfolio increasing our load by 150 BCF annually. And it enhances our generational load strategy because many of the power customers currently served by Integrys are in regions where Exelon owns significant generation.","Sifting to the power markets and hedging on slide three. Mild summer weather defined the markets during the third quarter. In July, spot markets cleared at relatively low prices on the back of low demand and strong natural gas supply. Forward market prices followed and bottomed out in the end of July. Since then, forward prices have recovered and are still well above where they were at the beginning of the year. Prices are up approximately $5 a megawatt hour in West Hub and $2.50 a megawatt hour in NI Hub for calendar year '15 and the move in 2016 heat rates and prices are similar.","We believe the price increases are due to the impact of coal retirements as a result of mass implementation next year and we expect this trend to continue. NI Hub should be particularly sensitive to the coal retirements and our hedging strategy reflects that view.","During the third quarter or portfolio management team performed very well. They executed on $150 million of power new business which allowed us to raise our full-year gross margin outlook by $50 million. In addition, we achieved $50 million of non-power new business. For 2015 and 2016 total gross margin is down $200 million and $250 million respectively. Divestitures during the quarter account for $150 million of the decrease in each year and in 2016 lower market prices accounted for the remaining $100 million.","You all know that Exelon Generation stands to benefit significantly from changes in power prices, whether in energy or capacity markets, and we will continue to see improvements in both. In the meantime, we will continue to make investments in market-leading technology and expand our footprint in attractive markets through acquisition.","I will now turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter.","Jack Thayer","Thank you, Ken, and good morning everyone. I will cover Exelon's financial results for the quarter, our full-year guidance range and update our cash outlook for 2014. Starting with our financial results on Slide 4.","We had a strong third quarter and Exelon delivered earnings of $0.78 per share exceeding our guidance and in line with our results for the third quarter of 2013. At Constellation, both wholesale and retail performed well this quarter driving the overall performance at Exelon Generation. During the year we have seen dramatically different market conditions play out and our balanced generation to load strategy has benefited us in each circumstance.","During the first quarter, our reliable, firmly fueled nuclear base load generation supplemented by our dispatchable fleet allowed us to take advantage of the volatility created by the polar vortex, while successfully managing our load obligations. Our portfolio benefits from our load serving business in periods of low volatility like we saw this summer. We experienced lower cost associated with ancillary services, load following costs, specifically hourly LMP shaping and variable load risks and power basis. Post polar vortex and with the expectation of greater volatility in the future due to coal plant retirements and market rule changes, we are charging appropriate load following costs. We have seen the success of this strategy throughout the market cycle.","For the full year we are narrowing our guidance range to $2.30 to $2.50 per share from our previous guidance of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. We expect to deliver 2014 results comfortably within the revised full-year guidance range. One of our key assumptions is that bonus depreciation expires as scheduled. If extended by Congress, we will benefit economically with a positive cash flow impact of approximately $80 million in 2014 and in the ballpark of $1 billion in 2015. However, we would expect to see a $0.05 per share drag on our full-year earnings which is not factored into our current guidance for 2014 or 2015.","Turning to utilities on Slide 5. They delivered combined earnings of $0.29 for the quarter. For the third quarter, ComEd earned $0.15 per share. We are on track to have a decision in our most recent formula rate case in December. On October 22, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved the Grand Prairie Gateway, 345 KV transmission line project. The nearly $260 million project will connect ComEd's Byron and Wayne substations, alleviating identified congestion and providing net savings to northern Illinois customers of more than $250 million within the first 15 years of operation.","Construction of the transmission line is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2015 and the line is expected to be in service by the second quarter of 2017. Including this project, ComEd is on track to invest more than $1.7 billion in 2014, which is approximately $300 million more than last year. This includes over $400 million related to EIMA and is consistent with our investment strategy to continue improving reliability and system performance in the ComEd's service territory.","PECO's earnings were $0.09 per share for the third quarter. Through the end of September PECO has substantially completed the installation of advanced meters and grid for electric customers. Nearly 1.5 million meters with an overall investment of approximately $700 million with $200 million of that funded by the DOE. We are well into the deployment of upgraded natural gas meter modules, installing more than 120,000 modules. We expect the installation will be complete in the second quarter of 2015. This technology brings significant benefits to PECO and its customers. In addition to helping the company further improve storm restoration and improve operational efficiencies, the technology also helps customers better understand and manage their energy use and cost.","BGE delivered $0.05 per share this quarter. On October 17, BGE reached the unanimous settlement agreement on its rate case which was filed with the Maryland Public Service Commission. The settlement includes a total revenue requirement increase of $60 million between electric and gas. In addition, the settlement allows for a $20 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense. This is the first BGE rate case settlement since 1999 and is the result of an improving regulatory environment in Maryland. It still must be approved by the Maryland PSC before it becomes effective. The earliest new rates would go into effect would be mid-December.","Slide 6 provides an update of our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of nearly $7.5 billion. This compares to $6.975 billion last quarter. The variance is primarily driven by additional proceeds from asset divestitures.","Turning to our asset sale program. We announced agreement to sell our Fore River, Quail Run and West Valley units during the third quarter. Our total gross proceeds from these plants and Safe Harbor will be $1.3 billion. On an after-tax basis, net proceeds from these sales will be more than $975 million. Further, on October 24 we entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of our interest in Keystone and Conemaugh to an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners for $470 million of gross proceeds, inclusive of approximately $60 million of working capital or $418 million on an after-tax basis. We expect to close this transaction late this year or early next year.","Please note that the sale of Keystone\/Conemaugh is not included in our cash forecast or reflected in our commercial disclosures. We will update these disclosures on the fourth quarter call. However, we expect to take an impairment loss of $350 million-$450 million which will be reflected in the fourth quarter. This is non-operating and will not impact full-year EPS guidance. We anticipate closing the Integrys transaction in the fourth quarter. The purchase price and working capital of approximately $325 million is reflected in the cash from operations.","On the financing side, we completed the $695 million financing of ExGen Texas Power, a diverse portfolio of CCGTs and peakers in ERCOT North and Houston zones. Since the third quarter of last year we have project financed approximately $1.75 billion, providing capital to allow us to explore growth opportunities for Exelon Generation. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts.","Now I will turn the call over to Chris for his concluding remarks before we open the line for Q&A.","Chris Crane","Before I turn it over Q&A, I want to close with some more remarks on Illinois. There has been a fair amount of speculation and some misreporting on what we're looking for in Illinois so I want to be clear. We are not looking for a bailout. We have a strong record of opposing non-market-based solutions not only in Illinois but in other states as well. What we are seeking to keep the plants operating is a solution that recognizes the clean attributes of nuclear as done with other sources that we compete against within this market. Examples of such a solution would be a clean energy standard or carbon regime like a RGGI, Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.","So there has been recent publications of reports that clearly articulate the significant contribution to the state and local economy as well as the environmental benefits from our nuclear plants, and we agree with those totally. Various state agencies including the state EPA and the ICC continue to work on the issue in a coordinated fashion and we hope that a positive conclusion will be reached by the end of the legislative session next May.","So thank you and we look forward to seeing all of you at EEI and with that we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group. I am sorry, your first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Sorry, Greg. So just a couple of quick questions. First, on the 2014 guidance update, the overall number is the same midpoint but it seems like there is $0.10 to $0.15 more at ExGen and $0.10 to $0.15 less at the utilities. Could you just kind of give a quick snippet of explanation for the changes in each?","Jack Thayer","Sure, Steve. This is Jack. So I will start with the utilities where I think it's simplest. We have had significant storm expense this year, particularly at PECO and BGE. And then as you think about the formula rate at ComEd, interest rates, it's based of the 30-year treasury. As that's declined our allowed return has declined with that. So that's been a headwind for the year. And when you aggregate those, that's on the utilities side really kind of bringing down the expected contribution relative to plan from the utilities. That said, both the formula rate and increased rates of BGE have been an offset to that and been a positive for the year.","On the Exelon Generation side, clearly you are seeing the benefit of a number of positive outcomes. Strong performance from Constellation. You are seeing the elimination benefit of the DOE fee. But we have had some increase outages this year. We have had higher costs associated with purchasing power during the polar vortex. So, again, speaking to the benefit of the balance load gen strategy, the opportunity to participate in the polar vortex and that volatility was a benefit at Constellation during the winter. The opportunity to have lower cost to serve during the summer was also a benefit at Constellation which I think you are seeing in the very strong improvement in the hedge disclosures as those positives have benefited our overall outlook.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Okay. Great. And I guess one other question is, just in thinking about all the asset sales and your forecast. I guess when you give like 17 at EEI, will this money have been reinvested in something or is it all going into Pepco which you we are not, you won't have the numbers for Pepco in your guidance yet? So where is all that, yes?","Jack Thayer","No, I understand the question. You will recall when we announced the Pepco transaction, we had highlighted that we would use $1 billion of those proceeds from asset sales to fund that investment. And at that time, we disclosed that we expected the impact of the asset sales, the lost contribution from those assets, the addition of Pepco, to be $0.15 to $0.20 accretive in 2017. The proceeds to date, as you know are in excess of that billion. We will have, including Key\/Con, roughly $1.4 billon of after-tax proceeds. And we will incorporate that into our disclosures as we move forward.","I would say that we believe that the very attractive prices that we have received are helping us to fund the growth, whether it's at the two combined-cycle plants in Texas, whether it's at the acquisition of Integrys, cash is somewhat fungible. But we are doing a lot that we think is very positive on the Exelon Generation side of our business to invest and grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","So Steve, thankfully, did not ask my question. When we are looking at the gross margin update, just want to be clear on what is baked in and what isn't baked in. So you've just announced the sale of Key\/Con, so the lower volumes and the lower gross margin associated with the sale of Key\/Con are not yet factored in. Is that correct?","Jack Thayer","That\u2019s correct.","Joseph Nigro","Steve, it's Joe Nigro. They are not factored into the disclosure.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","And is the Integrys acquisition factored in yet?","Joseph Nigro","No.","Jack Thayer","It is not.","Joseph Nigro","It is not.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Okay. So neither is factored in?","Joseph Nigro","That\u2019s correct.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","And when you give us the 2017, when you roll it, are you going to include an assumption for the contribution from the new Texas power plants or will they be up and running beginning of '17, middle of '17, end of 2017?","Joseph Nigro","Yes. When we roll out '17 and EEI you will see the assumptions of the new Texas power plants in the open gross margin calculation.","Chris Crane","And, Greg, we plan on having those units up and running prior to the summer of 2017.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Great. Can you maybe spend a little bit more time explaining how you were able to reduce the cost of serving your load so much that you were able to put up a really strong quarter despite the fact that, I presume, you actually delivered variable load risk. Probably came in on the downside of your expectation of what you would serve in the quarter in terms of the load in the retail business. So can you explain a little bit more how you were able to more than offset that on the cost side?","Joseph Nigro","Yes, Greg, there were really four elements to the success in the quarter and three of them are directly related to load. I think Jack said this and I will reiterate it. I think if you look at the first quarter, we got a huge benefit on the generation side because us like everybody else incurred substantial charges on our load book in Q1 but we got the benefit of the generation in the first quarter. In the third quarter, it was directly related to the fact that we had estimates of what cost to serve would be in three big buckets. One you just mentioned, the variable load shape.","The second is there is ancillary service cost estimates and then the third piece is, and I am talking, let's stay in PJM for a second because we have quite a bit of load in PJM. We have estimates as to what specific location of cost or basis cost would be. In all three of those buckets, the cost came in substantially lower than what we were expecting them to be. And so we got the benefit of that by serving load at contracted prices. The fourth element which really isn't tied to load directly but it's more of a general portfolio management comment, is we benefited from our spot optimization as well. Shaping of our generation to match our load and running short schedules. Price protection to the downside that we have purchased prior to the quarter and got the benefit of. As well as when we did see some volatility we had some opportunity with our excess generation to capitalize on that as well. So really, it's truly a story of generation and load.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Just kind of following up on these asset sales. Can you help put in context the idea of selling down some PJM capacity ahead of RPM rule changes. The idea of investing in ERCOT before there is any demonstrative move and maybe some policy changes there? Just kind of how you guys are seeing these kind of two major power markets evolve that's maybe leading to some capital allocation decisions?","Chris Crane","Dan, what don\u2019t I speak to the assets sales side and then Ken can speak to the investment side within ERCOT. There's no question that the discussion and commentary around the proposed capacity performance market factored into the pricing. We started our process in advanced of that but the commentary was well understood by the buyers. It was factored into the pricing. And while we didn\u2019t have absolute clarity on how that market will develop, certainly it played in the element in the investment decision for the buyer.","Clearly we have an internal view on how that market will evolve and what it's near term and more importantly longer term impacts will be on asset values. And we have factored that into our decision to sell Key\/Con as well. As you will know, we were close to $1 billion of net proceeds. We didn\u2019t need to sell this asset. We viewed it as a very attractive price and one that viewed as an opportunity to recycle that capital and invest in Texas opportunity and others. Ken?","Ken Cornew","Yes, Dan. I am sure you realize at this point we have been working on this Texas opportunity for a while now. We had sites that were set up very well to construct. Bringing GE and Exelon together was very leveraging in terms of putting the best technology forward that we could and doing at a very very low cost. And we are excited about the ERCOT market and its fundamentals going forward. We think that these plants will show up right about at the right time when ERCOT needs power and we think we have a technology and location advantage that obviously we have been working on and we are implementing that strategy as such. So for us this is a deployment to better technology. It's a deployment to lower cost and a deployment to more upside for ExGen.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Ken, when you think about the ERCOT market, you highlight the air cooled nature of these plants and with the CSAPR rules kind of evolving or coming back again. Are those having bearing or is there a way to think about the economic value of both CSAPR coming back and maybe water use issues in Texas as to help put this in a better cost position?","Ken Cornew","Clearly our strategy to go air cooled is a good one for Texas given the water constraints that are there. And our strategy to put efficient, clean, lowest in the stack combined-cycle is going to be constructive in environmental regulation space. That\u2019s all upside for us. We looked at the economics of these plants, where they sit on the stack and how they can respond to price movements and they will stand on their own because of that. And I think what you mentioned is potentially even more upside.","Chris Crane","Let me just elaborate on the water side. When you go to build a new asset and you try to secure water in the ERCOT market, you are building a 20 to 30 year asset with a contract that can only extend for three years. The air cooled nature of these assets guarantee their availability and their capability of returning value for many years to come while they, as Ken pointed out, they have the best mechanical heat rate and the best ramping speed to capture and to operate in a market that\u2019s heavily saturated with renewables.","Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse","Okay, got it. I guess one last question just on the CO2 front. There is kind of two big gubernatorial elections in Illinois and Pennsylvania this year. In Illinois, what has been the comments I guess between the two candidates, or is there any difference in willingness to consider supporting if somebody puts the value on the nuclear assets? And then in Pennsylvania, I believe candidate Wolf has come out in favor of some carbon policy. Where do you guys see that potentially playing through?","Joseph Dominguez","This is Joe Dominguez. I think you have captured it well in Illinois, I think the -- excuse me, in Pennsylvania. I think candidate Wolf has talked about joining RGGI if he becomes the governor. And I think that would be their compliance mechanism, at least based on what he said. Obviously, if Corbett remains in offices, he has been opposed to carbon trading regimes historically. So that\u2019s a big toggle there. In terms of Illinois, there hasn\u2019t been a lot of focus on who the different candidates would deal with carbon going forward. Not an opposition certainly to carbon trading from either candidate at this point. We think both will recognize the inherent value of nuclear, both from a reliability and claims standpoint. So we don\u2019t think the game changes materially depending on the gubernatorial election and what's going on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","I wanted to talk about the forward power market versus fundamental view that you have. Since March we have seen the PJM East on peak heat rates for 2016, rise about 3500 from about 12,000 to 15,500. When you look at your fundamental view of heat rates and then also sort of new build economics when you combine capacity prices plus spark spreads which were 16 or up about 40% at PJM East. Can you give us your view on your fundamental power view relative to the forwards?","Joseph Nigro","Yes. Stephen, it's Joe Nigro. If I start in PJM East, I would say that in the '15-'16 timeframe we think that the PJM West hub prices are generally fairly priced. There is a small big of upside in '16. When you go out to '17--'18, we do see increasing upside. I think on the NI Hub side, it's safe to say that there is quite a bit of upside both in the '15-'16 timeframe and more so in '17-'18. And some of that is related to the facts that you just have better liquidity in the front end of the curve, 2015 in particular. And we have seen quite a bit of heat rate expansion as you mentioned in the last few months in '15 related to the back end.","That all takes into account normal weather and normal operations. Some of the changes that PJM is talking about related to things like dynamic reserves that they are looking at implementing in the course of the year, would be incremental upside to what I'm talking about and it's not factored into our fundamental focused. From a fundamental forecasting perspective, we spend a lot of time scrubbing the stack as to what we expect to be added into the stack and what changes we would expect. I think it's safe to say, when you look at the new build economics for CCGTs in the Midwest, they are pretty challenged given the fact where energy prices are and the associated capacity prices.","You are much closer to breakeven economics in the mid-Atlantic. And that gets into where the market spark spreads are and where the capacity prices are but they are generally close to breakeven economics.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you. The first part of what you said, Joe, you were talking about PJM West. Was that also designed to cover PJM East or what's (indiscernible) that I understood the first part ?","Joseph Nigro","They are generally pretty close. There's probably slightly more upside at, let's call PJM West hub then there is at East hub. And there would be increasing upside as you move further west in PJM to NI Hub for example.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Understood. So PJM East in your view is more closer to fair value...","Joseph Nigro","Yes.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","But not overstated. Okay. And then shifting over to the utility. We just talked a little bit about PECO and low growth expectations. Longer term beyond, it just looks like for this quarter and next quarter, the low growth numbers are a bit lower than before. Can you talk a little bit more fundamentally about the PECO territory and your thoughts on load growth longer term?","Chris Crane","Denis, you want to cover that?","Denis O\u2019Brien","The longer-term load growth in all three areas is really pretty flat. I mean I think we may see load growth anywhere between a zero and 1% over the next few years but we are not seeing anything now really significant.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Could I ask a question about how you see demand response playing out, particularly in PJM? I mean you are obviously a large owner of utilities and PJM seems to have the strategy that DR is going to reorganize itself under the umbrella of states and utilities. So sitting on both sides of that equation, do you have a view on how this can work and what the impact on sort of the amount of that product in the market might be under different scenarios? Anything you could say there?","Joseph Dominguez","Sure. Jonathan. This is Joe Dominguez again. Obviously a very dynamic situation. We have a court order delaying the mandate at FERC. We will see if FERC is able to move forward with an appeal to the Supreme Court. So the decision isn't final until at least that determination is made. We think demand and the response is a very important tool in the market. It's an important tool for customers. It helps to keep prices low. And as long as it does exactly the same thing as generation, we think it needs to be a component of the market. We have looked at the white paper that PJM circulated. I think it begins a good discussion. Obviously, if the LSEs are going to be in the contracting role for DR, there has got to be a lot of work done between FERC, the states and the industry ultimately to make sure the product is defined appropriately in a uniform manner and then is included in the load forecast.","We think that makes a lot of sense. As you know, FirstEnergy has filed a complaint and they had some requested relief to strip out DR out of the markets and rerun the last option. We don't support that. What we do support, prompt action by FERC to define the new DR market to work with the states to implement it. But to close, we see it as a continuing and important tool and there is a good deal of work in our view to be done in how it gets defined and implemented.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Do you think that implementation can practically be achieved by next May's auction in the same type of scale that it's at today?","Chris Crane","No, I don't think so. I think the timing is going to be very difficult. Particularly if FERC appears the matter to the Supreme Court, we are not going to have a decision by the Supreme Court in all likelihood until March which is going to be a challenge for all the stakeholders to develop programs and have it implemented, assuming the appeal isn't granted. If it is granted, I think things will obviously stay and we will all wait the decision from the Supreme Court. But even if the Supreme Court doesn't hear the matter, it's going to be hard to imagine that we will have all the predicate work done to fully involve DR to the full extent that it's already participating, which was your question.","That's different than saying that there can be no DR participation. I think we will get some DR participation on the load side even if the timing is constrained. Just probably not as much as we have seen.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. Thank you for that. Can I ask just on another topic. On the Illinois process, Chris, I think at the outset you said you think that it will continue through 2015 but then you also said you are hoping that there will be some sort of determination by the time the legislature wraps up. Could you just maybe elaborate a bit more on what you see the steps in this process to be and timing of them?","Chris Crane","Yes. At the end of the last session there was mandates given by the legislature to different state agencies to review the environmental and economic support of these units that are in Illinois. That is ongoing. And as I mentioned, it's a coordinated, collaborative process and dialogue that's underway right now. I wouldn't speculate what the final outcome look. We are suggesting, is their potential for a clean energy standard as we have discussed before. That has to be vetted through to see if that's the right avenue going forward. We are just holding that it needs to be a market-based reform in support of the assets as the state currently supports renewables, clean coal and other sources.","So the sources we compete against are already recognized for the value that the provide and that's what we are looking for. So we had made the agreement with the states since they were open to having discussions about compensating for the value that they provide, that we would slow any decision on what the long-term aspects or the long-term viability of some of the plants would be. And so we hope that we see a path clear by the end of this session coming up in May. And if not, we will have discussions on the other side, looking at the economics of the plants.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","My memory says that the state agencies were supposed to come out in November. Is that correct and do you still -- are you expecting that to happen on time?","Chris Crane","Yes. Actually they have a window between November 15 and January 15 to issue those reports. So the earliest we will see in is November 15. Hard to say whether they are going to hit the earlier part of the target but I am very confident that they will get their work done within the 60 day period.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","You are obviously intermittently involved in discussions around the reforms to the PJM capacity market architecture and I am sure you have modeled the potential impact of the various different changes that have been proposed. I was wondering if, similar to the detailed discussion that you provided of your expectations for energy prices, you might provide more color on what you expect the impact of the proposed reforms to be over what period of time. And perhaps also give us your assessment of the likelihood of these reforms being accepted by FERC in time for the next auction?","Chris Crane","So we don't want to speculate. The process is very fluid right now on the design and how it would go forward. So we don't want to speculate or start to put a stick in what we think the value is to us. We first want to get the design right so we understand that the capacity will be there and the system will be secure. As the process moves forward we may be able to do that but it's some time off. We believe that the commitment that PJM has made and their board has made to addressing this process or to addressing these revisions to the process, will be done in a timely enough manner to allow FERC to review and make judgment before the next auction. So we feel good about that part of it but it's too early to speculate on value proposition here.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford Bernstein","Just a follow-up on that. You've in the past, obviously have been quite bullish in your forecast about energy prices in PJM and to a certain degree that's played out. Yet the decision to invest when it was taken was taken in Texas. Could you comment on the relative economics of the two markets. Why you favor Texas over PJM and whether the prospective changes in the capacity market in PJM might allow you to make a similar new build decision in the future closer to your core markets?","Chris Crane","Sure. There is a couple of ways to look at that. One is, we have is still a significant upside to the energy and capacity market in PJM. The divestiture of our partial ownership in those assets will not be material, depending on which way the market goes. We have talked in the past about continued geographic diversification of our generating portfolio. ERCOT is a core market. It's not an adjacent market. It's one that we work in now with our wholesale and retail portfolio, our generating assets. We have continued to maintain a very positive stance on ERCOT and stated previously that we will continue to look for opportunities to invest in it. And that's what these units are. The technology, the Brownfield location, the nature of their cooling will allow them to to take a spot in the dispatch stack that will allow us to recover the value that we need for making such an investment.","We continue to monitor the PJM market. The needs for generating assets. In some areas we are somewhat constrained based off of the market power, a view of where we would want to build plants or could build plants. But there may be potential opportunities coming forward as plants retire and the market tightens and the capacity market revisions come in that we might be able to deploy the technology that would give us the return on value that we are seeing in ERCOT market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","In the opening remarks you all had stated that in the gross margin numbers, taking out Safe Harbor and the three gas-fired plants, I think took out about $150 million annually from the gross margins. Just to complete that picture on a pro forma basis. If you take out Keystone\/Conemaugh, how much further reductions should we assume just from a pro forma basis?","Jack Thayer","It would be roughly $150 million in 2015 in gross margin and about $100 million in 2016.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Just from those two divestitures?","Jack Thayer","Correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. And then second question. Jack, you alluded to Pepco and the net impact in '17 from that acquisition. Can you remind me, the equity units, $1.15 billion, if I recall correctly, they have to be converted into equity in mid-'17...","Jack Thayer","That's right.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","At the then prevailing equity price. Is that correct?","Jack Thayer","That's correct.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And so in your [revision] (ph) obviously you...","Jack Thayer","Ali, obviously a floor of $35. We participate in the upside if the shares are higher at that point all the way up to a 25% premium.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. Okay. And so in your math obviously you have made that conversion when you were running that math?","Jack Thayer","Absolutely.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And my last question for you guys. Chris, obviously you've been fairly active on the divestiture front with your capacity. You are building Greenfield plants in Texas. As you look at the landscape right now, are you seeing more opportunities to buy or sell given the kind of prices that may be out there for existing assets?","Chris Crane","Yes. Just to clarify, the assets in Texas are on Brownfield sites and that helps their cost basis significantly with the infrastructure to support the plants already being there. Right now the market has priced assets higher than we, in some cases higher than we can see that value ourselves. And we have participated, will continue to participate in the sales process looking at the potential purchase of assets as they come to the market. But they have been trading at, as we see, a premium. And that was what led us to the divestiture of some of the assets that we have. They didn't have the earnings capability with their dispatchability and their capacity factors or the nature of the agreement of ownership that we value them as well as others in the market are willing to pay.","So we don't see much more in the way of asset optimization beyond what we have discussed previously. We will continue to participate. But we do see other markets as a potential investment on a new build. If it's peakers in some areas or highly efficient units in others. But don't expect to see a lot of transactions either way just because of the market values on them right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","I guess my first question is that PJM is talking about incremental auctions as part of their capacity performance transition plan. Can you speak to the effect of re-running past auctions on retail contracts that you currently have outstanding and whether those contracts would somehow have the ability to reprice?","Jack Thayer","First of all, we think the impact would begin in '16,'17, so not in the '15, '16 timeframe. And as you know, most of our contracts are called within that 30 month tenure. Contracts that would be affected we believe on the fixed price side contracts that the change in law clause would be relevant in this instance, and we would invoke that given the changes that we are talking about.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","So you would have some ability to pass through the cost?","Chris Crane","Correct. To our retail -- in most instances. There are instances on our retail customers where you can't but in most instances you can.","Ken Cornew","And, Paul, this is Ken. I would just add that we have been aware of this situation or what I would call exposure risk and are treating it appropriately in our pricing of customers as we continue to compete for them.","Jack Thayer","And the retail component of it is only one side of it. As you transition into these things there is going to be a generation benefit on the other side. So you would have to look at the net effect of all that.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","And then when we think of the capacity performance market and what you are asking for potentially either in New England or New York with your nuclear plants, what would the implementation of this type of a scheme by PJM do with respect to your desire to have some form of fixed price protection for the nuclear plants?","Jack Thayer","I think what Chris has been saying is, we are not looking for fixed price protection in the way of a PPA or a guarantee of a price. What we see the reform is doing is, in the first instance, curing a real reliability problem that we have in PJM. The problem that we see growing worse over the next few years. And that's the first and most important focus of our work. What it will do is it will provide potential additional compensation for firm fuel resources. Resources that are reliable, like nuclear units. And it will punish resources that don't perform well. And what we saw out of this past winter is a lot of units did not perform well and that's created a real problem that needs to be addressed.","But it really, it doesn't relate, I don't think to anything that would provide a guarantee of a payment for the nuclear assets. It's not nuclear specific. Any unit that performs well and secures its fuel will have the opportunity to earn a little bit more. Those units that don't perform well and don't have firm fuel will be exposed to severe penalties for non-performance which is the way it should be.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","I guess I'm still not understanding. So what additional support would the states potentially be providing under in terms of compensation for those units?","Jack Thayer","I think we are mixing two things. We are mixing a reliability need that's going to be addressed by the PJM reforms. The reforms in terms of 111(d) and zero emission energy is the focus of our work at this day. And as Chris said, over the last six years Illinois has passed laws that essentially provide market-based credit opportunities for all types of zero emission energy with the exception of nuclear. And the focus of our activities in Illinois will be to include nuclear and give it an opportunity to compete on a best price basis for those clean air attributes.","Chris Crane","We have made it clear over the last three years in a very pointed way the unintended consequences of subsidizing one clean source against another. And the unintended consequences come to roost. And so what we are trying to is fix what has happened between the subsidized PTCs and other forms of enablement for those more expensive sources to come to market. So we are looking at the market fix in what would be a fair treatment of all the renewable or clean generating assets within the market.","Paul Fremont - Jefferies","And then my last question is, in Texas, what would you estimate is sort of the lower cost to build at your existing site per KW?","Chris Crane","Yes. We have said we are spending about $1.4 billion on these plants and they are going to be in excess of 1000 megawatt each. So you can do the math. It's going to be our around 700 a KW.","Operator","And your last question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","You touched on this a little bit, but could you just go back to kind of the upside that you saw in the third quarter. Was it all ExGen or was it at the utilities as well?","Ken Cornew","The benefit in the third quarter was exclusively ExGen.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Did it make up for some shortfalls at the utilities?","Ken Cornew","You had some storm expense at the utilities. Then you also had elements of the decline in interest rates around treasuries factoring into our earned return at ComEd.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","So relative to your guidance, the utilities underperformed and that was more than offset by ExGen?","Ken Cornew","I would say they modestly underperformed and it was meaningfully offset by ExGen.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great. Thank you, very much.","Francis Idehen","Okay. Thank you, very much. That will conclude the third quarter call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"8787":["Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ:EXC) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call May  2, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Dan Eggers - Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance","Chris Crane - President and Chief Executive Officer","Joe Nigro - Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Kathleen Barr\u00f3n - Senior Vice President, Federal Regulatory Affairs and Wholesale Market Policy","Conference Call Participants","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Good morning. My name is Lindsey and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the 2019 Q1 Exelon Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance, you may begin your conference.","Dan Eggers","Thank you, Lindsey. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are: Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's Senior Management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. ","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call.","Please refer today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Chris Crane","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During the quarter, we achieved success on several key fronts and reached a couple of milestones. First, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the ZEC cases clearing the last legal challenge at the federal level for the Illinois and New York programs. The decision affirms that states have the right to protect their citizens by favoring clean energy and it is a win for the consumers, policymakers and the regulators.","Second, we received credit upgrades from both S&P and Fitch. These upgrades recognizes successful execution on our utility-driven growth strategy and reduction in business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics.","Third, we reached settlements in New Jersey, on the ACE rate case and the infrastructure investment program. These outcomes reflect the continued positive evolution of our partnership with regulators built on improvement and reliability and customer satisfaction.","Finally, turning to slide 5, in March, we celebrated the seventh anniversary of the Constellation merger and the third anniversary of the PHI merger. Each merger has positively contributed to our strategy of increasing our regulated business mix and providing more stable earnings. Before these mergers, Exelon earned a mix of 28% utilities, 72% generation. In 2021, we project that mix will have flopped with nearly 70% earnings coming from the utilities.","Through the Constellation merger, we grew our regulated earnings with the addition of BGE and also benefit from the combination of Exelon and Constellation's competitive business creating an industry leader integrated business that supports sufficiently hedging of plans while capturing incremental margins and cash flows.","The PHI merger further advanced our strategy to become more regulated, while creating value for customers and communities we serve. We are meeting or exceeding all of our reliability merger commitments and customer across the PHI service territory and experiencing record reliability.","The frequency and duration of outages have improved at each utility. Customers are out of power less frequency \u2013 with less frequency and are restored the service much faster when out of power.","In 2018, Delmarva customers had lowest frequency of outages. At Pepco, customers saw the fastest restoration time. And customer satisfaction is at all-time high at ACE, Delmarva and Pepco. We're also delivering on our promise to be a true partner with the communities we serve. The PHI utilities have contributed more than $470 million in total economic impact since the merger closed.","In 2018 alone, these utilities spent $313 million with minority and women owned suppliers, which is between 22% and 29% of each utility's total procurement spend. Each utility has made investments in workforce development programs, including partnering with the District of Columbia to create the DC Infrastructure Academy.","We are also an important community partner for hundreds of organizations in the PHI service territory, contributing more than $15 million in financial support and volunteering approximately 85,000 hours since the merger was approved. Because of the improved service and enhanced partnership with our communities, we are building trust in our jurisdictions and are seeing a more positive regulatory environment develop.","Since the merger, we have reached constructive settlements in each of the PHI jurisdictions including Pepco, Maryland and DC, and we've had our first settlements since 1980s. Exelon has delivered on the promises we made to our customers and the communities and the shareholders when we merged with PHI in 2016.","Turning to our financial results, on slide 6, we had a strong quarter. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.93 per share versus $0.60 per share last year. On a non-GAAP operating basis, we earned $0.87 per share versus $0.96 per share last year. Joe will cover the drivers in his remarks.","Turning to slide 7, at the utilities, we continue to execute the top quartile levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making are resulting in improved reliability, which is strengthening our relationship with our customers and the regulators.","We remain focused on helping our customers and communities become more energy efficient, saving energy and money. We have been doing this for years, and I'm happy to say once again the EPA named all five of our eligible companies, BGE, ComEd, Delmarva, PECO, and Pepco as 2018 ENERGY STAR partners of the year.","Generation performed well during the quarter. Nuclear produced 39.2 terawatt-hours of zero emission electricity with a capacity factor of 97.1%, the best quarter performance in more than 10 years.","During the polar vortex where the temperatures were significantly below zero, our fleet ran at full power keeping families in our markets safe and warm. Exelon power and gas and hydro dispatch match of 97.8% and wind and solar capture of 96.5% exceeding plan.","Moving on to slide 8, since the beginning of the year, there has been a number of important developments. U.S. Supreme Court upheld the clean energy programs. Illinois is looking to advance its clean energy goals. Pennsylvania is considering adding nuclear to its alternative energy standard.","New Jersey awarded zero emission credits. PJM has made scarcity filing in March with the request approval date by mid-December, and first act on fast-start energy pricing reforms.","These actions recognize the importance of preserving existing resources of carbon-free energy, addressing the -- and addressing the underlying deficiencies in the market. In Illinois, legislation was introduced that would require the Illinois Power Authority to procure clean capacity for ComEd customers using that fixed resource requirement mechanism that is currently in the PJM tariff.","In addition, to supporting a course of truly clean energy future in Illinois, the legislation will also ensure that consumers pay less than they do today. The concept of the FRR has a wide support and has been endorsed by the Illinois CUB, the Clean Jobs Coalition and organized labor.","Another piece of legislation has been introduced into Illinois to extend the formula rate. ComEd's formula rate provides tangible benefits to the consumers as well as certainty we need to make investments and improve reliability and resiliency in customer service, while keeping the bills affordable.","In the nine years that ComEd has filed the formula rate, we have asked for rate decreases four times. It's a busy legislative season as Governor Pritzker and the General Assembly tackle Illinois' significant budget problems. However, we are optimistic these two priorities can get done this year.","In Pennsylvania, bipartisan group in the House and Senate introduced legislation that would treat nuclear equal to other non-emitting resources by adding it to the ultimate energy portfolio standard.","Several hearings have been held in the House and Senate on the bill, but it's not clear the action will be taken in time to reverse our decision to retire TMI. We also achieved two important milestones for our existing ZEC programs in April. First, as mentioned, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the challenges, the New York and Illinois ZEC programs, consistent with the resounding decision we received from the district and the circuit courts. Second, the New Jersey BPU awarded ZECs to all three New Jersey \u2013 units in New Jersey allowing them to continue to provide zero-carbon energy to the state. We are pleased to see the states moving forward with thoughtful energy policy that preserves the rights to chart a clean energy future.","Finally, turning to FERC and PJM, we are pleased FERC acting on the fast-start reforms that expand the price setting eligibility for block loaded resources. FERC has requested that PJM submit a compliance filing by July 31st and we expect the reforms to be implemented shortly after that. In addition, PJM filed, they a 206 petition to improve the pricing of reserves, which we have previously referred to as scarcity or ORDC reforms. These reforms along with base load price formation are essential to preserve an effective competitive market in PJM, and we're happy to see the programs being made to address these clear needs.","Turning to slide 9. Much of the policy work, we've engaged in including preserving zero-carbon generation, we have viewed as necessary to bridge a comprehensive carbon policy, in the past time, not just for the government, but for every business, most particularly energy businesses along with their customers and stakeholders to take action on reducing carbon emissions.","For several decades, Exelon has been positioning itself for a carbon-constrained world and acting as a leader advocating for carbon policy at the state and federal level. We have built the cleanest power generation company in the country, we have divested or retired all of our coal generation and invested in renewables and increasing our output of our nuclear fuel.","As a result, Exelon has produced more clean energy than any other company in the United States by a factor of two, and out of nine\u2014every nine clean megawatts in the U.S. comes from an Exelon plant. We've avoided 67.8 million metric tons of greenhouse gas, the equivalent of making or taking 14.5 million cars off the road through two previous carbon reduction goals, and we are on track to meet the most recent goal of 15% additional reduction of emissions from internal operations. We're a leading voice in supporting policies and regulations that require reduced emissions and encourage technology changes, and across our businesses, we working to enable clean energy solutions for our customers and communities.","In 2018 alone, our energy efficiency program saved customers 21.9 million megawatt-hours of electricity avoiding 9.9 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission. We're investing in electric transportation and charging infrastructure at both utilities and Constellation. Exelon is also involved in grid scale energy storage development to enable faster and greater reliability for the use of renewables.","One example of this is through our efforts to launch the Volta Energy, which works with the national labs and research universities to commercialize new technologies. The world is changing in terms of awareness of the scope of climate change and the need for new potential solutions.","Our customers, our cities and our communities, as well as our employees are demanding clean power. So that is what we intend to provide. We still have a long way to go, but the engagements that we're seeing at the state level affirms our view that these policies will be part of our country's future.","With that, now I'll turn it over to Joe to continue the call.","Joe Nigro","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and quarterly financial updates including trailing 12 months ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures.","Starting with slide number 10, we had a strong quarter financially. We earned $0.93 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the upper end of our guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per share. Our performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations, including a positive $0.01 of net benefit around timing of expenses.","Exelon utilities delivered a combined $0.56 per share, net of holding company expenditures. Utility earnings were modestly lower than our plan due to O&M timing at ComEd and PECO, which will reverse itself over the course of the year.","Exelon Generation earned $0.30 per share, outperforming plan. This was a result of some realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust fund and favorable timing of O&M. We are reaffirming our full year guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. For the second quarter, we are providing adjusted operating earnings guidance of $0.55 per share to $0.65 per share.","On slide 11, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.87 per share in the first quarter this year was $0.09 per share lower than the first quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less HoldCo earnings were up $0.10 per share compared with last year. This earnings growth is driven primarily by higher rate base, new rates associated with completed rate -- and lower storm costs at PECO and PG&E relative to the first quarter of 2018.","Generation earnings were down $0.19 per share compared with last year. The biggest driver was the absence of $0.10 per share of ZEC catch-up payment from 2017 due to the timing of the final Illinois ZEC approvals. Generation was also impacted by lower realized power prices.","Moving on to slide 12. As Chris mentioned, we celebrated the third anniversary of the merger with PHI in March. We have seen tremendous improvement in PHI's operational performance, customer satisfaction, and relationships with our communities and regulators, which is leading to more constructive outcome. Given our progress on the commitment of our 9% to 10% ROEs across our utilities and the quarterly variability at the individual PHI utilities, depending on rate case timing, we are now consolidating the PHI utilities trailing 12-month ROEs.","We have also changed the format of the slide to show the relative size of the aggregate PHI utilities when compared to legacy Exelon utilities and the consolidated Exelon utilities. In total, the PHI utilities represent approximately 26% of our total rate base of $41.2 billion.","On a consolidated basis, the PHI utilities earned a 9.3% ROE for the trailing 12-months. This is a 90-basis point improvement over consolidated 8.4% from the fourth quarter of 2018. The improvement is due to 2018 distribution rate case settlement at both Delmarva and Pepco, favorable transmission revenue from the higher peak load in true-ups, the roll-off of higher storm costs, and favorable O&M timing at Delmarva and Pepco, which will reverse over the course of the year.","At the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs are modestly better, largely driven by the roll-off of the March 2018 winter storm costs as well as new rates associated with completed rate cases at PECO and PG&E. Including PHI, the combined Exelon utilities have a 10.2% earned ROE, which is above our 9% to 10% earned ROE target and 50 basis points higher than last quarter. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth target by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities.","Turning to slide 13. Since the last call, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the Atlantic City Electric settlement agreement, which provides for a $70 million revenue increase. The new rates went into effect on April 1st. In addition, the BPU approved recovery of $96 million of capital over a four-year period through the infrastructure investment program to improve reliability.","On April 8th, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate update with the Illinois Commerce Commission seeking a $6.4 million decrease to base rate, representing the fourth requested rate reduction, under the formula rate design. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter.","Pepco Maryland filed its latest rate case in January, requesting a $30 million revenue increase, which has been updated to $27.2 million with the test year updated to actuals. The request is based on the continued infrastructure investments to enhance reliability in customer service. We expect to receive an order in the third quarter of this year. More details on the rate cases can be found on slides 21 through 24 in the appendix.","Turning to slide 14, during the first quarter, we invested $1.2 billion of capital across the utilities and are on track to meet our $5.3 billion commitment for 2019. These investments will improve the reliability and resiliency of the grid to the benefit of our customers.","This quarter, I would like to highlight two projects. The first is the modernization of Pepco's Harrison substation in Washington D.C. This $190 million project will renovate aging infrastructure to more reliably serve important loads including two metro stations. It also expands regional transmission capacity supporting future load growth.","The other project is the second phase of BG&E's large gas line replacement program in Baltimore that will be recovered through STRIDE capital recovery mechanism. The second phase includes $732 million of investment and we will replace approximately 240 miles of gas lines by the end of 2023. Replacing these lines will improve the safety and reliability of the distribution system.","During the first phase of the program, BG&E replaced 208 miles of gas lines. Since the program started in 2014, STRIDE has created 600 full-time jobs in BGE service territory.","On Slide 15, we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy for the generation company. As a reminder, our disclosure previously reflected planned retirement of TMI and include New Jersey's ZEC revenues. Since last quarter, total gross margin has flattened every year.","In 2019, open gross margin decreased by $150 million, primarily due to lower prices at West Hub, New York Zone A, and NiHub. During the quarter, we executed $150 million in power new business.","In 2020 and 2021 respectively, open gross margin is up $50 million relative to our prior disclosure, primarily on the back of higher power prices at NiHub and New York Zone A which was partially offset by lower ERCOT spark spread.","Mark-to-market of hedges were down $50 million due to our hedge position offsetting the increasing gross margin and we executed $50 million of power new business in both years.","Our generation to load matching strategy continues to yield positive results. We ended the quarter 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2020 and 1% to 4% behind ratable in 2021, when considering cross commodity hedges.","Our open position is primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Texas. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we are comfortable with our strategy to hold if the market want.","Moving on to slide 16, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit ratings. As Chris mentioned, our working has been rewarded with credit upgrades at S&P and Fitch in the first quarter. S&P upgraded Exelon's issuer credit rating from -- to BBB plus from BBB. In addition, all subsidiaries were raised one notch.","According to S&P, the rating upgrades reflect the successful execution of our business strategy, which has reduced business risk while maintaining strong financial metrics. Fitch also upgraded Exelon to BBB plus based on similar reasoning.","Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt to EBITDA target of three times. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.4 times debt to EBITDA and 1.9 times debt to EBITDA on a recourse basis.","With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing marks.","Chris Crane","Thanks Joe. Turning to slide 17, we remain committed to our strategy and are pleased that our consistent execution is being recognized by the rating agencies and others. I'll close on Exelon's value proposition.","We continue to grow our utilities targeting 7.8% rate base growth and between a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use free cash from the GenCo to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt, and fund part of our growing dividend.","We will continue to optimize the value of our ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generation fleet, selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the generation to load matching strategy of Constellation.","We will sustain strong investment grade credit metrics and grow our dividend annually at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective and providing tangible benefits to our stakeholders. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earn -- earnings your ongoing support for Exelon.","Operator, we can now turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Greg Gordon","Thanks, good morning.","Chris Crane","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Two questions. First, can you just give us a little more detail on the status of the bills that relate to energy policy in Illinois? What processes for moving them to vote? And I think you know you intimated that given the pressures on the legislature with regard to other Illinois issues that there might be a chance that this slips from the regular session for the veto session. So, could you just talk through all those issues, please?","Chris Crane","Sure. And as you pointed out, there is a lot of activity in the session right now, as the Governor prioritizes all of this his issues, a lot of it's focused on the budget and revenue sources. Those bills are moving and being debated as we discussed. He also has a priority on achieving zero-carbon generation fleet by the 2020-2030 time frame -- to 2030 time frame. So there are numerous energy-related bills to get to that point. Our bill for the FRR, and there's one that's path to 100 and then there's one that's the Clean Jobs Coalition.","So we're in the process right now of negotiating with all the bills, so we can come together and provide the legislature with coalition that agrees on many things right now just working through the details. We hope to be done. Meetings are constant. I've met with the leadership of both House and Senate, talking about what we need to do and them showing their support for us going forward.","And so we're just going to keep working on it as we always do. If it's not done in the regular session because of the other priorities, we will have it positioned to move through during the veto session, that's the generation bill. The other bill in Illinois that will affect Exelon is the extension of the ComEd formula rate for 10 years, that bill is proceeding.","We've been able to work with stakeholders to gain support and recognition as I mentioned, out of the nine past filings that we made with the formula rate; we've had four rate reductions. So it's very balanced for the consumer, it's very balanced for our investment strategy and we are able to do so in a predictable way to serve our customers. So that's Illinois. Pennsylvania","Greg Gordon","Thank you. Sorry, you might as well cover Pennsylvania too, I interrupted you. I apologize.","Chris Crane","I believe that was coming, so I was going to do it. So, Pennsylvania, as you know, we've been working with the other nuclear operators there to create an alliance to continue and allow those assets to compete in with the other non-emitting assets. The bill continues to garner support and we'll continue to work through that. As we've told folks, we need clarity on this by the end of May or we're going to have to make the final steps and shutdown.","We won't be able to adequately procure -- design procure and manufacture fuel for continued operations without that certainty and would not want to make that investment without that. So we'll continue working on it and as you can see the Governor has shown recognition that he wants to have a low-carbon future for the state and all recognize that that cannot be done with the current technology without including the existing nuclear assets. So we'll work on that one and combine with the Illinois effort.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. And one other real quick one for Joe, just looking at slide 19, It looks like the free cash flow profile mainly at the utility portfolio is lower than you projected, lower now for the year than you projected at year-end by $300 million or so. What's the cause of that because you didn't look -- it doesn't look like you've changed your overall guidance for the long-term cash flow profile of the company? ","Joe Nigro","Yeah, Greg, you're correct, the variance versus our Q4 disclosure is $300 million lower. It's being driven by increased working capital to utilities and we're funding that with commercial paper. I think it's important to note though from a GenCo perspective, on a cash flow profile basis, we're still well -- we're in line with the forecast that we've provided you on the fourth quarter call, I mean I think that's an important element.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Is that working capital increase a permanent structural issue? Or is that related to things like storms or other things that might flip in future years?","Joe Nigro","Yeah, it\u2019s the latter. It's more than just the ongoing business itself. And we had some favorable weather points in the quarter and we took advantage of that from a work basis perspective.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning, everyone. ","Chris Crane","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So just to follow-up a little bit on Greg's question, can you elaborate a little bit on the scenarios around capacity auction participation, particularly if it happens in August, and I'm thinking that given your commentary in the prepared remarks around the timing of Illinois legislation that it'd be difficult to implement any full FRR or anything else coming out of this Illinois legislation in time for the next upcoming capacity auctions. So I suppose there's a litany of scenarios. How do you think about them, particularly if FERC does indeed act around something else, say a partial FRR, for instance?","Chris Crane","So, we've put our input into FERC that we believe it's very inefficient to execute an auction when -- with the previous FERC ruling that for PJM to execute an auction in the August time frame with the previous FERC ruling, we actually need to get guidance from FERC on what the construct should be.","So we think it should be an April time frame, but FERC feels -- the PJM feels like they are compelled to run forward and hopefully we'll hear something from FERC to clarify PJM's letter requesting clarification.","The most likely scenario for an FRR in Illinois would be the 2023 auction time frame from everything we're looking at. We need to get the legislation passed. We need to have the IPA who we've been working with the Illinois Power Authority be able to build the construct and be able to run it.","That estimate is aggressive on our side, but probably about eight months our folks have been in communications with the IP agency how reasonable that is, and so we'll continue to work down that path, but to run an auction is going to be potentially rejected without clarification, does not seem like the most efficient use of all of our resources at this time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Maybe even if it is delayed into 2020, and that is for the 2022 auction, how do you think about the choices before you?","Chris Crane","Kathleen, you want to cover it more?","Kathleen Barr\u00f3n","Sure. Hey Julien, it's Kathleen. As Chris said, we do know that the FRR bill once enacted will take a period of time to implement. The IPA has to write the rules, the ICC has to approve them, then the IPA has to conduct a procurement. And so if the auction is not delayed, there clearly is not enough time for that to occur before the auction if it happens in August. If it happens next April then the bill is enacted this spring, there would be enough time for it to be implemented by, let's say, the auctions delayed to next April.","And then the big wildcard is, what if the -- we don't know what FERC is going to do and we don't know when the -- exactly when the coalition, that Chris mentioned, together with the other clean energy package -- packages will come together in Springfield. So we can't really speculate on what would happen, because we have a couple of variables that are just unknown at this time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","All right. Fair enough. And then just to follow up on the business risk improvement in the credits out of the equation. Can you comment a little bit more about where you see that going over time, in terms of added latitude from absolute perspective and just where you would like to see the credit rating over time? Just perhaps following on some of the recent improvements?","Joe Nigro","Yes, Julien, first of all, we're happy with the upgrades by both S&P and Fitch, and we continue to work to stabilize the earnings and the cash flows of the company. We talk about how we're transitioning the earnings and the cash being driven from the much more regulated outcome, and we're really focused on that and we'll continue to manage accordingly and continue to take -- work closely with the rating agencies.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay, great. Thank you all very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Fleishman","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Chris Crane","Good morning.","Steve Fleishman","So just, I guess, on Pennsylvania, if -- obviously, something needs to get done there by the end of May to save Three Mile Island, but if it doesn't get done by then, does that -- I mean could something come back later on for the other plants? Or is it -- how should we just think about that?","Chris Crane","We don't plan on stopping and the coalition doesn't plan on stopping, if the TMI deadline has passed. There are other critical assets in the state that need to be recognized for the governors low carbon future. And so we'll continue to work as hard as we are right now, after the end of May, for the other reactors in the state.","So you've got eight other reactors that are very critical that are highly reliable, but their environmental benefits cannot be replaced with technologies available today without any significant cost. So we'll continue to work on it and we believe that we'll end up successful at the end.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Stephen Byrd","Hi. Good morning.","Chris Crane","Good morning.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to just drill into the Illinois Clean Energy Progress Act a little further. I'm thinking through the procurement process, and I've read through the legislation but I'm trying to understand the procurement process in terms of the clean bundled capacity.","Is it possible to talk a little bit more about the generation that would be eligible? The mix of energy that would be procured? I'm thinking about zero carbon versus renewable, just to make sure I understand the nature of the clean bundled capacity that's going to be procured under this legislation, if it passes?","Chris Crane","Kathleen, you want to go through that?","Kathleen Barr\u00f3n","Yes. Thank you, Stephen. The way that we have envisioned this is that the State would be able to conduct a clean energy procurement, as you said, and then any zero carbon resources will be allowed to complete to provide that capacity. And as you know, the bill is not specific about the exact timetable or there -- or other details that we believe are important, including how prices will be overseen by the IPA.","And the reason for that is that the reason the Future Energy Jobs Act was so successful is, it brought together a number of parties together towards a common future and what's exciting about this is that FRR concept is integral to all the other clean energy bills that are being considered right now, because everyone appreciates that, is that exact authority, letting that IPA conduct a clean energy capacity procurement and then having the ability to set its core towards the zero carbon future will give it more flexibility than it has under current market rules, where every asset gets the same capacity payment, whether it's emitting or non-emitting.","So we have left some room to have that discussion among other stakeholders to make sure that we have the right group who are supporting it and, as Chris said at the top of the call between the Clean Jobs Coalition including this in their bill, the consumer advocates see the tremendous benefit associated with this, we think that's a winning combination.","Stephen Byrd","That's extremely helpful. Just as a follow-up there. In terms of the state's overall energy mix in terms of clean energy versus fossil, I know there is an objective to move towards clean energy over time, what would that energy mix broadly look like over time, how should we think about that evolution in the state?","Chris Crane","So you're starting off right now with 60% of the generation statewide being zero-carbon emitting, 90% of that statewide is nuclear. The concept that Kathleen talked about is we would, in the ComEd zone, currently we can account for 100% carbon-free, but we would have a transition period where you would have the carbon-free assets bidding in at a greater percentage each year or being taken as a greater percentage each year as you build into 2030 when the procurement would become a 100% carbon-free. And those details, the finite details there will have to be worked out, but that's the concept.","Stephen Byrd","That's super helpful and that's all I had. Thank you.","Chris Crane","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jonathan Arnold","Good morning, guys.","Chris Crane","Hey.","Jonathan Arnold","Could I just -- just coming back to Illinois and the discussion about timing, if I understand you correctly, the ability to implement the FRR for the next auction, should the next auction happen in April, that would only be the case, if it passes in the spring. Am I right about that?","Chris Crane","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And so to that, I mean, Chris, what exactly are you saying about the spring session. Are you -- you said you are optimistic in your prepared remarks about this year, and I just wasn't clear in the previous answer if you're saying you think we're more likely in the veto session, or do you think you're still kind of in play for the spring depending on how things go?","Chris Crane","We are working with the coalitions as hard as we can to have something presentable to the legislature supports to move in the spring. But what I've cautioned in our road shows and on the calls previously, there is a very aggressive legislative agenda in Illinois this spring, they are talking about a graduated tax legislation that is needed to pass for constitutional amendment under 2020 election, the work on legalization of recreational marijuana, the work on the gambling and the sporting issues to continue to increase revenue. Those are the top three priorities. We come after that. We need to be ready to be able to tell our story, communicate and have that coalition that we're building endorsing where we're heading. But we need to be realistic. We do think if it doesn't happen in the spring, we'll be ready to move it in the -- a veto session in the fall.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, great. So you're not saying it's impossible. You're just making us aware of the priorities and the pullback on the fall.","Chris Crane","Right.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay. And then just one other thing I wanted to ask on the slide 10, you call out the NDT realized gains was one of the driver in ExGen versus guidance, but it doesn't show up as a factor in the waterfall. So could you -- any chance you guys could quantify that piece and sort of explain that discrepancy there?","Joe Nigro","Yes. The waterfall you're looking at a year-over-year change and the NDT gains in the each of the years was roughly the same.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay.","Joe Nigro","So there would be no delta on the waterfall.","Jonathan Arnold","Got it. Roughly how much, Joe, if you are willing to share?","Joe Nigro","$0.02 -- its $0.02 a share.","Jonathan Arnold","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, President and CEO of Exelon, for closing comments.","Chris Crane","Thank you all for participating in call today. I think we're off to a very good start for the year. And so with that, we'll close the call out and thanks again.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

During the presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn today's phone over to Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. The floor is yours.","Dan Eggers","Thank you. Good morning, Tamara. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who'll be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, all of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call contains forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.","Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections forecasts and expectations.","Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measure.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Chris Crane","Thank you Dan, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth quarter earnings call.","I'm going to start on slide 5. On almost all accounts, we had a very good 2019. Exelon Utilities and Generation remains focused on delivering for our customers and their communities. ComEd had its best performance ever. The nuclear fleet had its best capacity factor and we delivered financially.","As you can read, the full year GAAP earnings were $3.01 per share, and the non-GAAP earnings were $3.22 per share above our revised guidance range and midpoint of our original guidance range. Joe will walk you through the financial details later in the call. I want to address the operational details as we go forward.","Last year, Exelon Utilities invested $5.5 billion in capital and $150 million \u2013 which is $150 million more than originally planned. These investments were primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience, improve reliability and resiliency, modernization of our gas system resulting in best-ever customer satisfaction at each of our utilities.","We had a productive year on the regulatory front. Pepco D.C. filed its first multiyear rate case and Maryland's PSC is moving forward with the multiyear rate plans. We received a constructive settlement at BGE and at ACE. PECO's transmission formula was approved by FERC, and ComEd's formula rate provided the third-rate decrease in five years helping to keep the average residential customer bill flat from where it was a decade ago.","On the policy front, the United States Supreme Court upheld the Illinois and New York ZEC programs. New York Supreme Court \u2013 Superior Court affirmed the ZEC program and New Jersey implemented their ZEC program in the spring.","Governor Wolf in Pennsylvania announced plans for Pennsylvania to join RGGI, and the Pennsylvania State Senate passed legislation setting a goal for electric vehicles and deployment. FERC approved PJM's fast-start reforms. PJM filed its proposal to reform the reserve market and scarcity rules. We made our commitment to grow the dividend by 5% annually through 2020 with the Board raising the annual dividend to $1.53 per share in January.","We're good partners also with the communities we serve. Our employees volunteered a record-breaking 251,000 hours in 2019, that\u2019s 11,000 more than in 2018. During National Volunteer Week, we sponsored 452 events in 16 states and 128 cities with 5,400 employees which is another record. In addition, Exelon donated nearly $52 million to charities and organizations throughout our footprint.","We are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our nearly 33,000 employees. We were once again named Best Company for Diversity by Forbes, DiversityInc, and the Human Rights Campaign. Our total diversity supplier spend exceeded $2 billion for the third straight year, accounting for 27% of our overall supplier spend.","Exelon companies continue to prioritize partnerships with local-based diverse businesses by offering development programs. We also continue to be recognized for our environmental stewardship and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 14th year in a row.","We are focused on operating at world-class levels delivering on our strategy in supporting clean energy policies in their state. The hard work and the commitment of our employees to provide safe, reliable power, and natural gas to our customers led way to the greatest performance we had in 2019. We delivered on our commitments to you our shareholders, but also our employees and our customers and our communities.","However, this year was not -- last year was not without challenges including subpoenas we received from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Northern Illinois. As we said before, we are limited in what we can share about the investigation. However, I want to reiterate that we are fully cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's Office and taking the situation very seriously.","The Board appointed a special committee to provide oversight of the investigation led by outside counsels to determine if any changes are needed to ensure that going forward we operate at the highest possible standards.","At the end of [Technical Difficulty] our commitments for 2020. Turning to slide 6, we're committed to operating our utilities at the highest levels for our customers. Since 2016, we have deployed nearly $22 billion across the utilities and plan to invest $26 billion over the next four years. These investments enhance reliability, resiliency, and modernize our electric and gas systems.","We've been able to make these needed improvements while keeping the boards -- the bills affordable. The rates in all our major cities; Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington are 13% to 18% below the average for the largest U.S. cities, and 2% to 7% below the national average.","These investments are producing tangible benefits for our customers. Customer satisfaction is the highest level it's ever been at each one of our utilities, reflecting a strong system performance that has come from our investments.","Frequency of outages has decreased significantly, down near 50% at ComEd and 30% at PHI. Outage duration has also decreased by 52% and 38% at ComEd and BGE respectively. 2019 was the best reliability performance for ComEd and the second best for BGE.","On the gas side, PECO and BGE have replaced more than 200 miles of cast iron and bare steel mains and nearly 30,000 metallic gas services in 2018. These investments will help our customers' current and future needs while reducing gas leaks and greenhouse house gas emissions.","Moving to slide 7, our states are focused on ensuring the electric and the gas systems are ready to meet the changing customer needs, more reliable and more resilient and are prepared for renewables in electric vehicles and are ready to meet the challenges of climate change.","We are working with each state to get the right mechanisms in place to be able to make these needed investments. Our states are providing support through a range of regulatory tools, including alternate rate making such as formula rates and multiyear rate plans as well as tracker mechanisms for reliability and gas infrastructure programs.","Turning to Slide 8, FERC's recent order on PJM capacity. The Governors in Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey are firmly committed to having their electricity be supplied by 100% clean. These states are leading the way to a clean energy economy and we share that goal, and we'll work with them to achieve it. Unfortunately, there is a clear conflict between clean energy goals of our states and our customers on one side and the resource decisions being made by PJM and FERC on the other.","Unless states take action to protect their clean energy programs, FERC's December order on the PJM Minimum Offer Price Rule or MOPR will result in clean resources supported by the states being pushed out of the capacity market only to be replaced by carbon-based generation. This would result in billions of dollars of additional costs for customers and threaten the progress being made in retaining and expanding our clean energy.","Our states as well as many others oppose FERC's MOPR decision and are evaluating what actions may be necessary in response. We are working with policymakers and stakeholders to protect the clean energy programs from the negative impact of FERC's MOPR decision and enable the transition to 100% clean.","On Slide 9, we show our operating performance for the year. Each utility continues to have outstanding customer operations, all achieved first quartile in performance and service level and abandon rate. And I mentioned, we had our best ever scores on customer satisfaction index with BGE ComEd and PECO achieving top decile and PHI's performance significantly improved in the last three years missing first quartile by 0.01 points.","Reliability performance was mixed this year due to a very active minor storm season throughout the Mid-Atlantic. For instance, PHI had 32 minor storms for 2019 compared to eight in 2018. Minor storms are not excluded from these calculations. However, ComEd achieved top quartile in both outage frequency and duration and BGE achieved top quartile on outage duration.","Turning to generation on Slide 10, our fleet -- generation fleet performed one of its best years ever, very good in 2019 providing a significant portion of the country's clean energy. Exelon generates 12% or one out of every nine clean megawatts in the United States.","Our best-in-class nuclear fleet operated very well last year. Our capacity factor was 95.7% our highest ever. We generated 155 million megawatt hours, avoiding 81 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2019.","Our average refueling outage duration was 21 days, matching the record set in 2018 and 18 -- 14 days better than the industry average. Exelon Power's gas and hydro dispatch matched 97.9% and wind and energy capture at 96.3% were better than planned.","Our Constellation business remains the industry leader. A vast majority of our retail businesses is with C&I customers where we have the largest retail platform with 25% market share delivering 154 terawatt-hours of electricity and 67 terawatt-hours more than our nearest competitor.","Our retail operating metrics remain strong; 79% customer renewal rates, average customer duration of more than six years, and power contract terms of 23 months on average. We continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers. Our focus is on cost and helping support operating margins.","Constellation's strength lies in its durable relationship with our customers. We work with our customers to provide them solutions to meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals. We provide our customers with much more than just a commodity.","And now I'll turn the call over to Joe to review the financials.","Joe Nigro","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today I will cover our 2019 results, annual updates to our financial disclosures, and 2020 guidance. Starting with slide 11, we had another strong year.","For the fourth quarter we earned $0.79 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.83 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year we earned $3.01 per share on a GAAP basis and $3.22 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is above our revised full guidance -- full year guidance of $3.05 to $3.20 per share and $0.07 per share above our original mid-point.","Exelon Utilities delivered a combined $1.91 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were higher relative to original guidance, due to favorable O&M, including the lack of major storms, and favorable weather at PECO and BG&E, as well as higher distribution revenues of the PG&E.","These were partially offset by the impact of lower treasury rates, on ComEd's ROE. ExGen earned $1.31 per share, exceeding its guidance range of $1.20 to $1.30 per share.","ExGen's outperformance was primarily due to favorable O&M, including incremental nuclear insurance distributions, and recognition in the fourth quarter of the research and development or R&D tax benefit, for the years 2010 through 2018 tax years.","We expected to record this benefit, but it was more favorable than we had planned. This favorability was offset by the unplanned outages at Salem, Handley Station and a contracted asset during the year. Overall, we delivered well on our financial commitments.","Moving to slide 12, the consolidated PHI utilities earned a 9.2% ROE for the trailing 12 months, up 90 basis points from year-end 2018. The improvement is driven by the constructive distribution rate cases, across the jurisdictions as well as incremental transmission revenue and a decrease in O&M, partially offset by an increase in depreciation.","Earned ROEs for the legacy Exelon Utilities were above 10%, slightly improving from year-end 2018. Looking at our utility returns on a consolidated basis, we earned a 10% ROE for the trailing 12 months, which compares to last year's 9.6%.","As a reminder, we targeted 9% to 10% consolidated ROE at our utilities. And expect that we will move around in that band over the course of time. And we remain focused on earning fair returns across all of our utilities.","On slide 13 we rolled forward our outlook for utility CapEx and rate base, covering 2020 to 2023. This year we expect to invest nearly $6.5 billion, in our utilities and a total of $26 billion, over the next four years.","These investments are improving our system reliability, service experience for our utility customers, and preparing us for the future. Our capital forecast reflects identified and approved projects.","As we move through time, we identify more investment needs across the system that will provide additional benefits to our customers and communities. Since the initial disclosures for the 2018 to 2022 period, we have identified nearly $4.9 billion in additional investments, including an additional $1.9 billion, since last year's fourth quarter call.","As Chris mentioned, these investments benefit our customers, by helping to drive our operational excellence, overall customer satisfaction, and meet state resiliency and environmental priorities. Since the PHI merger in 2016, we have added more than $9 billion in rate base across the utilities.","Over the next four years, we will grow our rate base 7.3% annually to $54.2 billion, adding $13 billion to rate base by 2023 or the equivalent of adding a utility between the size of PHI and ComEd, without paying a premium, issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals.","As a reminder, 65% of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms such as capital trackers. These support our ability to efficiently invest in our system while also allowing us to earn a fair and timely return on our capital. Where we do not have these mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools.","Chris touched on this earlier, but I want to remind you all that we have been able to make these important investments while maintaining lower customer rates compared to other large urban areas. When we look at our projected residential bills, we continue to see bill inflation around\/or below the rate of inflation even as we make these important investments. In the appendix, we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility starting on slide 23.","Turning to slide 14. We continue to forecast strong utility less holding company, EPS growth of 6% to 8%. When you consider the drop in the 30-year treasury that lowered our EPS outlook for ComEd by roughly a nickel compared to what we had showed you last year, we've been more than able to offset in the back end of our plan through the increased CapEx program across the utilities for the benefit of our customers, which brings us to the durability of our industry leading earnings growth, which reflects the combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and environmental goals, successful cost management and a focus on customer bill affordability.","Before discussing our gross margin update on slide 15, I want to remind you that given the lack of clarity around the outcome of legislation in Illinois and the fact that PJM has not yet held a capacity auction for the 2022, 2023 delivery year, we will not be providing any ExGen disclosures beyond 2021.","So turning to the table, there is no change in total gross margin in 2020 or 2021 from our last disclosure. Open gross margin declined by $400 million and $100 million in 2020 and 2021, respectively due to declining power prices across most regions offset by our hedges. During the quarter, we executed $50 million of power new business in 2020.","We remain slightly behind our ratable hedging program in all years. We ended the year 6% to 9% behind in 2020 and 3% to 6% behind in 2021 when taking cross-commodity hedges into account. We continue to see some upside in certain markets, but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility.","Slide 16 shows our O&M and capital outlook at generation for 2020 and 2021. Compared to our previous disclosure on our fourth quarter call, last year our O&M is down in each year. The updated forecast reflects O&M cuts we announced on last quarter call, pension benefits and nuclear savings. The return on our pension investments in 2019 significantly exceeded our planned returns, but this favorability was partially offset by the drop in the discount rate. Taking both into account our pension expense it's about flat to plan in 2020 and is down by approximately $25 million in 2021.","Turning to CapEx. We expect lower cash outlays than we projected last year. We have reduced the growth capital in 2020 and 2021 given the focus of recycling ExGen cash and the increased need for equity investments at the utilities given their growing capital needs.","Nuclear fuel costs are also lower in 2020 and higher in 2021 versus last year's disclosure, primarily due to a shift in deliveries. Overall, we continue to see a constructive outlook for the nuclear fuel costs looking out over our planning horizon.","We will continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend to improve the cash flow profile of ExGen while maintaining the safety and reliability of our fleet.","Moving to slide 17. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit ratings. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics are consisting with our targeted ranges and above S&P thresholds.","Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt-to-EBITDA target for 3.0 times. For 2020, we expect to be at 2.4 times debt to EBITDA and 1.9 times debt to EBITDA when excluding non-recourse debt. This year we will be active in the capital markets, as we support our utility rate base growth. At ExGen, we plan to retire $1.5 billion of long-term debt this year, including the $1 billion maturity we paid off in January. As a reminder, this in addition to the $600 million of long-term debt retired in October of 2019.","Finally, I will conclude with our 2020 earnings guidance on Slide 18. We have provided 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of $3 to $3.30 per share. Growth in utility earnings is primarily driven by the continued increase in rate base, as we deploy capital for the benefit of our customers as well as carry through from the 2019 rate cases.","We will see offsets from lower treasuries on ComEd's earned ROEs, higher depreciation and some regulatory timing drags between investment and rate cases most notably at PECO. Our consolidated range in 2020 for utilities less HoldCo is $1.80 a share to $2.10 per share.","The decline in earned ExGen's earnings is a combination of lower realized energy prices and capacity revenues, more planned nuclear outage days and the absence of nuclear decommissioning trust gains. These are partially offset by a full year of ZEC revenues in New Jersey and increased ZEC revenues in New York. We expect first quarter operating earnings to be in the range of $0.85 per share to $0.95 per share. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix starting on Slide 55.","With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.","Chris Crane","Thanks Joe. Turning to Slide 19, I want to discuss our key focus areas for 2020. We will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses, focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities, while staying focused on safety and reliability. We will meet or exceed our financial commitments delivering earnings within the range and maintain our investment-grade credit ratings, as Joe mentioned.","At the utilities, we will prudently and effectively deploy $6.5 billion of capital to benefit our customers and help meet the needs -- our states' energy policy goals and we will work with our regulators to ensure timely recovery on these investments. We will support the enactment of state and federal clean energy policies with major initiatives in-flight in several states. We will -- and we will partner and ally with the communities we serve. This is key to who we are.","Slide 20. I will close on Exelon's value proposition, which highlights our strategy and commitment to shareholders. We will continue our focus on growing our utilities targeting 7.3% rate base growth and 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2023 rolling forward another year at this above-group trajectory. We will use free cash flow from ExGen to support utility growth, pay down debt and support the external dividend.","We will continue to optimize the value of our Genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero-emitting generating fleet, closing uneconomic plants and monetizing assets as we see value is there, while maximizing their value through generation to load matching strategy at Constellation.","We will sustain growth investment-grade metrics -- excuse me, strong investment-grade metrics and we will grow our dividend at 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective in providing tangible benefits to our shareholders. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earning your ongoing support to Exelon.","Operator, we can now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first response is from Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations on a great year and the outlook is encouraging. A couple of questions. The utility growth outlook has obviously improved as we go out through time, despite the headwind from ComEd. The CapEx is up significantly, but the rate base growth numbers look like they're not moving as much in tandem.","I skimmed through the whole deck. I understand, you've also moved capital around the different jurisdictions as well, but can you just comment on sort of that modest level of dissonance between CapEx being up and rate base growth looking like it's not up as much?","Joe Nigro","Yes, Greg. Good morning. It's Joe. Yes. The issue isn't solely that the incremental CapEx that we mentioned of approximately $2 billion isn't falling to rate base. It's about all of the CapEx and what we get into is the timing of when these projects go in service.","So, we've updated some assumptions as it relates to the schedule of when the projects are finished and then they go into service. In addition to that, we could have changes in things like depreciation that would also impact that. So, it's really just a movement of when we see project timing and other things.","Greg Gordon","So AFUDC is not -- or CWIP and AFUDC are not contemplated in those calculations then?","Joe Nigro","No. They're not contemplated in that calculation.","Greg Gordon","Okay. That explains it. Thanks. In terms of the cash flow profile, I know that you haven't given us an update because we do have obviously significant uncertainty with regard to ExGen and Illinois. But as you look at most scenarios there, whether it's getting some sort of deserved incremental revenue for the clean attribute to your plants or having to use self-help to rectify the earnings issues, under most of those scenarios do you still see the utility being funded by the cash flow of the corporation without needing equity through this forecast period?","Joe Nigro","Yes. Greg, so the first thing I would say is, based on the current plan, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we don't incorporate any equity issuance in the plan. And going forward, we can meet the funding needs and maintain the investment-grade credit metrics under most scenarios that we look at, because we do look at this under a range of different possibilities.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Two more questions and they're quick. One, since the Q -- since the EEI deck, where you usually give us your update on where you think O&M and capital are driving it at ExGen, things have improved on the margin. Can you comment on how you've pulled forward some of the O&M and CapEx trajectory?","Joe Nigro","Yes. I think the big thing is when you look at the improvement in ExGen earnings, it's really driven by four variables. As you could see in 2020 and 2021, the gross margin hasn't changed, right? But what has changed is we announced the O&M reductions on the third quarter call, that\u2019s been a benefit. Lower property taxes has been a benefit at ExGen. Lower depreciation is also a benefit. And then, finally, we do have some lower interest expense, when you think about the retirement of debt. So those four variables have driven improvement to the ExGen earnings.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Final question, Chris. The time flies. It seems like yesterday since you made the commitment to grow the dividend 5% through 2020, and here we are in 2020 and you've made good on that commitment. At what point do you go back to the Board with a recommendation on the dividend policy post 2020?","Chris Crane","So I would anticipate, the discussions with the Board will be in the fall time frame, when we have further clarity on what the future looks like. If we are able to enact some of the policies and programs in the states we're working on, and it provides us with certainty that we can provide certainty to the Board that maintaining the health of the balance sheet while creating shareholder value, we should have a better picture at that time. So, I would expect us talking to you around year-end time frame about that.","Greg Gordon","Thank you, Chris. Take care, guys.","Chris Crane","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next response is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Hi. Good morning.","Chris Crane","Good morning ","Stephen Byrd","I had a couple of broader policy questions. We've certainly been seeing quite a bit of evidence of -- especially, in the PJM states, a movement away from fossil fuels. And on the merchant side, I think I understand some of the moving parts there, but on the regulated utility side, what is your sense of the degree to which states are now pushing to move away from fossil fuels? And how do you think broadly about pivoting and sort of reacting to that shift at the utility side of your business?","Chris Crane","So as you know Stephen, our utilities do not have any generation and are restricted from having generation in the states that we serve. What you see in our planning years that you're looking at for the utilities, they incorporate what we believe needs to be done to support the states' needs which calls for more robust distribution system investments to allow two way energy flows, which is going to require transmission buildout to take care of importing the wind [ph] from the pockets of the service areas that we serve. And that's what's anticipated right now in the capital plan that we have in front of you. We have got to keep up with the state's policies, legislative agendas, or whatever is going to change the system so our customers can benefit from these policies that the states are enacting.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. And then just shifting over to the PJM capacity process, I wanted to just get your latest thinking on next steps procedurally. I'm thinking about sort of the broader process under which PJM would refine their approach and the timing under which they have an auction. I guess I'm thinking also about the possibility of pretty significant litigation around the -- whatever comes out of the PJM and the FERC process here. How do you see that unfolding? Just wanted to get your latest thoughts there.","Kathleen Barron","Hi, Stephen, it's Kathleen Barron. I can take that question. I'll start with auction timing. As you know there's a large group of stakeholders including clean energy advocates, consumer advocates, renewable developers and most importantly the states who have asked PJM to take their time in scheduling the next auction. There's just been such a fundamental change in policy here that states need time to evaluate what the impact is on their customers and to design appropriate policies to protect their customers from the significant impact of this new policy on customer bills.","So we of course agree with that perspective and are going to continue to urge PJM when they're developing their next filing effort which as you know is in March to propose an auction timing schedule that takes into account the states' needs. And in terms of litigation, you're right that there have been a number of requests for rehearing that have been filed. That would be the next step for FERC before this case could go to litigation. FERC has no time line in which to ask -- to act on requests for rehearing, but I think the more important point is they have been developing this policy for years. I mean they laid out in an order in ISO New England three years ago that MOPR is their standard solution and they have carried that through to PJM. I see no future where they change their mind on that policy and I think therefore the states are right in looking at what their alternatives are to continue participation in RPM.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. And just to follow-up there Kathleen, can the auction proceed if there is pretty significant litigation from multiple states sort of questioning the fundamentals of the FERC order?","Kathleen Barron","Well technically, it can. I mean I think from a good governance perspective, of course as I said before PJM should take into account the fact that some of the states need some more information to figure out what the impact is going to be on their citizens. They're going to need to do an internal evaluation. But from a legal perspective, the FERC order is final. And once the compliance filing is submitted and approved then PJM will be allowed to conduct an auction unless there's some sort of judicial stay imposed.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Your next response is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Chris Crane","Good morning.","Steve Fleishman","Can you hear me okay, Chris? Thanks.","Chris Crane","Yes, perfect. Yes, we can.","Steve Fleishman","Great, great. So just on the Illinois process, could you just maybe talk to I guess an update of the legislation and just trying to make sure that -- I think the hope is that there'd be more of a long-term framework in place for treatment of nuclear and renewables. And just how much is that likely to be part of any legislative activity in the state?","Chris Crane","Well it's definitely -- there's two focuses that Exelon has in the legislation. One is the ComEd side ensuring that we have adequate recovery mechanisms for capital investments being made, while trying to maintain the customer protections that we need by caps on bill increases. So that part is very critical. Kathleen can address the Genco parts. She's been heading that up in Springfield in and around the state.","Kathleen Barron","Sure Steve. I can jump in on the -- on your point about having a longer-term framework which is exactly the point of the legislation that's pending in Illinois. And the idea of using the Fixed Resource Requirement provision in the PJM tariff or the FRR provision is to give states that kind of flexibility to provide for example for renewables that may want to have contracts of differing lengths exactly that flexibility for them to have those contracts.","And likewise for their broader clean energy goals for them to be able to differentiate when they're procuring capacity resources between clean resources and emitting resources. And having that ability to design their capacity procurement to meet their state policy on a longer-term basis is one of the key benefits of the FRR strategy.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And any sense on when we'll get kind of a more -- kind of full bill with more details proposed to get a better sense on just the details of a potential bill?","Kathleen Barron","Yes. I think you should expect to see further discussion and public hearings about what the bill should look like. As you know there are a number of proposals that are alive in the legislature in Springfield and so there needs to be some discussion in public hearings of how the state's policy on all the issues that are pending will come together in a comprehensive approach.","So I think over the course of the spring session those details will become more evident. As you know in most legislatures, it usually takes until closer to the end of the session for all the details to be worked out, but I think you'll start to see over the coming weeks and months more detail emerge.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then a broader question just on -- I guess it's an ESG\/nuclear carbon question. Just -- maybe for Chris, just how do you feel about your ability to get credit? It seems like there's a lot of focus on ESG and renewables and not necessarily as much focus on the benefits of nuclear and carbon reduction as you said 12% of the megawatt hours you produced for the country last year.","Just how do you feel that you're going to be able to get credit either Republican or Democrat for the benefits of nuclear? Just how both sides are kind of looking at that right now including the FERC side?","Chris Crane","Yes. I think over the last two to three years, you've seen a greater recognition of the benefit of nuclear as it's contributing to a cleaner environment low carbon and also other emitting gases. So as we work with stakeholders explaining electrification and the benefits of electrification and that electrification is coming from clean sources that are highly reliable like baseload nuclear, and there's been quite a few environmental organizations and government legislative folks that agree with that.","The dialogue is going on, on how do we keep these assets so the states can make their goals and that's going to be a critical part going forward. We've shared numbers with you before that if we shut down a couple of nuclear units in a single state, we can totally destroy all the investments that were being made in the renewables and we're just going to go backwards with our carbon emission.","So we have to do our job as -- not only as a company, but an industry and we're trying to do that. The Nuclear Energy Institute has done a very good job on their campaign to communicate that to greater and broader masses and we'll continue to do it ourselves and work through things like the legislation that may be enacted or policies that may be enacted in states.","We've seen the ZEC and the recognition in New York. We saw the ZEC and the recognition in Illinois. We're going to have to go a little bit further to be able to save these plants and that's where we're talking about FRR. And it's also -- another part of it is, it's more than just environmental. The reliability they provide, the jobs they provide, the economic engine for the communities that they serve is very impactful. And to not have these assets or them to be replaced with carbon-based assets will just send the states not only financially, but environmentally backwards.","Steve Fleishman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next response is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim.","Shar Pourreza","Hey, good morning guys.","Chris Crane","Good morning.","Shar Pourreza","Just focusing a little bit on the Genco. If we get to sort of the November veto session and find energy legislation gets pushed to 2021 and we assume that there will be a PJM auction in, let's say, December and January and another one roughly six months after that. Can you just walk us through how you'd be thinking about the auction participation and the timing of potential closures? And do you feel that the MOPR order has catalyzed the states to act on CJC?","Chris Crane","We're not speculating right now on that. We surely hope for many complicated issues that the states are able to enact and given time to enact the policies that they desire that will allow these plants to still operate. I've said for the last four or five years on almost every earnings call that if we can't see half to financial stability for each one of these assets that we will have to retire them and we're not going to speculate today on which ones or when. But we've shut down Oyster Creek, gone into decommissioning with a decommissioning company. TMI is off. There was no path for financial stability.","And as I've said in the past, we must watch the balance sheet and our debt commitments and the negative cash flow assets will only send the fleet backwards and our goals on strong investment-grade will allow us to maintain our commitments to operate plants safely and meet our financial commitments on retiring our debt. So, we'll work hard through this legislative session to convey the importance of it and we're not going to speculate until we have no longer have a path to profitability for the assets.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. And then if let's just say Illinois does FRR, how are you thinking about maybe the potential impacts on sort of the rest of the RTO fleet like in Pennsylvania and Maryland, especially given obviously the IMM has been taken somewhat of a bearish tone on the impact?","Kathleen Barron","Yeah. Shar, this is Kathleen. I can take that one. I mean, there are a number of estimates as you know out there about the impact of one, two, three, four, five states choosing the FRR option. We have not conducted an analysis of what that means for the rest of the pool so I'm not going to speculate on which ones of those analyses are accurate.","But I will just say with respect to the market monitor, and the suggestion that the MOPR is going to have no impact on capacity clearing prices, it's -- and I note that that's been repeated by a number of the fossil companies, yeah, it's just it's a little bit concerning. I mean, it's exactly these state programs that they -- that were the reason that multi-litigation was brought by these companies.","Recall when the first lawsuit was filed in New York, when New York adopted the ZEC program they said the point of the lawsuit was that ZEC programs were suppressing market prices by $15 billion over the course of that program's life. The whole purpose of MOPR was to raise capacity prices. Commissioner Glick estimated that he's going to raise capacity prices by $2.4 billion annually across the pool. Other independent analyses have gone there too. So it's just not credible for them to be now saying MOPR is going to have no impact.","Shar Pourreza","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And congrats guys, its very solid result.","Chris Crane","Thank you.","Operator","Your next response is from Joseph Gutowski [ph] from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Smith","Hi, it\u2019s Julien, can you hear me?","Chris Crane","Yes.","Julien Smith","Thank you guys for the time. Super quick. Let me come back to some of the numbers that we start with Greg earlier. Just in terms of the guidance I know you mentioned the AFUDC and the reconciliation of the CapEx and rate base. Can we talk about the earnings? Obviously, rate base unchanged; EPS guidance higher. Is that principally due to some of these changes in AFUDC that isn't formally reflected in that rate base and obviously is reflected in that CapEx?","Or are there other changes? Obviously the cadence of the trajectory of the earnings in 2020 and 2021 onwards has shifted a little bit as well but just wanted to clarify that. And then also on ExGen, similar dynamic around what's causing the offset versus the open margin. I think you had a little bit of a quick brief commentary about basis potentially. Just want to elaborate quickly on that as well as maybe the tax piece for ExGen year-over-year.","Joe Nigro","Yes, Julien. Good morning, it's Joe. On your first question remember we're giving you guidance for the combined EU and HoldCo, so there's a couple of variables even though we're investing CapEx and rate bases are rising. When you look at it the interest rate \u2013 the interest expense at corporate is projected lower which drives EPS as one variable that's positive to the earnings. We are \u2013 when you look at these projects, right you could still see there is additional CapEx growth and then we've had some improvement in ROEs versus our prior plan as well based on some of the regulatory actions and performance. So there's a number of variables outside just the incremental CapEx that would drive the value.","Your second question on the offsets at generation it's \u2013 when you look at the prices falling use 2021 as an example where we're less than 70% hedged. You see that you would have the open gross margin come down. However that's a price at a common trading point. When you look at the values associated back to where the generator busbars are for example those prices move every day as well and there were some offsets associated with that. So that got us down to flat.","Julien Smith","Got it. Excellent. And then just to come back to the broader strategic points here. At what point in time do you need to make decisions here? It sounds like there's latitude through the course of this year. And then related to that are you expecting any kind of FRR developments ahead of these auctions themselves? Or would the outcome of the auction and the outcome of any ultimate resolution of how to run this auction prove to be a decision point for states outside of Illinois? I just want to understand the cadence of events given where we stand today. I know there's a lot of moving pieces and that could be a long question but I'll let you respond to as you peak that.","Chris Crane","We are definitely responding to the MOPR in our commentary to FERC in PJM if they need to allow the states to enact whatever policy or legislation they are pursuing prior to running the auctions. There's adequate capacity in \u2013 within the system that we don't need to rush to secure it until the rules are clear. So it would be an unfortunate event if the auctions ran before the states were able to take action, which means you'd be looking at 2024, 2025, before you'd be able to enact and that's a long time with negative cash flows that many of the units would be facing at that point.","So we want to work with every stakeholder we can within the states that we serve to help them enact the policies and explain what we can on the economics. If the bill, as we've seen it and draft towards the end of last year is enacted, it actually has a significant benefit to the consumer. It's not a bill increase as being communicated by some are understood by others.","It actually as Kathleen pointed out, could cost as much as $2.6 billion to the PJM customers. And you take just Illinois alone, that's about 15% or a little over $400 million on an annual basis on an increase to those customers. So there's a customer benefit here. There's \u2013 as drafted or inputted previously there is a cap on the -- and what can be increased on both sides of the investment to support the renewables or the cost of the energy capacity in the system. So we need to be able to have the time -- or the states need to be able to have the time and there's discussion in multiple states right now that they want to look at something differently. And we hope that PJM respects the states' needs and allows them time to enact the policies that they desire.","Julien Smith","Perfect","Operator","Thank you. Your last question come comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, Joe and Chris. ","Chris Crane","Hey, Mike. ","Michael Weinstein","Hey. Maybe you could explain a little bit why the hedging program is still -- is a little bit more behind ratable? And I guess you talked about not expecting a significant balance in power prices going forward. Just wondering what the -- what your thinking is.","Chris Crane","Yes. I'll let Jim McHugh answer that.","Jim McHugh","Yeah. Hi, Michael, it's Jim. We have shifted our positioning in the markets through time. I think we -- at this time of year 18 months ago or even 24 months ago we were carrying a position behind ratable primarily in the baseload regions looking at the markets and where they were trading. What we've done is we've shifted some of that to different regions. For example one of the areas we've -- with a backward-dated curve in ERCOT for example. We see opportunities in different seasons in Texas with ORDC pricing being more relative for the future. So there's just we're picking and choosing our spots I would say and it's spread out across multiple regions.","And it's just a smaller overall position but we're looking at where the opportunities are. And then not -- a little bit relative to your question I would just highlight too that the vast majority of our new business would not come from that type of optimization activity, but 70% to 75% would come from our load sales and customer-facing business in retail and wholesale. So we see a good strong pipeline for those activities. And you saw the win rates and renewal rates that Chris spoke to during the call which is another opportunity for us to continue to make our new business targets.","Michael Weinstein","Right. Still pretty well-balanced. Hey, and on the capital program would it be fair to say that it's -- that you're being conservative on it given the uncertainty over PJM and CJM? Could the capital program actually be higher next year if we see some more resolution more certainty over that?","Joe Nigro","Michael, what I would say is our capital program reflects what we think is -- the projects we've identified as I said in my prepared remarks at this point in time. I think that you've seen the uptick in what we put in in 2019 versus what we're putting in in 2020 and we'll continue to challenge ourselves for the benefit of our customers. But right now I would tell you I think what we're showing you is a fair reflection of where we are and what we expect to do.","Calvin Butler","Michael, this is Calvin. I would also say when you look at 2019 we added $150 million additional capital all around gas main replacement and really adding to the overall customer experience. And as we've built out our plan whether it's transmission or distribution additional capital it's all around meeting those customers' expectations and our stakeholders' in terms of reliability and resiliency. So we feel we have a solid plan and can execute to it.","Chris Crane","The only thing, I'd add to that is every quarter we look at the total bill of the customers and we're very sensitive to making sure the investment is prudent. It drives efficiency reliability and benefit to the customer and we also watch the affordability.","Michael Weinstein","Got it. One last question. Hey, Calvin. So the PHI multiyear rate plan filing for this year are you guys -- would it be fair to say that the ROEs tick up from the low 9s could go up to the high 9s if you get that approved later on?","Calvin Butler","No. What we anticipate -- we do not first right now we expect the DC Commission to come out with a ruling in the fourth quarter of this year. And along the way we've adjusted our ask in terms of those multiyear plans. But we have a very solid understanding of what those ROEs are so I'm comfortable with where they are right now.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. All right. Thank you very much.","Chris Crane","Thank you and thank you for participating today. Before we end, I want to thank our employees for staying focused on safety and delivering another good year both operationally and financially.","And with that, I'll close out the call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for joining us today. We hope you found this presentation informative. This concludes our presentation.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Eggers. Please go ahead, sir.","Daniel L. Eggers - Exelon Corp.","Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during the call.

We have scheduled 45 minutes for today's call.","I'll turn it now over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Thanks, Dan, and good morning to all. Thank you for joining us. 2016 was a monumental year for Exelon, and I'm very proud of what we have accomplished. We made great progress in the ongoing transformation of our company while delivering on our commitments. We performed well financially. Our 2016 GAAP earnings at $1.22 and our non-GAAP earnings were $2.68, landing near the top of our original guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70.","At the utilities, we benefited from a hot summer and low storm costs. At ExGen, the nuclear fleet had its best performance year on record. And at Constellation, the team executed very, very well.","In 2016, for the first time, our regulated utility, less the holding company, earnings represented more than half of the total earnings and is consistent with our goal for the utilities to be growing the majority of our EPS. And we've implemented a dividend growth strategy of 2.5% annually through 2018.","In March, we closed on the acquisition of PHI, adding $8.3 billion to our utility rate base and creating a significant geographic footprint covering the Mid-Atlantic region. The integration of PHI is going better than planned, help by our experience with BGE. We are working our way through the first of the two cycles of catch-up rate cases at the PHI utilities. We're seeing additional opportunities to help and improve the business processes in the stakeholder outreach process as we go through those rate cases.","The other banner highlight for 2016 was the creation of the ZEC programs in both New York and Illinois. For years, we have argued that all clean energy resources be treated the same way for their environmental attributes. We're able to work with a wide range of stakeholders in both states to enact programs that compensate these plans for their environmental attributes. As a result of these programs, we plan to continue to operate five plants and protect high-paying jobs, preserve needed tax basis in rural communities and maintain irreplaceable emission-free base load power production. These programs provide a supplemental cash flow for up to 12 years for some of our most at-risk plants.","Illinois legislation also provides significant benefit for our customers in energy efficiency, additional renewable generation and to benefit lower income customers. The program also adds to the earnings visibility at ComEd by implementing a decoupling mechanism, supporting energy efficiency investments where we now will be able to earn a return on those investments, and extending the formula rate to 2022.","In 2016, we also found ways to further grow stable revenue streams. We deployed $5.2 billion of CapEx at the utilities, growing the rate base by $2 billion, acquired ConEd Solutions, and will close the FitzPatrick nuclear plant station this spring. We have completed nine transmission and distribution rate cases, providing revenue increases of $397 million.","None of these accomplishments would be possible without the remarkable 34,000 employees that work hard every day to keep the power and gas flowing. Our workers donated over 170,000 hours to local non-profits, and Exelon donated $46 million, both of which were the most ever for Exelon. The commitment to our community is clearly part of who we are and shows our engagement beyond the products we deliver every day.","We also recognize that the support of our employees is essential to high-performing work cultures, and that is why Exelon took industry lead on two important initiatives in 2016. We expanded our paid leave policies to what are truly the best in class, with 16 weeks of maternity leave, 8 weeks for fathers and adopted parents, and 2 weeks of family leave. We were also the first utility to sign the White House Equal Pay pledge.","Being a good citizen also means supporting our local businesses. In 2016, our spend with female and minority-owned businesses reached $1.9 billion, over 200% since 2011, and it represents almost 20% of our sourceable spending. The team has done a great job making sure we work with our suppliers across all our communities. Doing the right thing by our employees and communities is the smart thing for business. And more importantly, it's the right thing to do. We are proud to be leading the industry forward on these fronts.","Turning to operations, our utilities had a great year. The legacy Exelon utilities continued to perform at top quartile on key operating and customer satisfaction metrics. These are the foundations of a constructive regulatory relationship. The efforts at PHI before the merger and our intense focus on operations since then has started to show benefits.","The color blocks are improving even compared to 2015, although we did get some help from favorable weather in 2016. PHI is still improving. We're encouraged by the gain so far, and we have plan in place to deliver for our customers and stakeholders.","The color blocks show great performance, but this actually is underselling how well we did in 2016. We actually had a number of best-evers this year. ComEd, BGE, PECO had had their best customer satisfaction ever. ComEd and PHI outage frequency were the best ever. And BGE had its shortest average outage duration ever. The benefits of our uniform management model across the utilities, our smart grid initiative, and our continued reliability spending are clearly paying dividends for our customers.","Turning to our non-regulated business operations, we had a banner year in generation as well. Our nuclear fleet had its highest ever capacity factor at 94.6% versus the industry average of 90.4%, which allowed us to produce an additional 7 terawatt hours more and approximately $275 million of revenue than if we had just been average. We also had the shortest average refueling duration ever, just over 22 days versus the industry average of 37 days. The fact the entire fleet performed so well against the backdrop of potential plant closures and fighting for ZECs is truly a testament to the professionalism of the workforce, which we all are greatly appreciative of.","Our gas, hydro, and renewable assets also had a good year, strong energy capture on the renewable and the power dispatch on our conventional plants.","At Constellation, the team performed exceptionally well. Our customer renewal rate was 77% for electric and 91% for gas. Equally important, our new business win rate was at 28% last year, and our C&I market share grew to 25%.","Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Jack to provide the financial update.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will focus on 2016 results, 2017 earnings guidance, and updates to a number of our financial disclosures including gross margin. Going forward, the fourth quarter will be when we update key financial disclosures and roll our hedge disclosures over the year.","On slide 8, as Chris stated, we had a very strong year financially and operationally across the company. For the full year, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $2.68 per share, near the top end of our original guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share.","Strong performance at both our utility and generation businesses drove these results. The appendix contains further detail on both our fourth quarter and full-year financial results by operating company on slides 52 and 53.","Turning to slide 9, we expect to deliver full-year 2017 adjusted operating earnings of $2.50 to $2.80 per share with the first quarter in the range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Our 2017 guidance range includes a full-year contribution from PHI, contributions from the FitzPatrick plants after closing, and the partial year impacts of the New York and Illinois ZEC programs that start on April 1 and June 1 respectively.","The growth in utility earnings primarily reflects continued reliability investments at ComEd, plus higher formulaic allowed ROEs, as well as increased rates from the recent distribution rate cases at BGE, ACE, and Pepco Maryland. These are partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to a return to normal storing costs after a calmer 2016, as well as higher depreciation and amortization driven by capital expenditures.","At Exelon Generation, the year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by the impact of hedging into lower energy prices, partially offset by revenues from the New York and Illinois ZEC programs as well as the new Texas CCGTs coming online this summer. More detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found on the appendix starting on slide 55.","On slide 10, let's turn to our updated multi-year forecast, and we'll cover 2017 to 2020 and provide a refresh of what we shared with you at the Analyst Day. For your convenience, in the appendix, we show these updated numbers side-by-side against the Analyst Day numbers.","We'll invest more than $20 billion into our utilities to the benefit of our customers over the next four years, which is a slight increase since Analyst Day. Upside comes from the Future Energy Jobs Bill in Illinois, which will allow ComEd to grow rate base and earn a fair rate of return on energy efficiency investments. We now project rate base growth of 6.5% through 2020.","On slide 11, of the $9 billion of rate base growth expected through 2020, approximately 75% is covered under either formula rates or other similar types of mechanisms. These timely recovery mechanisms allow us to make additional investments on the behalf of our customers while supporting our ability to earn our allowed ROE. Where we do not have mechanisms, we will continue to work with stakeholders to enact and implement these types of tools. I should also note that following the passage of the Illinois legislation, more than 70% of our rate base is decoupled.","On slide 12, we showed the trailing 12-month blended transmission-distribution earned book ROE at each of the PHI utilities relative to their allowed ROEs. ROEs at PHI have improved modestly, but there's still much work to be done. Legacy Exelon utilities had a strong 2016, earning 10.5% as a group, helped by favorable weather and lower-than-normal storm activity.","On a weather-normalized basis, the earned returns or ROEs would be closer to 10.1%. Improving the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining a strong performance of the legacy Exelon utilities will be important to meeting our overall utility earnings growth targets. Going forward, we will provide a slide on a quarterly basis to keep you updated on the progress we're making from an earned returns perspective.","On slide 13, we have an update on our current rate cases that are still in progress. Since our last update, we have completed two of the pending rate cases, the Pepco Maryland case was decided in November and we received a $52.5 million revenue increase. In addition, the ComEd annual formula rate filing was settled in December with an increase of $127 million related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. Those investments which includes $663 million for smart grid-related work has helped strengthen and modernize the electric system.","We still have four pending rate cases at Pepco and Delmarva, combined we're asking for $216 million in revenues, which reflects recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments that have been made to improve the reliability of the grid across these jurisdictions.","We expect the final ruling on the Delmarva Maryland case in mid-February, with the remaining cases being completed over the summer. More details on the rate cases can be found on slide 61 through 66 in the appendix.","Consistent with our previous discussions, we expect to file rate cases in each of the PHI jurisdictions again in 2017, as we continue to close the gap between allowed and earned ROEs.","Slide 14 provides an update on our outlook for utility EPS. The bars are largely the same as in Analyst Day, albeit $0.05 higher in 2017 and 2020. The increase in 2017 is due to continued cost management efforts; and the increase in 2020 is due to ComEd ROEs and efficiency-related investments. With a higher 2017 starting point, we now project strong 6% to 8% utility EPS growth through 2020.","Turning to slide 15, we've modified our gross margin disclosures for ExGen. We now include a new line that carves out capacity and ZEC revenues. ZEC revenues are the payments Exelon receives in New York and Illinois for the beneficial environmental attributes of our nuclear plants. The purpose of this new line item is to clearly call out the portion of our gross margin that is more contracted in nature. As a result of including ZEC revenues from New York and Illinois, the FitzPatrick acquisition and the reserved \u2013 reversal of the shutdown decisions of Quad Cities and Clinton, total gross margin increased by $650 million, $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. Almost all the gross margin changes relate to the fleet updates with changes in power prices, adding $50 million in 2018 and costing us $50 million in 2019.","Turning to slide 16, on our last earnings call, we announced we were reducing O&M by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen, adding to the $400 million of savings we've already taken out of the business.","The baseline O&M outlook remains the same from last quarter, although the total O&M cost outlook has increased with the addition of the FitzPatrick, Quad Cities, and Clinton power stations which we break out on the slides for your reference.","Our baseline capital spend is decreasing through 2020, driven by the proactive investments we've made in our nuclear fleet over the years. These investments have resulted in best-in-class performance and reduced risks for significant unplanned capital spend in the future.","On slide 40, we provide greater detail on these investments and the impact they have had on the nuclear fleet since 2010. We continue to run an efficient organization, and we'll always look for ways to reduce costs and run the fleet more cost effectively while maintaining the highest standards for safety and reliability.","Turning to slide 17, ExGen will generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is more free cash flow for that time period than what was included in our Analyst Day disclosure. This is primarily driven by the incremental cash associated with the New York and Illinois ZEC programs, partially offset by the impacts of lower power prices in the outer years. As we've said before, we will use ExGen's free cash flow to fund utility investment and pay down over $3 billion of debt through 2020.","Turning to slide 18, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. We are forecasting to be at 3.3 times debt-to-EBITDA at ExGen by the end of 2017 and have a clear path to our long-term target of 3 times debt-to-EBITDA. As we've said before, we will look to retire holding company debt once we've reached the 3 times target at ExGen.","From a recourse perspective, we are already below the 3 times debt-to-EBITDA level at 2.7 times, as shown here on the slide. This ratio will continue to decline as well with the paydown of debt to reach our consolidated 3 times target. The health of our ExGen balance sheet is strong and is continuing to improve.","Before I turn the call over to Chris, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the potential impacts of tax reform legislation of Exelon, which has been a topic of discussion since the election. Research reports and our peers who have already reported earnings have discussed the impacts to the sector and their businesses.","From a policy perspective, we think simplifying the tax code and lowering rates is the right objective. We are actively working with our partners at EEI and NEI and on our own to help inform the ultimate tax design. No legislation has been introduced at this time, so no details on exactly what will be included or how it will be => included is available beyond the short description of the Trump plan or the House blueprint.","In fact, just last week, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hatch said he's not planning on using the House legislation as a starting point. So the Senate will have its own bill, and there's no proposal for that bill at this time. And President Trump's economic team has stated that they will have their own views on tax reform once they're in place.","At this time, there's no way to know what a tax reform package will look like or how long it will take to advance, which leads us to the mindset that is premature to quantify how tax reform will impact Exelon's financial outlook. We run a wide range of scenarios to understand the high-level impacts of common themes in the House and Trump plans.","The House blueprint, excluding order adjustment provisions, will be neutral for our utilities, neutral to positive at the GenCo, and negative at the holding company due to the elimination of all interest deductibility. Order adjustment will be an additional negative at ExGen due to the importation of nuclear fuel, and at that the utilities would raise the cost of imported T&D capital equipment that goes in the rate base.","We've seen significant opposition to both the border adjustment and elimination of interest expense deductibility recently, leaving the fate of these provisions unclear. To the extent the Trump campaign becomes the basis of legislation and the election is made to take interest deductibility rather than immediately expense capital additions, it could be meaningfully positive to Exelon's earnings.","We see a long path until tax policy has clarity. We'll continue to advocate for the best interest of our customers and shareholders as legislation is developed.","With that, I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Thanks, Jack.","This next slide should look familiar to you at this point. This is Exelon's value proposition, and we are not wavering from these commitments. Strong utility growth, we expect to grow the rate base at 2.5% annually through 2020 \u2013 at 6.5%. Dan caught that one right away, 6.5% annually through 2020, which converts to EPS growth off our 2017 midpoint of 6% to 8% a year.","We will continue to look for opportunities to invest in reliability and customer service. ExGen is expected to generate nearly $7 billion of free cash flow through 2020, which is better than we had budgeted at the Analyst Day. We will use this free cash flow primarily to invest in the utilities, pay down over $3 billion of debt over the next years. And we will continue to optimize the value of ExGen through best-in-class operating like we saw in 2016, capturing the benefits of our gen-to-load matching strategy, and fair compensation for our clean energy assets, similar to what we've accomplished in Illinois and New York.","We remain focused on the balance sheet and are comfortably exceeding our credit metrics targets over the planning horizon. And our capital allocation priorities will remain the same, regulated utility growth, dividend growth, and debt reduction. The leadership team firmly believes we can deliver on these commitments to our shareholders.","Our executive compensation is directly tied to these goals, with the long-term components driven by hitting the multi-year earnings targets at the utilities which ensures we grow this business as we've committed to you. Meeting our targets improvements in earned ROEs at the utilities, which ensure we turn around the performance of the PHI utilities and maintain a strong investment grade credit metrics, which ensures the financial health of the business, no matter what the commodity price backdrop is.","Finally, our long-term compensation will be adjusted point per point with the three-year performance relative to the UTY, meaning that we are directly aligned with the long-term shareholders. I'm proud of everything that this team has accomplished in 2016 and very excited about the plan we have in place for the future.","So, with that, Stephanie, we can open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions as you guys were pretty thorough. So, can you give us an update on where you were on some of the tactical decisions you've made to sell down or exit from certain businesses, both the sell-down of the renewables business and the process on Mystic?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Greg, it's Jack. I'll take that. So, I'll start with the renewables. I think it's been widely reported that that we've been in the markets talking about a joint venture for our renewables business, and that process is going well. We want to maintain a stake in that business as it's important to our overall participation in the energy complex.","We do have a significant amount of project-level debt on those projects. So there is a thinner equity layer on top of that. So the proceeds, while meaningful, will be used for debt reduction. We'd expect that to be a very positive event for the company.","With respect to the Mystic process, that process continues to be underway. We've had broad interest in those assets as they play a key role in that needful market in Downtown Boston. We continue to work with the various stakeholders to draw it to a conclusion. And we look forward to that having a favorable outcome as well here.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Jack, can you give us any insight as to why it's taken longer than maybe we had initially expected when we \u2013 when you first articulated a desire to potentially sell those assets, it was at the EEI last year. And there was the potential for sort of an event early in the first quarter, and we still haven't seen that. And then, even if you were to get a deal tomorrow, given the lack of a quorum at the FERC, what are we looking at in terms of realistic timing to actually come to a closing of a transaction there?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","So, if we did openly talk about it after it had been leaked and figured we get that out there, but there is no fire sale here. We need to take our time and go through the process and make sure we obtain the right value for us and for all involved in it, so working through it, and we'll keep you informed when we're at a closure.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. But assuming you got a price that was accretive to what you think the implied value is today for ExGen, that would accelerate the deleveraging that you're talking about here on slide 18 in the handout, right?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","That's correct, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Fantastic. And the growth rate target for the utility now, that's just clearly a function of having a higher base in 2017, you're $0.05 higher in 2020. So, the headline number is not a reduction in the expectations, it's just algebra, right?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","That's correct. And you'll know with the passage of Illinois legislation and the energy efficiency programs, the solar programs we added to CapEx at ComEd, rather substantively throughout the curve. I think it's also important to note, we have a pretty conservative policy on only putting into our CapEx forecast the utilities, plants that are fully formed for capital investment. So, as time progresses and as we see opportunities to invest in the behalf of our customer, there are the opportunities for that rate base and capital budget to grow in those outer periods.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Right. I have more questions, but I'll go back in the queue. Thanks.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Good morning.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can I ask, Jack, I noticed you mentioned that the \u2013 that debt reduction target on slide 17 is now ExGen and HoldCo, and I think before it was just ExGen, so just to confirm that \u2013 if that is the case. And secondly, how much of the $3 billion roughly is it going to take to get to the 3x debt-to-EBITDA target? So, how much is therefore left over for HoldCo on the current plan?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","So, Jonathan your first comment is correct. We previously were talking about retiring debt at the GenCo, now we see the opportunity once we achieved 3 times debt-to-EBITDA to retire debt at the holding company. With respect to the debt retired \u2013 we'll retire at the holding company, we have a $900 million maturity in 2020, where I think you could see us potentially retire debt or some component of debt, and we're looking at opportunities with use of proceeds from a variety of strategic activities that we have ongoing to address the roughly $600 million of ExCorp that's not tied to the mandatory convertibles reissuance of $1.15 billion in 2017.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What's roughly the timing that you see in this kind of \u2013 through 2020 outlook that you'd get to 3x on the GenCo absent an asset sale?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","I think it's \u2013 I think \u2013 I think we can get there through cash generation I think over the next, say, two to three years. And then, we can \u2013 as we get out in the 2019, 2020, we can work against the holding company.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, if I could ask one other thing on \u2013 can you give us any sort of thoughts around potential for other states to consider New York and Illinois style nuclear measures?","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","Jonathan, this is Joe Dominguez. Right now, active discussions are occurring in Connecticut which is probably the most advanced. We believe those discussions will be started in Ohio, already have been relatively shortly in New Jersey and in Pennsylvania. I think all of the states, as Chris indicated before, states that understand the value of the nuclear plants and want to keep these plants operational, and so the level of discussion is at different stages, some with fully formed legislation that's already moving through committee, that's the case in Connecticut, and stakeholder average (32:16).","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. That's it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Yes, we hear you fine, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Just a couple of nuclear questions. First, could you give a sense on the appeal process on the ZECs, I guess, in New York, and when we should know from the court kind of roughly either way on the ruling both, I guess, your motion to dismiss and then an actual ruling?","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","So in the Federal Court action in New York, as you noted, a motion to dismiss has been filed. That's been fully briefed. I know a number of you have asked for the briefing packages, and those are available to anybody who would like them. We feel very strongly about our case and we believe it should be dismissed on that motion. But if it proceeds to trial, that trial will occur through to the balance of the second quarter, and we would expect a decision sometime this summer.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just more broadly on nuclear, there's been talk of the Trump administration wanting to do something for nuclear. Is there any better visibility on what they might be looking at or things that you might be suggesting?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","There hasn't been any concrete conversations, just a preliminary recognition of what's going on in the marketplace and the need to maintain the diverse power sources, looking at the economics, local economics of them and the benefit to the customer. So just starting, a lot more dialogue will happen with NEI and the administration, and we're staying involved with NEI and also with our own folks interfacing with the administration.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, one separate question on tax reform. I know you don't want to get into specifics, but just if we think about your company and the issues you care most about getting fixed or adjusted, are there any particular ones that you're most focused on addressing of the different factors that you mentioned?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Yes, we think Jack did a good job framing up why it's really premature for us to get point to point. I spent a lot of time on my own and with the EEI leadership in DC to look at this effect on utilities, utility customers, and what has happened in 1986 tax bill. So there are certain things in the regulated space that create a difference. I'm sure a lot of industries are trying to say they're different. But surely back in 1986, the insurance industry and the utility industry, the regulated utility industry was recognized as an exemption or a different methodology.","So that kind of conversation is happening within the process. It's not right to have a debate across the table until we have a bill, but coalescing under Tom Kuhn's leadership and the EEI executive leadership and board, we're working through those issues. Everybody is for a lower corporate tax rate. That's an easy one. Jack talked about the probability of the blueprint staying the way it is now versus after the sausage is made. It's something we'll just have to stay engaged and follow. But you reduce an interest deduction from a utility, and that automatically goes on to the customer, and we've got to make sure it's not an unintended tax increase for the customer and we just have to work through those details.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Good morning.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, maybe quickly following up on the last one here with Steve, can you elaborate a little bit on what the read-through would be from the litigation in New York vis-\u00e0-vis Illinois? Would there be an immediate impact, or how are you thinking about this perhaps across the various ways it could play out? And I've got a follow-up back.","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","Julien, this is Joe. The programs in New York and Illinois are very similar. They're both based on paying for the environmental attribute based on the social cost of carbon. And so the read-through is that when we are successful in New York, we think it will be a very helpful precedent to challenge the Illinois legislation.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it, excellent. And then just following up here on Greg's earlier question, just to establish a little bit of a baseline, how are you thinking about your portfolio evolution given the need to backstop the broader retail business? Are basically all combined cycles, broadly taking here, something that could be looked at? And then also at the same time, how are you thinking about the expansion of the retail business? Obviously, there have been some headlines out there on that as well.","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Julien, good morning. It's Joe Nigro. Broadly, we look at our asset portfolio on an annual basis and we look across our nuclear fleet through to our fossil and renewable fleet. And strategically, you've seen some of the assets that we've divested through time here, and I will tell you it hasn't had a material impact on managing our retail portfolios, given that we carry a lot of what I would call optionality in our portfolio with the generation assets.","And then additionally, when we need to, we will go to market to augment with additional products. So we're very comfortable where we are and we continue to strategically look at our portfolio. And if the market is willing to pay for something maybe more than we have value on, then we'll take that into account, make the decisions necessary recognizing that we do need to continue to manage our business. And I'm sorry, the question on...","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Retail growth.","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Retail growth, we're now \u2013 our C&I business is, as Jack mentioned or Chris mentioned in the script, we're about 25% of the market share in C&I. Our margins remained stable in that $2 to $4 origination range, and we continue to monitor that very closely. You heard what our renewal rates are and our win rates are, and they're in line with what we've laid out in the Analyst Day, and we're very comfortable with the plan that we have in place as we move through 2017. We'll continue to monitor that, but right now, we're very happy with where we are.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","And you wouldn't necessarily take this out a little further, acquisitive expansions in addition to organic, and maybe that's a good kind of segue into thinking about \u2013 what kinds of targets are you thinking about on a volumetric basis for the volumes in aggregate as we move through time?","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","We've given you the volumes, and I think previously \u2013 and we rolled them out again at the EEI, and we're very comfortable with where we are on the volume scale. I would tell you, you continue to see consolidation in the retail market, you see some generation entrance that have bought entities, existing entities, not really creating their own retail platform, so there's really no change there.","As you know, we've bought a few in the last few years, and we see the consolidation. We'll continue to hunt for those if the opportunity is right, and we see value and it fits our portfolio in what we're trying to achieve with the customer. And we'll remain disciplined with that. With our acquisition a few years ago of Integrys, and recently, last year with ConEd, we've been very happy with that outcome and the way they've integrated into our portfolio, and we'll continue to look for those type of opportunities.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the impact or the impacts of lower load growth and capacity performance in the PJM, upcoming PJM capacity auction. And separately, FERC recently rejected the MISO proposal for a competitive retail solution in certain zones. One of the criticisms, I think, FERC had in the rejection was that it was not broad enough throughout MISO. I'm just wondering if there's any potential for some kind of broader forward auction system throughout the entire Midwest ISO.","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. Good morning, Michael. It's Joe Nigro. I'll take the first question on PJM, and then I'll hand it off up to Joe Dominguez, and he can talk a little bit about the MISO question. From a PJM perspective, there is a lot of moving pieces, the load came in, as was previously announced, down about 3.5 gigawatts or 2%. So, that wasn't unexpected. We cleared about 27 gigawatts of non-CP supply last year or 16% of what cleared, and as you mentioned, that will be 100% CP this year. that's obviously a positive change when you think about price. There were some movement in the import capabilities. We saw it shrink some into the ComEd zone. And we saw it increased slightly into eastern Mass., so that has an offsetting effect in those two areas.","I guess the big thing is it remains around the two biggest variables which are the bidding behavior, and as you know, year-over-year, the energy rents are down, given how low the prices were on coal last year, and then additionally, what the new build is. And we continue to struggle to see how the economics of that new build works, given how marginal it is at best with where the market is on a forward basis. So, putting that all together, there's a lot of moving pieces where our long-standing policy is really not to try to forecast that, but there's a lot of puts and takes that we're evaluating as we go through this.","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","And Michael, this is Joe Dominguez, the short answer to your question is, no, I don't see a likelihood that we will see, as a result of this FERC order, an expansion of the proposals for what was effectively Southern Illinois and Michigan across all \u2013 with MISO. I could go into a little bit more detail but the answer is no.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","At this time, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Our final question will come from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Good morning, guys.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Good morning, Shahriar.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Good morning, Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Just real quick on the $0.32 that you're now guiding on ZECs and FitzPatrick, can you \u2013 are you embedding any sort of synergies of owning Nine Mile and FitzPatrick within the same portfolio, or you're still kind of looking at this opportunity?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","We're still looking at the opportunity, we're in the process of integrating that plans and that's going quite well. We've got to close the acquisition in March. Obviously, given its proximity to our Nine Mile units, we anticipate that there may be opportunities as we get in there and optimize the operations.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners","Okay. Got it. And then, Joe, can you just real quick handicap Pennsylvania, maybe from a potential timing or when we can see something? Are we looking at an adjustment to the RPS to include the nuclear, or is it more of a function of sort of a similar ZEC-type program?","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","I think historically what we've done is we've begun the discussion, and the first stage of the discussion is establishing a recognition that nuclear is the lowest cost and most reliable zero-carbon option for our customers, that's where we are in Pennsylvania. The next stage, I think we'll start getting into different solution sets, and you've identified a few, right. So, you could look at something that's similar to the ZEC programs that have been adopted. You can include nuclear as a qualifying resources and RPSs. And it's way too early for me to handicap where that discussion is going to go. There are a lot of different stakeholders. What's important to us is syncing effectively the first concept, which is that nuclear needs to be treated on a level playing field with other non-emitting resources.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2014 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Ravi Ganti, you may begin your conference.","Ravi Ganti","","Thank you, Amy. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our second quarter 2014 earning conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s President and CEO; Jack Thayer, Exelon\u2019s Executive Vice President and CFO, and Joe Nigro, CEO Constellation.","They are joined by other members of Exelon\u2019s senior management team, who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. We issued our earning release this morning along with a presentation, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon\u2019s website. The press release and other matters that we discuss during today\u2019s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties.","The actual results could defer from our forward-looking statements, based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's earning release, comments we do in this call, and in the risk factors section of the earnings release. Please reported today's 8-K and Exelon\u2019s other fillings for a discussion of factors that may cause the results to differ from managements projections, forecasts, and expectations.","Today\u2019s presentation also includes references to adjusted opening earnings which is a non-GAAP measure. Please report to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and the earnings release for reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures to the GAAP earnings. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon, CEO.","Christopher M. Crane","Thanks, Ravi. Good morning to everybody and thank you for joining. We had a good quarter overall, but before I get into those details I wanted to start today\u2019s call by re-emphasizing Exelon\u2019s long-term strategy. Our strategy is to continue to leverage our integrated business model to create value, invest for growth, and explore ways to diversify our business into other areas of the energy value chain. The utilities provide stable earnings in dividend support and allow us to reinvest in projects to strengthen the infrastructure. Our competitive business provides commodity upside, and the platform to diversify into adjacent markets.","On the regulated side, the Pepco Holdings transaction provides an opportunity to accelerate our regulated growth, and provides stable cash flows, earnings accretion and dividend stability. The geographic fit in the operational synergies provide us the opportunity to deliver better customer service. On the Genco side, we continue to look for ways to grow in the existing markets we serve, and diversify into other related areas.","Our partnership with Bloom Energy Fuel Cells is aligned with our goals of keeping up with our customer needs and the growth demand for distributed generation. Our acquisition of the Integrys Energy Services business allows us to expand our retail footprint further in an industry that continues to mature, consolidate, and provide hedging diversification benefits for our existing portfolio.","Similarly, our interest in the Annova LNG is another example. We are significant participants in natural gas market, managing approximately 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas on an annual basis. This project fits nicely in this business and aims to develop mid-scale, LNG facility near Port of Brownsville, Texas. It\u2019s in its early stage of screening for development with very little financial commitment for us at this moment, but has significant potential upside. So you can expect that we will continue to look for, and find diversification opportunities that leverage our expertise and strengths.","Moving on to the quarterly results, we posted a solid quarter with operating earnings of $0.51 per share, which is just over the upper end of our guidance range. For the full-year, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 a share, which we provided to you at the beginning of the year. Jack is going to go into more details about the earning in our financial performance in his remarks.","On the operational front, we had a solid operational performance at our nuclear fleet this quarter. We achieved 91.8% capacity factor while completing five refueling outages during the second quarter. After completing our spring refueling outages, we ran at 98.8% for the month of June.","These capacity factors include our ownership share of the CENG plants, which became integrated into the Exelon operations platform on April 1. Our gas renewable fleets had a strong quarter as well with fossil hydro dispatch match at 99.2% and our solar and wind energy capture at 94.7%.","ComEd and PECO had significant storms around the end of the quarter and on the last day of the quarter we had severe weather including multiple tornados in Illinois that caused service interruptions to over 420,000 customers in the ComEd service territory. PECO faced two storms on July 3 and July 8 that left more than 400,000 customers without power. In the matter of three days, or a little less, the power was restored to over 99.9% of those affected, demonstrating a storm response capability of our organization. I'd like to thank those personnel that were involved for the quick and rapid response.","On the regulatory side, ComEd filed its most recent annual distribution and transmission formula rate update in April. BGE filed its electric and gas distribution rate in early July. In early June, the EPA came out with its much anticipated draft rule for greenhouse gas regulations for existing power plants that set limits on emission by 2013. We see this as a potential positive for Exelon, and we are pleased that the rule recognizes the critical importance of the Nation\u2019s nuclear generation as vital to achieving the proposed standard. While it's too early to draw sweeping conclusions about state-by-state impact given the complexity of the rule in the time afforded to the states to respond, we think that our clean base-load nuclear fleet is well-positioned to take advantage of the potential changes in the stack composition and the generation mix that this will achieve.","Let me give you a quick update on the Pepco Holdings transaction. So far we have submitted filings with Burke, Virginia, DC, New Jersey, and Delaware. We continue to expect this transaction will close in the second to third quarter of 2015. We've made progress on funding the acquisition as well. We had a successful equity issuance in June and asset sales are proceeding, including our sale of our ownership in Safe Harbor that is expected to close in the third quarter.","Jack is going to go into more of the specifics around this area. Touching upon the state of the power markets. Despite the recent pull-back due to mild weather across the U.S. and higher gas production and injection rates, the forward power prices are still higher year-to-date. 14 gigawatts of coal assets that are set to retire in the PJM footprint by next year are still operating. Current weather and expected gas storage levels are going to dictate the forward power prices in the near-term.","We saw high, spot wild volatility in the markets during the first six months of the year, and have seen higher risk premiums and margins for wholesale and retail load products. We aggressively hedged during the quarter, and moved closer to our ratable hedging strategy capturing the upside prices we saw during the quarter. Joe Nigro is going to go into more details in his comments.","On the PJM auction results, as you know, the auction cleared at $120 a megawatt day, it was higher than most anticipated due to primarily, the rule changes around lower imports, lower demand response, and participants bidding behavior. We think the results are encouraging for our plants that cleared, but there is an opportunity for further improvements in the market rules in the future, such as, firm fuel commitments, anti-speculation rules, and with the recent ruling, court ruling looking for clarity on the role of demand response, energy efficiency in the capacity markets.","Our nuclear units: Oyster Creek, Quad Cities, and Byron, five in total did not clear the auction. For Quad Cities and Byron, these units are important for grid reliability, environmental and from an economic standpoint, are especially critical in helping Illinois meet its environmental goals in light of the recent EPA rules.","To that extent, Illinois House passed a House Resolution 1146 in May recognizing the value of nuclear energy for its reliability and its carbon-free benefits and urged the expiration of our opportunities to avoid closing nuclear plants.","We have agreed not to make any decisions about retiring these units until June of next year to allow for the Illinois legislature time to enact market-based reforms at the state level that this could be items such as joining Reggie or a clean energy standard.","However, as we\u2019ve said in the past, if we are unsuccessful and we do not see a path to sustain profitability for these units in question, we will be forced to retire them to avoid long-term losses. I do want to be clear, again, about one thing, we are not looking and do not want contracts for subsidies from Illinois, only contracts that recognize the environmental benefit in the reliability of the assets.","To wrap up, we\u2019re confident our fleet operations in our portfolio management to deliver our earnings expectations for the full year. A key area of focus for us during the second half of this year is to continue working through regulatory approvals to close the Pepco transaction. We will continue to look for opportunities to invest in assets that add value to Exelon and to its shareholders and ways to diversify our portfolio.","With that, now I\u2019ll turn over to Joe Nigro to share his views on the commodity markets.","Joseph Nigro","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. We wanted to take some time to talk about power markets developments this quarter, as well as year-to-date. I will also touch on our generation hedging strategies, discuss the results of the 2017-2018 PJM capacity auction, provide an update on those margins. And finally, tell you how this translates to our gross margin forecast.","Moving to Slide 3, the spot power markets in the first half of the year have been defined by volatility. We have had six months of very constructive spot market signals, followed by July weakness due to weather conditions. In the first quarter of this year, the polar vortex led to higher spot prices in PJM, as we observed the growing reliance on resources such as natural gas units, demand response and oil peakers.","Throughout the second quarter, we saw spot power prices were higher than what we saw during the same period in 2012 and 2013.","Expanding heat rates have been observed under most load conditions. These higher delivered heat rates can be attributed to the change in generation stack. During July, we\u2019ve experienced, unusually mild weather leading from lower spot power and deliver natural gas prices across the board.","Cooling degree dates are trending approximately 10% below normal at a national level, and 35% below normal in the NI Hub area. Due to the lack of weather related demand in July, spot prices in PJM have been clearing lower than the previous two years.","Moving to slide 4, I\u2019ll discuss the forward market and its impact on our hedging profile. It has been a volatile year for forward power prices. The second quarter of 2014 was a continuation of the trend we saw in the first quarter, in terms of an increase in both power prices and heat rates at the NI Hub and West Hub markets.","During the second quarter, forward NI Hub, around-the-clock prices for 2015 and 2016 increased approximately $2 to $3 per megawatt hour, while West Hub prices increased by close to $2. A lot of the increase with in line with our long-held that power prices should increase, giving the ongoing changes to the generation stack associated with coal plant retirements, and an increased reliance on natural gas supply and other high priced, non-based load resources.","During the second quarter, we were able to take advantage of the rising power prices and move our behind ratable strategy, as well as our cross-commodity hedge position closer towards ratable. And we have been operating behind our ratable hedging strategy for some time as we felt the upside in the market of both NI hub and West Hub warranted a more open position.","During the quarter, we captured the running forward prices increasing our hedge generation by approximately, 11% in 2015 and 9% in 2016. We also took advantage of market conditions by reducing the amount of our portfolio that was hedged with natural gas from near 10% to below 5% in both 2015 and 2016. In total, we reduced our power price exposure in 2015 and 2016 by 17% and 12% respectively. Our generation fleet is now hedged between 92% and 95% in 2014, 75% and 78% in 2015, and 46% and 49% in 2016.","Since the end of the second quarter, we have seen forward markets soften due to the weather-related weakness in spot market. Forward prices for natural gas \u2013 natural gas basis, and power are down during the month of July. The move down is largely driven by decline in the prices for the winter delivery months. Specifically, PECO M3 natural gas basis is declined heavily in the winter months, which is led to a corresponding decrease in both West Hub and NI Hub power prices. Spot natural gas basis prices were strong in Q1, driven by weather conditions, but were lower in Q2 as weather driven demand backed off.","The forwards responded accordingly with 2015 gas basis increasing through the first part of the year, only to decline during May and June. Our gas basis dues split into a short-term and long-term view. Over the next two years, we expect volatility to continue; while longer-term, we expect the stability in the Mid-Atlantic base is driven by the development of the infrastructure to transport gas away from the Marcellus shale area, expanding LNG exports, exports to Mexico, industrial expansion and gas demand for power generation.","With respect to the forward power market, we still see upside price opportunity in certain non-winter months and seasons where we believe the markets are undervalued. While we have moved our hedging strategy closer to ratable, and more neutral across the calendar years in 2015 and 2016, we think there is an opportunity to benefit from power price upside in those delivery periods. We will continue to set our hedging strategy according to this view.","Fundamentally, our view of power price upside has not changed. We understand that there are very short-term factors that can impact spot and forward prices, as we saw in the winter and then again, in July this year, weather by itself can have a significant short-term impact on the market. However, our view is grounded in the fundamental changes that are taking place in the market.","Specifically, we expect about 30 gigawatt of coal generation to require \u2013 to retire across the Eastern Interconnect, by next year, with which approximately 14 gigawatts will be in PJM. Changes in this supply stock and more disciplined load pricing are just a few of the fundamental market changes we have witnessed this year.","Before moving onto our gross margin update, I want to touch on the PJM capacity auction and then an update on our retail margins. The PJM auction cleared at $120 per megawatt day in both the RTO and NERC regions. The RTO clearing price doubled from the previous year\u2019s auction, indicative of tighter supply demand fundamentals following coal retiring announcements.","The clearing prices were primarily driven by 3,000 megawatts at lower imports, 1,400 megawatt of lower demand response, and participants bidding behavior. These drivers were partially offset by nearly 6,000 megawatts of new generation that cleared.","There are further potential market design changes that we will continue to monitor, which will impact future capacity prices as well. Some examples of this include uncertainly regarding the impact on capacity and energy markets of the DC Circuit Court vacating FERC Order 745, as well as FERC in PJM working to curve speculation, potential changes to the shape of the demand curve and potential changes due to cold weather reforms.","This was the first option that we did in some of our nuclear units at the rate CRs. And as a result, Quad Cities units one and two fired in units, one and two and Oyster Creek did not clear. As Chris mentioned, the failure of these units to clear will be a key factor in our decision and whether or not to shut down the plants. Our nuclear plants rely on the capacity market for revenues, and without those revenues, their economics will be stressed even more. We have committed that no decision will be made on any of our Illinois units before June 2015.","Moving onto our load margins. So far this year, we began to see increases in both our wholesale and retial load margins, as providers become more disciplined in their pricing assumptions. We have and will remain disciplined in our list-premiums and will not chase volumes for the sake of volume.","We continue to see an improving retail market developing to longer-term contracts and competitor consolidation. As many of you may have heard, yesterday, we announced the agreement to acquire Integrys Energy Services, a leading retail power and natural gas provider serving 1.2 million customers across 23 states and the District of Columbia.","The Integrys portfolio adds further scale to our retail power and natural gas business and provides generation and load-matching benefits to our portfolio. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2015.","Turning to slide 5, I will review our updated hedge disclosure, and some of the significant changes given the events for the second quarter. Focusing on 2014, we have a net $50 million increase to gross margin, since the end of the first quarter, driven primarily by the elimination of deal in nuclear waste in, partially offset by an extended outage at Salem. As I mentioned before, our portfolio management teams performed very well in managing our portfolio generation and load given the volatile market.","This contributed to us executing on $100 million of our power new business targets and $50 million of our non-power new business targets during the second quarter. For 2015, we saw pricing increase across most regions. The increase is around $2 per megawatt hour in the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest. This along with the DOE fees resulted in an increase in our open gross margin of $450 million.","Given our hedge position and our execution of $100 million of power new business, our total change in gross margin with an increase of $300 million. For 2016, prices increased by $2 to $3 per megawatt hour. This resulted in an increase of $600 million in our open gross margin, with a hedge position of between 40% to 50% for the quarter, and an execution of $100 million in power new business, our total change in gross margin with an increase of $450 million.","Overall, the first half of 2014 has resulted in higher prices from where we began the year. While mild weather increased gas production and falling natural gas bases prices have challenged power prices during July. Although volatility in the market is likely to persist, we are also confident that gas and power markets are fundamentally stronger and were just a year ago at this time.","Now, I will turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter.","Jonathan W. Thayer","","Thank you, Joe and good morning everyone. I will cover Exelon\u2019s financial results for the quarter. Our third quarter guidance range and update our cash outlook for 2014 including a discussion at the financing for the Pepco Holdings acquisition.","I will start on slide six. As Chris mentioned earlier, Exelon delivered second quarter earnings of $0.51 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.53 per share in the second quarter of 2013. The key drivers of the reduction in earnings quarter-over-quarter were lower realized energy prices at Exelon Generation, offset by increased distribution revenue at the utilities.","The cost of the extended outage at Salem, during the second quarter is offset by the elimination of DOE Nuclear Waste fee. I will go into greater detail on the quarter drivers at each of the utilities in a few moments. For the third quarter we are providing guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. In April, Exelon received the operating licenses for the CEMG nuclear fleet and began operating those plants. Prior to closing, Exelon and Generation each accounted for its investment in CEMG under the equity method of accounting.","After the close, we moved to a consolidated method of accounting and recorded all assets, liabilities, and EDF\u2019s non-controlling interest in CEMG at fair value on Exelon and Generations balance sheet as of April 1. Ongoing operations will be included in the consolidated Exelon and Generation financial statements. However, these accounting changes do not materially change the earnings and cash flow for Generation and Exelon.","For the full-year, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. This guidance includes the impact of the elimination of DOE Nuclear Waste fee and is partially offset by increased outages primarily in the nuclear fleet at Calvert Cliffs and Salem. These outages and their impacts are expected to be a $0.12 per share drag for the year. As we stated before the full-year benefit of the fee expiration is around $150 million per year or approximately $0.11 per share. We do not expect Congress to act to re-instate this fee in the immediate future and therefore have removed it from all years of our gross margin disclosures.","Turning to the utilities on slide seven, they delivered combined earnings of $0.25 for the quarter. Before explaining the drivers of each utility, let me provide a brief update on our latest load forecast. In general, we are seeing load growth year-over-year at ComEd and PECO. While BGE growth is flat for 2013. ComEd is seeing positive load growth of 0.8% across all three customer classes, led by 1.2% in the residential sector. PECO's overall load growth of 0.7% is led by 1.2% growth in the large commercial and industrial sector and offset by a decline in load in the small commercial and industrial sector. You can find our latest full-year load estimates in the appendix on slide 18.","For the second quarter ComEd earned $0.13 per share compared to a $0.11 per share in the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily related to higher distribution revenues due to rate base growth from higher capital investment. PECO\u2019s earnings were $0.10 per share for the quarter; this is up $0.01 per share from the second quarter of 2013, due to decrease income tax expense primarily due to additional tax repair benefits from February and July\u2019s storms and redemption of preferred securities which resulted in a reduction of preferred dividends.","As Chris mentioned earlier, PECO had two significant storm events in early July. Combined, these storms had a total incremental O&M cost of $10 million to $20 million and incremental capital cost of $10 million to $20 million. Despite these storms, and the ice storm in February, we are comfortable that PECO can still meet its full-year guidance range. BGE delivered earnings of $0.02 per share in the first quarter, a decrease of $0.01 from the same period in 2013, due to the increased O&M cost primarily due to bad debt expense, and labor, contracting, and materials partially offset by the increased distribution revenue.","Earlier this month, BGE filed a rate case with Maryland PSC asking for increases of $117.6 million for electric and $67.5 million for gas. We expect the final order in late January 2015 with new rates going into effect shortly thereafter. As you know ComEd filed its annual formula rate case in April and we expect a decision from the ICC by December 12. And the new rates will go into effect in January of 2015.","More information about the filings can found in the appendix, on slides 19 and 20 for ComEd and BGE respectively. Slide 8 provides an update of our cash flow expectations for this year, we project cash from operations of $6.975 billion, this compares to $6.2 billion last quarter. The variance is primarily driven by proceeds from divestitures and a decrease in OPEC contributions.","As you know, we had a busy quarter, working on financings for the Pepco Holdings acquisitions. on May 30 2014, we announced that we had entered into a $7.221 billion bridge loan facility to support the transaction and provide flexibility for timing of permanent financing. We executed the first portion of the permanent financing with a successful equity issuance via forward sale, which priced on June 2011.","we issued $1.2 billion in mandatory convertible units, and $2 billion in equity forward contracts, each of these transactions including green shoes, the proceeds of which may be utilized for accretive growth opportunities. As a result of the equity issuances, we reduced the bridge loan facility to $4.2 billion. We are well down the road with our asset sale program. in May we sold our Safe Harbor hydro facility to Brookfield capital for $613 million, or $375 million after-tax with an expected close in the third quarter.","We\u2019re also proceeding with efforts to divest Fore River, Quail Run, Hillabee and Keystone Conemaugh. We anticipated raising greater than $1 billion in after-tax proceeds from the divestitures, with the excess proceeds funding future invested growth.","As a reminder, I\u2019d like to point out a few changes made to the presentation of the projected sources and uses of cash from the first quarter due to the consolidation of CENG of Exelon. For the fourth quarter of 2013, we showed 100% of CENG cash flows, net of distributions reflected in the cash from operations line and the CENG distribution to EDF in the other line.","Starting the first quarter, we have kept the CENG distribution to EDF in the other line. However we now include 50% of CENG\u2019s CapEx in investing, while leaving all other CENG cash flows, net of distributions and cash from operations. As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts.","Now before I open the call for questions and answer, Q&A, I want to acknowledge that this is Ravi Ganti\u2019s last call as VP of IR. Ravi is moving back East to become the Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Risk Officer.","I thank you for representing Exelon for the past two years. I also want to welcome Francis Idehen as the new VP of IR. Many of you on the phone have met Francis, and we at Exelon are excited to have him in this new role.","That concludes my remarks. Operator, we\u2019d like to turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Christopher M. Crane","Hey, Dan.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Can we talk a little bit more about kind of what\u2019s going in the retail markets, (a) as far as what kind of margins and profitability you guys saw in the quarter. And then with the Integrys acquisition, how you think about the scale of selling power through retail channels relative to other ways of hedging your exposure?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes. Joe will take that.","Joseph Nigro","Good morning, Dan. The retail market remains very competitive. As you know, there\u2019s a number of participants in all the areas that we\u2019re in. I would say however since January, we have seen improvement in all of the retail markets. And it\u2019s really happened on two fronts from our perspective. The first is just the premium \u2013 the rich premiums charge to serve load. And I\u2019m talking both in the retail markets as well as on the polar side, have gone up with the increased volatility we\u2019ve seen in the market.","And then in addition to that, we have seen our margins on the C&I origination on the power side expand as well. And I think both of those things are positive. We have been saying for some time that we expected to see this happen, because we couldn\u2019t get our hands around where the market was trading at effectively. I think from the Integrys perspective, it\u2019s a really good [depth] [ph] for our portfolio from the standpoint of \u2013 the core products are power and gas, which dovetail nicely into our existing retail business.","The 22 states that they\u2019re in, also fit nicely with the geographies that we are in, and it is just a natural opportunity for us to grow the business that you see some of the competitors scale back.","Christopher M. Crane","The only thing I\u2019d add to that, the nature of the business is still very competitive, as Joe said, there\u2019s dozens and dozens of participants that are still in markets like northern Illinois. We expect upon closures that our combined footprint would be about 29%. I think it\u2019s been over reported in a few outlets. And so 28% to 29%, but there again, as the contracts come up, it will be \u2013 that will be processed in a very competitive way. So we feel strong about the acquisition and we still think it supports a very competitive market.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","","You guys have historically talked about kind of $2 to $4 margins for the retail business, where are you seeing new business fall within that continuum?","Joseph Nigro","Dan, we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019ve mentioned previously in the last six months that at one point, we were slightly below that $2 to $4 threshold for C&I originations. We\u2019re now back over that $2 threshold that [core load] [ph] mid $2 and we\u2019ve seen improvement. and as I mentioned in addition to that, on top of that, we\u2019ve seen the actual risk premiums increase. So the increases did really on two fronts, but our margins alone are above that $2 threshold.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","And I guess one other question kind of after the Pepco deal there was talked about, looking to buy more generation assets prospectively as well and maybe the asset sales freeing up even more balance sheet room. Can you just walk through the criteria, you guys expect as you look at buying assets in this market, and then with the volatility and power markets, we\u2019ve seen in the last few months. How is that maybe affecting decisions or where you might want geographic exposure?","Christopher M. Crane","We continue to look at growing both sides of the business either through on the generation side, either through acquisitions or potential development projects. but they have to pass the test of accretion and over the period and a value proposition, a positive NPV, a contribution to earnings and free cash flow or EPS. We participate as assets come more recently. Assets have been going at higher valuations than we would put them in the portfolio for, but it will continue to watch as things come to market and run them through our models.","They need to be generally in the markets that we\u2019re serving and trying to grow into some of the asset optimization there we\u2019re going through now. It is fairly back on a few of the assets that don\u2019t have the good well run assets, good employee base highly reliable, but they don\u2019t have the value creation in our portfolio, so continuing to optimize the assets as we go forward.","As we\u2019ve said previously, really interested in the Texas market, we see the economy there strengthening, we see the demand although not as fast as previously reported presenting opportunities for further growth in the wholesale, and retail opportunities, which would \u2013 with our business model, we\u2019ve tried to match as much as we can the generation to the load and the portfolio.","Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Christopher M. Crane","Hi, Steve.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hi. just first on the guidance for this year, have you incorporated any of this bad July weather, or August forecast in the range or not?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay, good. Is that that\u2019s in your Q3 forecast as well?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes. But one of us said, yes. (Indiscernible)","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. Good, and then just going back to the TEG transaction, retail. can you give us maybe any sense of the metric of what kind of valuation you might have paid for that business?","Joseph Nigro","Well, as we mentioned in the press release, Steve, we paid $60 million for Integrys, and assumed the working capital of approximately $180 million or so. I would say on an EBITDA multiple basis it\u2019s close to or less than 2 times on an EBITDA multiple basis.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. And then this might be a bit of a farfetched question. But just curious, because you\u2019ve been growing your renewable business at a decent amount and contracted generation. What\u2019s your kind of take on this yield curve trend and is this something you\u2019d want to kind of sell your assets to, given that you are probably selling for a lot now or you want to keep trying to grow the business, just how are you thinking it about it?","Christopher M. Crane","We like the business on the projects that you can get for the right value. It is on the renewables a free cash flow play and with the current tax rules that are there it\u2019s a tax play. We have leaned more towards project financing. And we think that fits our needs better than a yieldco and in the long-term with what we see for the tax environment for these assets going forward. So we\u2019re not heading towards yieldco or pushing assets into the yieldcos, we\u2019re more continuing development in project financing assets.","Steve Fleishman \u2013 Wolfe Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Thanks. A couple of questions, first, I know you had a good update on cash flow in part from tax. Though, were those tax inflows contemplated as possible to the beginning of the year and you just excluded them from your guidance, because of you are uncertain on timing, or were they something new that developed over the quarter, and then should we assume a normal effective tax rate in the subsequent quarters in the next couple of years?","Christopher M. Crane","Greg, I\u2019d say some elements were, I would say on the opportunity side. So we had some visibility. We had about $100 million improvements based on tax reimbursement for decommissioning trust funds. The Safe Harbor sale allowed us to accelerate some tax credits, so that pulled forward about $175 million. So we have had some elements that we had some visibility might come to fruition and with some successful settlements with the IRS, as well as very successful sale of Safe Harbor have created incremental opportunity there.","On the effective tax rate side, we would anticipate about 31% to 32% consolidated effective tax rate on operating earnings for the year. And on the GAAP side mark-to-market earnings kind of caused that to have some variability around it. About the modeling purposes, I think you can safely assume the 31% to 32%.","Greg Gordon \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","And in subsequent years, is that a reasonable bogey, or is it \u2013 should we assume something higher in lieu of any one-time tax monetization?","Christopher M. Crane","I think that\u2019s a fairly reasonable level.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. So consistent at that level.","Christopher M. Crane","Yes.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. And then can we talk a little bit about gas and gas basis, working here with John we watched not just strip, but the monthly is in you have still got a pretty positive winter basis and a pretty negative summer basis that take along the three. But then at the Chicago City Gate basis hasn\u2019t been nearly as volatile. What\u2019s your \u2013 what is going on in the real-time market and what is your point of view on how \u2013 Exelon\u2019s point of view on how we ought to think about gas basis?","Joseph Nigro","Yes. Good morning, Greg. It\u2019s Joe. I think from the gas basis perspective, your point is right on. We\u2019ve seen the Nov-March strip for next year, the M3 basis dropped since the end of June about $0.50, and inversely as we tied in early May, it\u2019s dropped almost $1. and to your point, really the summer periods since the end of June for that M3 basis hasn\u2019t fallen at all, we\u2019ve dropped some, since the high at the end of May; Chicago has been much more stable.","From our perspective, there\u2019s a couple of things obviously, the strong Q1 spot prices had a big impact on driving the forward prices higher, both in the winter and summer period. Most we\u2019re seeing an impact that drag through to the forward curve on what\u2019s going on in the spot market. I mentioned in my prepared remarks how we\u2019re 35% down on cooling degree days in Chicago and 10% national.","That\u2019s having an impact in the gas market, both the NI Hub and drag through the basis. I think specifically, the M3 basis, where it\u2019s going to continue to see some of this volatility in the next two years or so. As we continue to produce more gaps with the Marcellus shale, we\u2019re producing about 15 Bcf a day. In Marcellus, we just don\u2019t have the takeaway capacity and move that gas efficiently. As we get out towards 2017, we really expect that gas demand and supply demand balance that Marcellus could come into much better equilibrium, when you think about some of the pipeline reversals in TransCo and Texas Eastern and Rockies Express, which will provide an uptick and more stability to that gas basis.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","So, when will you guys roll out how you\u2019ve positioned yourselves for 2017 vis-\u00e0-vis hedging, and would we expect that perspective to be reflected in your positioning when you do so?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes. I think the way I would answer that is, first is, we\u2019ll roll out 17 like we do every year with EER. And we do have a ratable program for 2017 began this year. We are impacted by gas basis just like everyone else by our open position. But I would also say as we convert to power sales obviously, we don\u2019t have as big an impact on the gas basis doesn\u2019t have as big an impact on us, once we sell the power, because we have so much long base load nuclear generation that it\u2019s not impacted once the power sold.","Joseph Nigro","","But 17 will come out in EER.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","","Thank you, gentlemen.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Good morning, guys.","Christopher M. Crane","","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Could I just ask you to give us an update on how you see the whole kind of discussion in Illinois around these market base solutions playing out? I guess you said you weren\u2019t taking any action on plans till middle of 2015. The legislature is going to come in for a veto session in November, and then be back in the early part of next year. What\u2019s going on currently, if anything, and how is this actually going to move forward?","Christopher M. Crane","","I\u2019ll get Joe Dominguez just to cover his action.","Joseph Dominguez","","Sure. What\u2019s going on currently is that the Illinois stakeholders are taking a look at the 11B proposed rule, which obviously, provide the strong signal to the states to preserve nuclear as part of their compliance plan. The other thing that is happening is part of the resolution that Chris mentioned at the asset, state agencies are drafting a number of reports that will look at the economic value of the units to the local communities, jobs, the value of the energy produced, the value of the low resources. ","And so we expect those reports to be completed sometimes around November or December positioning us for a discussion of solutions in the spring session. So I think the first time we'll see the actual legislation and different proposals will be in the spring. As Chris mentioned, we're looking for a market solution to the extent that low carbon resources, enhanced reliability, or attributes. We'll expect the compensative for those attributes and we\u2019ll expect that competition really at all of the plants and not just the plants that are in jeopardy. So that\u2019s our go-forward plan. I think that\u2019s the timing.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So the next thing we\u2019ll probably see will be this reports coming out towards the end of the year.","Jonathan W. Thayer","That\u2019s right.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then, would you say that the stakeholders\u2019 interest in that is entirely dependent on 1011D, well does that kind of run. Is there a chance we move on this regardless of what happens with EPA and carbon?","Christopher M. Crane","The state has long positioned itself as focused on environmental issues. And they have individually, as the state take actions and advance of 1011D and looking at different programs that they maybe able to participate in, and we see this is helping them with the road map on going forward. So there is an interest within the state for that. There is also an interest within the stake holder body to secure the long-term viability of these assets, they\u2019re greatly highly critical to the economy, local economy in which they are located in serving as tax basis, job basis, economic support for the community. So it\u2019s a multifaceted view, but the environmental support has been a long-term focus for the state.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks, Chris. Can I just ask similar idea on a different topic on the various set of avenues you are pushing forward in terms of PJM market structure reform, could you give us an update on which of those is getting the most attraction and what your expectations are around timing and process there as well?","Christopher M. Crane","Joe you want to\u2026","Joseph Nigro","So there is some unfinished business around the speculation reforms that have been proposed in advance of the last auction and set up some sessions to deal with that. We think that ultimately revise some of those speculation reforms for approval and advance the next auction. The other issue that is gaining a lot of attention, it\u2019s an examination of the winter on a reliability situations I think has revealed some gaps in the capacity product that we have purchased thus for (indiscernible) consumers. So I think PJM is going to be looking at something that procures some additional commitments around high availability resources. I think that\u2019s going to look a lot like resources that have firm fuel, like our nuclear plants. And I think it\u2019s going to be characteristic approach where there will be additional compensation those units or enhanced reliability. And there is also going to be some enhanced penalties.","And I think as an early model one might look to in that regard is what New England has done. I think PJM is going to look very carefully at that. So there will be some more money in the session, but also some more penalties for people who don\u2019t perform. I think generally speaking PJM wants to be added a business of managing fuel supply for gas generators that has become a big issue and will become a bigger issue as the staff changes. And the other thing we saw is obviously generator non-performance in the winter, which really threatened the reliability of systems.","So I figure we will see a proposal sometime in the next month from PJM with action bringing something to firm potentially by the end of the year depending on what the analytics look like.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Would that run on typical PJM PRA schedule with an auction I guess second quarter or you see that happening on a different time frame?","Joseph Nigro","","Well. I think in the long run it\u2019ll do just that, it\u2019ll be part of the PRA and planning perimeters, we see going into the PRAs. But there is a question about these next few winters before we can catch up with the PRA schedule. So I think there's going to need to be something that will be supplemental for the coming winters. But, again, we need to see what PJM proposes. But I don't think it just truly to PRA plan. I think it\u2019s going to be back in the next few winters as well.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So the next month, you think that proposal is in that\u2026","Joseph Nigro","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Good morning.","Christopher M. Crane","Good morning.","Jonathan W. Thayer","Good morning.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","I wanted to follow-up on some of the discussion regarding Illinois response to 1011D. I think you had mentioned that rule provides an incentive to preserve the capacity of the nuclear fleet, and one point I also heard mention the possibility that Illinois might join RGGI. Could you comment more directly on what you've heard regarding the strategies of Illinois and Pennsylvania with a respect to their possible response to 1011D, their state implementation project?","Christopher M. Crane","I would say just first of all it's very preliminary. So I think there\u2019s a couple of things that folks are looking for. It\u2019s pretty clear that if you lose nuclear plants your ability to comply with any carbon regime going forward is going to be jeopardized. So plants produced tremendous amount of zero carbon energy, and so if you lose those you are going to see a big uptick taking in carbon efficiency and we see that states \u2013 were plants have actually retired. I think that's been fully recognized. What the vehicle for compliance will be is going to be the subject of discussions. I would guess at least a year and possibly longer.","So I just think it\u2019s too early to speculate on where they are going to go. I think some stake holders and see what\u2019s been done in the RGGI states and find that appealing. But, we are there's a lot of grain before we get the solution on that.","Jonathan W. Thayer","I think the other thing to add is in conversation, this is a very complex rule and it takes time to digest as I think the state ones to ensure they understand the allotment are reduction goals they have given that they ensure that as they are given a fair shake in that, but it will be as Joe said it take a while.","Joseph Nigro","","If I could just add you asked about Pennsylvania as well. There I think the administration has not been predisposed to joining RGGI that the other candidate for Governor as indicated as part this platform that he would win RGGI if he is elected, so mostly what the elections results look like in November, and that will probably charge path there.","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Can I just ask a question on that front? The portion of your fleet that's in New York and in Maryland, of course, is already governed by RGGI. Is it important to you, and are you making initiatives to see that the rest of your fleet is also governed by similar rules? Or do you feel that PJM can operate flexibly with different state implementation plans in different states?","Christopher M. Crane","","I think we believe later. I think RGGI is a good choice. RGGI is just one of choices, as clean energy standard can work, a dispatch model where we pricing carbon and then dispatch resource through the RTOs, it works. There are a lot of solutions out there. We have supported the RGGI platform and the model of improvements and we\u2019ll continue to support those states that are interested in that model. But it\u2019s not the only solution.","","Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","","Great. Thank you very much.","","Operator","","Your next comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Capital.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital","","Thank you. Good morning. So, I wanted to go back to the questions about Integrys. I know a lot of questions have been asked. Have you incorporated the projected uptick in volumes and margins to your retail business in your gross margin projections?","Christopher M. Crane","","No. Angie, we have not.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. So, the follow-up question is: How should we think about it? How big of a swing could it be? Also, is this for short power?","Christopher M. Crane","First of all, I think the first question is the uptick in volume would probably be approximately 15% to our retail power volumes. And our existing constellation retail power volumes, on the gap side the uptick in volume would be approximately 30% to the existing constellation volumes.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. And I\u2019m just trying to figure out if this very low multiple \u2013 does this very low multiple have to do with the fact that the portfolio was short \u2013 the 2 times EV to EBITDA?","Jonathan W. Thayer","","Yes, Angie, this is Jack. Clearly, Integrys didn't own generation to support that portfolio they had acquired has been hedged via the open market. It fits nicely with our generation footprint in the state that are active. And this will be an incremental avenue for us\u2026","Christopher M. Crane","","Yes. And I would add to that Angie, the purchase with the mark-to-market exercise, so regardless if they were long or short, it would be an exercise in just mark-to-market, whatever positions they had on. It\u2019s hard to speculate and then provide a more information to that.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. That's fine. Now, should we expect that you will give us an updated projections for volumes and then margins for the retail business during the EEI?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes. That is correct. We will update it for EEI.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. Then, given the correction in forward power curves since June 30, could you give us a sense roughly how big of a swing we are seeing currently in your total gross margin for 2015 and 2016 versus what you're showing from the slides?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes. If you are look at our sensitivity tables that we provide in our hedge disclosures. We show you a $5 change in power crises for 2014, 2015, 2016 respectively for PJM west and for NI-Hub, and we were roughly down about $3 in 2015 and 2016 respectively, so just backing into the math it\u2019s approximately $150 million in 2015 and approximately $250 in 2016 and you could see that in the sensitivity tables we provide.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. And then again going back to the retail business, I mean just to reconcile your views, so you are expecting, as we do, a growing volatility in power prices, and yet you are bulking up your retail business, which tends not to do well in a volatile power place environment. So are you comfortable with this strategy because you're still long power, or is it that you think that you're the last man standing in the retail business, and thus you will be paid for this additional risk that you're assuming?","Christopher M. Crane","","It\u2019s definitely not the last man standing. It\u2019s a (indiscernible) market with many participants in it. So I think, Joe could continue to cover this strategy, you touch that.","Joseph Nigro","Yes. I think Angie there is a couple of things. I think the first is intrinsically we believe in the logic of matching generation and load. And there is a number of reasons to do that it\u2019s beneficial for us, because we don\u2019t have to take our power output, over the counter market. The optionality of our units is efficiently matched with these load contracts. The locations in which we\u2019re selling the load contracts matches nicely to our generation output generally.","I think the second; the other side of it is the volatility piece. These contracts are renewing in a relative frequent period, that touch the phase and the volatility is reflected in those contracts. So it\u2019s not like for being exposed that. If you go back six months ago, we were saying we didn\u2019t think the market was accurately pricing the volatility in the right way. And when I was impacting the way we were executing our own quantity to retail. We have seen that improved and we thought it would improve and we are comfortable with it because it an efficient hedge for our total portfolio. And the margins had continued to expand.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. My last question, not related to the generation business for once, we're still missing a filing in Maryland for your Pepco acquisition. Is there any reason why you're waiting to file in Maryland?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes. As we previously said we have multiple filings in at Maryland. And we had to time ourselves in our own workload. So we prepare the other one, first Maryland\u2019s on a clock its 225 days, so we\u2019ll be filing that one very shortly. But it is just the execution of the work we already have, in front of the commission in Maryland the work that we needed to do in front of the other commissions.","Angie Storozynski \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ravi Ganti.","Ravi Ganti","Thank you, Amy. That brings us to the end of the call. Thank you for joining us.

My name is Laura, and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today\u2019s interactive broadcast. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the show over to Dan Eggers, Exelon\u2019s Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, sir.","Daniel Eggers","Thank you, Laura. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning, along with the presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters, which we discuss during today's call will contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during the call.","Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations. Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We scheduled 45 minutes for today\u2019s call.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Christopher Crane","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before I turn to the financial results for the quarter, I'm going to spend a few minutes providing some key updates on a number of positive developments in our businesses over the last three months.","First, we continue to move forward on our utility regulatory strategy, filing distribution rate cases at BGE, ComEd, and Pepco, DC, reflecting our safety and reliability investments across those service territories. In DC, we filed our first multiyear rate case. The plan provides the necessary framework to align Pepco system investments with DC policy goals, including grid modernization and further improvements to customer service and reliability. Joe will discuss the details in his remark.","Second, last week, Pepco and other parties filed a settlement agreement at FERC for PECO\u2019s formula rate, transmission rate. The settlement includes a 10.35% ROE inclusive of a 50 basis point ROE adder. PECO made the original filing in 2017 and we expect the final order from FERC in 2020.","Third, in June, we issued our annual corporate sustainability report, marking our performance and sustainability goals and priorities. In addition, the Benchmarking Air Emissions report that found Exelon is the largest generator of zero emissions energy in the U.S., producing 12% of the nation's clean energy. Also that we have the lowest emissions rate admitting at a rate that is 4x less than the next cleanest generator.","Fourth, the New Jersey BPU approved ZEC payments for the state nuclear units including our interest in sale. We appreciate the state support for the carbon-free power produced by these units. Fifth, we are unable to get legislation done in Pennsylvania in time to reverse the decision to close TMI this fall. Since then, there have been continued discussions on a path forward for the remaining nuclear plants in the state, including consideration of placing a price on carbon through the regional carbon trading.","Six, we are also pleased the Trump Administration decided not to impose quotas on uranium which would have jeopardized the continued operation of commercial nuclear reactors in the United States. And finally, last week, FERC issued an order directing PJM not to run the capacity auction in August. We agree with FERC\u2019s decision to delay the auction until the rules are finalized. The delay provides PJM and the state policymakers\u2019 time to adjust to the commission\u2019s changes.","Before I turned to the financial results, I also want to address two matters, you have raised with us recently. First, we received a number of questions from investors about the impact on our business from a steep decline in power prices.","The decline presents a considerable challenge for us, but as you know, our hedging disclosures are a point in time estimate. If you have seen them move up and down in the past, we need to be thoughtful and deliberate about our response if these prices persist, and we have a variety of levers that we can pull and decisions we can make if this is the future of energy markets.","We are pursuing a number of market reforms addressing the financial challenges many of our plants space. Against this backdrop, I can also again assure you that we will not operate our unprofitable or negative free cash flow plants. You've seen us closed money losing plants in the past. You should expect that discipline to continue if reforms are not inactive.","The bottom line is that fundamental market reforms in either the United States if we want to meet the nation's clean energy climate goals, maintain fuel security and reliable system. We need to sustain and increase electrification, preserving a significant economic value through good paying jobs in property taxes. We'll continue to work at the state level and the national level with birth the Congress and the administration to make this happen.","Second, we've had \u2013 we received numerous questions from our investors about the subpoena in Illinois from the U.S. Attorney's Office. We are cooperating fully and provided all or providing all information requested by the U.S. Attorney's office.","We simply can't comment further on the investigation and we're not going to speculate on whether it may affect legislative efforts in Illinois this fall. What we do know about this fall session is there are a number of stakeholders who want to see clean energy legislation enacted.","Illinois lacks behind other progressive states on clean energy policy, passing the clean energy legislation as a priority for many stakeholders include in Illinois, including the Citizens Utility Board, Labor, the Clean Jobs Coalition, and the Renewable Community. These stakeholders want to greatly expand the renewable penetration, so the state will be able to achieve the 100% clean energy target by 2030.","Kathleen and her team are working with the stakeholders to help craft the legislation or legislative package and the Board members of the General Assembly on the benefits of this legislation.","It's important to remember that while we are putting a real effort into preserving the value of the generation pleat, our focus remains on the utilities. The bulk of our capital investment in growing a majority of our earnings are coming from the regulated business where we continue to see great opportunities to invest and grow to the benefit of our customers and communities.","Now I'll turn to the financial results on Slide 5. We had a good quarter delivering earnings at midpoint range of our guidance. On GAAP basis, we earned $0.50 per share versus $0.56 last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.60 per share versus $0.71 last year. Joe will cover these drivers in his remarks.","Turning to Slide 6, operational performance of the utility was mixed during the quarter. We continued to perform at top quartile levels of costs for reliability and customer operations metrics or safety performance has slipped. Safety is the priority and we are focused on ways to improve our safety culture and performance. Outage frequency and outage duration performance is in the top quartile for three of our four utilities with ComEd performing in top decile.","So, on the customer operations side, all of our utilities performed in top quartile for service level and call abandonment rate. Our relationship with our customers is improving due to the investments we are making to improve reliability and the customer experience. This could be seen in our customer satisfaction scores and then the recent J.D. Power electrical of residential customer satisfaction ratings.","BGE and PECO, and ComEd achieve top decile performance and customer satisfaction index. We improved or maintained our rankings in the J.D. Power rankings. Delmarva ranked first in the east mid region \u2013 a mid-size region, the first excellent utility to ever be ranked first. BGE and PECO maintained their first quartile performance in the East Large segment and ComEd improved in its ranking to the second quartile.","Generation perform well during the quarter nuclear produced 38.8 terawatts hours of zero emission electricity with the capacity factor of 95.1%. And Exelon power and had a gas and Hydro dispatch match of 99.7% exceeding our plan and the wind and solar capture on the plan was 96% - was weaker plan of 96%.","Now I'll turn it over to Joe.","Joseph Nigro","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our second quarter result, our quarterly financial updates, including trailing 12-month ROEs at the utilities and our hedge disclosures.","Turning to Slide 7. We earned $0.50 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.60 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which is at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Exelon utilities delivered a combined $0.39 per share net of holding company expenses. Utility earnings were modestly higher than our plan largely due to O&M timing at ComEd, BGE and PECO, which will reverse itself over the course of the year. This was partially offset by milder weather than expected in the Philadelphia area impacting PECO by about $0.01 per share.","ExGen earned $0.21 per share behind our plan. This was a result of lower load volumes that constellation due to mild weather any extended outage of Salem. These factors were partially offset by a favorable O&M, strong performance of our Generation fleet and realized gains in our nuclear decommissioning trust funds. We are reaffirming our full-year guidance for $3 to $3.30 per share and for the third quarter we are providing adjusted operating guidance, earnings guidance of $0.80 to $0.90 per share.","On Slide 8, we show our quarter-over-quarter walk. The $0.60 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.11 per share lower than the second quarter of 2018. Exelon Utilities less holdco earnings were up $0.04 per share compared with last year. This earnings growth is driven primarily by higher distribution rate associated with completed rate increases and higher transmission revenues at ComEd and PHI relative to the second quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by unfavorable weather at PECO.","ExGen earnings were down $0.13 per share compared with last year. The decrease was driven by lower realized energy prices, partially offset by higher ZEC revenue from the increase in New York ZEC prices and started of the New Jersey\u2019s ZEC program.","Moving to Slide 9. Our utility ROEs remain strong and we continue to exceed our 9% to 10% earned ROE targets across the utilities. The consolidated PHI utility earned 9.1% ROE for the trailing 12 months, compared to last quarter and we had some help from the constructive distribution rate case settlement at ACE, Pepco DC and Pepco Maryland offset by equity infusions across PHI.","Legacy Exelon Utilities maintained a strong 10.5% earned ROEs in the quarter. Importantly consolidated our ROEs across our utilities were 10.2%. We remain focused on meeting our utility earnings growth targets by maintaining the earned ROEs at PHI and sustaining the strong performance at our other utilities.","Turning to Slide 10. On May 24, BGE filed for a combined $148 million rate increase in electric and gas distribution revenues. The requested rate increase included $81 million and almost $68 million for electric and gas revenues respectively, based on rate based of $5.4 billion and a requested ROE of 10.3%. The increase is primarily driven by the ongoing need for capital investments to maintain and modernize the electric and gas distribution system.","It also reflects moving $15.8 million of revenues currently being recovered via the stride in electrical liability investments surcharges into rate base. We into base rates and we expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter. On May 30, Pepco filed a multi-year plan in the District of Columbia, requesting a revenue increase over three years to recover capital investments made during the 2019 period and planned investments over the 2020 to 2022 time period.","The request provides the necessary framework to allow Pepco to align its system investments with policy goals set by the commission and enable us to continue to make the investments needed to modernize the energy grid, support the district's energy goals, and sustain first quartile reliability performance, and enhanced programs and tools that have resulted in improved satisfaction among our customers.","The multi-year plan includes five Performance Incentive Mechanisms or PJMs focused on system reliability, customer service and interconnection of distributed energy resources. The inclusion of the PJMs with the multi-year plan provide a performance based rate making approach designed to strengthen general incentives or good utility performance can penalize or underperformance. The multi-year plan provides customers with rate predictability and reduces the administrative costs to customers caused by frequent filing with traditional rape cases to recover costs.","On July 9, the Chief Public Utility Law Judge issued his proposed order in the Pepco Maryland distribution rate case. The Chief Judge recommended at $10.3 million revenue increase and in 9.6% allowed ROE, which is 10 basis points higher than Pepco Maryland's current ROE. A final order by the Maryland PSC is expected by August 13. Finally, ComEd annual formula rate update filing is expected to be decided in December of this year. More details on these rate cases can be found on Slide 20 to 23 in the appendix.","Turning to Slide 11. We are continuing our robust capital deployment program at the utilities and during the second quarter we invested $1.4 billion of capital to the benefit of our customers. We expect to exceed our capital plan in $5.3 billion by $100 million this year. We have been able to take advantage of the favorable weather, so fund investments in our gas business at BG&E, plus we had some additional storm-related work. As Chris mentioned, these investments are improving our infrastructure, increasing reliability and resiliency, which results in a better customer experience.","Today I'd like to talk about two projects that are part of these efforts and will bring improved operations to our customers in DC and Northern Illinois. The first project is District of Columbia Undergrounding project or DC PLUG. A DC PLUG initiative is a $500 million multi-year partnership between the District's Department of Transportation and Pepco focused on the underground placements of more vulnerable distribution power lines.","Over the course of the initiative, up to 30 feeders where replaced underground with six during the first phase. The underground placement of these lines will make the electric distribution system more resilient during severe weather events, reducing the duration and frequency of electric outages.","The second project featured is the expansion of ComEd Itasca Substation, this $48 million projects installed the new distribution terminal and associated equipment, including an indoor switchgear building, three medium power transformers at 12 138kV circuit breakers.","The expanded substation provides capacity to power the equivalent of 45,000 homes. It will support three new data centers in the Itasca\/Elk Grove technology corridor near O'Hare airport. These customers chose the Greater Chicago area after several years of discussions with ComEd's Economic Development team, part of our continuing efforts to bring additional investment in jobs in Northern Illinois.","On Slide 12, we provide our gross margin updates and current hedging strategy as a generation company. Before discussing the gross margin update, I'd want to spend a minute talking about the drop in the illiquid forward power curves during the second quarter, particularly in June.","Prices in PJM in 2020 and 2021 declined sharpen. Now I have around-the-clock power prices fell nearly $3 per megawatt hour or approximately $0.11 \u2013 11% in 2020 and approximately $2.40 per megawatt hour or close to 10% in 2021. PJM West Hub prices fell more than $4 per megawatt hour and approximately 13% to 14% in 2020 and 2021 respectively.","Jim can cover in more detailed during Q&A, but at a high level we think these declines reflected some combination of the following. Lower natural gas prices, a mild start to summer then weighed on crop prices, which thing cascaded out to the forward curve, which we have seen before.","Some market anticipation of plants targeted for retirement looking less likely to retire and hedging activity likely including market participants selling based on changes in the economic value of revenue put options sold or written to support newbuild power plants over the last few years driving down prices.","Despite the mild weather and low price environment. 2019 total gross margin is flat to our last update. During the quarter, we executed $100 million in power new business and $50 million in non-power business. We are highly hedged for the rest of the year and well-balanced on our Generation to load matching strategy.","In 2020 and 2021 our total gross margin is down $100 million and $250 million respectable. Open gross margin declined $550 million and $500 million respectively primarily due to lower energy prices at PJM West Hub, New York Zone A and PJM NiHub.","Mark-to-market of hedges we're up $500 million and $300 million respectively. As our hedge position mitigated, part of the impact of the price declines. We also exited $50 million of power new business in both 2020 and 2021. We continue to remain behind our ratable hedging for protecting and added less than a ratable amount of hedges across our regions during the quarter.","We ended the quarter 10% to 13% behind ratable in 2020 and 7% to 10% behind in 2021 when considering gross commodity hedges. Our Generation the load matching strategy remains a competitive advantage, contributing positive margin and providing a vehicle to bring our Generation output to market in a disciplined manner. We remain comfortable with this strategy to hold open market length given the continued strength of our balance sheet.","Finally, moving onto Slide 13. We remained committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in our investment grade credit ratings. Even after June 30 pricing marks given the levers, we have available, we are confident that we will stay within our consolidated at that voted debt metrics in our disclosure window 2019 to 2022.","Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our targeted ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. Looking at ExGen, we are well ahead of our debt to EBITDA target of 3x. For 2019, we expect to be at 2.5x debt to EBITDA and 2x on a recourse basis.","With that, I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks.","Christopher Crane","Thanks Joe. Turning to Slide 14, we recognize the current power of markets are creating headwinds for us. We're prepared to meet them head on and take thorough or thoughtful action if necessary. In the meantime, we are accomplishing the things we committed to do including maintaining industry-leading operations, leading our financial commitments effectively, deploying more than $5 billion in capital across our utilities this year, and advocating for policies that support clean energy.","Our strategy remains the right one and we're committed to our value proposition. We continued to grow the utilities targeting a 7.8% rate-based growth in a 6% to 8% earnings growth through 2022. We continue to use free cash flow from the Genco to fund that incremental equity needs that the utilities paydown debt and one part of the growing dividend.","We will continue to optimize the value of ExGen business by seeking pair compensation or our zero-emitting Generation fleet, closing uneconomic plants like we're doing with TMI and selling assets where it makes sense to accelerating our debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the generation \u2013 through the generation to load match strategy constellation.","We will sustain strong investment grade credit metrics and we will grow our dividend annually 5% through 2020. The strategy underpinning this value proposition is effective. We remain committed to optimizing the value of our businesses and earning your ongoing support of Exelon.","Operator, we can now open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.","Gregory Gordon","Hey, good morning.","Christopher Crane","Hey, Greg.","Gregory Gordon","So one high level question and then maybe one or two in the weed\u2019s questions. And I don't want to ask you anything that you're maybe not comfortable delving too deeply into, but I'm going to anyway. You mentioned the concept of levers that you have full in order to stay on track to generate the free cash flow and credit metric targets that you laid out for us at the beginning of the year despite the fall on the forward curves.","And you talked about how you won\u2019t run power plants that aren't cash flow positive. And look, I've covered the stock for a long time and covered the company for a long time. We've been in this situation before, and nothing is ever as good or as bad as it looks in the moment, but can you tell us should this persist? What some of those options are in a little bit more detail please?","Christopher Crane","Yes. I'll let Joe go through the list of what we've got laid out right now. We've been talking quite a bit about it, meeting on it as we watch the markets. So Joe?","Joseph Nigro","Yes. Good morning, Greg. Greg, you mentioned one of them. I think we've proven through our time with our financial discipline that we're not going to run power plants in perpetuity that are in economics. So that would be the first lever. Obviously, you've seen us continue to drive efficiencies in our business and continue to look at ways to streamline our costs and we would continue to do that and that would be across our Exelon generation business as well as at the business services company.","At our disposal, I won't speculate on what at this time, but we obviously have the opportunity if necessary, to look at asset sales. We do have a small amount of growth capital in our ExGen business. We would look at that and take a hard look at that. And then there were alternative forms of financing.","When you think about project financing, you know, they're saying. So I think when you look at it, this is a point in time estimate over our financials. As you said, we've seen the markets move up or down. We're comfortable, like I said; with our credit metrics through the disclosure period and we continue to allocate capital in the ways we've laid out. And if we had to, if this continued, we would look at these levers.","Gregory Gordon","Yes, I'm very cognizant that some of those plants are large nuclear units in the state of Illinois. And I'm also cognizant that you're having a dialogue with legislators and other constituencies in the state around an Omnibus energy strategy that takes into account and contemplates certain actions with regard to those plants. Can you tell us how that broad that coalition is, as we get into the veto session and whether you think that the state policymakers understand the implications of the lack of necessarily market reforms in PJM and the need to take back control of the market?","Christopher Crane","As you can imagine, we have a significant communications drive with the legislative and the administration on the situation and we are prepared to present them with the coalition. I'll let Kathleen to describe who she's working with that will balance out the needs for the state, the goals that the governor set after election to get to 100% cleaned by 2030 and be able to do that in an economic way that does not harm our customers. But you want to talk about the coalition?","Kathleen Barr\u00f3n","Yes. Good morning, Greg. There are a number of stakeholders that are very focused on getting clean energy legislation enacted in Illinois. As you know, a number of states across the country have already set 100% clean energy targets. And it's not just states like California, New York, it's across the country. And so Illinois has a lot of emphasis on making sure that Illinois, which is already the cleanest state in the country, has an equally aggressive target.","So on that question, we have folks in the environmental community have heavily focusing on environmental justice players. The renewable developers are very focused on addressing those flaws in the prior version of the states clean energy targets to make sure that they can achieve the goals that have been set previously.","But also as I said, set a more ambitious new targets for renewable development in the state. The consumer advocate is heavily focused on this policy as well because the question of state having to pay twice for capacity has been very much in the forefront, and ensuring that if we're going to incentivize clean energy.","We can count our capacity towards our obligations for PJM. And then finally the labor community, very focused on what these policies mean both for new construction and preservation of things clean energy resources.","So that's the correlation we're focusing on putting the package together. There are a number of parties who will come together in the end to help \u2013 communicate the message that Chris mentioned that this is important for the state, but it's not going to be possible if we can't allow these resources to count as capacity and that's why the FRP is foundational to getting this policy done.","Gregory Gordon","Thanks. And my final question was actually, a numbers question on the update on the mark-to-market, Joe. There was $50 million decline and how our new business to go. Is that because that moved into hedges because you executed sales or are you assuming either lower volumes or lower margins in the out years significantly retail business?","James McHugh","Hi Greg. Yes. This is Jim McHugh. That is just executed. That's executed business that now has moved into the mark-to-market of hedges. So when you net that all together, that numbers \u2013 those two lines would be flat from last quarter, it's just executed now.","Gregory Gordon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steven Fleishman","Yes, thanks. I got -ups to both the Greg's question. So first of all, just I know in the past when prices have fallen a lot and certain times you've talked about actually how much money losing plants there are and potential offsets. Can you give any flavor on that on just, hey, if prices stay this low, if we shut certain plants or generally shut plants, what the potential offset could be?","Christopher Crane","If you're asking in market prices, we don't calculate the effect of uneconomic plants being shut down on the effect of the market. If you're asking about the effect of removing the negative free cash flow, we haven't got those numbers to be published right now.","It's something that we're looking at, but we're trying to evaluate, unit by unit and then in aggregate, as we've said publicly right now, you can see a challenge in the future if this market persists between the capacity and the energy market that Dresden, Byron, and Braidwood are financially challenged.","Now do you think we've got a clear path that that with good coalition to support, fixing that at some of it at the state level and we still are working very hard with PJM for FERC to continue on base-load scarcity in the capacity market reforms that should correct, and make a fair market. So, but short of those things happening, those three sites, you can look into the future and see the challenges that they have.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then I guess that the point there is if we're just using current forwards and taking it down that we're including basically losses on plants that you would not just sit and take forever.","Christopher Crane","Right.","Joseph Nigro","Correct.","Christopher Crane","That's right.","Steven Fleishman","Okay.","Joseph Nigro","Either we have a clear path to securing them or the units will be shut down. We will not damage the balance sheet, sitting around for years with negative free cash flow or negative earnings.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then just specific question to the Illinois coalition, can you just give any color if possible that since this news from a few weeks ago came out about the subpoena. Has there been any \u2013 have these talks or continued and is there any kind of public process we'll be able to see kind of those talks? Or is it just going to kind of be suddenly in legislative proposal?","Joseph Nigro","Steve, [indiscernible] the activity that has started and continued for a number of months on advancing the clean energy legislation among the coalition that was referenced by Kathleen and by Chris remains unchanged. We're meeting regularly, we're doing the stakeholder outreach, we're trying to craft a package and educate members of the legislature. And dependency of the grand jury and subpoenas had no impact on the level of activity or the intensity of the activity in that regard.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Turner of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Turner","Good morning. I was wondering if you could just help us with some background of your franchise agreement in Chicago, kind of when that expires, the terms of renewal, et cetera and kind of how you're thinking about that right now.","Ann Berzin","Well, I'll start. Hi, this is Ann. And Joe to make guesses here as well. But basically the expiration date is the end December of 2020. The city needs to give us an indication by the end of the year as to whether they want to maintain status quote renegotiate or terminate the franchise agreement. So we'll know by the end of the year, but we're in discussions with them, we started to have discussions around that.","We understand what their priorities are and there, I think priorities are very much aligned with ours. They want to see more clean energy in the city of Chicago. They are concerned about vulnerable populations, in particular in terms of pricing. And those are all \u2013 those are both, strong strategic elements of our focus going forward at all our utilities. But that's the status right now.","Joseph Nigro","Yes. And just to supplement what Ann said, we've been in the process of these negotiations for some time. We've exchange terms and have detail discussions about, how the agreement would be structured going forward. We had a slowdown in those negotiations during the transition to the new mayor. But those negotiations have resumed in full at this point.","Christopher Turner","Okay. And right now that is your set of assets and you would need to be compensated if anything changed there.","Joseph Nigro","Yes, that's correct. But again, the focus here is I'm getting the franchise agreement done. Our expectation is it will be fully negotiated and Dan will address the issues that Ann talked about, to the extent municipalization is what that will come with a very hefty price tag as you know, and I don't think realistically that's a path we're going to go down.","Christopher Turner","Okay. And then I guess just more modeling here for the balance of 2019, you put out the third quarter guidance there, which was I think a little bit less than we had expected. How are you thinking about the fourth quarter right now and what I guess might look like O&M headwind at least in the back half overall?","Joseph Nigro","You heard me say in my \u2013 it\u2019s Joe, good morning, you heard me say in my prepared remarks that we reaffirmed our guidance, range of $3 to $3.30. That's inclusive of the earnings guidance. We gave you obviously for the third quarter and we're comfortable with those numbers.","Christopher Turner","Okay. Anything to think about that might be kind of one-time or non-recurring in nature for the third or fourth quarter that could help you year-over-year?","Joseph Nigro","Hi. I mean you saw some of the drivers in the second quarter when we talked about the lower load volumes that constellation driven by the unfavorable weather and we continued to as Jim sits were talked about. We continue to execute our new business at constellation and we continue to manage the utility business accordingly and we're comfortable with full-year guidance.","Christopher Turner","Okay, great. Thanks Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys. I just one quick follow-up on the guidance. The guidance for $4.2 billion of cash flow Generation from ExGen over the next four years? What does that assume in terms of uneconomic plants and might be operating or I guess retirement is going to go where to those types of plants? What's built into that $4.2 billion number?","Joseph Nigro","Good morning, Michael. It's Joe. As Chris mentioned when you just said, inclusive when you look at the three plants in Illinois that he mentioned, Byron, Braidwood and Dresden, those plants are running in those cash flow forecast. And then to the extent, these power prices continue there's obviously challenges financially with those.","And as I said in my remarks, we won't continue to run those plants in perpetuity on economically. Having said that, we haven't provided the numbers specifically, but we will. We put out a forecast on our fourth quarter call for $7.8 billion of free cash flow from 2019 to 2022 coming off generation that we're still working with that number.","Michael Weinstein","So I mean would it be accurate to say that there's upside either way at this point with the forward curves where they are?","Christopher Crane","We\u2019ll give you an update at our fourth quarter call and you're getting like one side of the story here obviously, because in the numbers we provide, we're showing you the mark-to-market. You see our gross margin disclosures and they change quarter-over-quarter this quarter driven by the price drops we saw in the second quarter. I also discussed their other levers at our disposal. Those are reflected in our disclosures, but you can go back to what we've modeled on the fourth quarter call and that's what we've disclosed at this point.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta","Thanks so much. Hi guys. So maybe just following up a little bit on the power markets, it was very helpful to get the levers that you've talked about. But just to understand from a PJM perspective, do you see more happening on the market side as in other players shutting down other plants or other form of rationalization like you also talked about regulation. Where do you see PJM going? Because if it stays this way, clearly, it's unsustainable. So wanted to understand how you thought the market would play out?","James McHugh","Yes. Praful, this is Jim McHugh. I'll start. I think from a market's perspective, first of all, the one thing, I want to highlight to Joe's point about this as a point in time. We've already seen the Nighthawk market move up $1 on the forward curve since the end of the quarter and the West Hub markets moved up about $0.75 since the June 30 pricing. So we've seen a pickup in prices so far. I think when it comes to what we're working on; we've talked over the last several quarters on the market reform side. Fast start pricing is willing to be enacted.","There is some work being done on reserves and scarcity pricing and the ORDC curve in PJM. And then in the long run it's a little bit lower priority right now for PJM, but the focus on the baseload price formation and Entergy relaxation. Those are some of the things. I think we have new build and retirements both happening over the next four or five years as natural course of business and our fundamental analysis.","So there will be a little bit of that, but I think, by and large the reforms are around price formation and then in the long run, if we're able to come up with a market solution to have carbon pricing in the market would be another thing in the long run. That would be something we would all continue working on.","The one thing that's interesting to me about where we've seen these prices in that $22 area, which you look at Cal 21, Cal 22, Cal 23, that's trading down where the quarter two just cleared. Quarter two Nile just cleared $22.25 with very, very mild weather. So the entire curve is trading where a very mild quarter just traded. It's an interesting note to me and I think it gives us some insight into why we think those prices on the forward curve have already responded slightly higher in the last couple of weeks.","Praful Mehta","That's super helpful color. And maybe just one follow-up more strategic. If you do see these profiles, does that mean that you think more retail would be helpful to the business? Do you look to expand on the retail side or maybe acquire more retail businesses? Is that something that you think would work?","James McHugh","Yes. So I think from a retail perspective, our customer facing businesses are doing pretty well. The margins are hanging in, our win rates are strong and we're holding our market share, our retail customer facing business and our wholesale load auctions and wholesale origination businesses have performed well.","I think as far as acquisitions and expanding it, we've talked for a while now about having grown really what is the best in class platform. So we will love to acquire books of business, if there is value proposition there that we can absorb it into our best in class platform and just take a retail book of business. We'll look for those opportunities and we certainly would take a hard look at them.","Praful Mehta","All right. Really helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","I would like to turn the call over back to speaker Chris Crane. Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher Crane","Thank you all for participating in the call today. We remain on track to meet our commitments to our customers, communities, and shareholders. With that, we'll close up the call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Dan Eggers, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your call.","Daniel L. Eggers - Exelon Corp.","Thank you, Geneva. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section on Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast and expectations.","Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. It is scheduled 45 minutes for today's call.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We have had a productive few months since our last earnings call, making important steps in reinforcing our value proposition. At our PHI utilities, we reached settlement in both Pepco Maryland and Pepco D.C. rate cases. With these settlements, we are now reached constructive settlement in all PHI jurisdictions since the close of the merger and accomplished that legacy PHI has not achieved in many years.","This reflects a positive evolution of our engagement in these states. Our employees' hard work to improve system reliability and performance have led to rising consumer satisfaction. The progress we have made is reflected in our constructive partnership with our regulators. There's always more work to do particularly on our earned ROEs, but we are encouraged by these developments.","In New Jersey, state legislators passed three important energy policy laws with strong majorities on April 12. Most impactful to Exelon was the New Jersey ZEC program, similar to that in New York and Illinois. It'll be more fairly compensating our nuclear generating assets in New Jersey for clean energy attributes of these plants.","In March, our East Coast utilities were battered by three northeasters that resulted in about $200 million of spending between capital and operating expenses. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our employees and contractors, we were able to restore power to the effective customers safely and quickly. These storms were challenging and the benefits of our scale were on display in March. We were able to return customers to service days faster than we would have as a standalone utility.","Finally, we had a strong quarter financially. On a GAAP basis, we earned $0.60 per share versus $1.06 last year. On a non-GAAP operating basis, we earned $0.96 per share versus $0.64 last year, just above the midpoint of our $0.90 to $1 guidance range while overcoming a $0.06 storm cost through March.","Turning to slide 6. At the utilities, we continue to execute at top quartile levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making are paying off in improved reliability, which is strengthening our relationship we have with our customers and regulators. These numbers follow the standard industry practice of excluding major storms, although the benefits of our scale, health (00:04:42) and recovery efforts, which I'll discuss in the next slide.","I would note that Pepco D.C. has achieved a record reliability in the past two years since joining Exelon family of companies. We continue to make gains as we share best practices across all utilities. We also continue to focus on helping customers and communities becoming more energy-efficient, saving energy and money. We have been doing this for years and I'm happy to once again announce that EPA named all five of our eligible companies; BGE, ComEd, Delmarva, Pepco and PECO, as 2018 ENERGY STAR Partners of the Year. Our companies also received the Sustained Excellence designation for being named partners three or more years in a row.","Safety is always our highest priority and we review our OSHA recordables in the first quarter. We've identified a number of areas for improvement and have implemented a series of our actions to get those numbers back on track. At ExGen, nuclear generation this quarter was 40 terawatt hours, with capacity factor of 96.5%. Our Texas CCGTs continue to perform very well with an economic dispatch match rate of 96.6%, ramping up and down to optimize hour-by-hour the variability in ERCOT pricing.","Turning to slide 7. I'd like to take a moment to highlight our utilities' performance and the outstanding work from our crews as they battled three consecutive nor'easters in March. These storms blanket our East Coast utility with heavy wet spring snow and high winds that are especially hard on the system. Over the span of these storms, we faced 1.7 million cumulative customer outages and shared over 1,600 Exelon employees and contractors with our sister utilities. ComEd alone provided an additional 1,200 workers and contract crew members.","We also incurred, as I said, $200 million of operating capital expenses. To help put this in context, we replaced approximately 1,200 power poles and handled more than 1.8 million customer calls. With that context, let me share with you the success story of the combined Exelon utility families. Because of our employees are trained on common practices, we're able to seamlessly incorporate workers from different utilities more quickly to get work and return service to our customers.","Each storm impacted the service territories differently, but the last of the three storms significantly impacted Atlantic City Electric. We were able to bring in crews and contractors from ComEd, PECO, Pepco, Delmarva and BGE to assist in the restoration effort. Our scale and performance notably sped up the recovery and allowed us to send over 250 employees and contractors into New Jersey to aid in the restoration effort. The storms that occurred this quarter provide a great example of how our model directly benefits our customers. The scale of the Exelon utilities and how we run these businesses continue to contribute to higher quality, more responsive and cost-effective service for our customers.","Turning to slide 8. Last call, we provided an update on the impact of tax reform, but I want to revisit it as we have been working with our regulators to pass these savings on to customers. We've identified over $500 million in savings to be returned to our customers related to lower corporate tax rate from our distribution utility operations. As we've said from the start, the benefit of the lower income tax rate will provide a meaningful savings to our 10 million utility customers. We appreciate the constructive relationship with our state regulators in that are allowing us to pass along these benefits to our customers in a timely fashion.","Turning to slide 9, we made additional progress in establishing compensation for our nuclear generating fleet that recognizes the value of the emission-free generation and the underlying deficiencies in market design. The most significant development was the New Jersey legislation as I spoke of enacting the ZEC program into law, establishing a path forward to preserve the at-risk nuclear plants in New Jersey. I want to thank our team and our partners at PSEG leadership, the leadership in the Senate and the Assembly and the Governor for working together to pass this important legislation.","Once the Governor signs the bill, the ZEC program will go to the BPU for its review of the applications. There is a 330-day deadline for completing the process, putting the program implementation likely at the end of the first quarter in 2019. At that time, we will start realizing the New Jersey ZEC revenues. We are pleased that New Jersey has joined New York and Illinois and Connecticut in recognizing the clear environmental attributes of the nuclear generating fleet. We still see need for more comprehensive solutions to compensate for this clean energy, but we think expanding the ZEC program is a key interim step to preserving our most challenged assets, extending their useful lives and the long-term value of this fleet.","Turning to the existing ZEC programs in New York and Illinois, we have had oral arguments in both cases at the federal appellate court levels. In Illinois, the court requested and now waiting for the U.S. Government to provide a view on the case. In New York, the decision is with the judges as they had no outstanding items following the oral argument. We remain confident in our legal position in both cases and continue to collect the ZEC revenues.","With respect to PJM work on price formation, FERC has committed to ruling on PJM's fast-start price formation by September, if not sooner, as many parties have requested. PJM is committed to operationally implement the rule as soon as FERC gets approval. FERC's decision on fast-start will dictate the process for additional reforms aimed at eliminating flaws in the current pricing formation rules that currently prevent some units from setting price.","In addition, PJM has now set deadlines for stakeholder reviews of reforms to its shortage pricing rules, including those related to reserve and operating reserve demand curves. We see these price formation changes as essential to preserving an effective competitive mark in PJM and apply the ongoing efforts to design and implement these changes. Finally, just yesterday, PJM committed to study fuel supply vulnerabilities that could arise if the grid became dominated by natural gas generation. In its white paper, PJM called for reforms of its capacity market to better value fuel-secure resilient resources.","We have seen this as a positive first step where we urge PJM to model the carbon and air pollutant implications of greater reliance on fossil fuels, particularly oil-fired power plants to meet electrical demand. Our states and customers communities expect us to develop policies that will lead to less pollution, not more, so we believe PJM should study the emissions consequences as well.","Now, I'll turn it over to Jack to walk through some of the numbers.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.","Turning to slide 10. We had a strong quarter financially, delivering adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.96 per share, just above the midpoints of our guidance range of $0.90 to $1 per share. This compares to $0.64 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Better results from Generation offset the storm-related cost pressures at the utilities. Exelon's utilities delivered a combined $0.47 per share net of HoldCo, which includes $0.06 of higher storm costs.","Since we've not had significant winter storms like these in years, let me remind you how major storms are treated in our different Mid-Atlantic jurisdictions. In New Jersey and Maryland, excluding BG&E, we have a tracking mechanism for major storms, so the costs incurred during the first quarter are deferred as a regulatory asset and will be recovered in the future, thereby not impacting our reported earnings.","In Delaware, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., and for BGE and Maryland, when we file our rate cases, we use an average of major storm costs from previous years that is included in our rates and assumed in our budgets. In years when major storms exceed the historic average, Exelon absorbs the additional storm costs, but future rates will be adjusted to reflect these costs.","With March's winter storms, we exceeded our storm budgets, which left us $0.06 per share behind plan in the first quarter of 2018. As we look out to the remainder of the year, we will have to find offsets at the utilities to mitigate any additional major storm expenditures, which historically have come in the first and third quarters.","Looking beyond the storm impacts, our utility results did benefit from additional revenues associated with resolved rate cases. We would also expect PHI to catch up on some of their normal course O&M expenses over the balance of the year.","Generation had a strong quarter relative to plan, earning $0.49 per share. We had good performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted. We also benefited from lower O&M expenses and favorable spot market prices.","We're reaffirming our full-year guidance range of $2.90 to $3.20 per share, which you can see on slide 19, and expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.55 to $0.65 per share in the second quarter compared with $0.54 last year.","Turning to slide 11. The $0.96 per share in the first quarter of this year was $0.32 per share higher than the first quarter of 2017. Generation earnings were up $0.32 per share compared to last year, with ZECs representing the most significant source of uplift, as we recognized the true-up of the 2017 Illinois ZEC revenues in the first quarter, which added $0.11 per share, and we realized full quarter contributions from the Illinois and New York ZEC programs, including the acquisition of Fitzpatrick, which were not in effect during the first quarter of 2017.","Relative to the first quarter of 2017, Generation also benefited from higher capacity pricing in New England, the Midwest, and the Mid-Atlantic regions. As a whole, the utilities were largely impacted by higher storm cost, which was partially offset by increased electric distribution and transmission revenues due to higher rate base at ComEd, increased transmission revenue at BG&E, rate increases at PHI and favorable weather at PECO.","Moving to slide 12. On a trailing 12-month basis, our overall earned ROEs slipped modestly from last quarter, but are near the midpoint of our targeted 9% to 10% earned ROEs that underpin our target returns for 2019 and beyond. The biggest drag in overall ROEs compared to last quarter came from the increased major storm expenses that I discussed earlier. In total, the storms reduced earned ROEs by 10 basis points for our total utility businesses on a trailing 12 months basis. We remain diligent in managing our operating expenses to dampen the effects from the storm costs.","Turning to the PHI utilities, the absolute levels of earned ROEs still have room for improvement, even when we adjust for the 60 basis point drag from the fourth quarter's FAS 109 write-off. That said, the recently filed settlements at Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland should start to lift Pepco's earned ROEs in the second half of 2018. We also experienced higher O&M in the first quarter than budgeted, which is due to timing issues, and should reverse over the remainder of the year and help to lift earned ROEs.","As we look at our earned ROEs for the rest of 2018 for the overall utility, tax reform is positive to earnings, but also creates ROE headwinds this year due to the timing of equity injections to fund deferred tax returns before the higher equity is reflected in rate cases. The ROE impact is primarily a 2018 timing issue and is already captured in our earnings outlook. We still expect earned ROEs in 2019 to be solidly in the 9% to 10% range.","Turning to slide 13, we've had a constructive regulatory quarter. Starting with the most recent developments, we were pleased to reach settlement agreements in April at both Pepco D.C. and Pepco Maryland, providing revenue decreases of $24.1 million and $15 million, respectively. The decreases include adjustments for forecasted tax benefits to customers with the recent tax reform legislation. The settling parties have proposed a procedural schedule that would place rates in effect by June 1 for Pepco Maryland and July 1 for Pepco D.C. We're happy to have reached constructive settlements with key interveners in both jurisdictions that provide bill relief for customers, while also providing a return on our investments and being resolved months earlier than if the cases had been fully litigated.","On March 29, we filed our first case at PECO in three years, where we requested an $82 million rate increase, with a scheduled completion by December 31. The filing is focused on supporting PECO's strong reliability performance, strengthening system resiliency and supporting physical security and cybersecurity. I should also note that the $82 million is net of $71 million tax credit for 2019 tax reform benefits and that the five-year average storm cost in the filing includes the costs incurred in the first quarter.","On April 16, ComEd filed its annual distribution formula rate update with the ICC seeking a $22.9 million decrease to distribution base rates. The decrease is primarily driven by an adjustment for forecasted tax benefits resulting from the recent tax reform legislation. On February 9, we closed out the Delmarva, Maryland rate case with a $13.4 million revenue increase effective immediately.","Finally, we have outstanding cases in Delaware at Delmarva electric and gas that are scheduled for completion in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on slides 22 through 27 in the appendix.","Turning to slide 14. In the first quarter, we invested $1.2 billion of capital at the utilities and are on track to meet our $5.5 billion budget to the benefit of our customers. Considering the significant number of projects that go into our overall capital budget, we thought a more regular update on specific projects would be useful to appreciate how these investments are benefiting our customers and communities.","Today, I'd like to highlight two projects. The first is DPL's Cedar Creek to Milford Transmission Rebuild. This $75 million project entails replacing approximately 43 miles of 230 kV transmission poles as well as new conductor and optical ground wiring. The 230 kV line is critical for the transmission network in the Delmarva region and will improve reliability by eliminating the potential for outages due to structural failure of the line.","The second project I'd like to highlight is ComEd's future new substation in Elk Grove. The $90 million greenfield substation is expected to be in service by the third quarter of 2021. The project will support transmission line reliability and projected load growth, primarily from data centers in the Elk Grove Village area by adding over 300 megawatts of additional new capacity.","Slide 15 provides our gross margin update for ExGen, which saw some movement within the buckets, but total gross margin in each year is unchanged from our last update. For 2018, open gross margin was up $250 million, primarily due to strengthening ERCOT spark spreads, offset by our hedges. We also had a strong quarter in execution creating $200 million of Power New Business.","2019 and 2020 gross margins are also flat relative to our last disclosure. In both years, open gross margin increased by $50 million on strengthening ERCOT spark spreads, which was offset by our hedges. We were also able to execute $100 million and $50 million of Power New Business in 2019 and 2020, respectively. We ended the quarter approximately 6% to 9% behind our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 8% to 11% behind ratable in 2019 when considering cross-commodity hedges. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at market fundamentals.","Turning to slide 16, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment-grade credit rating. We are forecasting ExGen's leverage to be 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA at year-end 2018, which is below our long-term target of 3 times debt-to-EBITDA. On a recourse debt basis, we are at 2.1 times, which is well below our target. We will continue to manage our balance sheet at ExGen over time to the 3 times debt-to-EBITDA level, so look for us to focus on debt reduction at both HoldCo and GenCo.","I'll now turn the call back to Chris.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Thanks, Jack. Turning to slide 17, we remain firmly committed to our strategy and see progress in the first quarter. Whether it'd be the rate case settlements of PHI, the benefits of the scale on our storm restoration or establishing ZEC programs in New Jersey, our financial footing is very strong.","Here again is our value proposition. We will continue to focus on growing our utilities targeting 7.4% rate base growth and 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2021. We continue to use free cash flow from ExGen to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt over the next four years at ExGen and the HoldCo and part fund a faster dividend growth rate.","We continue to focus on optimizing value for ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon-free generation fleet in Pennsylvania as we have done with the ZECs in New Jersey, Illinois and New York. And this adoption of price formation in PJM and resiliency initiatives at FERC will also benefit.","We continue to close uneconomic plants, sell assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximize value through the gen-to-load match strategy. We continue to sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics and grow our dividend consistently at 5% through 2020.","With that, operator, we can now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. Great quarter considering all the storms you had. I've got a few questions.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Sure.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","The first is, looking at your gross margin slide, you did comment that you had some puts and takes and that the total expected gross margins are the same. I see from looking at the prior quarter's deck that your sort of NI Hub's around-the-clock pricing is down, Mid-Atlantic's a little better, ERCOT sparks are a lot better. But when you show us the open gross margin and you roll down to the total expected gross margin, how are you thinking about current forwards in ERCOT rolling into spot pricing? And are you just giving us sort of a theoretical naked mark, assuming you can roll all the current run-up in spark spreads into spot or is there some sort of a holdback there, given the uncertainty with regard to summer volatility (00:25:21)","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Hey, Greg. Good morning. It's Joe Nigro. It's a good question, Greg. And as you've mentioned, there is a lot of volatility expected in ERCOT this summer. And for us, it's not as simple as just selling the Generation output. As you know, we have a very big load book of business. So, we have to take that into account as well. And we look at those scenarios under a lot of different outcomes, be it higher prices and\/or lower prices, and we try to set up the book accordingly.","When you look at the disclosure here, we're simply mark-to-marketing the value of our open position in the open gross margin calculation, and there was a large uptick to the tune of about $300 million if it had been a fully-opened book. Offsetting that obviously is the mark-to-market of our hedges that are on the book, given the strong move and the sales we've made. And that nets to a gain in the portfolio of about $50 million.","As for a holdback, any holdback would be relatively small in the overall total gross margin of the \u2013 over $8 billion that's expected, and we would do that given some of the uncertainty of outcomes that we expect.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. Thanks. Jack, I've got a couple questions for you. Looking at the slide where you give the projected sources and uses of cash, since I compare that to the last quarter disclosure, it looks like regulated utility investments \u2013 expected investments are up a little bit, but the overall free cash flow profile into the end of the year actually looks like it's still net-net improved even after a slightly higher CapEx. Is that a fair synopsis? And I know it's a small increase, but what are those capital expenditures being directed to?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","It is a fair synopsis and I think the CapEx is really related to the storm investment. Chris talked about the significant investments that were made in the Mid-Atlantic utilities during that storm, so that's why you see the increase in CapEx there. To your point, the overall cash flow profile of the company looks quite strong.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. And my last question actually goes, because you didn't put it in this deck, back to the Q4 deck where you had EPS sensitivities related to interest rates. And it looks to me like the 30-year is up about 37 basis points since year-end, and you guys put in here the interest rate sensitivity for ComEd ROE and pension expense is $0.03 in each instance for every 50 basis points at least looking at 2019. So, is it fair to say that these sensitivities still hold because that would mean you might be as much as a $0.05 ahead of where you were in 2019 at the beginning of this year?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","I think the $0.05 sounds a little high, but they do hold. And as you know, we benefit from rising interest rates relative to other utilities because of the types of the formula rate in Illinois, but also because of our significant pension liability. And as the interest rates increase, the liabilities shrink. So, no question. This rising environment is helping our costs as well as our revenues and EPS, but $0.05 does seem a little bit aggressive.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you, Jack. That's all I've got.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Just hoping to follow-up on the ERCOT comment just now. I think I heard you say $300 million is roughly the gross margin. And then, with the hedging value, it sort of offset down to $50 million. Was that a 2018 comment? And if so, could we get some sort of sense on 2019 and 2020 because the sort of hedge sparks (00:29:21) numbers that you gave, finding a little difficult to unpack those.","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. The comment I made was in relation to 2018, Jonathan, but you could think similarly not in magnitude of dollars because we haven't seen the absolute price change that we saw in 2018.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","But you had a pickup in open gross margin in 2019 and 2020, and similarly, we had a mark-to-market drop in 2019 and 2020, given that we've sold in obviously at lower prices. Given that those market prices haven't moved nearly as greatly on the back-end in 2019 and 2020, just the absolute value of the dollars isn't going to be as great.","I think the other element, though, is you've seen this market move pretty appreciably in the front-end and rightfully so, given where reserve margins are and the announcements of the retirements. I think you could expect some extreme volatility this summer and that will be obviously weather dependent and depending on unit performance as well as our wind performance.","I think the other element, though, is if we see some of that volatility that's expected, it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that you would see price appreciation in 2019 and 2020 on the back of it just because it hasn't moved. And as you could see from our disclosures, we're not only carrying a long position in 2018, we have quite a bit of power still opened in 2019 and 2020 as well.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure. Thank you, Joe. But can you just \u2013 when you look first quarter versus year-end, the effective realized energy price spark number you gave is down. So, just remind us sort of how that works because I think the message is the margin's up so somehow that indicator goes down.","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. And it's slightly different for the base load regions, I'll call the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic, versus the calculation in ERCOT. As you know, ERCOT, we're trying to give you a view of our spark spread which is more relevant to our machines. And the formula is laid out here. It's very simple. We take a gas price using Houston Ship Channel, multiply it by heat rate and add some variable O&M to set the reference price.","What we then do is we got to add back or subtract from the mark-to-market value. And the way to think about that is that's a dollar amount. So, we calculated the reference price in a unit of dollars per megawatt hour. We've now got a bucket of dollars on a mark-to-market basis that we need to divide by the volumes sold to bring it back to that same unit of dollars per megawatt hour. It just so happens in 2018, when you look at the effective realized energy price, it's next to zero. We've seen it in the past to actually go negative in ERCOT if we have a large mark-to-market loss with very small volume sold. And then, you could see in the out-years 2019 and 2020, that's a positive outcome or a positive spark.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But the net-net is that your expected margin is higher, correct?","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Yes. Our expected margin in ERCOT is higher in each year given that we're carrying an open position in all those years and the market is going higher. Now, that was offset, as we mentioned in the first question from Greg, with some of the changes on the rest of the portfolio to keep the gross margin on the bottom-line balanced.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. And then, just one other little issue. So, we noticed that there were particularly low tax charges at both PECO and PHI in the quarter. So, was there something unusual going on there? What should we be thinking as we sort of push those through the year?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","PECO, I think is where it's specific and it's tax repairs. So, as we invest capital for the storms that shows up later in the benefits and tax repairs same is true in certainly the PHI jurisdictions.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, what would be \u2013 should we see continued effect through the year, Jack, or is it really just like a Q1 one-off?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","It's a Q1.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","And depending on what storm activity we see in Q3 or Q4.","Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. I'm curious just there's a lot of retail businesses that looks like are on the market these days. How interested might you be in expanding retail through acquisition?","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Steve, we're always \u2013 good morning, first of all. It's Joe. We're always interested in looking at whatever opportunities exist in the marketplace. As you know, we have a history of acquiring companies in our recent past when you look at Integrys and Con Ed, for example, and we'll continue to do that. To the extent we can add something that we think will be accretive to the bottom line and fits with the value proposition that we're trying to bring both to our shareholders and our customers, we're going to be aggressive with doing that. There has been some change of hands with retailers in the near-term here and we would expect that to continue given some that are on the market now and we'll continue to hunt for them.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just the continued comment on staying more open due to your view that power prices are, I guess \u2013 upside you see in power prices. How much of that is the potential market reforms versus just expecting better price kind of without them or is it a mix of both?","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","It's a mix of both. I think you have to take the whole picture into account. When you look at our portfolio, from my lens, I think about risk reward. And when you look at where the power curve is, like, for example, in the Midwest now and where gas prices are, we think about it from a heat rate perspective and we see upside to that. And that's driven by some of the reforms that PJM themselves is talking about, and obviously, Joe and a number of folks here at Exelon are working on very closely, and we stay very tied to that.","And then, in addition to that, we look at history and changes in the composition of the Generation stack and the transmission stack. I still go back to some of the easy examples, though. We had gas prices two years ago at $1.70 and we had power prices that were almost $26. You have gas curves at $0.75 or $0.80 higher than that, and you see power prices that are lower than where they were. So it becomes a question of risk reward when you overlay just the fundamentals of the market itself and then obviously some of the regulatory reforms that are out on the horizon.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning.","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. So, perhaps, to follow up on Steve's question a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about expanding margins on retail and just what you're seeing out there? Obviously, some of your peers of late have really been adamant in seeing an opportunity there. Just would be curious to hear your latest assessment. I know you guys have seen a variety of different dynamics in the retail markets in recent months. So, I'll leave it there.","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. Julien, good morning. It's Joe. I guess, I really can't speak to what my competitors are actually achieving. I have an understanding of what they're saying, and we know how they're reacting in the market. What I would tell you is, we think about our load serving business across the wholesale perspective, when we think of polar auctions, as well as our independent retail business. It's tied very closely, obviously, to our Generation portfolio.","I think, first of all, the volatility during the quarter, especially in New England and PJM was good to see. We've got an expectation of volumes and margins that are in our disclosure, and we're comfortable with those, and they remain \u2013 the margins remain in line with what our expectations have been historically for C&I margins. We're comfortable with our projections overall. I will tell you we've seen some competitive behavior change on the retail side. Some folks, I think, were hurt last year with low volumes. And when you get into some of the non-energy charges and how they're calculated on a volumetric basis, and we've seen some of our competitors move away from fully fixed price contracts in certain markets. And we'll continue to offer those products, and we're going to remain disciplined to our approach.","We spend a lot of time analytically evaluating data and using that data to inform our decisions both from a generation to load matching strategy, from a pricing perspective and a product development perspective. And as you know, last year, we had some challenges in our retail business. We're comfortable where we are now. I will tell you on the wholesale polar auction side in the first quarter, we have had some success. And I think it's directly attributable to the volatility that we saw in late December and early January, and quite frankly, in March as well in Eastern PJM with higher prices.","So, overall, we're comfortable with what's reflected in the disclosure, and we're comfortable with the margins and the volumes. And we'll continue to work hard, and it is a very competitive marketplace.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just wanted to follow-up on one specific plant here, Mystic in New England. A lot of different dynamics playing out right now, but it would seem as if you need to clear your asset at all of the units, if you will, and then keep them around or would you actually look to retire select units here if they don't actually get picked up with an RMR or otherwise?","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Well, I think we've been very clear, right? I mean we announced the acquisition of the Marine Terminal. We have an obligation for capacity that we are going to honor. And that's part of the reason that we're driving towards that acquisition of the terminal. We've also been very clear that absent market reforms, we don't see profitability for these units into the future. And we're working very closely to try to rectify that. I mean, the ISO themselves put out a study recently saying that there were five assets in New England needed to ensure reliability into the future, one being the Everett Marine Terminal and the others being the Mystic asset.","So, putting all that together, as we've done in PJM and other areas with the capacity market, I think we take a very prudent approach to how we manage this looking into the future, and we're going to do the same thing in New England. We'll honor the commitment for capacity and we're going to look to get to the right reforms to make these assets more economic in the future.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All of it needs to clear, right?","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","Julien, this is Joe Dominguez. Actually, no. That's wrong. We don't have to clear the units to participate. And in fact, absent successful filing by the ISO on this waiver that they filed last night to offer a cost of service rate to Mystic, we will not clear. We will not participate in future capacity auctions.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Hey, Steve.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to touch on your additional leverage capacity. And I guess what I'm thinking about is, as you continue to shift your earnings mix more towards regulated earnings and you're certainly doing that organically, but I guess I'm also thinking about inorganic ways to do that as well. Could you talk at a high level in terms of what that might mean in terms of a different risk profile with the rating agencies, a different targeted credit metrics, et cetera, if you pivot increasingly more towards regulated earnings?","Jonathan W. Thayer - Exelon Corp.","So, Stephen, I think you know, we've been incredibly conservative with our balance sheet in taking that approach and I think it's worked well with the agencies. As we do get more regulated contribution, certainly the earnings mix of the company shifts as does the risk profile. That married with the 3 times debt-to-EBITDA target at the GenCo, which we're well below now, I think, positions the company quite well.","We have, in the past, spoken with the agencies, particularly S&P, about upgrading us at the holding company level and we will continue to pursue that. As the mix shifts occurs, I think our case strengthens. So, that's kind of the conservative approach we're taking.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. And then, shifting gears to the PJM white paper, Chris, that you had mentioned in your prepared remarks and thinking about fuel resiliency, fuel security. Procedurally, sort of how do we think about how PJM might approach that from a process point of view? I know it could take quite a bit of time to do more work, more analytics on that at PJM. But is there anything you can tell us in terms of just thoughts on how that process might unfold?","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","Yes. Stephen, it's Joe, and let me just start off with an observation. It's interesting. Secretary Perry in the 403 last fall identified a resilience problem in these markets. And as you know, that proposal was widely panned with a number of parties indicating that there is no resilience issue. Yet, in the last 48 hours, we've seen a filing by the New England ISO to retain Mystic on fuel security resilience grounds, and of course, we saw this white paper from PJM on Monday indicating that it too may have a resilience problem that would require capacity market changes.","From our perspective, turning to that white paper, the things that are going to be important is to understand the analytics, the inputs into the analyses that PJM runs and in particular, how they think about the unavailability of natural gas pipeline service and for what duration. What Chris mentioned at the top of the call is that in addition to those constraints or those modeling parameters, we'd like to see them model environmental impacts associated with this fuel mix. We kept the New England system running this year really on the back of oil-fired units.","And while we succeeded in keeping the lights on, it was a disappointing outcome for environmentalists in New England, where we burned 2 million barrels of oil and a disastrous, frankly, outcome for the stakeholder process in New England, where they want to get to lower air pollution, carbon and conventional pollutant emissions. So, we think that needs to be incorporated as well into PJM's analysis.","And until we get those environmental externalities incorporated, we're not going to have a complete market. So, we see this as a positive step forward. We're going to look very carefully at how they intend to model this situation, again, the unavailability of gas and for how long. And we think if they do that right, they're going to find that they, too, like New England, have a significant number of fuel constraints on the system that will require them to preserve fuel secure resources. Now, that could be gas plants on Marcellus Shale's storage, it could obviously be nuclear plants and it could be coal plants, but then we need to take another look at that mix and make sure we're meeting the expectations of our customers and communities in terms of environmental impacts.","In 2018, emissions need to be going down. And any resolution of this issue that results in emissions going up is going to continue to create incentives for state actions and indeed, for other federal actions to correct the flaws in those market.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","I want to just follow up on one thing. I want to make it clear. We are not anti-gas. We think that the consumers in the country have really benefited from the plentiful low-cost gas. But as we look at the transmission system designs in the country, the N minus 1 concept that coordinates power flows across our system in the loss of major lines is a design basis.","What we need is a design basis threat on the gas system to the electric system and ensure either redundancy in capacity for getting the gas to the plants or limit the dependency on the gas so we can keep the system up along with what Joe said on the environmental attributes.","So, we don't have a combined gas- and electric-day coordination. We don't have a design basis threat to the gas system that would affect the electric system properly. And that needs to be worked out.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very thoughtful response. I mean, it seems like the analysis, as you said, it's important to get the parameters set. That process could take a while. But I appreciate your point about what that analysis could result in. Thanks so much for the color.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Sure.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Hi, guys. Thanks so much.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Hi.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","So, a quick question on price formation. Could you just remind us what is the impact that you see for price formation for your assets? And how does that net out against the asset that are receiving zero-emission credits? Is there any net out of that as well?","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","So, I'll jump in. What we have talked about is really what PJM has modeled. And as a grouping of two different initiatives, the fast-start initiative and the full (00:48:09) relaxation for baseload units, PJM has modeled a $3.50 impact to energy markets. We haven't published or discussed any numbers different from that.","In terms of how it interfaces with the ZEC program, remember that the units that we presently have in the ZEC program are in New York, which would be unaffected by that change. Clinton, which is in MISO, again unaffected by that change. So, the only unit presently we'd be talking about is Quad Cities. And yes, as energy prices go up either as a result of energy market dynamic changes, policy changes, carbon being in the market, there would be potentially an offset to the ZEC payment with the plants that are participating.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Okay. That's helpful. And that'll apply to New Jersey as well?","Joseph Dominguez - Exelon Corp.","In New Jersey, the mechanism is going to be different. But if prices recover for other reasons, the program also will have the BPU look at pricing in future years and potentially make adjustments. The key in all of these states is to preserve the zero-emission resources for the customers.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Got you. That's helpful. And just quickly connecting that with capital allocation, right? If you do have the upside from price formation and zero-emission potentially in Pennsylvania as well, you've already kind of laid out a plan which allocates all the capital into all the different kind of criteria you've mentioned from debt reduction to dividend. Where do you see the incremental capital, if it does come through, get allocated in your plan covenant? (00:49:54)","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. We have good capital resources today. We have good sources of investments to make for customer satisfaction and reliability, so we'll continue on that path, but we have to maintain a very strong sensitivity to the consumer impact on excessive capital going on the system. We can install $8 worth of capital and keep rates the same by reducing O&M by $1. And that's what we have to be focused on is customer service, reliability and the impact on our consumers. So that will be our approach as we go forward.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Got you. Thanks. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Crane for closing remarks.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","So, I want to thank everybody again for attending the call and the questions. We're always available for any further details that you want going through Dan. We've had a good first quarter. We anticipate a good 2018. The work that's being done by all our operating groups continue to ensure that we maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver on the value proposition. I won't wear you out with my opinion of the valuation of the stock. We have had some improvement but as we execute we expect to see more improvement on that in the following quarters and year.","So, with that, thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. JaCee Burns. Ma'am, you may begin.","JaCee Burns","Thank you, Tracy, and good morning, everyone. I'm JaCee Burns, Vice President of Investor Relations for Exelon. Welcome to Exelon Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today. We hope that you and your families are safe and sound, particularly for those of you on the East Coast, who have been dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. You've really been in our thoughts a great deal.","We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven't received it, the release is available on the Exelon website. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings.","Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Thayer, Exelon Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's executive management team who will be available to answer your questions. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call.","I will now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Christopher M. Crane","Thank you, JaCee, and good morning to everybody. Before I discuss the Exelon third quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the more than 8,000 PECO and BGE employees, contractors, mutual assistant workers, who are working around-the-clock to respond to Hurricane Sandy.","This devastating storm slammed our Pennsylvania and Maryland service territories with heavy rain, high winds and is causing historic damage. Many of you know this firsthand, being in the New Jersey and New York area. We are grateful to the dedicated men and women in the field, who are repairing the damage and restoring service to our customers as quickly and safely as possible. And that's not to mention the thousands of out-of-state contract workers, including our ComEd employees, who have made their way east to assist in the service.","We have today, for those of you in New York, around 50 underground technicians arriving in New York City to assist with the recovery of the underground system there, and we'll continue to keep our folks on the East Coast as long as we can to help in all regions.","I'd also like to acknowledge the employees that are for -- in Mid-Atlantic nuclear plants for effectively preparing for the hurricane. And then they worked diligently to respond to the storm, particularly Oyster Creek, which was at the point where the storm came ashore, which felt the greatest impact. Because of their dedication, we are able to resume normal operations.","With that, let's turn to Slide 2. The third quarter financial performance was very strong for Exelon, particularly at ExGen. We reported operating earnings per share of $0.77, which was well above the midpoint of our guidance range for the quarter. Based on our financial performance to date, we are revising our 2012 full year earning guidance range to $2.75 to $2.95 per share. This range incorporates the preliminary cost estimates of the impact of the Hurricane Sandy in our service territories, which we have preliminarily forecasted to be around $100 million of incremental O&M expense. We're in the midst of the restoration, so that could have a plus or minus 20%. We'll be finalizing it by weekend.","The merger continues to go very well. We are on track to meet our commitments to various stakeholders, including our shareholders. We expect to achieve the $170 million merger-related O&M synergies in 2012 that we announced at Analyst Day, as well as the $500 million of run rate synergies beginning in 2014.","In the course of the bottoms-up construction of our long-range plan, we have also identified an incremental $50 million of O&M cost reductions, bringing the total synergies to $550 million. As we complete the integration and continue to refine our financial plans, I expect we will identify further cost reduction opportunities.","We've signed a sales agreement for the mandated asset divestiture in Maryland, received FERC approval for the sale and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. We are benefiting from our well-matched generation and load footprint as demonstrated by our year-to-date financial performance, highlighted by the Constellation portfolio optimization success.","Our integrated operations are seamless, the management team is working very well together and the merger is working. Jack will provide you with more detail about the financial performance, but first let me give you our view on the current market environment and how we assess our overall financial priorities. I'll wrap up with a discussion on the outcome of the rehearing process at ComEd and the implications of the ICC's ruling on the pace and scope of future investments.","So moving to Slide 3. During the quarter, we saw considerable volatility in the power and gas markets. In August, prices declined significantly to levels lower than June 30 prices, which were the basis for our second quarter hedged disclosure. In September, power prices recovered, driven largely by rising gas prices. However, we continue to see a disconnect in heat rates and forward power prices in PJM.","We recently updated our fundamental analysis, which now indicates that even after the recovery and power prices, there is roughly $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside not being reflected in the prices. The expected upside is the result of plant retirements, higher operating cost for compliance with environmental standards and a continued disconnect between heat rates and gas prices.","We forecast that approximately 42 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in the Eastern Interconnect by 2016, with over 30 gigawatts of retirement already announced. Other third parties have even higher forecast of retirements. We believe NiHub has the most heat rate upside. At the current gas prices, we expect to see greater than 1 heat rate point increase over the current market, or approximately $6 of upside in 2015 at NiHub prices.","Given the lower number of retirements in the MATS portion of PJM and less of a disconnect in heat rates, we see an opportunity of approximately $3 per megawatt hour upside in the PJM West Hub prices.","There are 2 primary factors can explain why we are not currently seeing this upside. First, approximately 15 gigawatts of capacity will be retired in Eastern Interconnect this year and next. As these units come offline, we expect to see an increase in prices. Second, there is a potential for an increased liquidity in 2013 forward prices for the year -- calendar year of 2015 and beyond, as load auctions take place with delivery in 2015 and customers procure power in the commercial, industrial and the Muni-Ag space. For these reasons, we think we expect the forward curves to reflect the $3 to $6 per megawatt hour upside during 2013.","We continue with our traditional ratable hedging but we are executing our Bull\/Bear program in this period of volatility to capture the incremental value from a heat rate recovery while ratably locking in cash flows to support the balance sheet. We have flexibility in our program to increase or decrease our hedge within a 10% band of ratable.","You've seen us exercise this flexibility in the past, where we have hedged at or above ratable and locked in on incremental value. Now we have slowed our hedge activity over the last few quarters from ahead of ratable at the end of 2011 to ratable levels. At this pace, we will trim below a purely ratable program over the next few quarters, absent a power market recovery. However, we will always look to shift our strategy when we see better pricing opportunities.","We are also leveraging our financial and physical products, such as selling underlying gas and utilizing gas and power options in order to preserve the ability to capture the heat rate expansion when the ultimate pricing -- the price comes back into the market. And note that, that natural gas underlying an option hedge is less than 10% of our expected generation.","This portfolio optimization is a core skill for Constellation. This year we were able to capture considerable value through the portfolio management by optimizing our generation load positions.","In ERCOT, large moves in the forward summer heat rates allowed us to sell our peaking generation open link as forward prices rose prior to the summer, and we continue to perform this optimization into the spot market while we manage the load variability.","In PJM, we saw low falling products that better match our generation through our retail and wholesale channels, reducing basis exposure and capture incremental value for our base generation.","With that backdrop on markets, I'd like now to speak about our latest forecast for retail. As we discussed our -- in updated generation hedge disclosure, flip to Slide 4. As you heard us discuss in the last month, both the retail and the wholesale markets have been impacted by aggressive competition and pricing. We maintained the same disciplined approach to valuing and pricing the risk and the full requirements load that has led to success in our portfolio optimization in the past.","This approach has resulted in us not winning as many of the recent Muni-Ag RFPs in Illinois and certain other competitive procurements in other markets. Our recent experience in the competitive environment has tempered our near- to mid-term outlook for our retail business. We have adjusted our commercial load expectations as reflected in our updated Exelon generation disclosure from what we presented back at Analyst Day.","At Analyst Day, we were projecting 20% growth in commercial volumes from 2011 to 2014. Reflecting the current market dynamics, we are now projecting a 9% growth in volumes from 2011 to 2015. We still expect retail to support growth in our commercial business and serve as a key channel to market. We also view the current pricing dynamic as unfortunate, but a necessary aspect of what we expect to be consolidation of retail providers. This experience also highlights the importance of the ability that we uniquely possess to utilize other channels to market to optimize our portfolio.","Turning to Slide 5. We can discuss the impact of these changes on our ExGen hedge disclosure.  Compared to second quarter open gross margin improved by $600 million from the 2012 to 2014, as power prices increased across the curve. We have continued to hedge and have moved the portfolio back to near ratable.","In our PJM baseload regions, we are close to ratable and we have utilized discrete hedging products to preserve the opportunity to benefit from the market realization of our fundamental views that forward market heat rates will move higher.","In ERCOT and NEPOOL, we are slightly behind ratable, leaving room for upside participation in what we believe will be higher spark spreads.","We are fully hedged in 2012, roughly 90% hedged in 2013, approximately 60% hedged in 2014. We've introduced hedge disclosures for 2015 that we have approximately 20% of our portfolio hedged in that year. We are mostly open in 2016 and highly leveraged to the recovery in power prices as reserve margins tighten.","During the quarter, we benefited from our balanced load serving and generation portfolio, which is reflected in the $100 million increase in our total gross margin for 2012.","In particular, due to the hot temperatures across the country, we experienced stronger-than-forecasted wholesale and retail loads, resulting in favorable variances as the majority of our contracts are executed at higher prices. In addition, we leveraged our dispatchable fleet across the country to realize higher margins during this period.","The impact of the degradation in the retail market can be seen in 2013 and 2014 through the reduction in power new business to go bucket. The decrease of $50 million in 2013 and $100 million in 2014 is a combination of both a decrease in volume expectation as well as a lower dollar per megawatt hour margin.","At our June -- at our Analyst Day in June, we shared that our retail C&I margin average, $2 to $4 per megawatt hour. With the increased competition, we're now seeing those margins at the lower end of this range. As we move into the selling season in the fourth quarter of 2012 and early into 2013, we will gain more insight as to where the margins and the volumes are trending.","While we're disappointed with these reduction -- reduced expectations, history has taught us that discipline is more integral to value sustainment than unfettered growth. So we'll continue to monitor the competitive environment, strive to attract and serve new customers and improve our market share, but we will be -- remain disciplined in our pricing.","Before we leave this slide, I want to tie it back to our discussion about the expected upside in the power markets. In the appendix, back on Slide 19, we provided our standard gross margin sensitivities. Hitting that, in 2015, we're only 20% hedged. A $5 move per megawatt hour increase over the current forwards will result in roughly $700 million of additional gross margin. In 2016, where we're mostly open generation position, this opportunity is approximately $1 billion or roughly $0.70 of earnings per share. If our fundamental view is realized, this is a boost to earnings that is not reflected in our current valuation.","Now let's talk about our financial priorities and some actions we have taken as a result of the volatility we've seen in the markets and to give ourselves some more opportunity. So turning to Slide 6. Our #1 priority is to remain investment grade across all our registrants. Our investment grade rating is fundamental to the business, given our sizable collateral requirements, our counterparty and customer relationships and our significant nuclear capital expenditure.","In close proximity of importance, our next financial priority is returning value to the shareholders through our dividend. We understand the importance of the value of the dividend to our shareholders.","Our third priority is to invest in growth opportunities, smartly deploy growth capital to value -- to provide value to our shareholders.","In order to fulfill our top priorities and sustain certain investments, which benefit from the anticipated market recovery, we've adjusted our capital spend plans. This repositioning of capital has 3 key components. First, we're deferring the Limerick extended power upgrade by 4 years. Second, we're deferring the LaSalle EPU by another 2 years. If you remember at Analyst Day, we announced the deferral of LaSalle by an initial 2 years, and this will create a 4-year overall deferral. The licensing activities, which is the amendment to approve that power uprate, will continue to be submitted to the NRC by the end of the year. This allows the flexibility to execute the EPU projects when prices recover.","Lastly, we removed the undesignated renewable spend from our financial plan. In total, we removed roughly $2.3 billion of growth capital from 2012 to 2015 capital plans at Exelon Generation since our Analyst Day disclosures, which meaningfully improves our free cash flow over the period.","The deferral of these projects is a matter of better aligning our growth capital spend with the expected timing of the power market recovery. We still believe that these projects add significant value and can earn attractive IRRs. The long-term -- the long-lived nature of these assets will allow us to defer the investment and still capture returns in a more balance sheet friendly manner.","On Slide 7, we'll provide the comparison of our current ExGen growth CapEx forecast to what we presented at the Analyst Day. So flipping to that -- excuse me, they gave me a long script today. So flipping to Slide 7. You can see the impacts of the deferral of Limerick and LaSalle as well as the elimination of the unidentified renewable spend. We're moving forward with the EPU at Peach Bottom as planned. The additional 130 megawatts from this upgrate are expected to come online and generate returns beginning in 2015, resulting in an unlevered IRR on a go-forward basis well above 10% across the range of potential price scenarios.","We are the farthest along with Peach Bottom. To date, at our ownership level, we have invested $55 million, with roughly $360 million of spend planned through 2016.","In terms of investment dollars, Peach Bottom is the smallest of the 3 uprates and the size of the investment results in limited strain on the balance sheet.","You can also see that we are moving forward with our plans for upstream gas. These investments provide strong returns with no impact on credit metrics as calculated by S&P, given their treatment of the reserve base lending facility that is utilized to fund the business.","We view these investments as value-creation opportunities for our shareholders that support our strategy but with limited balance sheet impact.","Now I'll speak to the decisions -- now I'll speak to how these decisions impact our balance sheet and how we think about the dividend going forward. We've maintained a strong balance sheet to help us weather this challenging market. With the expected year-end FFO to debt of 31% in 2012, we are strong heading into 2013. However, these metrics weaken as our higher-priced hedges roll off and we enter into the new hedges at lower prices.","Based on 9\/30 prices and with the deferral of the upgrade and the elimination of the undesignated renewable spend, our FFO to debt at Genco plus HoldCo is more focused -- excuse me, forecasted to be above the 25% to 27% range for 2014 and '15.","We believe our metrics are sufficient to maintain investment-grade ratings. But with the recent market volatility we experience, we have to continue to monitor this.","We believe the materialization of our fundamental view of power prices will allow us to strengthen our credit matrix and watch the markets closely to ensure that we have no structural changes that could impact our fundamental view of the $3 to $6 upside.","It is, of course, also possible that the power prices will not recover as completely or as rapidly as our fundamental views suggest. In that regard, with the actions we've taken, we have time to see how things play out. But if they do not play out favorably in the next 6 months, revisiting our dividend policy will be in the range of options for preserving our investment-grade rating that management and the board will need to consider.","Before I turn the call over to Jack, I'd like to speak to the implications of the Illinois Commerce Commission's decision in the rehearing of ComEd's formula rate, which is on Slide 8.","On October 30, ICC granted ComEd recovery of the cost of funding its pension but denied the cost of recovery of 2 other key issues, which ComEd appealed in the courts, along with other items previously denied in the ICC May ruling. The adverse ruling on the interest rate and rate base issues impair ComEd's ability to finance long-term investment programs. While we remain committed to fulfilling the promise of the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act and intend to meet our obligations under the law, we have to be thoughtful about making the investments, if we do not have a full cost recovery mechanism, as authorized by the legislation.","As a result of the ICC decision, ComEd has deferred $450 million of capital expenditure through 2012 -- from 2012 to 2014 to 2015 year. Obviously, that schedule could shift as a result of regulatory, legal or legislative developments. At EEI, we'll be providing a more comprehensive update of the ComEd and other utility CapEx spends forecasted through 2015.","Given the negative impact of the ICC decision, we believe the decision should be reversed. This will take time. So we'll continue to update you as we work through it. And like I said, we'll talk more about this in EEI.","I'll now turn the call over to Jack, who will speak to our financial performance during the quarter.","Jonathan W. Thayer","Thank you Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, I'll review the second quarter financial results, and then update you on changes to our 2012 cash forecast and earnings outlook.","I'll start on Slide 9. We reported third quarter 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.77 per share versus $1.12 a share in the third quarter of 2011. Beyond the impact of the merger-related share differential and the addition of earnings from the legacy Constellation business, revenue net of fuel at ExGen is the primary difference between 2012 third quarter results and the third quarter prior year. The drivers of lower RNF include lower realized market prices and lower PJM capacity revenues due to the transition to the 2012-2013 capacity auction clearing prices, which averaged about $36 per megawatt day lower than the 2011-2012 planning period.","When comparing our financial results for the quarter with our expectations, we delivered solid results for the quarter and we exceeded our $0.65 to $0.75 of earnings per share expectations. We outperformed our guidance range largely due to favorable RNF at ExGen and tax benefits at PECO and favorable weather at ComEd and PECO.","ExGen's $0.53 non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter reflected about $0.04 of favorable RNF. This RNF upside is the net of approximately $0.07 of revenues from effective portfolio management optimization by Ken Cornew's Constellation team, partially offset by $0.03 due to lower-than-expected nuclear volumes. Chris already spoke about the source of the portfolio optimization benefit earlier, but I will add that event-driven opportunities such as this are difficult to forecast. When they do arise, having a skilled team that can execute and capture the benefits such as ours is an asset.","Moving to the utilities. ComEd's non-GAAP earnings of $0.10 per share for 2012 third quarter includes $0.01 more earnings than expected from favorable weather, driven by the amount of cooling degree-days over normal. The number of cooling degree-days at ComEd this quarter exceeded normal expectations by nearly 250 degree-days or 40%.","Likewise, PECO's 2012 third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.14 per share reflect an additional $0.01 of earnings above our expectations due to weather. PECO's 2012 third quarter results also reflect a larger than estimated benefit from the deductions associated with the tax treatment of repairs for gas distribution assets. We elected and recognized a similar benefit for the treatment of electric transmission distribution assets the same time last year. The actual benefit for this item came in higher than our estimate by $0.02.","BGE's 2012 non-GAAP operating earnings this quarter were completely offset by storm cost. BGE's non-GAAP operating earnings would have been about $0.03 if not for the cost incurred for the derecho storm in July. Despite BGE's absorption of the storm cost, BGE will still contribute positive earnings to full year consolidated earnings.","Turning to Slide 10. Our cash from operations projection is up $450 million since the last update. There are several puts and takes to this number, but it's largely due to changes in net income and changes in taxes coinciding with the company's annual tax filings. In addition, the latest cash from operations projection includes the updated expected net proceeds from the sale of the Maryland coal assets, as outlined in the 8-K we filed on August 9.","Now I'll turn to Slide 11 on earnings outlook. On Slide 11, I'd like to provide our updated earnings outlook for 2012. As is typical at this time of year, we are narrowing our guidance range. We've had a few positive developments occur this quarter that warrant us raising the top of our range as well. We now expect 2012 full year earnings in the range of $2.75 to $2.95 per share, up from our initial earnings guidance range of $2.55 to $2.85 per share.","The revised earnings expectations reflect the $0.10 of earnings per share ComEd will record in the fourth quarter to recognize the impact of the commission's rehearing decision issued on October 3. The guidance adjustment also considers the incremental earnings contributed by the favorable RNF at ExGen, offset by our preliminary estimate of incremental storm cost related to Hurricane Sandy.","So in closing, our next update would be at EEI, where we will refresh much of the information we shared at Analyst Day, including capital expenditure estimates through 2015 and pension contribution expectations.","That concludes my comments. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris before we open the line for Q&A.","Christopher M. Crane","Thanks, Jack. Before we move to Q&A, I just want to reiterate a few points. We've had a strong financial performance in 2012, even with the impact of the hurricane. As a result, Jack mentioned, we are increasing our earnings guidance range. While the recent market dynamics do give us concern, I'd restate we believe $3 to $6 per megawatt hour is not priced into the market, and our expectation is that we will see the upside for 2015 and beyond materialize in 2013.","We've taken the right platform to take the right advantage of what we expect for the power market recovery. Investment-grade ratings and maintaining the dividend are our top priorities. We have options, we have time to maintain these objectives.","To time our investments for the power market recovery in giving us some flexibility, we've repositioned our growth strategy and we deferred certain upgrade projects. We'll also, as we stated, eliminate the undesignated renewable spend.","Lastly, we remain focused on protecting and creating value -- shareholder value through continued advancement of growth projects at Exelon utilities, Peach Bottom, Antelope Valley Solar Ranch and upstream gas.","With that, we will open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Greg Gordon with ICI Group (sic) [ISI Group].","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask you a few questions about the numbers from sort of the -- from the Analyst Day from April 30 to present. So when we look at power pricing, power prices dipped but have -- sort of substantial to come back more or less to where they were at the Analyst Day deck, slightly higher in some regions like Zone A, New York; slightly lower in other regions like PJM -- I'm sorry, like NiHub. But you have also done things to reduce CapEx, further cut O&M and your gross margin targets are substantially the same. So is it fair to say that your credit metrics, as things look today, are still within the 25% to 27% FFO to debt that you were projecting in April?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes, they are.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So why would you, 6 months from now, when things aren't improving, be sort of thinking about a change in dividend policy if at the current forward curve you're still on those credit metrics? Is it that over time, you start to -- you're deferring capital expenditures but you can't -- you're sort of pushing out the decision but you can't permanently eliminate that decision unless power prices go up. Is that the right way to think about it?","Christopher M. Crane","Here's how I'd look at it. The capital isn't part of that decision any longer. If the markets don't come back, which we think they will, most likely we will not do those upgrades. So you've got to see the market recover and then you see the strengthening of the balance sheet, then you understand we should be back into a sustainable growth mode, optimizing our assets. Continuing to watch the markets come forward, if you look at 2012 and 2014 -- excuse me, 2013, 2014 NiHub or West Hub, those years on an ATC are back to where we were talking with you at Analyst Day, and some a little bit better. But if you look at '15 and '16, there's still a buck and change disconnect there. So we haven't seen them strengthen as much on the back end. We saw a lot of volatility in August. It was unbelievable where the numbers were going, we couldn't model them. We want to make sure that we're being very open and clear. We said we wouldn't surprise anybody. If that volatility comes back into the market, we don't see the recovery, you do not want to -- we do not want to be living on the edge, and the edge is 25%. We've been given some flexibility by the rating agencies because they think this is a stress period. But if something structurally change there and you're dealing with a 90% payout on a dividend for a long run and we have to question if we're getting value. You don't want to live on the edge. There is potential volatility, but I think we have time to watch it going into 2013.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So just to recap and make sure I'm hearing you correctly, you've sort of moved yourself back into a comfort zone for the short term with the actions you've taken, but if we don't see the back end improve, those actions sort of aren't a permanent solution?","Christopher M. Crane","I don't think they would be a permanent solution under these market conditions right now. And that's why we've got to see the market come back up.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Just a follow-up question on that. One of the things that is sort of an obvious observation is that this is probably leading to lower prices is the anemic low growth that you're seeing in your service territories. I think that's a concern that's come up on a number of other earnings calls in a number of other regions as well. Is there anything you can point to that's leading to sort of such sluggish activity? And anything that might lead to a potential change in that perspectively?","Christopher M. Crane","Well, the first initiating event for the market prices is the retirement of the assets that have been stated already, and we think that tightens the reserve margins there and should be reflected in the market prices. The load growth has been flat to negative. We continue to work on saving industry and trying to attract industry in. But I don't think you can beat energy efficiency over the next couple of years. So there -- on some sides, you're seeing housing come back. You're seeing auto come back. We saved the refineries in Pennsylvania, that's the load sting or a little coming back in. On the other side of that equation, you're seeing the effects of energy efficiency come in. So the real needle mover is on the market reflecting the tightening reserve margins of the retirements.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Following on the last question, given the volatility in August, is there a change in your confidence in your fundamental view? Or is it simply just the volatility itself? I'm trying to understand what's causing the injection of the dividend uncertainty.","Christopher M. Crane","We're not injecting that today. I think we've messaged clearly that we'll never surprise anybody. We talked about the levers we had back in Analyst Day, when we were looking at tight market forwards. We've come back to that point. August had more volatility than we expected. Now there's a couple of things that came in, in August. We think there was more coming to market, then the liquidity was there. It -- other portfolios were coming into the market. We need to substantiate that in the next quarter, next couple of quarters to see -- and we believe the prices would come back. But can -- I don't think we're shaken by the volatility but we do want to confirm our assessment, right?","Jonathan W. Thayer","That's right, Chris. Obviously, Jay, we have and continue to reiterate that we see heat rate upside in this market that is not being reflected, particularly in the '15, '16 time frame. The volatility in price you've seen this summer largely was driven by a couple of things, natural gas price movements and selling behavior in the marketplace. We have seen some recovery on the back of natural gas prices, but we still have not seen the market reflect what we think is a fundamental shift in the stack based on the retirement of over 40,000 gigawatts coal plants in the '15-'16 time frame.","James L. Dobson - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then Chris, on Illinois, can you talk just a little bit about the legislative outlook? I know you filed an 8-K and are probably getting out and talking to folks about the ICC decision. Just I know you're appealing it, but what legislative attempts might be on the horizon?","Christopher M. Crane","We have Anne Pramaggiore here. I'll let her speak to that.","Anne R. Pramaggiore","Thanks, Chris. Our view is we've got free pass to resolving this issue, which is essentially recovering the cost of making the investment that the legislature envisions us to make over the next few years. One is the appeal path, and I think you've all seen that we filed our appeal. We also asked for an expedited appeal, and that was -- we did not -- we were not successful on that. So we're on the appeal path. The second path is to try to deal with this in the commission itself. There's a current rate case in front of the commission that is -- will be resolved by the end of December, and there's some opportunity to deal with it in that case. And then finally, obviously, there's a legislative path. So we view all those paths as options right now. We are talking to all parties and having conversations. I don't think we foreclosed any path, but we'll see what looks like the most opportune path and the one where we can get it done as quickly as possible so we can get back on track with making these investments and creating jobs in the state.","Operator","And your next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question. Chris, when you were talking about just looking out into next year and recovery, I think you mentioned the dividend being one of the options that you'd have to address, maybe your fundamental view is not playing out as you hoped. What would the others be?","Christopher M. Crane","We would continue to look at other capital spends. Stacie Frank and treasury are looking at some things in project, financing some of our renewables we have. Now, they're not as large or meaningful, but if it's just to buy more time as we see the market come back, there are other steps that we'll be looking at.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And so those would be -- you see you have incremental sort of levers on CapEx, potentially?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Yes.","Christopher M. Crane","We have to be very careful about the next step. So the next step is, is this a reliability cut, and are you going to pay for it in the long run? So you look at some of the upgrade projects around digital systems at the nuclear plants or other things like that, that are addressing each of the infrastructure, which -- you really have got to be careful, but we will look at them. And if it's moving in some amount of time, months or a year and we don't think it'll be impactful, we can look at that. But again, they're not the 2.3 billion size that we are able to just pull with the actions we are taking now.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, if I may. Like last quarter's 10-Q disclosed some pretty substantial pension contributions that you expected to have in the '16-'17 time frame. How should we -- I mean, firstly, have those numbers changed much as you update for this quarter? And how should we think about those as they fit into this plan?","Christopher M. Crane","Sure. We've been working on that. Jack, do you want to talk a little bit about that?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Sure, Chris. So Jonathan, as you might expect, with the declining interest rates, the liability has grown. Importantly, under Doug Brown, who heads up our investments organization under Bill, we had put in place a liability matching strategy that reduced the impact on the overall obligation. That current unfunded status, if you look at the pension, is roughly $3.9 billion. That's relative to an end of year '11 of $2.2 billion. And I would say that, that growth is despite the fact that we've seen a very strong performance on both the equity, as well as the liability matched elements of our pension assets. As we look forward, as you may know, the President has put in place a -- or is looking to put in place a policy that allows us to adjust the pension liability and how we fund that. And that would have the impact of pulling forward certain of our expenses and reducing our expenses in out years. This strategy, we'll be updating at EEI, and we'll be able to walk you through after we've issued the Q3 10-Q, the specific details of the impact of that adjustment. But it does result in further funding in the initial years but moderates that funding and reduces it in '16 and '17.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And could I just ask one sort of a related topic, is equity something you would look at as a way to bridge either the trough in the power cycle or maybe this pension funding issue as it comes -- it will arise?","Christopher M. Crane","So we would always look. But at this point, I believe that our equity is -- the value isn't reflected in our equity right now. So it would be unlikely that, that would be a fix. If we don't see markets recovering, something's fundamentally shifted. Issuing equity to buy time only to have to make some other decision in the future just seems more destructive than we'd be willing to take at this point. But that said, it's not totally off the table. We'll look at where we're at when -- middle of the year and see what fits best based off of the financials that we're facing.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question with regard to the $3 to $6 and thinking about the base, you've been communicating that range for a while but the base has continued to move around. Should we think about the base being this 9\/30 price stack when you think about the $3 to $6 that you're looking for?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes. That is right. It's the -- around the 9\/30 and it's in the out years, gaining that recovery where it still has stayed flat.  Jack, you got any more on that?","Jonathan W. Thayer","No, I think that's right, Chris. We have talked about, at varying times, the upside that we see in heat rate recovery. At varying times, we've said it's actually priced into the market and aggressively hedged at above ratable to lock in that value. And at this point, as of 9\/30, that $3 to $6 is what we see as the fundamental upside.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on the retail margin and disclosures, it looks like you are expecting some kind of normalization, maybe by the 2015 forecast, is that correct in terms of margins? Or are you assuming like lower end?","Christopher M. Crane","No, I think we do. Ken, you want to talk about that?","Kenneth W. Cornew","Yes. Steve. we do expect margins to revert back to historical, where we would think of more rational levels in 2015 timeframe. You are correct.","Steven I. Fleishman - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And when we think about rational, is that the midpoint, the $2 to $4 for low end?","Kenneth W. Cornew","Yes, commercial industrial business, it would be in the midpoint area, the $2 to $4. Obviously, much larger for gross margin on the MATS market side.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What do you know as far as the schedule of auctioning of the Illinois load?","Christopher M. Crane","Do you have any update on that? Yes, we'll ask Anne.","Anne R. Pramaggiore","Yes. I mean, I don't know if you're asking about municipal aggregation or the Illinois Power Agency. The Illinois Power Agency typically goes out in April. But with the load shift under municipal aggregation, I think there's a question right now as to whether they actually will go out in April. If the question is on municipal aggregation, we've seen about 50% of the residential load shift year-to-date. We've got about 60 more referenda to go next week. And if they all go, we'll see about 75% of the load move off of ComEd into the market by first quarter of next year.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And when -- how soon would you act on the dividend if -- when you do your 6-month look and things haven't improved, under that scenario, would you do something immediately?","Christopher M. Crane","I couldn't venture to say that. We've got to see what's going on in the market. We have had a lot of conversations with the board if we got to that point, but -- and I said we wouldn't surprise anybody. We'll have many more conversations between here and there, but couldn't commit to a timeframe. As I said, we believe the market is going to come back. We believe the market has to come back. And so we're more on the side \"let's get the market back\" than we are \"here's the date we would plan on cutting a dividend.\"","Operator","And your next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just on the credit quality. I mean, you want the investment grade, but again I think of you guys as being -- you're not exactly BBB-, right? I mean, how far down would you go, I guess? Is there any particular range we should think about here? Or...","Christopher M. Crane","Well we are at the HoldCo BBB-, BBB at the Genco. So we're there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm talking about the Genco. Isn't that where the big issue is? Or is it at the HoldCo, as well?","Christopher M. Crane","We wouldn't allow ourselves at any registrant to go below. Due to the constraints on the other businesses, would be too cumbersome and too costly.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then Kewaunee, they're shutting that down, which would sort of lead me to believe that it could have been gotten for a song. I know it's not in PJM. I know that there are obviously different characteristics with their plant. I'm just wondering sort of your thoughts about that. The opportunity I'm sure you guys probably would have seen -- anything in terms of -- give us any flavor for that?","Christopher M. Crane","Demand has done a lot to improve that plant. There are good people there. It's sad to see a nuke come off, but there isn't a market to cover -- it's a small unit, so it's all -- and costs are a little bit higher. It's tough to compete in the PPA area for that. So the economics just don't work. We're -- across the board, we continue to look at the valuations of all the nuclear assets. And smaller, single site assets are more challenged with these power prices that are not only damaged based off of the lower commodity price but also some of the issues that we're having around excess wind generation. So we'll continue to look at plants as they come up, but it just doesn't make it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And is there anything we should think about with respect to anybody in your fleet? Is there -- are there any Kewaunees to put it directly?","Christopher M. Crane","No. No, there's no Kewaunees that -- we go through our asset valuations on an annual basis. But we are looking at things to try to improve the financial performance. Our Clinton station, which is a large single-unit site, it's a high quality, newer asset, is struggling with this MISO market in the wind generation. We're looking at going to annual refueling cycles to save on our fuel costs that will help its sustainability on the grid. So we're in the mode of continuing to figure out how to help these things survive this market downturn versus the outright sell or close-type thing at this point.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then on the positive side Sandy and the Rachel, I think, are in guidance, is that correct? And I know -- I think you said it was about $100 million for Sandy? What was the impact of the Rachel? I'm sorry, if I missed it.","Christopher M. Crane","Is that...","Jonathan W. Thayer","The derecho","Christopher M. Crane","Yes. You got that, Jack or Ken?","Jonathan W. Thayer","The derecho was roughly $0.05 -- or sorry, $50 million, $0.03.","Operator","And your next question is from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just if we can get into the retail conversation a little bit, I mean, Jack, you guys have been in this business for a long time. Is the pressure outside of Muni-Ag, are you seeing similar pressures on the C&I customer base kind of across the country? Or is this a more of Midwestern localized issue as you've seen some of the other big integrated utilities try and hedge their outlook this way?","Christopher M. Crane","Ken, do you want to cover that?","Kenneth W. Cornew","Yes. Dan, we've clearly seen pressure on both the Muni-Ag side and C&I space. C&I selling season is really Q4 and Q1, so we're now in the midst of what will be a 6-month run-on selling in C&I space because that's how the buyers -- this is the time here when buyers buy. So it remains to be seen whether the behavior persists. But clearly, through the summer, there have been -- there has been margin pressure in all segments of retail.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, Chris, just I don't want to belabor the dividend question. But when you and the board stepped back and kind of looked at the dividend relative to the business mix and the earnings power, how do you guys think about your coverage or payout ratios between the utility and the generation businesses as you formulate kind of comfort with a dividend at a certain level?","Christopher M. Crane","So what we've done in the past, we have a more traditional payout strategy for the utilities, 65% to 70%. And that resonates well as we benchmark to other regulated entities. On the growth side for the competitive part of the integrated, we have tried to benchmark more of the yield and keep track with the sector and the yield. Now since we've got a little bit more damage with the gas and our concentration in NiHub, our yield is 5.9%, last time I looked at it, where the others are probably 1% lower, if not more. So we're outpacing the yield. Now we get this $0.70 back, it's a different conversation. And we're more sensitive to the upside. And that's what -- we just got to reaffirm with -- in our policy as we look at this, is that the right thing? We think we're hitting the stress low, and we think the recovery is there. But that would be part of the conversation, how do you benchmark the yield and the payout percentage on that other side of the business?","Operator","You're next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Chris or Jack, when you look at the margin profile you laid out for us for '15, I guess you've now added that to your disclosure and you factored in cost escalation, et cetera. Should we be thinking of '15 still as flat to down year for you guys?","[Technical Difficulty]","Christopher M. Crane","I'm sorry, we're having some technical difficulty here.","[Technical Difficulty]","Christopher M. Crane","So you were asking about the margins that we baked into the disclosure on '15?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes. And my question was when you look at cost escalations and the like, are we still looking at '15 relatively flat to even down for Exelon as a whole, given those margin trends you've given us?","Christopher M. Crane","Are you talking in...","[Technical Difficulty]","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","On an EPS basis.","Christopher M. Crane","Yes, we are giving EPS for 2015. So we're only going to focus at the first of the year on '13. We don't go out there.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I understood. Understood. I was just looking directionally not really trying to pin you down on a number. A separate question, Chris. As you look at your portfolio today, and of course you have to sell those assets as part of the merger, but are all the current assets pretty much core for Exelon? Is asset sale or divestitures the source of capital that you may revisit given market conditions?","Christopher M. Crane","So there are some assets on the edge, they're not big assets. There's something in Las Vegas that's historical. There's a few small assets in California that we're looking at divesting. We continue to watch what we're doing in Alberta. But the meaningful assets are all core, and we think that they are undervalued at this point. I mean, you look at our nuclear assets and the implied valuation well under $1,000 of KW. I think anybody would buy it at that price right now. So I don't think we would look at asset divestitures in this devalued state besides those small ones, which won't be meaningful to cash flows.","With that, we're going to wrap up before the music starts again. We apologize for any of the background noise or any of the issues. We actually have everybody spread across all the service territory attending to storm issues. So there's only a small portion of us back in Chicago here now. We'll be at EEI, and we look forward to being able to provide additional modeling information for the company as we address your questions and talk about more of the strategic focus going forward. So we hope all of you in New York, they get you back soon and everybody stay safe, and we'll see you in Scottsdale. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

We had another strong year of operations in 2014, which we are very pleased with given the challenging weather conditions at the start of the year. At the utilities, each OpCo achieved top decile performance for safety and top quartile performance for outage frequency and duration. The nuclear fleet ended the year at 94.2% capacity factor, which this marks our 15th year in a row being over 92%. Gas and hydro power dispatch match was at 97% and our renewable energy capture was at 95%.","On the financial side, we delivered $2.39 a share in line with our recent year full year guidance. Exelon Generation delivered a strong year for performance in what was a volatile year and our generation to load matching strategy drove strong results during an unexpected mild summer. The utilities performed well in light of severe storms and continuing challenging interest rate environment.","2014 was an active year for us. In addition to selling several assets, we continue the process of recycling capital and strengthening our balance sheet. I will highlight some of our major investments for the year. We grew across the enterprise. From the utility growth perspective, we announced the PHI merger and continued on with our infrastructure upgrade plant spending $3.1 billion of utility investment. On the merchant side, we announced the state-of-the-art CCGT newbuild in ERCOT and we added 215 megawatts in nuclear, wind and solar capacity during the year. At Constellation on the retail side, we completed the acquisition of Integrys retail and ProLiance.","We also made investments in adjacent markets in emerging technology to continue to prepare for an evolving marketplace. Bloom Energy and our micro grid investments are good examples of that. We also have a number of major regulatory developments in 2014 that affect both the utilities and the generating business. On the generating side, we have seen progress in Illinois nuclear discussions, with four reports released last month, which highlights the reliability, the economic and the environmental benefits of the nuclear plants to the state. PJM capacity performance proposal has been submitted to FERC. We strongly support the steps being taken to ensure reliability in the region. We expect a continuing discussion on the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan over the next several months.","On the utility front, we had two positive outcomes for ComEd and BGE rate cases. ComEd received 95% or more from our ask on the last three consecutive rate cases. And BGE achieved its first settlement since 1999. And these outcomes highlight our continued commitment to the customers we serve. Bill is going to go into greater detail on the efficacy issues towards the end of the call. These policy initiatives on the horizon present a potential material upside to earnings as value of our fleet is more appropriately recognized by the market. However, I do want to underscore that the management team is focused on EPS growth and our capital deployment efforts. We invest in prudent growth of the utilities where we can add value for our customers. And within our merchant business we look for opportunities to earn robust financial returns. Our recent announcement announced a Peaker in New England is a great example of that. Our continued investments in both utilities and the generation businesses, demonstrates our commitment to long-term growth initiatives across the enterprise that will bring value to our customers and drive future earnings.","Now let me turn it over to Jack to discuss our financial expectations for 2015.","Jack Thayer","Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. We provided information on our fourth quarter financial results in the appendix of today\u2019s materials on Slides 17 and 18. I will spend my time this morning on 2015 earnings guidance and our O&M forecast. Turning to Slide 3, we expect to deliver adjusted operating earnings in the $2.25 to $2.55 range, which is the same as our 2014 guidance and earnings of $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. Our guidance does not include the earnings from the Pepco Holdings acquisition, but does reflect all asset divestitures to-date. As you know we sold several assets last year, the proceeds of which are being used to partially finance the PHI acquisition and to recycle capital on the merchant side of our business. The lost contributions from these divestitures results in an earnings impact of $0.12 per share relative to last year.","In future years there is minimal earnings impact, in particular as capacity revenue from Keystone and Conemaugh runs off. The modest lost earnings from the divested plants will be meaningfully offset by the accretion from our Pepco merger and earnings from other growth projects. For 2015, the earnings impact from these divestitures of $0.12, combined with an additional refueling outage at nuclear of $0.02 and the increased pension and OPEB cost at ExGen of $0.02 are modestly offset by higher capacity prices of $0.07. The full year benefit of the elimination of the DOE fee at Exelon Nuclear of $0.04 and by higher earnings at ComEd of $0.03.","As you know at EEI we gave earnings projections for Exelon for three utilities through 2017. Since that time, we have adjusted the midpoints of that guidance down by a total of $0.05 per share due to the impacts of treasury yields at ComEd and bonus depreciations impact on EPS. We still expect a healthy 5% to 6% CAGR on utility earnings from 2014 to 2017 and the cash benefits from bonus depreciation will help to accelerate and fund utility investments. For reference and deeper analysis more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix on Slides 19 through 22.","As Chris mentioned our capital investment plan is significant and positions us to grow earnings over time. Over the next 5 years we are investing $16 billion in capital at our existing utilities and plan for more than $6 billion of investments at the Pepco utilities. We believe these investments are prudent and will improve reliability and our customers\u2019 experience. As you know the Pepco transaction is expected to add $0.15 to $0.20 per share of earnings on a steady state basis in 2017 and beyond. In addition to growing earnings the Pepco acquisition shifts our earnings mix to a substantially more regulated weighting with 61% to 67% of earnings coming from the regulated side in the 2016 through 2017 period.","On the ExGen front our focus is deploying capital for growth that achieves attractive financial returns and generates both earnings and cash flow. These investments span the energy value chain and include conventional generation like our Texas CCGTs and a new build peaker in New England that cleared the most recent capacity auction and investments in our distributed energy platform. Above and beyond our existing plan, we see additional opportunities and the have free cash flow to deploy capital to earn attractive incremental returns on both the regulated and merchant sides of our business.","Starting in 2016, we expect to have up to $1 billion in incremental annual capacity we can deploy to invest in our utilities, emerging growth and other opportunities. At the utilities, we are evaluating the potential to increase our investments in utility infrastructure, including grid resiliency and security, storm hardening, and new smart grid enabled technologies. Of course, our capital investment in the utilities has to be prudent and help meet the evolving expectations of our customers. These investments will benefit customers by improving reliability and system performance and allow them to better understand and manage their energy usage and costs. At ExGen, capital deployment across the business will be driven by the ability to earn robust financial returns.","Slide 4 shows our 2015 O&M forecast relative to 2014. We project O&M for 2015 to be $7.225 billion, an increase of $275 million over 2014. The increase at ComEd and BGE is due to inflation and increased budgeting for storm costs, which results in incremental year-over-year O&M growth. ExGen\u2019s increase is related to a combination of factors, the inclusion the three months of CENG O&M relative to 2014, an additional planned nuclear outage compared to 2014, increased pension costs and projects at Constellation and Generation, including Integrys and growth in our distributed energy business.","Overall, we expect a basically flat O&M CAGR over the 2015 to 2017 period. We remain disciplined on cost even as we seek to grow our business. Since our presentation at EEI, we have increased our CapEx projections for 2015 across the company by approximately $325 million. The increase is primarily at ExGen and reflects investments to build contracted generation, including an 80-megawatt wind facility in Texas and an up to 50-megawatt biomass plant in Georgia, which we announced yesterday. Additionally, we have increased the 2015 budgeted CapEx for our Texas CCGTs, advancing the timing of the capital spend. The total cost of the project has not changed.","Now, I will turn the call over to Joe Nigro for a discussion of markets and our hedge disclosures.","Joe Nigro","Thanks, Jack and good morning. The Constellation business continues to perform at high levels. We finished 2014 strong and are seeing solid results so far in 2015 as a result of our generation of load matching strategy and our ability [Technical Difficulty] to market. My comments today will address market events during the fourth quarter and what they mean for our commercial business going forward, including our hedging strategy, the New England ISO capacity market results and our updated hedge disclosures.","During the fourth quarter, we experienced a decline in prices across the energy complex as oil and natural gas both realized steep losses in the spot market. Power prices followed gas lower in the second half of the quarter as expectations of extreme weather subsided. The primary driver weighing on prices was the contraction of winter premiums as the markets focus moved away from last year\u2019s Polar Vortex and on to higher natural gas production storage estimates.","NI Hub and West Hub around-the-clock prices were down $1.50 to $3 for calendar years 2016 and \u201817 from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter. In response, we have positioned the portfolio to better align with our fundamental view that we expect to see seasonal power price subside, primarily at NI Hub and began to build a long position into the forward years. This is similar to how we positioned the portfolio the last few years when our fundamental view showed power market upside.","When the market is volatile, our generation of load strategy allows us to optimize the portfolio to lock-in additional value. During the year, we aggressively pursued load-following sales when we observed appropriate risk premiums and increasing margins. We are very highly hedged in 2015 and not impacted from the large downturn in near-term power prices. In fact, we were very aggressive in hedging our PJM East and New England portfolios early in the fourth quarter when higher risk premiums were priced into the market. The remaining length in 2015 is mostly in our Midwest position and focused in the months and time buckets where we believe the forward market is undervalued.","As I mentioned we began to build a long tradition in the forward years because we see upside in our view versus market. During the fourth quarter, we dropped further behind our ratable plan and added approximately 5% to our hedge percentages for 2016 and 2017 versus a normal quarter of 8% sales. The majority of our behind ratable position remains in the Midwest where we continue to see upside in power prices driven by coal retirements. Not only did we adjust our deviation to ratable during the quarter, but we also adjusted our seasonal hedging strategies holding length in undervalued month. We will continue to hold a long position based on our market views.","Last year at this time we talked about hedging with natural gas to take advantage of our bullish view on heat rates. Those views have materialized over the past 12 months. And we have shifted our hedging strategy out of these cross commodity hedges in order to lock in the higher market implied heat rates. In January of last year, natural gas sales represented over 10% of our hedges. Currently they are less than 2% in any given year. Going forward our hedging strategies and positions will continue to reflect where we see upside versus current market prices both from our view of heat rate expansion and natural gas price increases.","We have got a lot of questions recently on oil markets and I would like to spend a minute on what the sharp decline in pricing means for our business. We are not materially impacted by oil pricing mostly due to the fact that our gross margin is primarily driven by a large base load position. However, we do experienced some minor impacts including the potential for lower peak power pricing during heavy load conditions, the potential for lower load growth in ERCOT and lower pricing in our upstream business.","The current pressure on the oil prices is more pronounced in the near-term delivery periods as longer-term prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range still reflects global demand growth. Before I turn to our gross margin update, I want to provide you an update on the recent capacity auction in New England. On February 4, ISO New England released the results of its ninth forward capacity option for the planning year 2018-2019. The clearing price indicate that the new pay for performance capacity construct works. And will attract development of new resources needed in the region. This concludes our recently announced 195 megawatts dual fuel peaking facility at our existing West Medway site, which we expect to have online by December of 2018.","Turning to Slide 6, I will review our updated hedge disclosure and the changes since the end of the third quarter. In 2015, total gross margin is unchanged. The impact of the divestiture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the acquisition of Integrys and the expectation of favorable portfolio performance. We executed on a 100 million of power new business and 50 million of non-powered new business during the quarter. Based on 2015 performance to-date and the expectations for the full year, we have increased our power new business target by an additional $50 million.","For 2016-2017, total gross margin decreased by $200 million and $250 million respectively largely driven by the impact of lower market prices on our open position. The divesture of Keystone and Conemaugh was offset by the addition of Integrys in these years. We also executed on 50 million of both power and non-power new business in 2016. Overall, the commercial business is performing extremely well across all of our business lines. We will continue to implement hedging strategies that reflect our fundamental view of increases in both power and natural gas markets and optimize our portfolio.","Now I will turn it over to Bill.","Bill Von Hoene","Thanks very much Joe and good morning everyone. As Chris referenced in his opening statements, there are a number of developments playing out on the policy front that affect our customers are our businesses. These issues are not necessarily earnings impactful in 2015, but they may have a material impact on the company beyond this year. And so we are going to spend a few minutes this morning sharing with you our perspectives on the issues.","I will start with three issues affecting the generation business in policy space. First on the capacity market reform front that Kris referenced, we have been involved in PJM\u2019s stakeholder process to develop a proposal that will harden the power supply system to help it withstand extreme weather events and ensure reliability for customers. We believe the proposal that now sits before FERC is constructive and if approved will address the gaps in system reliability. The proposal has many similarities to the \u2013 for performance market design, which FERC approved in New England a couple of years ago. It\u2019s a no-excuses approach that provides fair compensation to reliable assets that do perform and penalizes suppliers that do not. We think this is a win-win for our customers and for our generation business. We have invested billions of dollars in our fleet over the years to make it the most reliable set of generating assets in the country and we think that the fleet will fare well in a pay for performance system. All told, we view developments on the capacity reform front as decidedly positive and we are expecting a ruling from FERC by April 1.","Second, let me talk briefly about the discussions that are ongoing in Illinois. As Chris referenced and as you all have seen by now, the state of Illinois report on potential nuclear power plant closings was issued earlier this year in response to House resolution 1146. As stated in that report, the right energy policy for Illinois should guarantee reliability and improve the environment, while creating and retaining jobs, growing the local economy and minimizing cost. It is difficult to envision such a policy, without nuclear as a critical part of the energy mix.","The report offers an independent assessment of the substantial economic, environmental, and reliability benefits that Illinois\u2019 six nuclear plants bring to the state and lays out five options to address the current situation. Establishment of the cap and trade program, imposition of a carbon tax, adoption of a low carbon portfolio standard, adoption of a sustainable power planning standard or reliance on market and external initiatives to make the corrections. We are supportive of any of the options that reward all carbon-free resources equally, but doing nothing simply is not a viable economic option if we are to maintain the operations of those plants that are at risk. As we stated repeatedly, we do not think a bailout. This is about addressing market floss to properly value resources that are of great importance to the State of Illinois. The state has an opportunity to implement, need a change and we will work with policymakers and stakeholders during the coming months to come to an appropriate conclusion soon.","Third, on the generation front, a brief discussion of the environmental policy, as you know the EPA\u2019s clean power draft was issued last year. While it is well-intentioned, it fell short in our view of addressing the importance of nuclear to achieving our national environmental goals. We continue to work on improving the plan. Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the initial proposal, however, we view the environmental discussion as progressing in the right direction. Furthermore, the EPA debate and the states roadmaps to implementing the plan are inextricably linked to the discussion around nuclear energy in Illinois that I just referenced as any solution must contemplate the state\u2019s ability to comply and to do so cost effectively without the clean attributes of nuclear that will be impossible.","The final ruling on the EPA\u2019s plan has been pushed back to later this summer. Like many, we want clarity on the issue. However, we would rather the time be taken for the agency to get this right and design a rational emissions reduction policy for the country than to rush it through. We are confident that the EPA will issue a final rule that appropriately values our assets. The question that arises from all of these pieces is how do they fit together and will the resolution of these three policy issues translate to market-based compensation sufficient to maintain the economic viability of our challenged assets. That is what will play out over the next few months or longer.","In the aggregate and individually, we view these potential policy changes as a positive driver for the Exelon fleet. If the PJM reforms are adopted, this should benefit all of our PJM nuclear assets. However, we have been clear that there is no silver bullet. Each plant has to stand on its own economic merits and it is unlikely that the PJM reforms in isolation will ensure the survival of each plant. One clear example of this is Clinton club, which is not in PJM and therefore will not be properly valued as a result of the PJM capacity market reforms. These plants need to be fairly recognized for both their unparalleled reliability and for their zero carbon attributes. Anything short of that recognition is insufficient and that is why we have been working diligently and simultaneously on all the fronts I have referenced. The fact is there is no other technology that produces reliable, zero carbon electricity. All of the alternatives are intermittent and far more expensive than keeping these plants in operation. Our customers will pay more if these assets are retired prematurely and need to be placed. We think policymakers get this and also understand what it means to lose these plants in terms of jobs and costs. We are optimistic that they will take the steps needed to ensure fair treatment of the units, because it is clearly in the customer\u2019s and the state\u2019s interest to keep these plants open.","Finally, on the regulatory front, let me turn to a non-generation matter, which is of course the PEPCO transaction, which we announced last year. Getting the merger with PEPCO across the finish line is of course a very high priority for the company and things are progressing according to plan. We continue to anticipate a closing sometime in the second or third quarter of this year. We are pleased to have received approval from New Jersey earlier this week. And as you know, we have already received approvals from FERC and the state of Virginia. In Delaware, as noted in the letter to the commission that you have seen, we are close to a settlement. And if the settlement is reached, there may be an adjustment in the schedule. We are continuing the process of review in the remaining jurisdictions of Maryland and Washington DC. We believe the merger is in the public interest and we expect that the combined company to bring significant value to customers given our top-tier operational performance and the merger commitments we have made. We look forward to completing the regulatory process and closing the transaction on schedule.","Thank you. And now, we will open up the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore-ISI.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Jack Thayer","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Jack, can you comment again on the \u2013 to revisit the comments you made on the earnings guidance for the utilities, because as I look at the $0.20 to $0.30 from BGE, $0.35 to $0.45 from PECO and $0.45 to $0.55 from ComEd, if I just take the exact midpoint there, that\u2019s $1.15 versus $1.25 at the midpoint of the eyes that\u2019s a $0.10 delta, not a $0.05 delta? Is there a reason why I am miscalculating that?","Jack Thayer","No, Greg. The $0.05 delta was with respect to 2017. The 2015 guidance to your point is down $0.10. Some of that is just a mere factor of rounding. We speak in terms of $0.05 increments. And would say 2015 guidance is down on a relative basis, $0.05 year-over-year, although the rounding would indicate that is down $0.10, it\u2019s just a matter of how we round it up or round it down our expectations.","Greg Gordon","Okay. So the earnings power out in \u201817 of you three utility businesses is a nickel lower than your prior expectation, not a dime?","Jack Thayer","That\u2019s correct. And I think importantly there, you see the sensitivity we have to interest rates, primarily ComEd, you see the impact of the bonus depreciation, which has the CPS impact of lowering rate based and lowering expected earnings but also is the cash flow and savings related to that is a contributor to the $1 billion of incremental capital we see in \u201816 and beyond that we can deploy to grow both our utilities business as well as our merchant business.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Another question, because I think there is a bit of an apples and oranges going on in terms of the discussion, now that you have given us an earnings guidance for this year, that includes the $0.12 dilution from the generation, from the asset sales that you are using to fund the Potomac transaction. As we roll into \u2013 if we assume that deal closed precisely on 12\/31, is it accretive by $0.15 to $0.20? Is it accretive by $0.15 to $0.20 all things equal off this base or is it more accretive because you are also offsetting the dilution from the asset sales you used to fund the deal?","Jack Thayer","The $0.15 to $0.20 number, Greg, that we referenced incorporates the net dilution associated with the asset sales. That said as I mentioned in the script, the earnings contribution from those assets, while admittedly $0.12 this year, because of the failure of Keystone and Conemaugh to clear capacity markets, the contribution from those assets diminished meaningfully off the curve. The $0.15 to $0.20 that I referenced we would anticipate in 2017, so that\u2019s while you mentioned a close in 12\/31 obviously per Bill\u2019s comments we are anticipating a Q2 and Q3 close. We wouldn\u2019t expect to see that all of that $0.15 to $0.20 until 2017, we will be certainly achieving part of that during the 2016 period.","Greg Gordon","Got it. So, I get it, so the math on the earnings contribution from the assets sold, they would have been significantly less than the $0.12 contributor out in time?","Jack Thayer","Correct.","Greg Gordon","Okay. One more question, just in a little bit of the weeds on the forecast for O&M, you did call out increased O&M predominantly at BGE, ComEd, and ExGen and then you say that through \u201817, you expect 0.2% growth. Specifically at ExGen, as we get out into \u201817 is that growth rate sort of pro rata across all the businesses? Is ExGen\u2019s O&M roughly static, because I know you are adding assets to the mix in \u201817? And I am wondering whether there is a significant increase in O&M associated with that or whether the totality of the O&M is still only growing nominally inclusive of those new asset additions?","Jack Thayer","It\u2019s pretty static, Greg. Certainly, we are adding those assets, the operating cost of which will increase. We added Integrys. We added ProLiance. We have announced in recent months both a waste-digesting plant out in LA, a pulp and biomass facility down in Georgia partnered with P&G. We are looking for incremental opportunities in that space. We are offsetting that in part with activities that we are pursuing broadly across the company to drive lower operating costs both within the embedded businesses \u2013 so Constellation, the power generation business, the nuclear business, as well as our business services corporation. So, on a kind of blended basis, we see relatively flat O&M further out the curve. Obviously, wage inflation is a component of that. Interest rates have been a meaningful factor of that in driving pension costs and the growth in the liabilities side of that higher. So, as CPI oscillates as interest rates move that will continue to be candidly something a little bit outside our control, but obviously something we are trying to focus on other things to offset.","Greg Gordon","Great, thank you guys.","Jack Thayer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse.","Dan Eggers","Hey, good morning, guys.","Jack Thayer","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Eggers","Just following up on Greg\u2019s question on the utility outlook, if you go back to a year ago when you guys gave guidance I think that kind of all these expectations are down about $0.15 today from where they were a year ago. Can you just bridge for me what has changed a year-to-year basis? And then if you thought about interest rates normalizing or pension normalizing, how much of the $0.15 erosion could you reasonably get back?","Jack Thayer","I don\u2019t know that Dan I can track you back to year end of 2013, but clearly you have seen a material degradation in the interest rate environment. As an example in 2014, the average 30-year was 3.34%. The interest rate for 30 years today is 2.63%. So, just with even \u2013 even within on an average basis of full year, the continued decline of interest rates and\/or sensitivity to that through the formula rates at ComEd has been significant. For sensitivity, say 25 basis points up or down, and the interest rate is $9 million improvement or detriments to our expected revenues at ComEd. Obviously, the same element is impacting us from a pension liability side marry that with a change in the mortality tables and longer expected lives of our pension and OPEB participants. And that is a headwind \u2013 and that\u2019s a headwind that we pass through, through the formula rate within ComEd. But we have to go through rate cases at PECO, and we have to go through a rate cases at BGE to recapture that. So, and then I guess the final element that\u2019s changed, I think is given our load sensitivity of PECO and given some of our longer term load sensitivity of BGE and ComEd as we have continued to experience zero, and in some instances negative load growth that\u2019s been a headwind as well.","That said, we continue to see meaningful opportunities to deploy capital in that space. We see an opportunity to drive our customers\u2019 reliability and experience. And importantly we see opportunities to earn a fair rate of return in those businesses. And as we are delivering and evolving a ray of services of our customer, even perhaps improve upon what we allowed to earn.","Dan Eggers","Okay, got it. And I guess, just kind of on the deployment of capital conversation, what are you guys seeing in the ERCOT markets at this point in time underlying the new build decision, it seems like sparks have eroded since those plans were announced and obviously with maybe an economic slowdown, because of oil and gas drilling, there is a little bit of concern in the market, I suppose over demand growth?","Ken Cornew","Yes, Dan, it\u2019s Ken. We are very comfortable with our decision to invest in our combined cycle plants in Texas, and there are several reasons for it. First, the technology we have chosen, we think puts us in a significant competitive advantage. Again, as you know with the position in the stack, we would have as well the ramping capability in the units also cost advantage, given we own these sites. We have advantaged cost position that we don\u2019t think it would be matched in the market. Importantly, we made this investment on our long-term fundamental views. And without talking about a re-assumption in our fundamental views, they are not \u2013 they are not drastically different than the environment we are seeing right now. We didn\u2019t \u2013 we didn\u2019t make a bet on massive load growth in Texas. We are very conservative in our assumptions. And the last thing I will say Dan is we have a significant load business in Texas as well. And having these plans and this capability and matching that capability with our load business is something, I think you are seeing it right now. We have proven that that is the value proposition that Exelon brings to table. And we expect that the investment in these plants will really enhance that value proposition in Texas.","Dan Eggers","Okay. Thanks, Ken. And I guess Bill can you just walk us through what kind of a timeline we need to see in Illinois as far as draft legislation on carbon action and kind of progression to get something done before the recess in the summer.","Bill Von Hoene","Yes, Dan. As you know the recess is scheduled or at least currently scheduled for the end of the May. And what we anticipate is that legislation consistent with the policy solutions outlined in the 1146 report will be introduced in the general assembly sometime within the next month. We are actively working with legislators, regulators and stakeholders with that in mind. So I would expect to see something surface within the next month and that will give ample time for the legislator to consider it. There will be hearings related to 1146 or possibly to the legislation specifically that will accompany that. But if this gets introduced as we anticipate within that next 30 days or so, it will give an opportunity to go through the full discourse in the legislature before the recess in May.","Dan Eggers","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Yes, good morning, guys.","Chris Crane","Good morning.","Jonathan Arnold","Quick one first, just on Illinois and following up on Dan\u2019s question, is there a sponsor that has emerged or sponsor of this or are you still kind of working that out?","Bill Von Hoene","There is \u2013 Jonathan, there has been nothing publicly announced. There will be a significant number of sponsors and it will be bipartisan, but that won\u2019t be revealed until the legislation itself is actually announced.","Jonathan Arnold","Well, as you have said, you are expecting it to be broadly supported?","Bill Von Hoene","Correct. We anticipate Republican and Democratic sponsors in significant numbers.","Jonathan Arnold","In both houses or is it going to sort of emerge in one house and then go to the other?","Bill Von Hoene","The mechanics, it is not yet been determined what the mechanics will be, but there will be adequate support and sponsorship in both houses to run it through the legislature.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. And then if I could also just revisit the question on the regulated guidance, I am sorry to do this, but Jack when I look at the $1.11 starting point for 2014, which was pretty consistent with the EEI slide and your statement that 2017 is only down by a nickel in the midpoint, which would imply $1.35 versus $1.40. I think where I am having confusion is that you had said \u2013 you called that an 8% CAGR at EEI, but now you are saying 5% to 6%, but seems to me that the $1.11 to the $1.35 would be more like 6% to 7%. And 5% to 6% implies a bigger reduction. Can you speak to that at all?","Jack Thayer","I think Jonathan we are talking about 100 basis points. And to be candid, the rounding issue comes into play. So, I think I would focus more on the $0.05 of degradation from EEI\u2019s 2017 expectation to where we sit today. And some of that is an issue of the timing of capital deployment and other elements and I think we feel good about 5% to 6% growth. Ideally, we will endeavor to deliver higher growth that $1 billion of incremental spend in \u201816 and beyond is potentially a driver of that incremental growth.","Jonathan Arnold","But the $0.05 is what we should really focus on?","Jack Thayer","Yes.","Jonathan Arnold","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fleishman from Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","Yes, hi, thank you. So not to beat a dead horse with that, does your viewpoint on the utility include any of the $1 billion being reinvested in it or is that, that would now be in additive?","Jack Thayer","No, its additive.","Steven Fleishman","Great.","Jack Thayer","Incremental.","Steven Fleishman","Thanks. And then just with respect to the Illinois legislation, I know there is other aspects of this, not just on nuclear plants. So, maybe you could give us a little bit of better sense of what else might be addressed in this legislation. I am assuming it\u2019s also kind of renewables, but is there other aspects that would likely be in this?","Bill Von Hoene","Steve, this is Bill. The legislation that we are referencing in the nuclear is standalone for the time being. There are going to be undoubtedly additional energy-related initiatives. There was a group that convened last week called the Clean Jobs Coalition, which was an environmentally directed group of a number of agencies and entities, which indicated that they will introduce legislation that will relate to energy efficiency to renewable standards and also to a cap and invest system that would be implemented in connection with 111(d). So, we anticipate that, that will be legislatively active and there undoubtedly will be a variety of other things that will be considered as well.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And just lastly and maybe to Joe on your kind of point of view in your hedging, it sounds just to kind of clarify, it sounds like you are particularly focused on future NI Hub prices being too low. Is that fair?","Joe Nigro","Yes, Steve. I think there is two elements. I think you are correct when you think about the expansion opportunities, heat rates I think that\u2019s primarily in NI Hub. I think from our perspective as well, we actually see upside to the natural gas markets, especially this maybe to a lesser extent in \u201816 and more so as you move out into \u201817 and \u201818 on the back of demand pickup and where prices are today and that would be true, for example, both at West Hub and NI Hub. You can see in the quarter that we sold less than our ratable plan, approximately 5% of our portfolio \u2013 total portfolio, whereas an average quarter, we would sell about 8% and we rotated out of a lot of the gas shorts that we had because of the big heat rate move we had. So, as we move forward as we build a position that falls behind ratable, it\u2019s going to be done more on a, I\u2019ll call it a flat-priced basis, where we are just going to take the power that we would have normally sold and just hold it in our portfolio and we will tailor that to locations and time buckets. NI Hub will be a big piece of that, but we will be looking at other areas as well depending on what we see in the gas market.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hi, good morning.","Jack Thayer","Good morning.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, I wanted to ask a little bit of a bigger picture question here around the direction of the company vis-\u00e0-vis utility versus merchant. And as you think about that decision point, you have obviously made a couple of decisions over the past years, PEPCO namely, how were you thinking about positioning the company towards the merchant side of the business, specifically as you think about, a) potentially expanding nuclear and then b) specifically expanding into Texas, are either of those avenues palatable or desirable under a merchant expansion? And then more broadly, is a merchant expansion desirable at this point in time?","Jack Thayer","So, we continue to look at both sides. The utility business as we talked about we can operate the utilities well. We can drive efficiencies in. We can improve the customer experience while we are getting returns. We are in a unique situation with ComEd on the formula rate at some historically low interest rates. We are not running from the investment \u2013 the utility business. We think interest rates will normalize and will be at the right place for the return. So, we will continue to make prudent investments and operate the utilities well there.","On the merchant side, it\u2019s all about the value proposition in looking at the specific investments. If a nuclear plant came available and we could fold it into the portfolio and see our adequate returns, we would certainly have the scale and the scope to put one in. We don\u2019t see any out there right now, but newbuild is not an option. So, that\u2019s the only way we get as acquisition. As we have said before, we do think Texas is one of the more interesting markets to invest in right now, and that\u2019s why we are proceeding with organic growth down there. We do look at assets that come up from time-to-time in the ERCOT market. Most have been overvalued from our perspective on the long-term fundamentals. That\u2019s why building these new technology units makes more sense to us.","So, we will continue to look for opportunities on both sides of the business and use the balance sheet prudently to make the investments, but one thing that we \u2013 in the last couple of years as we do our asset valuations on an annual basis, recycling capital has become a focus and we will continue to watch that. If we see assets and others have more value and we can deploy that capital into other arenas, we will not be \u2013 we will not be shy of any divestiture. And that\u2019s what we did this year with divesting assets and having the opportunity to use that capital into what we think is something that would be strategically valuable for us with PEPCO and also having the \u2013 creating the new balance sheet space to make the investments in new unit. So, we were still very confident in the model and confident in the investment thesis. And if low interest rates are hard on pensions and they are hard on the formula rates, but in the long run we see those coming back and we still think it\u2019s a good investment in CC.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Alright, great. And then secondly, if you can comment more specifically around Ginna in New York, obviously there has been some development there, what\u2019s your latest expectations if you can elaborate?","Bill Von Hoene","Chris you want me to take that?","Chris Crane","Joe is going to grab it.","Bill Von Hoene","Thanks.","Joe Dominguez","Julien, this is Joe Dominguez. We continue negotiating the RSSA with our counterparties up there in New York. I think you will see developments become public on that within the next few days to a week.","Julien Dumoulin-Smit","Got it, fair enough. Thank you. Good luck.","Joe Dominguez","Thanks.","Chris Crane","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Good morning.","Chris Crane","Good morning.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to \u2013 I think I had heard that on the call that Keystone and Conemaugh had not cleared in the PJM auction, and if that\u2019s correct, I wondered if you can just elaborate on the rational, I thought of those as large well-operating co-plants, I am just curious what was the driver behind that?","Joe Nigro","And Stephen, this is Joe. Good morning. There are a couple of reasons for that. First of all, as you know into the mechanisms afforded in the PJM model, you can calculate an avoided cost rate on each of your units. And we take the opportunity with our fossil units in particular and all of our fossil units to do that. And that\u2019s just what I\u2019d call our cost base line. And recognizing what we need from a cost perspective on those units we take that into account in our bidding strategy. And we have a host of other assets that we have to look at in particular to make sure that we are looking this in a proper sense from a total portfolio basis. And in the way that math worked for Keystone and Conemaugh in particular, it just didn\u2019t clear given where the clearing prices were today for that particular option.","Ken Cornew","So, Steven just a little to add to that, this is Ken, there are substantial costs at the plant associated with the environmental upgrades. That associated with the avoid the energy benefits that were very low from that 2009 to 2013 period drove the avoided cost rates up at those plants. And as we said before we \u2013 the market works when participants bid their costs, and that\u2019s what we do.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, great. Thank you. And just shifting to the utility, in terms of achieving the growth rates that you have laid out, what kind of low growth assumptions sort of your latest thinking that\u2019s driving that growth?","Chris Crane","Denis, do you get that?","Denis OBrien","Yes, Chris. The load growth is really flat to slightly positive for the next few years. What we are seeing for the last couple was flat to slightly negatively. We see the next 5 years or so, flat to slightly positive.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, great. And the change in terms of the outlook from flat to \u2013 negative to flat to positive, what\u2019s your \u2013 just at a high level view of what would drive that improvement in load growth?","Denis OBrien","I think it\u2019s just the general economic health of the each of the service territories that we serve.","Stephen Byrd","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our final question comes from Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein.","Hugh Wynne","Thanks. The $435 million asset impairment charge in this quarter, how do you breakdown between Keystone, Conemaugh and upstream assets and others?","Jack Thayer","Hugh, the total of overall long-live assets impairments that we had during the year, we had a wind impairment that was $0.06. We had a lease impairment that was $0.02. We had Quail Run assets held for sale impairment of $0.04. Keystone and Conemaugh was $0.29 of that. Upstream was $0.09 for a total of $0.50. On the flip side of that, we had $0.28 of gains related to the sale of Safe Harbor, sale of Fore River, again on the sale of West Valley. So, overall on a net basis, it\u2019s about $0.22 negative impact on the year.","Hugh Wynne","Okay. And then my question is for Bill. Bill, though you\u2019re lawyer and you are talking about the potential implications of the Clean Power Plan EPS and Clean Power Plan, I just want to get your views as to the likelihood that the plan survives at all. I understand there has been challenges as to whether EPA has a authority to regulate CO2 under 111(d) at the \u2013 in the first place. And then secondly if it does, whether that authority extends to energy efficiency and renewables is this Clean Power Plan going to be with us in the long run or do you think it\u2019s going to be whittled down or overturned altogether?","Bill Von Hoene","Well, one thing that we can be abundantly certain of is that there will be litigation respecting whatever the final rule will be. But the basic tenants, Hugh, of the underpinnings of the rule are legally sound. The ability to regulate carbon emission has been already ruled upon by the United States Supreme Court and our expectation is that there will be litigation and there maybe modifications that result from that, but the basic underpinning of the rule will survive and will have the impact that will be significant in that scope.","Hugh Wynne","Right, thank you very much.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to our presenters.","Jack Thayer","So, thank you very much everybody for joining. As we laid out from an operation standpoint, very strong year, we continue to run well, continue to watch costs and contain where we can. The Constellation, the Generation business has done a very good job in this marketplace and we continue to see \u2013 feel very strong that, that will be continue to be supported. The utility side, the utilities are operating well as I said. We see the investment thesis as right. We know the sensitivity to the interest rates, but don\u2019t think that\u2019s a long-term sustainable issue and we will continue to keep investing. Thanks.","Operator","This will be the end of today\u2019s call.

My name is Tierra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2013 earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Ganti, you may begin your conference.","Ravi Ganti","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I welcome you to Exelon's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. In case you did not receive it, the release is available on Exelon's investor website.","The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and the actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of the factors that may cause the results to differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings.","Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and CEO; Ken Cornew, Exelon's Chief Commercial Officer and President, CEO of Exelon Generation; and Jack Thayer, Exelon's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's management team, who will be available to answer your questions following the prepared remarks. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher M. Crane","Thanks, Ravi. Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us this morning. Operationally, we had another strong quarter with great performance in both the utilities and the entire generation fleet. Financially, the third quarter was strong and results were higher than our guidance range.","The third quarter operating earnings were $0.78 per share. Jack's going to cover that in more detail in his remarks. Low commodity prices, low load growth and tough retail margins continue to challenge our industry. While these challenges are mostly beyond our control, we are leveraging our core competencies to control what we can and influence what we cannot. We're focused on operational excellence, regulatory advocacy, financial discipline and investment that provides value to our shareholders.","As I said, operationally, we had a good quarter and we're having a very good year. Once again, our generation fleet performed at high levels. For the quarter, the nuclear fleet ran at 94.8% capacity factor, and during the summer period had a 97.4% capacity factor. The fossil and renewable fleet had a strong quarter as well. In particular, the fossil, hydro fleet performed at exceptional level with a dispatch match rate of 99.1%.","The utility performance remains very solid. All 3 utilities year-to-date improved on the customer satisfaction index year-over-year, and in some case -- places, we're reaching our highest numbers that we've seen in over a decade. No major storms did contribute to this favorable quarter for the utilities.","On the regulatory advocacy side, we continued to push on many fronts. The rate case for ComEd and BGE are on schedule, with decisions expected in December for both. On the RPM stakeholder process, we continue to work with PJM and other stakeholders on improving the capacity market rules. The stakeholders are discussing reforms in the area of reducing speculation, demand response and imports. PJM has committed and continues to commit to propose tariff reforms to FERC in time to take effect before the next auction in May.","We are very pleased with the federal court decision on the New Jersey LCAPP program. Combined with the decision in Maryland, these decisions uphold the principles of the competitive electric markets by finding state programs such as the subsidizing certain power generation -- generators are unconstitutional.","Our financial discipline is key to our success. With rightsizing the dividend early in the year, our balance sheet remains strong and provides us with the flexibility to make investments in challenging times. We continue to look at ways to strengthen it further. For example, the work that has been done in completing the Continental Wind off-balance sheet financing that was closed earlier this quarter. We believe project financing allows us to grow the business in a credit-supportive manner, and again, Jack's going to cover more of that in his -- details in his remarks.","On the investment side, we continue to invest in our regulated and merchant businesses to drive value for the shareholders. On the utility side, we are growing rate base with investments in gas infrastructure, transmission and distribution systems and the Smart Grid and smart meter installations.","On the smart meters, the installation of the projects at all 3 utilities are underway in 2013. BGE has installed over 4,000 -- 426,000 meters through the third quarter. PECO is at 465,000 meters, and the ComEd smart meter deployment began in September is off to a good start, installing nearly 10,000 meters in the first month.","At Exelon Generation, we've installed 153 megawatts of solar capacity as part of the AVSR to date. There are 2 blocks that have been delayed due to issues on the construction. Jack's going to talk about the impacts on capital and revenue on that when he -- we go through his comments.","So for the full year guidance, given our year-to-date performance, our expectations for the balance of the year, we are narrowing the full range guidance from $2.35 to $2.65 to $2.40 to $2.50 per share. Now I'll turn it over to Ken who will discuss the hedge disclosure and put some color on how we're incorporating the gas basis into our hedging.","Kenneth W. Cornew","All right. Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, I'll cover changes in natural gas basis and how we incorporate these risks while we hedge our portfolio, as well as our hedge disclosure.","If you turn to Slide 3, I'll turn to Exelon Generations results this year and the outlook for the next 2 years. Challenges we have faced over the past year have continued over the third quarter, with natural gas modestly down across all years, power prices mixed across all regions and years, key grades modestly increased in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, very little volatility outside of ERCOT and the retail competition continues to be aggressive. These factors all combined to put further pressure on our ability to extract margin to our wholesale and retail businesses.","To offset these pressures, we've mentioned $100 million reduction in 2013 O&M during the second quarter call. As seen on Slide 3, for 2013, the total reduction in gross margin from last quarter is $50 million. While prices were lower, especially in ERCOT, where summer peak prices came in lower than forecast, our hedge position and execution of $100 million in our new business target provided an offset to the open gross margin decrease of $150 million.","Unfortunately, the lack of volatility in other regions and our outlook for the remainder of the year has caused us to reduce our expectations for incremental margin from our commercial business. Our non-power business continues to ratably transition from our to-go bucket to our executed bucket.","It's important to note that we expect this $50 million reduction in 2013 to be offset by cost reductions, and Jack will be highlighting these a bit more as he discusses our full year guidance.","In '14 and '15, our disclosure indicates a reduction of $50 million for each year in the total gross margin. In 2014, the open gross margin saw a decrease due to the significant peaks part spreads drop in ERCOT, as well as a reduction in the expected output from our wind assets. This was offset in our mark-to-market of hedges by the execution of some of our power new business to go.","In 2015, our gross margin was impacted by price decreases in nearly all regions on our open position.","As you've heard us say for the last few quarters, the retail space is extremely competitive and challenged. We have remained disciplined and have not gone after volume for the sake of volume and have maintained appropriate margin on our sales. We have not seen anything in the market to lead us to believe that we have turned the corner and are headed for growth in this business, and the guidance we gave previously on retail volumes and margins still stands.","While we expect little to change, we will provide an update to our volumes at EEI. As we've mentioned to you earlier, we'll be providing you the details of our 2016 hedge position and gross margin estimates at EEI in a couple of weeks.","If I had to make a statement directionally about what you'll see, I would say our gross margin estimates will largely be unchanged year-over-year, except for value of our hedges, which is simply a reflection of the amount of hedging we've done for '16 so far this year.","Going to Slide 4. As you know, the impacts of shale gas on the United States energy industry are immense. We have seen the prompt-month price of Henry Hub natural gas fall from its highs of $13 in 2008 down to $2 in 2012. The decline in natural gas prices has had a corresponding impact on power prices.","Much of this gas comes from the Marcellus Shale formation, which largely lies within the footprint of the PJM power grid. The surge in natural gas production has caused a fundamental shift in the pricing structure of gas in the Mid-Atlantic location, sometimes referred to as basis from a premium price area to a discount area.","The discount is in relation to Henry Hub, the primary trading point of U.S. natural gas. The Henry Hub location has historically traded at a discount to the Northeast region due to its formerly significant gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and conduits of pipelines.","The surge in gas production in the Marcellus has caused this relationship to reverse. With the rapid expansion of production within Marcellus, we've begun to see what was once approximately a $0.60 premium at M3 to Henry Hub in 2010 move to a discount of approximately $0.25.","This change in basis in the basis relationship was expected and has been in steady decline over the last few years. Over the next several years, we anticipate new pipelines to be built and some pipelines to reverse, enabling the surplus to be moved to higher-priced areas.","This will work in tandem with all other factors that will impact the market such as expanding LNG exports, exports to Mexico, industrial expansion and gas demand for power generation. The combination of these factors will stabilize Mid-Atlantic basis and support our fundamental view that natural gas will trade between $4 and $6 in MMBtu between 2017 to 2020.","Over the last several quarters, our hedging profile has tracked at or ahead of ratable in PJM East. This has limited the impact of the basis move on our portfolio. Although Chicago basis has also been weaker recently, this had a minimal impact on PJM power prices at NiHub. We believe the size of the basis discount seen in the East will not be seen in the Midwest. This view is primarily driven by global supply and demand and pipeline capabilities for natural gas in the Midwest.","We continue to stay behind ratable in our PJM Midwest power portfolio because of our view that heat rates will expand. Now I'll turn it over to Jack to review the full financial information for the quarter.","Christopher M. Crane","Before we go to Jack, I need to correct one thing I said. I said the range was going to $2.40 to $2.50. That's $2.40 to $2.60 is the new range.","Kenneth W. Cornew","Thank you, Chris.","Jonathan W. Thayer","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. I'll review the third quarter financial results, our full year guidance range, key events of the quarter and our balance sheet and cash flow outlook, starting on Slide 5.","As Chris mentioned earlier, Exelon's results for the quarter exceeded our expectations. Operating earnings for the third quarter of this year were $0.78 per share, well above our Q3 guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share.","Compared to our guidance, favorability at both ExGen and our utilities drove us well above the range. While we expected to be at the upper end of the range provided, we continue to limit costs, resulting in lower-than-planned O&M across all our businesses. We are realizing merger synergies faster than forecast and that is helping results.","The utilities accounted for just over 1\/2 of the savings compared to guidance. As Ken alluded to earlier, the full year 2013 RNF production shown in the hedge disclosures was offset by ExGen, with lower O&M and interests. The lower O&M was driven by reduced O&M costs related to outages of power and lower labor and benefit costs.","Across our operating companies, some of the reduced spending were onetime benefits, quite fewer than expected large storms, and others may reverse in the fourth quarter, but in general, our focus and execution on cost management helped drive these results.","The $0.78 compares to our operating earnings of $0.77 per share during the third quarter of 2012. The quarter-over-quarter difference was largely driven by improved performance at our utilities, specifically at BGE and ComEd. I will go into greater detail on the quarter drivers in a few minutes.","As Chris mentioned, for the full year, we are narrowing our guidance range to $2.40 to $2.60 per share from our previous guidance of $2.35 to $2.65 per share. With our strong year-to-date performance at the utilities, we are bringing up the bottom of our range.","When we look at the fourth quarter, we see some unfavorability and gross margin expectations from our Constellation business, as shown in the hedge disclosures and addressed by Ken during his remarks. As I mentioned earlier, we were able to offset those reductions with cost savings.","Additionally, since our second quarter earnings call, we had delays in 2 blocks at our Antelope Valley Solar projects, moving their in-service date and the related portion of our expected investment tax credit into the next year. Overall, we're confident that we can deliver 2013 results comfortably within the revised full year guidance range.","Please turn to Slide 6. Turning to Exelon Generation on Slide 6. ExGen's results were $0.05 per share lower quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by lower RNF due to lower realized energy prices. This was partially offset by higher capacity prices, favorable nuclear performance, lower income tax, primarily due to AVSR investment tax credit benefits and lower O&M costs due to merger synergies.","Before I turn to the quarterly earnings for the utilities on Slide 7, let me provide a brief update on our load forecast. In general, we saw a slight dip in our load expectations for the full year compared to the update I've provided on last quarter's call. This decrease was largely driven by lower residential usage during the summer and some uncertainty about the economy heading into the fourth quarter, driven by the recent government shutdown.","Our overall load growth yield is still very modest and virtually flat for the full year 2013 when excluding the impact of RG Steel's bankruptcy for BGE. More detail on the utility load can be found in the appendix on Slide 19.","ComEd's earnings increased $0.05 per share compared to earnings in the prior period last year. This is primarily driven by the benefits of higher distribution revenue due to recovery of pension costs, additional investments that resulted in a growing rate base and higher ROE from a rise in treasury rates. These are partially offset by unfavorable weather compared to the third quarter of 2012 when Northern Illinois experienced above-average heat.","PECO's earnings decreased $0.03 per share compared to the earnings in the prior period last year. This decrease is a result of onetime items that occurred last year, with favorable weather and a benefit from the gas distribution tax repairs deduction not repeating this year.","BGE's earnings increased $0.06 per share compared to the earnings in the prior period last year. The combination of lower storm costs without the direction of storm from July 2012 and improved electric and gas rates helped improve BGE's quarter-over-quarter earnings.","Third quarter saw further progress for the utilities in the regulatory and legislative arena. During this quarter, BGE filed its Strategic Infrastructure Development and Enhancement, or STRIDE, plan to accelerate the modernization of its natural gas distribution system.","In addition, ComEd and BGE continued with their rate case proceedings that were filed earlier this year. The ComEd distribution formula rate filing requests an increase of $353 million, which reflects actual 2012 expenses and investments and forecasted 2013 capital additions to our distribution network. We expect a decision by year end, with the new rates going into effect in January of 2014. Additional information on the ComEd rate filing can be found on Slide 20 in the appendix.","BGE's ongoing rate case with the Maryland PSC requests an increase of $86.2 million for electric and $24.4 million for gas, adjusted for the actual data submitted in August of this year. We expect the final order in mid-December with new rates going into effect shortly thereafter. BGE rate case details are shown on Slide 21 of the presentation.","Slide 8 provides an update of our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of $5.8 billion. This is up from last quarter by about $225 million. The primary driver of the increase was favorable working capital at ExGen, mainly driven by higher accounts payable related to the AVSR project delays.","Our CapEx forecast is decreased by $70 million from last quarter, mainly due to the AVSR construction delay I mentioned earlier and some lower-than-projected spend at the utilities. That decrease was partially offset by additional wind and non-AVSR solar project spend.","Our current 5-year plan includes $16 billion in growth CapEx, with approximately $13.5 billion of that at the utilities where we have the ability to earn a stable rate of return.","On the financing side, we have long-term debt issuances at both ComEd and PECO during the third quarter. In August, ComEd issued $350 million of 30-year bonds with an annual interest rate of 4.6%. In September, PECO's bond issuance was for $550 million, including $300 million of 3-year bonds with a 1.2% annual interest rate and $250 million of 30-year bonds with a 4.8% annual interest rate. We do not anticipate any additional long-term bond issuances during the remainder of the year.","Our expected financing cash flows are $150 million lower than what we provided in our second quarter update, with the decrease largely driven by a reduced AVSR Department of Energy loan draw given the construction delays I previously referenced.","On Slide 9, in late September, Exelon completed the largest-ever wind finance transaction, Continental Wind, a 667-megawatt portfolio of 13 projects located in 6 states and across 5 different wind regimes. Issued $613 million of project finance bonds with a 6% coupon maturing in February 2033. Net proceeds were dividended up to Exelon Generation. This financing is nonrecoursed to Exelon and solely dependent on the cash flows of Continental. The transaction is consistent with our previously communicated strategy to use project financing as a means of strengthening ExGen and Exelon's credit metrics.","As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you on your modeling efforts. Now I'll turn the call back to Chris for his concluding remarks before we open the call for Q&A.","Christopher M. Crane","Thanks, Jack. There have been a few reports in the past month commenting on the impact of the lower gas and power prices on our earnings. I think these reports all assume that we'll sit on our hands and not take any action and the market participants will not rationalize their behavior. In fact, we continue to take a hard look at our assets and determine their economic viability. We will shut down facilities that we do not see a path to a long-term sustainable profitability.","We've built our record on reducing costs and improving productivity of our business, which is shown in the $550 million of synergies from our merger, exceeding our original estimate. Our hedging portfolio -- we are hedging our portfolio to reflect our fundamental view of the market and that it will improve.","We continue to look for opportunities to grow. We'll continue to advocate for public policies and market designs that properly compensate our fleet, victories in the court and legislative regulatory fronts that will support our pricing. We'll continue to optimize the use of capital structures, different capital structures like the Continental Wind project financing and our current view of some of the analysts on Exelon's expect performance is not where -- excuse me, the current view of some of the analysts on Exelon expected performance is not where we see it to be. We believe that the analysts have it very wrong, and we would like to change that.","With that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","You guys have been doing a good job on the cost side. Can you tell me, I think we've been assuming that total O&M and TOTI at ExGen, if you include CNG of around $5 billion, but given the headway that you've made on costs this year, could you tell us what the right run rate is as we go into 2014?","Christopher M. Crane","Greg, as you mentioned, we have pulled a substantial amount of costs out and we will update on our O&M at EEI. But I think it's safe to assume we are in the midst of our 5-year planning process that we're targeting flat O&M across the business plan at ExGen.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question is, and this goes to the statement you made earlier and I think that you reiterated, there's a view that this negative gas basis that we're seeing in Pennsylvania is going to migrate west as this REX pipeline partially puts around. Can you go into a little bit more detail why you feel like the expectation that negative basis permeates West is incorrect?","Joseph Nigro","Greg, it's Joe Nigro. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first is I think you're right, we do expect the REX pipeline to move gas out to the Mid-Atlantic into the Midwest. Historically, we have seen the need for inflows to the Midwest area of natural gas to meet the demand and that, historically, come out of Canada in the Gulf Coast. We would expect to see the displacement from the gas moving in from the Mid-Atlantic and displacing that gas that, historically, has come out Canada and the Gulf. I think the other important point to mention though, Greg, is that gas basis is one component of it. When you look at our -- when we look at our fundamental forecasting and do all the puts and takes of what we expect from a generation change perspective over the next few years, you still only have gas on the margin a lot less than we do in the Mid-Atlantic. So the impact on the gas basis change when we see a $0.25 change in gas basis lower, for example, the impact on power pricing is less than $0.25 a megawatt-hour. So when you convert that to power, the impact isn't nearly as great.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Final question for Chris, and I don't know how much of this you want to answer, but obviously, also, a lot has been written about the potential for further consolidation in PJM. You guys have done a remarkably good job notwithstanding the bad overall macroeconomic environment of making the best of your merger with Constellation. Would you try to -- do you think that in Exelon's future, there's further consolidation, given your -- how you've refined your expertise in managing costs and optimizing portfolios?","Christopher M. Crane","Greg, we've continually supported further consolidation in the industry not only across PJM where it can be done but in other RTOs also. We have a small group that's constantly looking at value-accretive potentials and will continue to look at that as we go forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Chris, I guess, just kind of following up at the end of your comments. You kind of talked about the idea that looking at the fleet and rationalizing assets if they don't make sense or you don't see a recovery as you guys expect. How do you frame out the timing of making these kind of decisions relative to kind of the long-standing internal point of view that market conditions are going to recover?","Christopher M. Crane","So we think through 2014 into the first part of 2015, we should see the uplift in the market. If we have it wrong, then we -- there's some assets that we'll have to look at for the long-term profitability. And that would be around the timeframe that I think it will be a very serious conversation taking place.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","[indiscernible] to be about 12 months from now is kind of the time horizon you think that would be the kind of the natural progression you see a recovery?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes.","Dan Eggers - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, you guys had talked previously about your freeing up some capital because of the dividend reduction earlier this year, the idea of potentially buying more assets or getting more contracted assets. Could you just share your thinking on, A, what you're seeing in those markets? And B, what are some downward pressure on your -- at the upper end of your open gross margins and ExGen? Is that going to have a bearing on the timing and maybe deploying that capital?","Christopher M. Crane","Jack, you want to go [indiscernible]?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Sure. So, Dan, you've heard us speak about the reduction in the dividend gives us between $1 billion and $2 billion of balance sheet space or growth capital that we could use and deploy. As we look at various markets and assets, interestingly, you're seeing, in certain markets, very attractive pricing from an ownership standpoint in ERCOT, and obviously, we're a very major owner that isn't necessarily translating into perceived value into our merchant fleet. In other markets, there've been recent transactions in New England, as well, at attractive values. And as you know, through our Boston Gen acquisition, we are a significant owner in that region as well. There hasn't been a lot. I would say there has been a whole lot of speculation about PJM. There hasn't been any actual assets. And so we'll watch, as will others, as other companies may look to strategically realign to a more regulated footprint.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","First question for Ken. I think, Ken, you mentioned briefly you'll be giving a '16 margin information, and I think you said '16 will be kind of flattish with '15. Is that on an open basis open gross margin?","Kenneth W. Cornew","Steve, I would say, if you look at our hedge disclosure and go down the lines between '15 and '16, we will relatively see flat '15 to '16 in open in several other areas. I would say we have a mark-to-market of hedges in '15 that's $450 million. We have been hedging 2016 and we have positive mark-to-market value at those hedges as well. And I just wanted to make sure you all were thinking about that and we'll go into much more detail at EEI in a couple of weeks.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, but is the flattish more open or could it even be on a hedge margin?","Kenneth W. Cornew","The flattish is open in several areas. On the hedge, there is a lower hedge mark-to-market of hedges in '16 and '15, but it's not drastic. We have positive mark-to-market value, and like I said, I'd like to go through that more detail at EEI.","Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then, Chris, just your comment at the end of the call that the -- your view that the analysts have it wrong with all the recent downgrades. How much -- when you say that, how much of that is the analysts have the kind of power market view wrong versus if the power market stays just as it is, that you can continue to do more to make sure Exelon handles the conditions better? Could you just give a little color where you see people having it wrong?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes, I'll start and we'll let Ken continue to fill in the blanks. When we talked about this upside in 2015 with the 22,000 -- 2,200 gigawatts -- 22 gigawatts coming out, there has to be a market rationalization of that, there's a tightening of the stack. We have gone back and the team is in process of modeling assets by asset again in the stack to make sure we have it right. We'll have more details on that at EEI, which -- Ken, do you want to fill in?","Kenneth W. Cornew","Hey, Greg, I think we're making -- I'm sorry, Steve. Steve, we're making a couple of comments there. Chris talked about what we see as upside, and I sound like a broken record when I do this, but I'm going to do it again. In 2013, so far, at NiHub, we're seeing an 8.6 heat rate. We're seeing close to $32 power prices. And then when you look out the curve, you see sub-$31 prices until 2016, with contango in gas and you see heat rates that are a full point lower. We have -- we scrubbed and continue to scrub our modeling of coal retirements. We look at all the announcements and the activity that's going on in the market, whether it's a plants that -- some may think we're retiring and are now being converted to natural gas, whether it's some plants that a lot of people didn't think are retiring that are retiring. And we've actually, given the latest information we've seen on coal plants, we actually are a little more bullish in our analytics about our $2 to $4 upside. We quite frankly have been conservative and has some plants running on coal long term that now have been announced to either being converted to gas, which will take them out of the stack -- take them up the stack and not running nearly as much or actually retiring. So we do think when the spot market rationalizes itself in '15, '16, you're going to see a very different heat rate environment than what the forward markets projecting. I think the other thing is important to realize here is, as Chris said, we're going to be very disciplined and rational about our actions if this is the market. And we're not going to sit on the current market valuations and prices and do nothing about it. So I think that's what we're trying to say. We do think the market will improve. We do think we need to be compensated fairly for the assets and what we provide with our fleet, and we're going to work hard at it.","Christopher M. Crane","It's hard to get your head wrapped around an implied valuation for our nuke set of $100 of kWe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first, just in light of the latest transaction, Energy Edison, I'd be curious just to get your views in terms of what that did to the market versus your $2 to $4 expectations, if you could?","Christopher M. Crane","Julien, I think I just commented at that at some level, but let me have Joe Nigro dive into that a little more for you.","Joseph Nigro","We take into account all the changes that we see in the generation stack when we run our analytics of our fundamental forecasting. We've seen a number of changes over the quarter with some units that we expected to remain in the generation stack actually retiring, some units that we expected to be refueled no longer going to continue operations. We've seen some of the announcement of what specifically energy plants to do with refueling some of the assets that they'd be acquiring from E&E [ph]. When we take all of that into account, as Ken mentioned a minute ago, we still see that $2 to $4 of upside in the market, when you look at the changes coming to the generation stack between the dispatch cost for the coal that remains, the increased cost when -- for plants that are going to refuel, you're talking about PRB coal trains that are currently dispatching $25 a megawatt-hour and refuel environment that's closer to $40 a megawatt-hour, so that has an uptick energy and then we continue to see that 20-plus gigawatts of coal retirements that we expect in PJM alone. And when you put them all that together, as Ken said, we expect to see the $2 to $4 of upside.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Then as conversely, what do you think about the wind impact perhaps in subsequent years offsetting these retirements?","Joseph Nigro","Yes, we do see -- there's a couple of elements to that. We do see the impact of wind greater and greater especially on some of the plants at the nodal level of generation busbar as far as specific level, but we do factor that all into our modeling in the disclosures that we provide you represent the values of what we expect the plants to receive. At the generation busbar, we take that all into account.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Excellent. And then perhaps this is a more of a -- the high-level, as you think about your disclosures, the non-power margin executed versus to go, just thinking about the to-go side of that. For 2013, you're talking about $400 million executed, $200 million in theory to go. Given where we are in the year, how do you think about achieving that to go piece? Is that sort of in theory something that you achieve more on the spot basis in that sort of a transactional sense? Or is that something that you would -- you still need to sign contracts to get? I'm just trying to understand what you're saying.","Joseph Nigro","Yes, there's a couple of elements to that. The non-power bucket includes our fuels business both on the retail and wholesale side. It includes our services business on the retail side, so that would be energy efficiency, demand response, our BGE HOME business, our solar business and then lastly it includes the results of our proprietary trading book. What I would say is, as noted in the disclosure, the gross up of our services businesses are expensive. It really inflates the amount that remains to go, so the results of these businesses have been reflected on an EBIT basis in our earnings guidance. The gross up of those businesses the way it's reflected is approximately $100 million. So we're in line generally with the expectations that we remain with that non-power to go business. And again it's across the 3 areas I had mentioned, our services business, the seasonality to our fuels business and then finally a higher proprietary trading results.","Christopher M. Crane","Julien, just to reiterate those, a large piece of that is run rate business on our services and our natural gas sales that renew themselves on a monthly basis.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And a quick clarification actually on the prior question. When you were referring to taxes in New England, is it that you want to acquire more there or that it's a potential sales opportunity? Sorry, if it wasn't clear.","Unknown Executive","We're looking at growing the portfolio where it makes sense and we see good returns. Conversely, if we think the market's right and it's a good time to harvest capital, we would also sell assets.","Unknown Executive","And Julien, some of the reference that's similar to the Continental Wind financing, there are opportunities that we can look at within certain of our parts of our fleet that could be considered noncore to look at structured finance opportunities as another means of extracting value. So ERCOT, New England and then our hydro assets would be areas where we might consider pursuing that activity, as well as incremental financing at the Continental holding company level.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So project finance at the thermal -- some of the thermal assets?","Unknown Executive","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to revisit the last question that Julien had there. On taxes, I think you talked about sort of disconnect between asset values and some expectations in the markets, something like that? And are you -- can you comment on recent changes and expectations around market structure and are you more inclined to be a buyer or a seller in that market?","Christopher M. Crane","We would like to be more of a buyer in the ERCOT market where we see the market rules going. The most recent assets that have traded have been slightly above a value that we would put on them, so we'll still participate. Nothing I've seen yet would say it's time to liquidate. We think there's upside to that market, so there's upside to those asset valuations for the ones we have. And we'll continue to participate as things come to the market. But other entities have placed a slightly higher value on than we can see getting out of.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then can I just on the kind of wind question in the Midwest, this is Ken or Joe, is there a way of giving us a sense, you see that forward curve, but obviously, it's made up of expectations around hourly pricing. As you look out into 2014, '15 and '16, how much of an impact does sort of incremental hours of potentially negative pricing have on the sort of aggregate calendar year strip that we look at. Is there any help you can give us on that?","Joseph Nigro","Yes, we've seen negative prices at some of our nuclear plants up to call it 15% of the hours. When we look at the modeling that we do, we see that there's constraints on the system and congestions. We take that into account when we're building the value of the disclosure up from the bottoms up, I would call it. So we're not marking the generators to a NiHub price. We're marking the generators to a busbar price that has an expectation of what the congestion in marginal losses will look like at each of those plants for each of the years, and that included in that is the expectation of what the wind development will be in that time period and the impact that it has.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So is there -- are you saying that you'll have more wind but more infrastructure and it's kind of a wash?","Joseph Nigro","Yes, we continue to grow the wind development in the Midwest, and we continue to see degradation in the basis value of some of our plants. And that degradation is reflected in the buildup of our disclosure. We do expect as you get out past the period that we've disclosed with some transmission changes, you could see possible improvement but that's not reflected in this current disclosure. This current disclosure reflects the degradation that we've seen.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So is that 15%, is that specific to sort of like history and it's going to get worse from there or is that what you're expecting it to become.","Christopher M. Crane","Well, let me bring it up and summarize. I think I'll have Joe Dominguez talk about the project when we've got in the short term to mitigate it. So what we've taken in the model is the most conservative with the RPS standards as the state's being fully met. Then we have that with a lot of inflow coming from MISO into the system and the negative impacts of the worst-case scenario of meeting the full RPS standard is in the model. So that's -- we're not betting on something better to happen with that. But in the meantime, Joe, why don't you cover the project that you have in place there?","Joseph Dominguez","Sure. And just as Joe said, we're seeing 14% to 15% of off-peak hours at our facility that is most exposed to the problem. It is not a problem that we face at every one of our nuclear units. In fact, the problem really exists where you would imagine if we're geographically more located to where the wind is coming across the seam. We have been working, I think, this has been reported in the press and by some of you we've been working with PJM to wrap our nuclear assets down at night when we're seeing a negative pricing of vendor when PJM is saying a negative pricing. We work with PJM to market monitor to formulate a program that allows us to start doing that on a pilot basis. We've experienced first couple evolutions of that. It is difficult for us to capture all of these events because the events are ultimately as unpredictable as the wind itself. But that's 1 method that we're working through. The other thing that we've accomplished is some rule changes in MISO where the intermittent resources now have to have a price bid into the system, which will allow for their dispatchability. We've seen some improvement in negative pricing events really as a function of that rule change. I think as Joe indicated, this problem is very much acquired at the transmission constraints at this plant space stage. So as very different plants get the benefit of transmission expansion programs and other transmission work that is occurring in Illinois, it wouldn't necessarily be the case that the problem is going to increase, for example, from 14% to something greater in the off-peak hours. It is, however, an issue and it's an issue that has driven us to take position on introduction tax credit and other incentive programs that are distorting the market and that really explains the company's position over the last couple of years. When Chris talked about the ongoing policy work is going to continue to evolve across all of these areas, the subsidy work, as well as the regulatory response to the subsidies so that we can try to clear up this problem as best we can.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you quantify the offsets?","Joseph Dominguez","Well, I don't think so yet. But I think it's fair to say that, for example, the plant that we experienced the 14% impact in 2012, that impact is significantly less, I'm going to call it 4% to 6% lower in '13 as a result of some transmission expansion. We'll see how the market reacts to this. It's hard for me to differentiate between the dispatchable intermittent resource rule that was accomplished in and the transmission work but I think we can marginally improve it. That said, it's a continuing problem.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hugh Wynne.","Hugh Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wonder if you might comment on the demand assumptions that underpin your outlook for the power market recovery. And in particular, what are your expectations for energy efficiency gains. Just looking at Page 19 of your slide deck, it seems like we've seen declines in power demand across the regulated utilities system. So that's the first question. And the second question is what are your assumptions for the shape of the load going forward? And in particular, will there be a flattening of demand as demand response gets bid into the energy market in PJM?","Joseph Nigro","Hugh, it's Joe. A couple of things. From a demand perspective, we forecast about 0.8% load growth in our $2 to $4 modeling across the PJM footprint. So historically, you've seen a conversion rate of, call it, 0.6% to 1% -- of 1% versus a 1% change in GDP. We're down to about 0.3% conversion and it's on the back of what you're talking about energy efficiency and demand response. In addition to that, we've run a sensitivity that if we were flat over the 5-year horizon with 0 load growth, the impact to that $2 to $4 is about $1 of megawatt-hour, just to give you some frame of reference of what the load growth value represents. I think to your question on the shape of the load flattening, I think it's safe to say we have seen that already, given the fact that we have seen substantial amount of demand response. And we have seen the impact of energy efficiency. I think the element that I would add though in our $2 to $4 of modeling, we don't include any upside associated with the rule changes in PJM as it relates to demand response bidding into the energy market. For frame of reference, we saw a couple of times this summer, we're the first energy market went to $1,800 a megawatt-hour in the back of demand response bidding. And I think just as importantly from the Exelon perspective in September during the heat wave given some generation outages and transmission outages, they implemented about 6,000 megawatts demand response that if you're bidding in the energy market would have a price associated with it that would've made to telling people it's very different that it actually did. So yes, it does flatten the load but I think there is an ancillary benefit when you think about what price that demand response we'll be bidding at and it can set the locational marginal price.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Most of my questions have been addressed but wanted to just go back to the retail business a bit, and Ken, I think you said that the margin outlook is unchanged. I wondered if you might be able to talk this a little bit about just competitive dynamics in the business, any trends you're seeing in terms of degree of competition or changes in the business over time?","Joseph Nigro","It's Joe Nigro. Our retail business, the market environment overall still remains extremely competitive, and it's extremely competitive both on the commercial and industrial side and on the mass market side. What I would say to you is we've seen some stabilizing effect on our margins, meaning we've talked to you that our margins on the C&I side for power have been sub-$2, and they remain so, but they've stabilized slightly below that. And our expectation in our plan as we look at next year is not to see much improvement in that area. We have seen consolidation with what went on with the [indiscernible] with the direct energy process of buying but the market is still highly competitive.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and just hitting on the heat rate outlook, you had spent quite a bit of time on the Midwest as you look at PJM East and West, what's your general view from where we stand now in terms of the heat rate outlook in the East and West?","Joseph Nigro","But I think Ken mentioned this earlier. We still hold a view of $2 to $4 of upside and the $2 when we're reflected is on the West -- on the eastern side of PJM, excuse me, and it's driven -- really, when you look at the changing composition of the dispatch stack in the locational margin price model, there are still hours that the eastern unit benefit from that change of the dispatch stack. So we have seen a degradation and basis as we talk about the gas basis -- gas that market basis is reflected in our analytical modeling and we're using those prices and with all that we do see the $2 of upside expected in the Mid-Atlantic.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a point of clarification on the gross margin comment earlier. When you said that the gross margin generally is unchanged year-over-year in '16, were you referring to only the open gross margin row or were you talking about the total gross margin, the $7.6 billion?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Brian, the open gross margin's unchanged. Most of our disclosure lines like our new business, non-power margins, those elements are largely going to be unchanged. We are hedging so we do have positive value in the mark-to-market of hedges. We will disclose exactly what that is in a couple of weeks. So I was referring to a similar 2015 to '16 outlook except for that we have had less hedging so somewhat less of mark-to-market hedge value.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just as a reminder, the open gross margin includes capacity revenues so the drop in '16 capacity revenues is obviously being offset by something else in your open gross margin comment?","Jonathan W. Thayer","That's correct.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second follow-up question, we've seen other competitors out there where they've used a yield curve structure to tap a lower cost of equity for consolidation purposes. Can you just comment a little bit on to what extent does that present either challenges or opportunities for you and how you think consolidation can progress as far as Exelon is concerned?","Jonathan W. Thayer","So Brian, this is Jack. Where you've seen the YieldCo [ph] particularly at NRG have success, they really have a shareholder base that values those shares on the basis of exposure, the power markets and on an EBITDA-multiple basis. They had a modest dividend but they had an opportunity to carve off assets into a yield-oriented vehicle to optimize that. I think people own us for both our upside to power markets but also our dividend. And certainly, our renewables assets and the contracted nature of them as it factors into our ability to pay a dividend and drive value and reduced volatility in the earnings profile of the company, we think create value. That said, we do look at many structures, and we certainly have assets that align to those types of structures. And to the extent that there are -- that the price of capital for those structures and the need to acquire assets drives the markets higher, then the implied value of our renewables fleet should improve along with that.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Does the renewables fleet that you own now more merit a closer look towards a yield curve structures so that way, you can compete on a similar cost of equity footing?","Christopher M. Crane","I think it has us look at more of project financing for the credit quality that it gives us and then bringing that cash back in for investment.","Jonathan W. Thayer","And the reality is, Brian, as you know, we can tap many markets to secure capital to grow our business. And if you think about who the investors are in those yield-oriented names, whether they're pension funds or insurance companies or other elements, we're capping similar capital, as Chris mentioned, through the project financing side. We could, through other means, secure capital as well from those entities at a lower cost of capital. And there are opportunities in a nonpublic vehicle to form relationships with entities to benefit from that lower cost of capital. So rest assured, we're looking at any and always optimize the cost of capital for our company as we look to deploy capital for growth and the implied yield or cost of capital on certain of those YieldCo is not lost on us.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Most of my questions were answered. Chris, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that your cash flow outlook puts you in a position to make potential acquisitions in the space. Does your cash flow outlook also assume a scenario where EDF may put the nuclear assets to you as early as 2016? And what could potentially be a pretty challenging [indiscernible] environment? And I have a follow-up.","Christopher M. Crane","We do stress the balance sheet for any potential commitments that have to be made. If you look in the disclosure, we have the like-kind-exchange issue in the out years that where we feel that we're going to prevail on, but there was a probability shift and we had to put that in the disclosure. And we stressed the balance sheet to make that commitment before we agreed to the EDF potential point, we made sure that, that was stressed. So we are very comfortable where we're at right now with the balance sheet.","Jonathan W. Thayer","And remember there's -- as part of that contract, there's a baseball arbitrage type of valuation approach. So to the extent where the challenge course spread market, then that should show up in the implied value of those assets, thereby reducing the put value.","Shahriar Pourreza - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then let me -- just one more question is under an assumption that the power price or heat rate recovery doesn't materialize and you find yourself in a scenario where you're rationalizing your fleet, a couple of the assets in those put options could also face cash flow challenges. I'm kind of curious on how the change in outlook could impact that transaction? Do you have like a clause where you can back out of the transaction or is it essentially the flexibility is going to come where the economic value of the assets are?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes, that's where the flexibility comes. If they're negative MPV and the negative cash flow would be in the valuation and so they're really not worth anything on the baseball arbitration. So we don't feel stressed over the deal. We think the upside we're getting from driving the synergies the cost savings out of it is the real focus of this.","Ravi Ganti","Thank you, operator.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to our host Ravi Ganti. You may begin your conference.","Ravi Ganti","","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exelon\u2019s second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us today. We issued our earnings release this morning. If you haven\u2019t received it, the release is available on Exelon\u2019s Investor website.","The earnings release and the other maters we will discuss in today\u2019s call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties and the actual results could differ from our statements. Please refer to today\u2019s 8-K and Exelon\u2019s other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management\u2019s projections, forecasts, and expectations, and for a reconciliation of operating to GAAP earnings.","Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon\u2019s President and CEO; Ken Cornew, Exelon\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer and President and CEO of Exelon Generation and Jack Thayer, Exelon\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of the executive management team who will be available to answer your questions at the end of the prepared remarks. We have scheduled 60 minutes for this call.","I now turn the call over to Chris.","Christopher M. Crane","","Good morning and thank you for everybody joining. We delivered on our financial and operational expectations this quarter. In the markets lower commodity prices continue to challenge us both in the near-term in the outer years. Ken Cornew will provide more detail on both the power markets and the capacity markets.","Overall the prices that were received in the RPM auction this quarter were disappointing, but not devastating. We can\u2019t control or influence the markets. We can control our actions, business practices and decisions. We continue to leverage on our core competencies, our reliability and efficiency provides a competitive advantage. By resizing the dividend we\u2019ve strengthened our balance sheet and now have a sustainable dividend and the ability to invest and grow even when prices move against us.","Moving to the financial update, the second quarter operating earnings were $0.53 a share within the guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 a share and Jack Thayer will discuss the drivers around that. We\u2019re providing guidance of $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the third quarter operating earnings and reaffirming our full year guidance of $2.35 to $2.65 per share. Operations remained strong, while the full-year gross margin expectations at Constellation are lower as you can see from the hedge disclosure, the full company impact has been offset largely by reductions and cost and strong utility performance. And both Jack and Ken will provide more details around that.","Moving to operational excellence on Slide 1, we\u2019re on track for very good year operationally. Our Generation fleet performed well of this quarter, nuclear ran at 92.8 capacity factor in the second quarter despite our refueling outage days which is normal and for the loss of offsite power at LaSalle in April.","Year-to-date performance for the fleet has been excellent with a capacity factor slightly under 95%. Our agreement with EDF provides an opportunity to do what we do best, run the CENG plants, safely, reliably and more efficiently. Fossil and renewable fleets have had a strong quarter as well. Fossil and hydro dispatch match rate was at 99.1% solar and wind energy capture were at 92.4% and the utilities had very solid performance thus far this year. All three utilities to date are in top decile safety performance and a continuing improvement in consumer satisfaction index year-over-year.","On the regulatory advocacy side, in Illinois, Illinois State Bill 9 was enacted this quarter. It enables us to start executing grid modernization plans, including installation of Smart Meters to improve reliability. We\u2019ve filed rate cases of both ComEd and BGE and this will now be a regular practice, as we have accelerated our capital into those systems. The RPM auctions, as I said, Ken will provide some more context around that, but like all competitive generators and PJM, we\u2019re disappointed with the May results.","Looking back on RPM and the auction process, it is a 12 year old process. From time-to-time, we have had issues arise around the process that have required us to go back to the stakeholder process and make amendments. We will be working with PJM and fellow stakeholders on improvements and recommendations to address the increased reliance on planned resources and also supporting PJM\u2019s effort to enhance the MOPR rules as well as rules governing demand response.","On the growth and investment side, we are bringing new megawatts online, growing our rate base with smart grid investments. We\u2019ve installed 99 megawatts of solar at our AVSR solar facility year-to-date and expect to add another 102 megawatts to complete the project. We are adding approximately 46 megawatts to our wind portfolio in 2014, with our Beebe project in Michigan.","The Smart Meter installation projects are well underway this year at all three utilities for 2013, BGE has installed 287,000 meters thus far, 980,000 are expected to be installed by year-end. At PECO, we have 364,000 meters in year-to-date with 562 expected by year end. And ComEd Smart Meter deployment begins in September with 60,000 meters expected by year end and we\u2019ll continue to look for other opportunities to grow value.","As we talked about before financial discipline is key to our management model. Our decision to cancel the EPUs at LaSalle and Limerick demonstrate our continued focus on financial discipline and value return. We can return capital in other places elsewhere in a value chain to realize value at a sooner pace.","We are on track to achieve synergies associated with merger including $305 million of synergies in 2013 and the run rate of $550 million of synergies beginning in 2014. And we continue to look to pull cost out of the business across all businesses. The wholesale market and the competitive retail market are challenging. The impact on our gross margin expectations through 2015 have been noted. We are aggressively taking actions to offset these challenges by taking on additional cost cutting to focus on each business and optimize the portfolio.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Ken Cornew to provide some more specifics on power and gas markets in our retail business.","Kenneth W. Cornew","","Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. As Chris mentioned I\u2019ll cover the recent PJM capacity auction, market trends, and then provide an update on the Constellation business. As Chris said in his opening remarks the results of the May capacity auction were disappointing. Results were lower than we and many others, including most of you on the call had anticipated.","As you know this was largely due to the 90% increase in capacity imports over the previous auction and the amount of new generation that cleared. The volume of new generation that cleared in the auction is surprising given the lower clearing prices. We do not believe that it is reflective of the long-term capacity revenues needed to support new generation development. 10 gigawatts of coal did not clear in the auction, a record level and the amount of coal offered in the capacity auction continuous to decline from 67 gigawatts in 2013, 2014 to 59 gigawatts in 2016, 2017. These two facts bolster our view that more than 20 gigawatts of coal will be retired in PJM by 2016.","Slide 3 depicts the fundamental changes to PJM supply stack that have occurred over the last few auctions. As you can see from this chart on the top left, the existing PJM generation stack as it existed in the 2013, 2014 planning year has become a smaller percentage of the overall capacity. There is a large amount of planned new generation expected to be online by 2015 and 2016 and the 2016, 2017 planning year imports, demand response, energy efficiency, combine for nearly 22 gigawatts of PJM capacity. When we factor all of these changes to the supply stack along with other input assumptions such as modest load growth projections and current forward fuel prices, we continued to see upside compared to the current forward PJM power markets.","Like all of you, we continue to wait and watch for developments on some of these new planned resources. Needless to say, if the new planned resources do not materialize, it may create additional volatility in the market and potential for upside in power prices beyond what it in our current forecast.","Additionally, the retired coal units are being replaced by some supplier resources which have a very different dispatch profile. This can lead to increased volatility in spot energy prices. We have many issues to consider from this RPM auction. Will the require transmission for imports to get built? Will the new generation get built at these prices? At what price does demand response participate in the energy market? Do these trends continue at the next auction or do they reverse?","We\u2019ve seen anomalies in the RPM auction results before and have successfully used stakeholder process at PJM and FERC to improve the auction process. The MOPR isses of the 2015, 2016 auction, were largely fixed by FERC. As a result of the stakeholder process at PJM. Exelon intends to work with PJM, other PJM stakeholders and FERC in reviewing the auction results and considering potential changes to market rules to address PJM\u2019s increased reliance on planned resources.","Slide 4 provides an overview of how we position the portfolio to benefit from our fundamental views. Forward power prices have fallen since we last updated you on the Q1 call. In particular, West Hub and NI Hub decreased by $2.90 a megawatt hour and $2.68 a megawatt hour in 2015 respectively. Natural gas prices decreased approximately $0.16 an Mmbtu in 2015, which has caused some of the decline in power price.","We continue to see a disconnect in forward heat rates compared to our fundamental forecast, given current natural gas prices, given expected retirements, given the new generation resources and given our modest loan growth assumption. We have acted on this view and have widened our deviation in rateable across our entire portfolio in the past six months, which has reached approximately 8% under-rateable for 2015. The actual deviation in a pure underlying power position is even greater, when auctions and cross commodity hedges are factored in.","Let me address the following question. What does this market upside really mean in terms of earnings or gross margins for Exelon? To put it simply, it depends on the unhedged position in our portfolio at the time the upside is realized in the market. The sooner the upside is realized the greater the impact. Our fundamental view remains that there are $2 to $4 of upside still to be realized in the PJM markets. This market upside will have a gross margin impact of around $550 million on a fully open basis. We will continue to evaluate the amount of upside we see in prices due to our views and carry positions that allow us to benefit as much as possible from the realization of these views.","Now I\u2019ll turn to Constellation\u2019s results for this year and the outlook for the next two years. There are increased challenges in the business from all sides. As I mentioned before power prices are lower, forward heat rates are lower and there continues to be pressure on the retail segment from aggressive competitions and reduced volatility.","As you can see on Slide 5 for 2013 the total reduction to gross margin from the last quarter is $150 million there are three elements equally contributing to this reduction. First we had lower than expected generation in the quarter, due to an unplanned outage at our LaSalle plant and delays in the online day for portions of our AVSR solar project. Despite these delays there\u2019ll be an offset in terms of depreciation expense for AVSR in the Genco financials.","The second element is under collection of revenues from PJM financial transmission rates or FTRs otherwise known as congested rates. For those of you that monitor PJM you likely know this under collection situation for entities that only these congestion rates are being paid significantly less than their full value. Third the remaining is due to $50 million reduction in our new business targets for the year largely attributed to reduced expectations at our wholesale gross margins.","In 2014 and 2015 our disclosure indicates a reduction of $250 million and $400 million respectively in our hedged gross margin. The reduction in power price and the resulting impact on our under hedged generation contributes to the bulk of this drop. As you\u2019ve heard us say for the last few quarters, the retail space is extremely competitive and challenged. We have remained disciplined and have not gone after volume for the sake of volume, but have maintained appropriate margin on our sales.","Due to this continued competition and limited volatility, we revised our estimates from both a margin and volume perspective. Our expectation for the weighted realized margin of our retail business still remains in the lower end of our $2 to $4 a megawatt hour range. Our recent retail C&I origination margins are slightly below that $2, however, we expect to be in that $2 to $4 range in the longer-term.","Additionally, we are lowering our volume expectations from what we published at EEI by 15, 20 and 25 terawatt hours for 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively. We\u2019re still optimistic that we can grow the retail business, but given the overall competitive environment, we have seen over the last 18 months, we\u2019ve chosen to be more conservative in our volume estimates.","To mitigate the impact of lower gross margins and new business targets, we continue to take a hard look at our cost and optimizing our process. We\u2019ve reduced the Constellation O&M budget by roughly $15 million for 2013, 2014 and 2015. We\u2019ll continue to look for additional opportunities to further reduce our operating costs for process and system improvements.","In total, ExGen\u2019s reducing its Q&M by $100 million in 2013, which includes the $50 million of O&M reduction at Constellation, I just discussed. We are targeting O&M reductions in 2014 and 2015 that will result in a roughly flat CAGR for ExGen.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jack, to review the full financial information for the quarter.","Jonathan W. Thayer","Thank you, Ken and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll review the second quarter financial results, our third quarter guidance range, key events of the quarter at the utilities and our balance sheet and cash flow outlook.","I\u2019ll start with our financial results on Slide 6. As Chris mentioned earlier, Exelon produced results consistent with our expectations. Operating earnings for the second quarter of this year were $0.53 per share within our Q2 guidance range of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. We reduced O&M at ExGen and realized the favorable impacts of SB9. These positive drivers are offset by a favorable performance at Constellation.","This compares to earnings of $0.61 per share during the second quarter of 2012. The key drivers of the quarter-over-quarter difference were lower realized energy prices at Generation, decreased capacity pricing and higher nuclear fuel costs. I will go into greater detail on the quarter\u2019s drivers in a few minutes.","For the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance range of $2.35 to $2.65 per share. Despite the reductions in gross margin as seen in our hedge disclosures, we are confident that we can deliver on our full year guidance range. This is due to the passage of Senate Bill 9, the outcomes of the rate cases at ComEd and BGE, the full $100 million of O&M reductions at ExGen and appreciation offsets due to the AVSR delay. We will continue to look additional opportunities to improve our cost structure and streamline the business. For the third quarter, we\u2019re providing a guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share.","Turning to Exelon Generation on Slide 7, ExGen\u2019s results were $0.15 per share lower quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by lower rev net fuel due to lower realized energy prices and lower capacity prices. This was partially offset by lower O&M costs due to merger synergies and lower income tax due to investment tax credit benefits from AVSR.","Before I turn to the quarterly earnings for the utilities on Slide 8, let me provide a brief update on our load forecast. In general, the outlook for 2013 is improving as economic conditions continue to strengthen. Both ComEd and PECO are forecasting positive load growth for 2013 and BGE would be positive after removing the negative impacts of RG Steel. More detail on utility load can be found in the appendix on Slide 19.","ComEd\u2019s earnings increased $0.06 per share, compared to the earnings in the prior period last year. This is primarily driven by the reversal of the write-down of a regulatory asset we recorded in Q2 of 2012, based on ICC order we received in May of that year. We\u2019re also seeing the benefits of higher distribution revenue due to higher allowed ROE and the impact of SB9.","These are offset by unfavorable weather compared to the second quarter of 2012, where Northern Illinois experienced above average heat in June. PECO\u2019s earnings decreased $0.01 per share, compared to the earnings in the prior period last year. This decrease is a result of the premium paid for redemption of PECO preferred stock during the quarter. Higher O&M costs for the quarter due to inflation were offset by lower income taxes.","BGE\u2019s earnings increased $0.01 per share, compared to earnings in the prior period last year. This is related to the increased electric and gas rates that were received in the recent rate order. Second quarter was a productive time for the utilities in the regulatory and legislative arena. During this quarter, BGE filed a rate case and in Illinois, the legislature overwrote Governor Quinn\u2019s veto of SB9.","The impact of SB9 is expected to be $0.01 per share in 2013 and $0.04 per share in 2014. In late May, ComEd also amended its rate case to reflect the passage of Senate Bill 9. The amended filing requests an increase of $359 million, which is $48 million more than the pre-SB9 filing. This request reflects actual 2012 expenses and investments and forecasted 2013 capital additions through our distribution network. We expect the decision by year end with a new rates going into effect in January of 2014.","In May, BGE filed a rate case with the Maryland PSC asking for an increase of $101.5 million for electric and $29.7 million for gas. We expect the final order in mid-December with new rates going into effect shortly thereafter. We\u2019re optimistic that we can build upon the results of our last rate case. We continue to target a 5% to 6% growth in rate base for all three of our utilities and have set a target 10% earned ROE by the end of our planning period.","In the appendix, we\u2019ve updated our rate base and ROE targets for the utilities. As you will see, we\u2019ve maintained all three utilities long-term equity target ratio of 53%. However, in the short to intermediate term, we believe an equity to total capital ratio of 46% allows ComEd to effectively earn on all equity invested in both transmission and distribution businesses. Given our current situation and capital structure at ComEd with more equity would result in less than optimal earnings in the transmission business.","Slide 9 provides an update of our cash flow expectations for this year. We project cash from operations of $5.6 billion, this is down from last quarter by about $270 million, primary drivers to decline include lower net income at Exelon Generation related to the revision in our full year portfolio targets and timing of tax refunds at ComEd originally anticipated for 2013 that are now expected in 2014.","Our CapEx forecast has increased by $125 million from last quarter, mainly due to accelerated AMI deployment at ComEd, movement of upstream spend from the first quarter of 2014 into 2013, and the addition of the Beebe Phase I project in the Wind portfolio. Our current five year plan includes $16 billion in growth CapEx with approximately $13.5 billion of that at the utilities, where we have the ability to earn a stable rate of return.","We\u2019ve upsized our planned ComEd long-term debt issuance by $500 million from last quarter due to the aforementioned delay in tax refunds. PECO\u2019s anticipated $550 million issuance and $500 million retirement, contemplates termination of its $210 million accounts receivable facility, which matures on August 30, 2013.","Last month, we received commitments from all banks within the BGE, PECO, Exelon Corp. and Exelon Generation core credit facilities to extend the maturity date in one year. With the ComEd extension executed early this year, all $8 billion of our core credit facilities are now extended into 2018. This extension provides refinancing flexibility to Exelon as new banking regulations are implemented over the next several years.","Yesterday, we announced that we reached an agreement with EDF to operate the CENG plants. As part of the agreement, Exelon will provide CENG with a $400 million loan at an interest rate of 5.25%, which will be used to provide a special dividend to EDF. Once the loan is repaid, Exelon will receive a preferred dividend from CENG. The agreement includes an option for EDF to sell us their stake in CENG in the future. The financial structure of the agreement allows Exelon to take over day-to-day operations of the plants.","It is intended to be as close to financially neutral as possible for the owner companies enabling each to capture the value created by a world class operator like Exelon, operating the plants. We expect to close on the agreement in the first quarter or early in the second quarter next year. And as a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Chris for his concluding remarks before we open the call for Q&A.","Christopher M. Crane","Thanks to Jack and Ken. Exelon continues to excel at our core competencies. Operating our plants while keeping the lights on at the utilities and managing risk and optimizing our portfolio.","We continue making productivity and operational enhancements to drive efficiencies across our business. Our strong balance sheet allows us to invest in our business and find ways to grow. When we screen growth opportunities, we look for value creating investments that are EPS, free cash flow and credit metrics accretive. We will act on those accretive opportunities at both an incremental level and a transformational level, leveraging our skill in markets.","Our operating agreement with CENG is a good example as Jack has just outlined, we are investing $16 billion in our business over the planning period mostly in our regulated utilities as Jack stated we\u2019ll result in a rate based growth of 5% to 6%.","In conclusion, we faced a number of challenges. Exelon is focused on the fundamentals of our business throughout the growth process, as we continue to add value to our shareholders.","And with that Ravi, I guess we\u2019ll open up for questions.","Ravi Ganti","Yes, sir. Operator, we\u2019ll now take questions from the participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen C. Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning.","Christopher M. Crane","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen C. Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I wondered if you could talk in a little more depth about the synergy potential with the additional nuclear units that you\u2019ll be operating. Can you just talk in little more specifics about what kind of operational advantages you see from this transaction?","Christopher M. Crane","The first advantage is a reduction of $50 million to $70 million of expense at the current within the current operating model and that\u2019s significant in itself. Beyond that is the flexibility to move resources around to continue to improve the talent development, not only within our own fleet, but the CENG fleet. We\u2019re really focused as everybody knows on the long-term viability of the small assets and we think this will give us a much better chance to have the whole fleet operate at a higher safety and reliability while reducing cost.","Stephen C. Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you very much. And then shifting over to your wind business and thinking about some of your contracted assets. Can you talk just generally about your appetite for either growing in that business or going the other direction and trying to monetize given the value of the contracted assets? How do you all think about the strategic path there?","Christopher M. Crane","Go ahead Jack.","Jonathan W. Thayer","Sure. So Stephen, it\u2019s Jack Thayer. As we look at assets and it\u2019s not just our wind assets. We look at what we believe the internal value of those assets are and then we bench that relative to what we see in the market as an implied value for those assets. As you think about those wind assets, one of the opportunities that we\u2019re working through right now is our project financing on our wind facility and that we expect to raise, somewhere between $625 million to $700 million of balance sheet debt.","To the extent that we successfully complete that and we anticipate that in September of this year, we\u2019ll then be in a position to look at those assets on an off balance sheet basis and see what\u2019s the optimal way to organize those within the Company. We also expect to use this off-balance-sheet structure to be able to the extent we\u2019re adding to our Wind portfolio or our Solar portfolio to optimize their capital structure to gain as much earnings accretion from those investments as possible.","Christopher M. Crane","The only thing I would add, we have continued to grow in the renewable space as Jack said the Wind and Solar. But a long-term large scale business model on a highly subsidized product is something that we watch closely. The only thing I would add, we have continued to grow in the renewable space, with as Jack said, the Wind and Solar, but a long-term large scale business model on a highly subsidized product is something that we watch closely. We have clearly stated that we think that Washington picking winners and losers on subsidies, it is not a long-term plan. So, we will continue to monitor the Federal policy and the State policy as we look at growth potentials in that area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon of ISI Group.","Christopher M. Crane","Hey Greg.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","When you talk about hedging through the gas markets, just trying to leave your heat rate position open, how should we think about the way you are hedging in the context of, for instance, natural gas basis and PJM having collapsed relative to historical basis versus Henry Hub given the Marcellus situation?","Christopher M. Crane","I\u2019ll get Joe to answer that, Joe Nigro.","Joseph Nigro","Good morning Greg. Greg in our disclosure we show you our hedge percentages by region and you can see if we use 2015 as a proxy year, we are approximately 50% hedged which is right on ratable in the Mid-Atlantic region. And in the Midwest we are about 40% approximately hedged, which would be 10% behind. As we have stated, we see the most amount of upside aligning to the Midwest region with all the changes that Ken talked about in the script. The big thing is as it relates to gap hedging is, the bulk of the trade that we have done in gas is relative to our Midwest position.","And the gas basis there has been much more stable as you know the Mid-Atlantic basis has really seen a roll-down with the Marcellus shale, when you look at gas basis at city gate in Chicago over the last year or so, the degradation has been much, much less than what it's been in the Mid-Atlantic. So the trade aligns well with our Midwest position.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay so you tend to trade the more liquid contracts at the Henry Hub, so we should look at basis as being something that you have to manage if the basis starts to become more volatile?","Joseph Nigro","Absolutely, as you know as you move out on the basis, on the curve in time it gets more difficult to effectively execute the basis in different areas. We do use primarily the NYMEX contract and then if there is an opportunity we will layer in the basis as appropriate.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. A couple questions for Jack. You had laid out some numbers in terms of what you thought you would generate in terms of we investable capital over the next several years after the dividend cut and that that was sort of your sort of warchest for opportunities should they arise in the business. Can you reiterate what those numbers were and have they dissipated significantly because of the downturn in the retail and wholesale power markets on the capacity outcome?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Sure. So, as you recall, we spoke to roughly $2 billion to $3 billion of balance sheet capacity in the first quarter call, with the degradation in power prices, we have seen that come in. It\u2019s in a roughly $1 billion to $2 billion range now, and a way to think about this from a sensitivity standpoint is for every plus or minus dollar move from megawatt hour roughly to the plus side, $750 million of capacity is created to the down side roughly $650 million is lost depending on what power prices do.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Great. And Jack, where are you guys in terms of the evaluation of whether or not you're certain of your nuclear plants are viable in the longer-term and when might we get a decision on that?","Christopher M. Crane","This is Chris, I will cover that. We have worked hard over the last couple of years to continue to focus on cost to maintain some of the viability of the smaller units. As we have mentioned our Clinton facility in MISO, the nuclear team has come up with a fairly good plan to put the plant on annual refueling cycles, which keeps it viable for years to come as the market recovers.","As one of the newest boiling water reactors, in our fleet and in the country, it\u2019s a well-run plant, which last year had zero-force loss rate and so we are not ready to give up on it, we are continuing to optimize its cost structure, maintaining it safe but also neutral on the balance sheet. As we look at our other smaller ones, being able to bring Gannett into the Exelon cost structure, I think will give us time to continue to look at that, as we understand the policies that are revolving in New York, around capacity and transmission.","So, there is nothing on the chopping block right now. It is constant work to look at cost. It's constant work to look at regulatory structure and if it does not improve, we will be talking more about those facilities.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, my last question is \u2013 I know it sounds maybe like an odd question, but one of the things that you did in the restructuring of the joint venture with the put option with EDF is indemnify them against a serious nuclear accident. I know it is a tail risk, but it seems like a very large risk to be saddling your shareholders and bondholders with. Can you explain the logic there?","Christopher M. Crane","Bill you want to go ahead?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Yeah, we will get Bill to\u2026","William A. Von Hoene","Yeah. Greg, this is Bill Von Hoene. As you know, the indemnification is for Price-Anderson exposure. Corresponding to their ownership interest in the plants, each unit in the United States has an exposure to this. There are 104 units and I think the exposed rate is about $117.5 million potential retro call for a Price-Anderson event, which is a catastrophic event, and understanding what that means, TMI was not a Price-Anderson event, Price-Anderson has ever been in both.","So what you have is on a plant-by-plant basis. You have that exposure it\u2019s limited on a per year basis to $17 million per plant. So essentially what happens here is in the event that there was a Price Anderson event which has never occurred and there was a call and the call is pro-rata in the plants and there was a call for the full amount. The maximum exposure would be about $50 million a year. So looking at that, looking at what the collective insurance arrangement is and looking at what the events are, that would be eligible for this; we do not consider this to be material to the transaction.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Great, thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Savings are your kind of the idea of eliminating inflation at ExGen, can you talk a little more\u2026","Christopher M. Crane","Dan.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah. Can you hear me, sorry.","Christopher M. Crane","You sort of came in midstream there do you mind restarting?","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah, sorry, sorry. So when you guys look at the O&M savings you are talking about at ExGen, both the cut this year and then sustain for the next couple years, could you give a little more detail on where those savings are coming from given the fact you guys are already pulling out so much money from the synergy benefits from the merger and the upsizing of that so far?","Kenneth W. Cornew","Yeah Dan its Ken, I can help with that. We are on the Constellation side continuing to look at vacant positions and attrition and sweeping them and not [fill in] them as we evolve with our transformation in our organization from the Exelon and Constellation merger. So we have been very disciplined about not hiring until we realized the full efficiency of the merger and the capabilities of the organization and you got to keep that in the context of what we are facing in the commercial markets right now.","We had a plan that had retail growing at a more aggressive level, we had back that plan down as you could see in the hedge disclosure, and we backed our cost structure down accordingly. So, we also have continued opportunities on the Constellation side and while we finish our systems integration to improve processes, lower our cost on our IT systems. So, I'm very comfortable with half of that $100 million I talked coming from Constellation and even maybe some more.","On the Genco side, it's really been about non-labor opportunities. Our pension cost are down with interest rates going up. Our insurance costs are a bit down and our ExGen CAGR was not very high to begin with before we rolled this extra $100 million out. We are around 0.5% already. So, we think it\u2019s well within our capability to achieve that flat CAGR.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Does the CENG savings get put into that number, Ken, or is that coming in somewhere else?","Christopher M. Crane","The CENG savings will be on top of this.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","So CENG savings are incremental to that number, okay.","Kenneth W. Cornew","That\u2019s right.","Christopher M. Crane","That\u2019s correct.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then I guess, Ken, just kind of on power market recovery and the $2 to $4 a megawatt hour which has kind of been the expectation for a while, heat rates did come back this quarter from where we had seen those, you have got a negative reset down. Did that mean that basically your outlook for power prices in general have also come down, because you have kept that recovery number at the same level? Or should have that recovery number expanded based on your fundamental view of where the market would have been say a quarter ago?","Kenneth W. Cornew","Dan, one thing to realize is we don\u2019t want to be chasing as every time market prices go up and down. I would say $2 to $4 right now is conservative and our views are that there is substantial upside probably on the high end of that $2 to $4 or even more in the marketplace. We have beaten our models up, we have gotten some new models to challenge ourselves, we have challenged ourselves with some outside help and everything I see indicates that this upside should be there in the markets fundamentally when the system actually dispatches. When we are going to see it in the marketplace, we don\u2019t know and we have to be prudent about how we manage the business accordingly, but I see, $2 to $4 being probably a conservative number right now, if you are looking at current market prices.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, I just \u2013 for the overlay just for context, how much demand growth do you guys assume you see in your territories on a long run basis to support that level of power price recovery?","Kenneth W. Cornew","Its under \u2013 in the PJM territory, which is what we are really talking about, with this upside Dan, it\u2019s under 1%.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Under 1%, okay got it.","Kenneth W. Cornew","And then we have some energy efficiency discounts on top of that.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","So, 1%, then you net back efficiency, so it\u2019s more like 0.5% or something?","Kenneth W. Cornew","Between 0.5% and 0.75% is probably a good assumption.","Daniel Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hello.","Christopher M. Crane","Hey Jonathan.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah I think Dan asked most of what I was just about to ask, so I\u2019m going to keep this short. Just to clarify one thing, on the $50 million to $70 million, I apologize; I was on jumping between calls. Is that your the Exelon benefit from the shift or is that kind of a gross number in the entire JV of which your share is half?","Jonathan W. Thayer","It\u2019s a gross number.","Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, so half of that is kind of what will accrue to you on top of the $100 million of other savings?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Yes.","Jonathan W. Thayer","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Can you hear me?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Yeah, we can hear you Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","So perhaps the first question and, again, following up on the last few here, just in terms of aggregate cost cuts, if you could kind of quantify here. Is it correct to take both the Exelon numbers and the half of the $50 million to $70 million from the CENG to get to kind of a total aggregate reduction in 2013 and beyond? And maybe the better question is, the $50 million to $70 million, when exactly do you start realizing that on a run rate basis?","Christopher M. Crane","So that is accurate to aggregate them. We will start to make the adjustments in the organization and achieve, start to achieve the savings after we receive the regulatory approval which is anticipated sometime around March 15th of next year 2014. So the restructuring to garner the savings will happen in 2014 in the long term run rate my anticipation would be 2015.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","For the CENG portion specifically.","Christopher M. Crane","That\u2019s correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Excellent and moving back to the power side for a quick second. You talked about FTRs and congestion, what is being done to resolve that? I mean is that something that we should expect that should turn around next year or is that a potential liability for next year as well? I mean, how have you positioned that with respect to your guidance and from a regulatory perspective as well?","Christopher M. Crane","So, Julien we have seen a run rate over history of receiving around 90% of our allocated ARR and FTR value. So this year that\u2019s come down about 20% on us. It\u2019s due somewhat to the allocation process and how PJM models the system and allocates ARRs in initial stages of that process. It\u2019s also due to what I would call less than optimal seams, issues and dispatch, between MISO and PJM that are causing congestion issues at the seams and you get substantial congestion issues in the market, PJM can\u2019t collect enough revenue on congestion to payback the ARR and FTR holders.","So, it is a relatively new challenge for us. What we see is working with PJM and MISO to improve the seams issues as one of the first and foremost things we can do. We also see as the transmission system itself gets upgraded and starts to handle the capability of new supply. That will help the situation as well, but prudently we have to plan for lower collection until we see those changes occur.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","So you would say that is baked into the 2014 and 2015 expectations at this point?","Christopher M. Crane","Yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Okay, all right, great. And then with regards to PJM policy overall, just kind of lastly here, obviously a lot of focus on transmission imports. Is the goal at PJM really to kind of tackle transmission and sort of how that\u2019s done? Or is it more to tackle buying back and sort of that whole element of arbitrage, if you will?","Joseph Dominguez","Julien, this is Joe Dominguez. I think it\u2019s probably more the latter, I think eliminate the incentive to arbitrage between the base residual option and the incremental options direction to stakeholder group is working at. I think we\u2019re also looking at some of the deficiency penalties that determine whether there is sufficient pipelines credit and look at the milestones that need to be accomplished for all planned resources. PJM and IMM may have some other proposals that will come into this. They've started talking about that they may go into direction limiting imports but it\u2019s early to tell.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","All right. Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali of SunTrust.","Christopher M. Crane","","Good morning Ali","","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Can you hear me?","Christopher M. Crane","Yeah we can hear you.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","First, I just wanted to clarify \u2013 I know when you were talking about the cost savings it seemed to me that some of the savings for 2013 may be more 2013 specific \u2013 lower depreciation and what have you. But just to be clear, as I look forward should we assume that relative to the margin erosion that you\u2019re seeing in 2014 and 2015 on the latest forward curve, that about $140 million or so of that is being offset from cost savings? Or how should we think about that on the 2014, 2015 outlook if I\u2019m hearing you right?","Christopher M. Crane","It\u2019s the complete long run cost savings that we talked about should be achieved by the first of 2015, which includes the CENG cost savings along with the Genco cost savings. If you want to talk about trajectory\u2026","Kenneth W. Cornew","The $100 million Ali will be in 2013, 2014 and 2015, so achievable now and held for that period.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got it. Understood. Then secondly, Chris to you, again, hitting you guys, I mean the $2 to $4 uplift, you've talked about that versus fundamentals, versus market, let's say that does not materialize, hasn't materialized today. Should we assume Exelon will continue to focus on cost, perhaps a Hunker Down strategy, wait for that to happen or I mean, strategically, do you step back and say, maybe there is something else that I need to do. Maybe my portfolio mix is not right, and the market is just not there. How should we be tracking that from your perspective?","Christopher M. Crane","Sure, on one side, we will continue to aggressively focus on the safety and reliability on our utilities side, which allows us to continue the opportunity to make significant investments over the planning period.","So, you can see a real focus on the utilities over the next five years putting $13 billion to work and continuing to grow the rate base at 5% to 6%. On the generating side we are definitely within the 2013, 2014 year timeframe in a hunker down mode, watch all expenses, maintain the assets which we think we have a competitive advantage on our asset mix and watch for the market to come back and we think as all of you were the best leverage for a market recovery.","On an annual basis, we always go back in the fall and say what if we get it wrong. What are our paths forward, what's our strategic planning we'll do that again this year, like we do every other year, we'll look at our fundamental modeling, we'll look at external sources of fundamental modeling and we'll look at alternatives, but right now we feel that what we've talked about on a market recovery should happen within the timeframe on the power side. Even with the disappointment of the capacity market on the 16 and 17 side. We see that power upside coming back. On the capacity side, like we said it\u2019s disappointing but not devastating. But that\u2019s one data point, we'll have to continue to work in the stakeholder process to fix this issue and look for any others but if we continue to see issues with the capacity market, it would be prudent for us to go back and make sure that we\u2019re looking at the strategic mix in how we\u2019re structured.","We believe in it, we believe in the competitive market. We are wed to it, but we will always continue to reevaluate it.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","A last question are you still comfortable also with the dividend, the new dividend level even if that $2 to $4 is not materializing?","Christopher M. Crane","Yeah, definitely, if you go back to some of our earlier calls on this and Jack has reiterated that the dividend is essentially sized for the regulatory business to handle with the 65% to 70% dividend up to the HoldCo. So, we could maintain what we think is a very competitive dividend within Exelon or paying to the Exelon shareholders while we\u2019re able to use the balance sheet of the competitive business to grow and see that those dollars and free cash flow back into the competitive business.","Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont of Jefferies.","Christopher M. Crane","Hey Paul.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","A couple of clarifying questions, when you talk about the 0% compound annual growth in O&M through 2015, I assume that does include the CENG savings that you\u2019ve identified or is CENG incremental to that?","Christopher M. Crane","No, No Paul, it\u2019s incremental to that.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","It is incremental okay, second clarifying question is I think you affirm the 2% to 4% guidance for retail supply margin, but you talked about margin pressure on the wholesale side, previously I think you provided a range of a $1.50 to $3 per megawatt hour on wholesale. What would that number has that number been revised?","Christopher M. Crane","We hadn\u2019t revised the wholesale number Paul; I did reaffirm in my comments the $2 to $4 on the retail side albeit we\u2019re expecting to be in the low end of that range. On the wholesale side as you can see in the volume chart, we provided you that we\u2019re reducing the percentage of wholesale load that\u2019s in our projections relative to retail. So we\u2019re still seeing that $1.50 to $3 opportunity albeit the volumes are little lower than we expected.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay. So but the margin \u2013 we should assume similar margins than as what you provided in the past?","Jonathan W. Thayer","Yes lower end of the range on the retail side right now though is what you should assume?","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Okay. And then in terms of the $50 million reduction, that you're looking to achieve at Constellation, is that linked to the lower volumes or is that \u2013 or should we assume that, that represents a reduction in the fixed cost in the business?","Christopher M. Crane","It's some of both Paul. The first, we did have a plan that had us growing our retail business, which meant growing in on the labor side and to the extent we're not growing, we can maintain current labor position, that is a reduction of our plan. We have also been very disciplined while we are integrating the Exelon and Constellation commercial platforms and we continue to do that on the IT side, while we're doing that we've been very disciplined about not finalizing our design and hiring open positions in the business until we get our efficiencies, our systems and our processes all where we want them to be. So, again, I'm very comfortable that Constellation can achieve that cost channel.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","So, with both, is it more skewed towards variable or evenly skewed?","Christopher M. Crane","I would say it's more skewed towards fixed and to the extent there is some variable because of our situation and our lack of growth in that business, there is some benefit there as well.","Paul Fremont \u2013 Jefferies & Company","And then, with respect to EDF, are you basically obligated under that put option to buy them out and who basically ends up doing the market assessment in that calculation.","William A. Von Hoene","","This is Bill Von Hoene. The put option obligates us to buy them out under a process that protects us we believe very carefully protects us in terms of having an accurate market value. Essentially the process calls for each side to designate an investment bank that's embedded to determine the fair market value and that is the fair market value of the EDF share. So, if this happens before we repay the dividend or repay the loan, that's net of that. They then try to agree on a price, if they're unable to agree on a price, there is a third party that is designated by the two investment banks and that party would determine a price and it would be baseball arbitration type of arrangement. There is also, built into it, flexibility to accommodate other business needs that we may have during the period of time, it might be called.","Ravi Ganti","","We will take one last question now. Go ahead.","","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Neil Mehta.","Christopher M. Crane","Hi Neil.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Lapides from Goldman here. Real quick. Actually, two separate ones. One, gas generation, we're seeing lots of new build announcements in PJM these days, just curious if you think they're economic or not and are you worried about a wave of new combined cycles coming into PJM especially with gas basis and the Marcellus now upside down a little bit? Second one is can you give an update on the MATS litigation that is outstanding, I don\u2019t know if a lot of folks are following this, but that case is actually sitting at the DC Circuit waiting on judges to be assigned and just curious your views about the risk around that litigation?","Christopher M. Crane","Let me cover the new build, first. We made lots of announcements, I don\u2019t know if I would agree with there have been announcements on some CCJTs in PJM. Your earlier announcements were subsidized they had to be subsidized based off of the economics. I think they\u2019ve all had their struggles to some extent on being built. There is others that are going to build that risk, I think it's less than a handful that I can point to right now, they\u2019re doing that. We continue to evaluate their economics even with the stated cost per kilowatt number of $60 megawatt day clearing price does not cover the economics for us. So, at some of the latter \u2013 some of the newer announcements saying they could build for under 500 a KW, we don\u2019t think it's includes owner\u2019s cost, it\u2019s not with an EPC agreed upon and the economics, we can't get the economics even on a Brownfield site just to get there.","So, we continue to watch that and we\u2019ll keep our eyes on it. But from the way, we\u2019re modeling it, we don\u2019t see it work. Now they could be first movers anticipating something in the fundamental models that we don\u2019t see like a more significant growth rate greater or low growth rate, greater reduction on installed capacity. Some kind of new behavior on bidding on RPM but from our modeling we don\u2019t see it. Second part I'll ask Daryl Bradford to discuss on the MATS?","Darryl Bradford","As you suggest the MATS litigation is fully briefed. It\u2019s waiting for oral argument in the DC Circuit. We expect that to be scheduled sometime in the fall and while there is always risk in litigation. We carefully reviewed all the briefs and arguments and we think that the EPAs argument is very sound and court should sustain it. We'll get better read on what the court's reaction is to those arguments when oral arguments are held. But we do think the EPA rule should be upheld by the DC circuit.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciate it.","","Ravi Ganti","Okay, operator that should conclude the call.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines."],"8784":["Exelon Corp. (NASDAQ:EXC) Q2 2018 Earnings Call August  2, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Daniel L. Eggers - Exelon Corp.","Christopher M.

My name is Nora and I will be facilitating the audio portion of today's interactive broadcast.","This event also features streaming audio which allows you to listen to the show through your PC speakers. And for those of you on the stream, please take note of the option available in your event console.","At this time, I'd like turn the show over to Dan Eggers, Exelon's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Daniel L. Eggers - Exelon Corp.","Thank you, Nora. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Leading the call today are Chris Crane, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joe Nigro, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. They're joined by other members of Exelon's senior management team who will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks.","We issued our earnings release this morning along with the presentation, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section on Exelon's website. The earnings release and other matters which we'll discuss during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ from our forward-looking statements based on factors and assumptions discussed in today's material and comments made during this call. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other SEC filings for discussions of risk factors and factors that may cause results to differ from management's projections, forecast and expectations.","Today's presentation also includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the information contained in the Appendix of our presentation and our earnings release for reconciliations between the non-GAAP measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures. We scheduled 45 minutes for today's call.","I'll now turn the call over to Chris Crane, Exelon's CEO.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. We understand it's a busy earnings release period. So thanks for being with us.","Starting on slide 5, we're pleased to deliver another great quarter. We achieved strong financial results while continuing to enhance our operational performance and make meaningful gains at our utilities on both the regulatory side and the legislative fronts. Taken together these advances will support our continued strategy to invest in infrastructure, in technology at our utilities delivering better service for our customers.","For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.56 per share versus $0.10 last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we earned $0.71 per share versus $0.56 last year, which is above the midpoint of our $0.55 to $0.65 per share in the guidance range and puts us in a strong footing for the year.","Turning to slide 6, at the utilities, we continue to execute at top quartile levels across key customer satisfaction and operating metrics. The investments we are making are paying off in improving reliability, strong customer satisfaction, which in turn strengthens our relationships with our regulators. All of our utilities are achieving top decile performance in KD, which measures the average speed, which we are able to restore power when outages occur. We are also delivering leading performance across the utilities on customer service metrics as we share best practices and give customers more tools to connect with the utilities when they need service. Safety still remains our highest priority and the targeted programs implemented last quarter are driving improved results.","At ExGen, nuclear generation output was 39 terawatt hours with a capacity factor of 93.2%. We had 41 fewer outage days compared to last year. Our gas and hydro fleet continue to perform very well with economic dispatch match rate of 97.8%.","Turning to slide 7, I'm happy to report that the tax savings from our FERC regulated transmission assets will benefit our customers by an additional $175 million, adding these benefits to the $500 million of savings from our distribution operations that we discussed on last call. Our 10 million utility customers will realize over $675,000 of an annual benefit from tax reform. We're pleased that our constructive relationships with our state regulators in FERC allow us to pass these benefits back to our customers in a very timely fashion.","Flipping over to slide 8, in June, Delaware and Pennsylvania both passed important legislation that reflect our utility priorities in the present and for the future supporting infrastructure investment and positioning for the utility of the future, respectively. In Delaware, state regulators passed the Distribution System Investment Charge. This will support needed infrastructure investment to enhance the system improve service to our customers. It will provide a mechanism for a more consistent and gradual rate increase for our customers, while also allowing for a more timely recovery on our infrastructure investments. Delmarva Power, Delaware plans to make its first filing in the fourth quarter with new rates effective by the first quarter of 2019.","In Pennsylvania, Governor Wolf signed legislation authorizing the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to review and approve alternate rate mechanisms that will better position PECO to make investments in the utility of the future. The forward-looking regulatory design options in the legislation include a decoupling mechanism, formula rates, multi-year rate plans and performance-based rates. Both of these laws will help to ensure that our utilities can deploy much needed capital to support reliability and performance of the grid for our customers, while also decreasing the frequency of traditional rate cases.","I want to especially thank the broad group of stakeholders in both Delaware and Pennsylvania for the support of these laws. We look forward to finding common ground across all our jurisdictions, as we focus on improving customer service and investing in the utility of the future.","Slide 9, turning to the ZEC programs, in both Illinois and New York, we are awaiting final decision from the Federal Appeals Court. We are pleased with the Solicitor General's brief filed in the Illinois case in the Seventh Circuit, which agreed that the states have the authority to enact the ZEC programs. We remain confident in our legal position in both the cases, and continue to collect the ZEC revenues as they are being adjudicated.","In New Jersey, following Governor Murphy's signature, the Board of Public Utilities is beginning to implement the ZEC program there, which we expect to take effect around the end of the first quarter 2019.","On the Federal Energy policy front, FERC issued an order on PJM two capacity market mitigation proposals. The order rejected the two-stage capacity re-pricing of multiple RECs proposal submitted by PJM and it also determined that the existing tariff is unjust and unreasonable. Instead FERC established a new proceeding to introduce a two part proposal. The first proposal is to expand the current MOPR to ensure that most if not all plants that receive out-of-market payments will be subject to a minimum offer requirement.","The second proposal, however, would allow the plants receiving out-of-market payments to avoid the MOPR and instead be withdrawn from the market along with the commensurate amount of load. This asset specific FRR can be implemented by the states to align with the state's environmental policies. FERC has set a schedule to allowing 60 days for comments, 30 days for replies, and a goal of reaching the final decision by January 4.","We disagree that the MOPR is necessary. We are encouraged that FERC has now said that all assets receiving out-of-market payments should be treated the same. The implementation details will matter but we believe that the partial FRR design could allow states to advance their energy policy goals, which we think is critical to ensure the needed reduction in carbon emissions.","With respect to PJMs work on price formation, we continue to look forward for a decision from FERC on the fast start by September and PJM has committed to implement the rule changes in a timely fashion after the FERC order, including reengaging stakeholders on a full integral relaxation. PJM continues to work through reforms to which storage pricing rules included those related to reserves in the operating reserves demand curve pursuant to the deadlines it had set for those rule changes.","Finally on resiliency, PJM has taken the input and the assumptions and the scenarios that it needs to model in order to assess fuel security of its generation fleet. This will allow PJM to move forward on evaluating potential changes to market design to ensure that it is properly valuing the fuel security, while it awaits further direction from FERC in the open resilience docket. We see all these changes as essential to preserve the effective competitive market in PJM and we applaud the ongoing efforts to design and implement these changes.","Now, I'll turn it over to Joe and he can walk through some of the numbers.","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 10, we had a strong quarter financially, delivering adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.71 per share which is above the $0.56 per share we earned in the second quarter of 2017 as well as our guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share. Exelon's utilities less Holding Company expenses delivered a combined $0.37 per share. Compared to our plan, the utility results were better on higher distribution revenue from the approval of the Pepco Maryland settlement, a transmission revenue true-up at BG&E and favorable weather impacts at PECO.","Generation earned $0.34 per share in the second quarter, which was also better than planned. Upside came from realized gains from our nuclear decommissioning trust. Our nuclear plants had another strong quarter with fewer outage days compared to both last year and what was budgeted for this year. And we benefited from favorable market conditions including FTR settlements in PJM. These were partially offset by higher allocated transmission costs.","We are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $2.90 to $3.20 per share, which you can see on slide 19. We expect to deliver operating earnings of $0.80 to $0.90 per share in the third quarter compared with $0.85 last year.","Turning to slide 11, the $0.71 per share in the second quarter of this year was $0.15 per share higher than the second quarter of 2017. Our utility earnings were collectively up $0.04 per share compared to last year, driven primarily by higher rate base and mill rates associated with completed rate cases. Generation earnings were up $0.12 per share compared with last year benefiting from fewer planned and unplanned nuclear outage days, contributions from the Illinois ZEC program and higher realized nuclear decommissioning trust gains partially offset by lower power price realizations.","Moving to slide 12, our utilities continued to execute financially as we look at our trailing 12-month earned ROEs. Starting with PHI, we made modest gains at each utility as we continue to deliver improved operational and financial performance since the merger. Pepco's higher earnings reflect the distribution rate cases from last fall and the recent Pepco Maryland settlement that took effect on June 1, 2018.","Looking to next quarter, Pepco's earned returns should benefit from a full quarter of the Maryland settlement reached in April and a partial quarter benefit from the pending DC settlement.","Delmarva's earned ROEs now include the benefits of interim rates in Delaware that took effect in March 2018, and at Atlantic City Electric we saw higher earnings from the ACE settlement effective October 2017, which was largely offset with higher O&M and depreciation expense. We expect to see ROE improvement with full flow through of the October 2017 settlement. For all of the PHI utilities, trailing 12 month ROEs in the fourth quarter should show additional uplift as the FAS 109 changes from the fourth quarter of 2017 drop out of the calculation.","For the legacy Exelon utilities, our earned ROEs remained over 10%, lifting the consolidated utilities platform to nearly 9.5% including PHI. We are happy with our overall utility performance but still see room for improvement at PHI as the better operating performance translates into higher earned returns. And as we have said before, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plan and still expect earned ROEs in 2019 to be in the 9% to 10% range across the utilities.","Turing to slide 13, we remain busy on the regulatory front. On the last call, we discussed settlement arrangements in April at both Pepco DC and Pepco Maryland, providing revenue decreases of $24.1 million and $15 million respectively after reflecting tax savings benefits for customers. On May 31, the Maryland PSC approved the settlement for Pepco Maryland with rates effective on June 1. For Pepco DC, the Commission is expected to approve the settlement in the third quarter with rates effective shortly thereafter. We are also able to reach a settlement in our Delmarva, Delaware electric distribution case on June 27, 2018 making it the second consecutive electric case we have settled in recent history. The case will provide a $7 million revenue reduction inclusive of tax benefits. We expect a final order in the third quarter.","As Chris noted earlier, Delmarva Power, Delaware expects to make its first filing under the Distribution System Investment Charge tracker in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the new charge appearing on customer bills by the first quarter of 2019.","We also have a number of rate cases still in play. On June 8th, BG&E filed for a $63 million increase to its gas revenues and a $22 million STRIDE surcharge reset with an order expected in January 2019. BGE's continued investments in STRIDE and gas systems safety and reliability programs are driving the need for this requested increase. In Delaware, we have an outstanding gas distribution rate case at Delmarva that is scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter. In Pennsylvania, PECO filed for an electric distribution base rate case in March for the first time in three years. We expect to receive an order in the second half of this year. Finally, on April 16th, we filed for rate updates at ComEd as part of the standard annual formula process. We expect to receive an order in the fourth quarter.","We appreciate the hard work of our utilities and regulatory teams. Our investment is focused on improving system reliability and the customer experience are having positive benefits in the communities we serve. By delivering on a regulatory strategy, we're able to make these investments, while also earning a fair and timely return on the capital being deployed. More details on the rate cases and their schedules can be found on slides 27 through 33 in the Appendix.","Turning to slide 14 and continuing on the topic of capital investment at our utilities, we invested $1.3 billion of capital at the utilities during the second quarter and are at $2.6 billion year-to-date. We remain on track to meet our $5.5 billion capital budget for 2018.","Today, I would like to highlight two additional projects that are part of our overall budget and offer real benefits to our customers and communities. The first is PECO's gas main and service replacement program. The project will replace nearly 1,800 miles of gas mains and service lines of which 520 miles has already been completed.","We continue to work with the state to accelerate the implementations having shortened the replacement cycle at the start of the program from 30 years to 20 years, today. These efforts will reduce risk on the distribution system by replacing aged materials, which we believe is good for our customers.","The second project relates to BGE's investments in Trade Point Atlantic or TPA. Over the next five years BGE will invest $150 million in transmission and distribution infrastructure including construction of a 93 megawatt substation. These investments will support the new 3,100 acre commercial industrial TPA development in Baltimore County, which is projected to generate 17,000 permanent jobs, plus an additional 21,000 during construction. This project is another example of our efforts to continuously work with our states to identify and support development efforts that drive economic growth in our service territories.","Turning to slide 15, it provides our gross margin update for ExGen. This quarter we have included the New Jersey ZEC revenue in our 2019 and 2020 disclosures for the first time. Relative to our last update, we saw some movement within the buckets. Our total gross margin in each year is unchanged from our last update with the exception of an additional $50 million in both 2019 and 2020 associated with the New Jersey ZEC revenue. For 2018, open gross margin was up $100 million primarily due to higher NI Hub and PJM West Hub prices, offset by weakening ERCOT spark spreads and our hedges. We had a strong quarter in new business execution creating $200 million of Power New Business in our retail and wholesale channels as we capitalized on ERCOT volatility.","In 2019 and 2020, total gross margins are up $50 million in each year with the New Jersey ZEC revenue, which shows up in the capacity and ZEC line. Open gross margin is up $100 million in 2019 due to higher prices in New York Zone A and PJM West Hub. Open gross margin is flat in 2020. We also executed $50 million of Power New Business in 2019 and 2020.","We ended the quarter basically in line with our ratable hedging program in 2018 and 10% to 13% behind ratable in 2019 and 6% to 9% behind ratable in 2020 when considering cross commodity hedges where we have increased our concentration. We remain comfortable being more open when we look at the market fundamentals compared to forward prices particularly at NI Hub.","Turning to slide 16, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our efforts on this front have been noticed with Fitch placing Exelon, PECO, and BG&E all on positive outlook in June. Our consolidated corporate credit metrics remain above our target ranges and meaningfully above S&P thresholds. We are forecasting ExGen's leverage to be 2.6 times debt-to-EBITDA at year-end 2018, which is below our long-term target of 3.0 times.","On a recourse debt basis, we are at 2.1 times, which is well below our target. We will continue to manage our balance sheet at ExGen over time to the 3.0 debt-to-EBITDA level. So look for us to focus on debt reduction at both HoldCo and GenCo.","I will now turn the call back to Chris. Thank you.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Thanks, Joe. Turning to slide 17, again, we had a strong financial quarter and operationally that is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees. Our financial footing and sounding continues to gain momentum. Here again, I'll restate our proposition value.","We continue to focus on growing our utilities targeting 7.4% rate base growth and 6% to 8% EPS growth through 2021. We continue to use free cash from the GenCo to fund incremental equity needs at the utilities, pay down debt over the next four years at ExGen and the HoldCo and fund part of the faster dividend growth. We continue to focus on optimizing value for the ExGen business by seeking fair compensation for our carbon free generation fleet, supporting proper price formation in PJM and resiliency initiatives at FERC and working to develop capacity market reforms at PJM pursuant to the recent FRR order. We continue to close uneconomic plants and sell assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximize value through the gentle load matching. We continue to sustain strong investment-grade credit metrics, as Joe pointed out, in our growth driven consistently at 5% through 2020.","With that operator, we can now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Ali of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. The first question on the PHI utilities, what's the aspiration there? I mean, are those utilities and the way the system is set up, are they set up that they can ultimately earn their authorized ROE or will there be a permanent lag in the system and when do you think you will be at the maximum in terms of your earned versus allowed ROE (24:22)?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","So there is a lag component at a couple of the PHI utilities now that we're working on. We've talked about ACE. We think we have the right legislative package to help that reduce that in Delaware and we're also working on different proceedings at Pepco Maryland and Pepco DC. We project it to be within the 9.5% range by the end of 2019. We're on track to do that. We have the developed activities that are helping. We also have the efficiency programs we're putting in place. So, I think we're well on plan. We recognize the legacy issues that were happening around that and are having constructive dialogue with our legislators as we've done in Delaware, our regulators, as we're doing with the filing in New Jersey and we'll continue to focus on that.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then Chris to the extent that Forex proposal for PJM and the FRR aspect of it does become law and moves forward. How do you look at that relative to your portfolio and what that means for Exelon?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Well, you can imagine. I'm going to let Kathleen Barr\u00f3n cover that. But, as you can imagine, there's a lot of evaluation that we have to do right now to really choose the path that benefits our customers and our fleets. So, Kathleen?","Kathleen L. Barr\u00f3n - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ali. I think what we're facing here is markets that because they're not pricing pollution are making emitting resources look less expensive and they're pushing out clean resources, including ours, as you know, 10.6 gigawatts of uncleared nuclear in the last auction.","I think what FERC is saying in this order is that rather than letting RPM continue to push those units out, they're giving safety opportunity to pull them in and instead of paying PJM to support units that perhaps they don't want to support they can directly pay those assets. And so, as Chris said in the opening of the call, implementation details certainly matter. But we think this is an extremely constructive approach to allowing states to choose the resources, the clean resources that they need to continue to keep running to achieve the our goals of reducing carbon and air pollution for their citizens.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And last question with regards to the pending litigation in New York and Illinois, any marker we should be keeping an eye on to give us some framework of when the decision might come from either of those states?","Kathleen L. Barr\u00f3n - Exelon Corp.","Unfortunately, we have no way to know exactly when those orders will issue but the cases have been fully briefed and we expect them to issue any time. There is nothing that we know that's holding them up.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning. I'm happy we're on a first name basis now.","Daniel L. Eggers - Exelon Corp.","Thank you, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Joe, just a question for you with regard to the quarter. I mean, obviously the numbers were quite robust, but there was $0.05 of positive earnings from NDT. I mean that's not necessarily \u2013 I know that that moves around every quarter, but I wouldn't consider that necessarily the highest quality earnings. But even if you exclude that, you were still ahead of your prior guidance range. So can you just walk us through what you think sort of a clean basis and was that still in excess of your expectations?","Joseph Nigro - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. If you subtract the $0.05 for NDT, Greg, what I would say is, when you look at it overall, the midpoint of our range was $0.60. We obviously earned $0.71 on an operating basis. A little more than 50% of that was coming from the utilities. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it is driven by three things: the transmission settlement at BG&E, the yearly implementation of the rate settlement at Pepco Maryland, and as well as stable weather at PECO were the big drivers there. And then the balance was GenCo and NDT was a big piece of that but we also had favorable market conditions related to the FDR option during the quarter. Our Generation performance was stellar, and then it was offset by some transmission costs. So you could see even subtracting out the NDTs, the performance was very strong across the operating businesses.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Right. And I heard you indicate that you're \u2013 and show that you're running well below your debt to EBITDA target and thus you can address that by using your cash to \u2013 in addition to funding rate-based growth, dividend, not just think just think about paying down ExGen debt, but also working down parent debt. But there's a bigger issue here, which is that you know the FFO to debt targets that the rating agencies are holding you to seem excessively high relative to the declining risk profile of the company. What has to happen to evolve the conversation with the rating agencies to get a lower threshold? And is it really dependent on getting more certainty on capacity and energy market reforms at this point since you've shown demonstrably that you're one of the best operators on the utility side of the house in the country?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Yes. So Greg, we have been and will continue to have dialogue with all the rating agencies. You heard Joe's conversation on Fitch. We've had a good dialogue with S&P. They understand our strategy, they're wanting to see it consistently implemented. They recognize that it is being consistently implemented. I think you know a couple of milestones coming through with the final approval from the Appellate Court on the ZECs, making that revenue look much more like regulated revenue, continuing to follow our path on debt reduction, which part of that is building balance sheet space, de-risking, but also part of it is liability matching with the nuclear assets and their life into the 30s and 40s. So we just have to continue to execute on our plan. We're having very positive dialogue. We appreciate the Fitch positive. We look forward to hearing from the others and hopefully shortly that they're seeing it and we'll be able to talk about not only moving thresholds, but potentially a more positive rating.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. My last question you may have already demonstrably answered previously, but if in fact, you're given \u2013 you and the states are given the option of pursuing an FRR type structure for plants that are deemed to be important in those regions. Does the legislation that you currently have in Illinois and New Jersey for instance create the flexibility to do that or would you need to go back to your legislators and engage them in a restructuring of that legislation to give them the flexibility they would need to bring those assets out of the capacity market and properly compensate them?","Kathleen L. Barr\u00f3n - Exelon Corp.","Hey, Greg. It's Kathleen. We're currently looking at existing legislative authority in all of our states. And so I think it's going to depend on the jurisdiction. And it's also going to depend on what FERC's order ultimately says about what authority states will be to exercise in order to take advantage of this option. So I think, it's going to differ depending on the state. But we're currently evaluating the best path forward in each of the states that have clean energy targets that we think this order will help them meet.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you all. Have a great day.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Hey, Chris.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Hi.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Just I guess, you know it's hard to kind of interpret a lot of these FERC proposals in different directions. You also had the Mystic decision. And so, maybe you can just give a broader perspective of what they're trying to achieve here and just what could change versus this initial proposal before we hear kind of I guess a final structure by early next year?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. So the fight \u2013 the disagreement within the stakeholders is around the supplemental income that is being received for the social benefit of carbon reduction within our states. We lack a federal policy as you know on carbon, although the conversation continues and that would be the ultimate fix. That would really level the playing field and allow the states to skip (34:15) support of federal policy. Short of that, the states have deemed \u2013 the majority of states that we operate in that they want to preserve the low carbon output that they have.","They understand that 60% of the power in the State of Illinois is carbon-free, 90% of that is nuclear. We start shutting down nuclear plants like you look at the FE announcement, every penny that's been spent in PJM and outside of PJM on REX to achieve a lower carbon output would be wiped out. It's like we threw the money away. So you've got a very passionate belief within some of our states that they want to keep these assets. PJM has been unable under the current tariffs to be able to separate and support at this point the environmental needs of their stakeholders. So what this allows from FERC is a positive move to say if the administration and the legislation in New Jersey wants to preserve a low carbon future for its state and for its citizens. It allows Illinois to do the same thing. If New York wanted to look at something, it could do something for New York. So I think, this is finally setting the final decision on how we manage these assets that may be out of the capacity revenue stream, not clearing, but the state wants to keep them. We had Secretary Perry at the FitzPatrick Plant yesterday with Congressman Katko and it was very positive. I mean we are gaining momentum, but not only in his opening comments, in the press conference and with our tour in discussion with local officials, is he concerned about the economic benefits of the plant. He's concerned about the reliability and the resiliency on the fuel diversity and he's also commented on their capabilities for low carbon.","So you've seen us go back and forth between ZECs and between other programs to try to save. We've seen the arguments from other stakeholders against it and I think this gives us a path to finally put it to bed.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just one other question on it, if you were to get into kind of an FRR structure like, do you have any sense on like how long that would be i.e., you know if that's kind of a form of reregulation of the plant, is that for good, is that for you know a set amount of time like the ZECs are?","Kathleen L. Barr\u00f3n - Exelon Corp.","Yeah. Steve, I'll jump in on that, that's certainly one of the implementation details that will be worked out through the FERC docket, but it's important to know we're not talking about reload (37:27) regulation, we're talking about an alternative way to pay the units for capacity, and let the states choose which units they'd like to pay for capacity as opposed to letting RPM select the assets. So it's a step towards the future that Chris identified, that we anticipate will be short-term. The current FRR structure as you know allows units or zones to step out of RPM for a five year period with the option to come back in. And ultimately if we get this to the longer term carbon solution that Chris identified, then these decisions will be made by the market through a carbon price and that will be a longer term structure that will benefit our customers.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Good morning, Julien, how are you doing?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good. Great. Thank you. Just to clarify the last question actually if we can start there. I just want to make sure I'm hearing this correctly. Is your expectation that states would actually move through the motions to file for this FRR or is it rather that your expectation that status quo would maintain itself with respect to just continue to clear assets or attempt to clear assets given wherever your avoided costs might be?","Kathleen L. Barr\u00f3n - Exelon Corp.","Julien, it's Kathleen. I think it's the former that we would expect states to be looking very closely at this opportunity, not just because of course of the nuclear [Technical Difficulty] (39:02) the renewable fleet effects, any asset efficiency demand response that's receiving support from customers directly. And so there are a lot of stakeholders who have an interest in making sure that the states are going to be able to do clean capacity procurements and have that capacity recognized by RPM \u2013 by PJM rather.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And you've confidence that you can indeed find a way from a regulatory path to support an FRR implementation including compensation for the units, if that's where it goes in both Illinois and New Jersey, to be clear?","Kathleen L. Barr\u00f3n - Exelon Corp.","Yes, sir.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, excellent. Now, let me turn back to the utility side of the equation here where things are booming obviously. Can you comment on the New Jersey side with CapEx? I mean we've talked a lot about New Jersey in the context of the nuclear plants, but obviously the Governor is implementing a lot more than that, maybe energy efficiency filings, offshore wind seems to generate some opportunities at ACE. Just curious how you're thinking about that and what's reflected in the budget as it stands today?","Anne R. Pramaggiore - Exelon Corp.","Hi, Julien, it's Anne Pramaggiore. How are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good, thank you.","Anne R. Pramaggiore - Exelon Corp.","Good morning. On the New Jersey side, obviously with the new legislation, there's a couple of areas that we're looking into, it's subject to \u2013 a lot of it's subject to regulatory proceedings that are yet to come. So you would not see what we would be looking at reflected in the budgets or the earnings to-date. But there's an area around energy efficiency, we traditionally have not been involved in energy efficiency programs except for some program funding in the past, and that's one of the things we'll look toward going forward.","So to the extent that there's capital investment in energy efficiency, voltage conservation programs, you could start to see those reflected going forward. We also have opportunity to invest in storage and solar going forward in New Jersey. But again, these are all subject to proceedings, at the commission before we have a sense of exactly what that looks like. But we think there's tremendous opportunity here especially as we think about utility of the future, the kind of businesses that we can be in looking forward, serving customers with the types of programs and products and services that they like. So we think there's a great platform there, but some work to do with the regulatory agency.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","The only thing I'd add to that is, we have a very high sensitivity to rates on our customers. As you know that that part of the state has gone through a downturn. And so as we make the investments which we can do efficiently, we're going to keep a constant focus on those rates. So we're not impairing the future development of commercial, industrial or residential customers.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Thank you all very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Hi, Mike.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Can you talk a little bit about what your expectations are for the summer power market in Texas, given I guess it's gotten off to kind of a mild start? And then also talk about the recent acquisition on the retail side that you guys executed with FES and what the implications are for Constellation from that?","James McHugh - Exelon Corp.","Okay. Hi, Michael. It's Jim McHugh from Constellation. As far as ERCOT summer, what we've seen is some volatility in the forward markets and the weekly markets going into delivery and even in the day ahead markets, we've seen some pricing that exhibited on the ORDC curve, some higher price spikes. In the real-time market, it hasn't come to fruition. So it's led to a large spread between day ahead and real-time. In real-time, we really saw great operating conditions. The wind performed at or better than forecast. There were minimal generation force outages, so the generators all performed very well, and there were some good demand response availability.","But prior to going into the period, we saw weeks trading as high as $800 or $900 and the month of July and August trading in the $200 range. As far as our portfolio, performed well, we're able to take advantage of some of that market volatility we saw in the forward markets. You saw that we executed $200 million of new business this quarter for 2018 on the power side, a good chunk of that is represented by our activity in Texas and what we're able to do and our gen-to-load strategy proved valuable once again. We were able to serve the high load and the high demand with our peaking fleet and the options that we owned.","Going forward, I think we expect that volatility to continue. You'll have continued demand growth of 1 gigawatt to 1.5 gigawatts a year with really some wind and solar build out and very little thermal gas combined cycle generation build out. So that volatility will continue, next summer is trading right around the $100 right now and we would expect you would see the same exhibited volatility on the forward curve between now and delivery period of next summer.","For the acquisition of FirstEnergy, it's a great fit for our portfolio. We would be paying $140 million subject to price adjustments based on market moves before the process is over. But there's 900,000 customers on the C&I side and residential side across six states. It'd be a great fit for our gen-to-load and gen-to-customer strategy that we've been deploying. We'd also be buying some certain power in basis hedges as part of the process. So it's a strong complement to our existing portfolio and it would provide repeatable and sustainable customer business through renewals and brand recognition for us.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, just a quick follow-up. I think you said that earlier in the call that you're a little closer to ratable in hedging for 2020 I think it was versus 2019. And I'm just wondering, should I be reading anything into that that you're becoming closer to ratable as you go further out, is that sort of a negative take on the power markets or?","James McHugh - Exelon Corp.","No, Michael, it's not. It's actually we're just building that position, as we hedged the third year of our three year program, we'll continue to grow that behind ratable position. We're currently about 7% or 8% behind ratable in 2020. We've added some gas hedges and cross-commodity hedges to further expose ourselves to upside in power markets. The concentration of our behind ratable position is largely in NI Hub and ERCOT. So I wouldn't read into that. I think our position is similar and growing to be similar across both those years.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Praful of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Hi.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So just wanted to get a sense for getting back to the capacity auction on the capacity market reform piece. If the states are required to kind of support the asset both from the ZEC payment as well as (46:33), are there any winners, losers in terms of states, I think would make it more difficult to get done especially in this timeframe. Are there some states who will be more inclined to get this versus others?","Kathleen L. Barr\u00f3n - Exelon Corp.","I can take that one as well. It's certainly going to depend on the state's readiness, how quickly this gets implemented. So I take the question to be one of what kind of transition period might we be looking at, and I think that's going to be a subject of active debate in the paper hearing at FERC, as to whether there needs to be some sort of transition period to allow states to understand what the rules are and take advantage of them. So I think you should look for that to play out as part of the FERC process.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thank you. And then in terms of ERCOT, if the volatility clearly has been high, should we expect that if there are retail players struggling at the back end of extreme volatility that you're looking to expand your retail position or is there any goals that you see to kind of expand your portfolio position in ERCOT at all?","James McHugh - Exelon Corp.","Hi Praful, it's Jim again. I think we did see going into the summer, one small retailer go out of business with the new collateral posting requirements by ERCOT, which include a look at the forward markets. It might be harder for some of the smaller retail providers to manage their balance sheet if they're undercapitalized through those collateral requirements. For us, I think strategy is the same. We'll look for good value propositions. Our track record with Integrys and Con Ed and what we're looking at now with the FES book will continue to be the same to look for value. As far as the lag effect, you may see the impact of the volatility for the larger players impact maybe in the longer term as the contract tenures and the extended start dates are further out in the curve. So they're currently contracting for load out two or three years forward.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks. And just quickly just, I mean, ExGen O&M cost reductions, I noticed their target, I think 75% in 2018, 50% by 2019. Is that all on track right now?","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","It's not only on track, it's Crane, Praful, it's not only on track. We are continuing to work to become more efficient, continue to compete in the markets we're in. We are on track to achieve those if not to exceed those, so we're in good shape.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Excellent. Good to hear. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Thank you so much. I would like to turn the call over back to speaker, Chris Crane. Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher M. Crane - Exelon Corp.","Yes. Thanks. And thanks again for everybody joining the call. As you can see from the strategy that we put together years ago, we're right on track, if not ahead of schedule and we will continue to keep you updated. Look forward to the third quarter calls, but also Dan and Joe and I are getting back out and making sure we drop in and answer any of your questions, so making ourselves available during the third quarter will be a big part of our plan to continue to communicate. We thank you very much and have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
