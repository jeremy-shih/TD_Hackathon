All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Bujnicki, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.","David Bujnicki","Good morning, and thank you for joining Kimco\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me on the call are Conor Flynn, our Chief Executive Officer; Ross Cooper, President and Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, Kimco\u2019s CFO; David Jamieson, our Chief Operating Officer; as well as other members of our executive team that are present and available to answer questions during the call.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking, and it\u2019s important to note that the company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company\u2019s SEC filings that address such factors.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco\u2019s operating results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Investor Relations area of our website.","And with that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. With the release of our second quarter results, it\u2019s clear that our 2020 Vision is becoming a reality, as we continue to execute and create long-term value for our shareholders. We made solid progress on our portfolio leasing, as well as our Signature Series platform, positioning us to drive FFO and EBITDA growth, reduce leverage and improve our dividend coverage.","We also have the benefit of balance sheet flexibility and liquidity with no significant debt maturities coming due until 2021. Our team is committed to achieving our goals and putting us in a position of strength as new opportunities emerge.","Now for some highlights and some observations. The progress on our Signature Series is more and more visible, as our renderings turn into realities. Just this month, The Witmer, Kimco\u2019s residential tower at our mixed-use Pentagon Centre project secured its Temporary Certificate of Occupancy. Pre-leasing activity has exceeded our expectations as we now have leases for 46% of the units, with tenants moving in ahead of schedule.","We\u2019re benefiting from the property\u2019s adjacent location to the future Amazon National Landing headquarters, a project that is still several years away, but it\u2019s already driving a significant increase in both residential and retail demand. It\u2019s exciting to see this first phase of our Pentagon Centre redevelopment project come to life, and we\u2019re equally excited about the future phases still to come.","Going forward, the majority of our capital allocation will be on redevelopment, including selective mixed-use opportunities, where we see better risk-adjusted returns. Currently, we have over 4,000 apartment units entitled and see many more opportunities to expand this across our portfolio, as we seek out the highest and best use of our real estate.","Just this quarter, we achieved additional entitlement approvals for 350 apartments at our Boca Raton asset, where we\u2019ve executed a ground lease with a well-capitalized, local multifamily developer.","As for our operating portfolio, leasing volume remains robust, as our portfolio and our leasing team continue to shine. Overall, shopping center demand remains strong for the right real estate. New leasing spreads came in this quarter at 37% and combined spreads were 7.9%. We believe Kimco is at the hard corner of where value meets convenience, which as Milton likes to say, is a sweet spot of retail real estate.","We\u2019re seeing continued demand as our occupancy level matched its record high of 96.2%, with a healthy level of interest for potential spaces we may recapture. Given the continued strength of our portfolio, we\u2019re comfortable raising our same-store NOI range for the year.","Recognizing that retail continues to evolve in a rapid pace, we continue to position our portfolio in dense markets and key growth MSAs, where we see the most favorable supply and demand dynamic and redevelopment potential. In addition, as buy online pick up in-store trend continues. more emphasis is being placed on the physical store, as retailers realize their tremendous value as fulfillment hubs for their digital business.","Target, for example, indicated on their most recent earnings call that store fulfillment is more than 40% cheaper than fulfilling orders from warehouses, and there\u2019s in-store sales per square foot and growing at a rate of 4% per year. It\u2019s further evidence that brick-and-mortar can support incremental growth from online business without hurting in-store sales. While Target, along with Home Depot, are ahead of the pack in their seamless integration of e-commerce with bricks-and-mortar, the pack is moving in the right direction.","E-retailers across the spectrum are partnering with brick-and-mortar retailers like Kohl\u2019s and Target. They are leveraging these locations to gain returns, which in turn is driving up foot traffic. While some retailers will be unable to pivot and embrace the change, quality real estate will allow the nimble retailers to adapt to the new normal and find the right merchandising mix to drive traffic at all points of the day.","While we\u2019ve discussed this before, we have many unique attributes that support our proven approach. Beyond the quality of our locations and our team, we have many below-market leases, great tenant diversity and a proven ability to reinvent and transform our business as we have done over the last five decades.","At Kimco, our focus is to look forward and anticipate the future of retail and be one of the leaders in providing the right real estate. I would like to thank our team for working tirelessly in a challenging environment. This group never ceases to amaze me for what they can accomplish. The greater the challenge, the more they rise to the occasion.","Finally, I\u2019m proud that Kimco ranks at the top of all retail for both social and environmental progress and the ESG rankings by ISS and through our recent inclusion in the FTSE4Good Index Series. This is further evidence of a culture that not only wants to be the best in its sector, it also wants to do things the right way for our people, our shareholders and the next generation of stakeholders in our efforts to create long-term sustained value. Ross?","Ross Cooper","Thank you, Conor, and good morning. We continued our modest level of transactions in the second quarter, selling three shopping centers for a total gross price of $103.7 million, with $65.8 million at Kimco\u2019s share. Subsequent to quarter-end, we sold another two joint venture assets with a gross value of $43.6 million, with Kimco\u2019s share being approximately $6.5 million.","Given the level of dispositions completed so far this year, as well as the anticipated closings in the back-half of the year, we are comfortable at the high-end of the dispositions range of $200 million to $300 million. Our strategy has been paying off as the core portfolio continues to shine and provide stability and upside for the company.","Notwithstanding the success, we will keep with the strategy of being active asset managers of our portfolio, where we envision risk or downside to a property, or where we believe we have maxed out value for that center, we have moved them to the market and out of the portfolio.","Our recent transaction activity demonstrates that demand for our assets remains very healthy, of particular note with the level of interest in our Latham, New York asset. Located in upstate New York and with a deal price north of $73 million, the solid quality and depth of the bitter pool reinforces our view that the marketplace \u2013 the market places significant value on open air shopping centers.","Moreover, our buyer was able to obtain attractive financing, which continues to be readily available for our product type. With the 10-year treasury rates approximately 120 basis points below the 52-week high, borrowing costs remain favorable for the levered buyer. As it relates to core market institutional quality assets, demand outweighs supply in the marketplace and pricing reflects this.","Recent transactions in Northern California and Texas have traded at sub-5% cap rates. A significantly larger wholesale club anchored center in Palm Beach, Florida, as well as a recent grocery anchored portfolio priced at just under $500 million in the Mid Atlantic region, both recently traded in the 5% cap rate range.","While we have seen many examples of single asset sales at very low cap rates, it is encouraging to see a larger size portfolio also pricing very aggressively. While we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities, we did not acquire any assets in the second quarter and do not anticipate buying any properties in the current quarter.","Given the aggressive landscape for high-quality core market assets, we continue to see our best risk-adjusted return and the reinvestment in our best assets. This includes repositioning and strengthening the retail, while also adding mixed-use densification where appropriate.","Overall, the progress we\u2019re making has been positive and very exciting for our company, as we continue to hit new goals and milestones for the portfolio and the Signature Series assets.","I will now pass it off to Glenn for a look into the financial results for the quarter.","Glenn Gary Cohen","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid performance. Our portfolio operating metrics of occupancy, leasing spreads and same-site NOI growth, all generated positive results. The cash flows from our Signature Series development projects are ramping up and will continue to be significant contributors to our growth as they reach stabilization over the next 24 months.","Now to some details of the second quarter results. As a reminder, as a result of the NAREIT FFO definition clarification, we no longer include gains and losses from land sales, marketable securities and preferred equity investments in NAREIT FFO. We are presenting prior periods to conform to the selection. These transaction items were previously excluded from FFO as adjusted and therefore have no impact on that calculation.","NAREIT FFO was $161.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share for the second quarter 2019, as compared to $158.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share in the second quarter last year. Included in the second quarter 2019 NAREIT FFO, but excluded from FFO as adjusted, is $1 million of property insurance proceeds related to claims from our Puerto Rico portfolio associated with Hurricane Maria.","Included in the second quarter 2018 NAREIT FFO, but excluded from FFO as adjusted, is $2.8 million, primarily from an equity distribution above our basis. FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO was $150.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share for the second quarter 2019, as compared to $155.7 million, or $0.37 per diluted share for the same period last year.","Our results include a decrease in NOI of $10.9 million compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to the significant level of dispositions during 2018. This impact from the dispositions was $16.1 million, which was partially offset by same-site NOI growth of $5.2 million and incremental NOI from our development projects of $3.4 million. FFO also benefited from lower interest expense attributable to lower debt levels and lower non-real estate-related amortization, as compared last year\u2019s second quarter.","For the 2019 six-month period, NAREIT FFO was $0.74 per diluted share and included $2 million of transaction income items not included in FFO as adjusted. This compares to $0.76 per diluted share for the same period last year, which includes $6.4 million of transactional income items not included in FFO as adjusted.","FFO as adjusted for the 2019 six-month period was $307.6 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, compared to $313.5 million, or $0.74 per diluted share for the six-month period last year. Our six-month results include a reduction in NOI of $12 million. This includes dispositions, which reduced NOI by $36.2 million, partially offset by same-site NOI growth of $13.3 million, incremental NOI contribution of $6.9 million from our development projects coming online and higher lease termination fees of $4.3 million.","FFO was also impacted by the adoption of the new lease accounting standard Topic 842, which requires the expensing of internal leasing and legal costs, which were previously capitalized.","Included in G&A for the 2019 six-month period is $5.7 million of previously capitalized costs compared to the same period last year. FFO for the six months benefited from lower interest expense of $9.3 million versus the comparable period last year due to lower debt levels.","There is no doubt that our efforts to transform the portfolio are proving effective. Our high-quality operating portfolio is generating strong recurring results. Pro-rata occupancy increased to 96.2%, up 20 basis points from last quarter and from a year ago. The improvement is primarily attributable to positive net absorption from the strong leasing activity during the quarter.","We signed 324 leases totaling 1.6 million square feet at a weighted average base rent of $18.11 during the second quarter. Pro-rata occupancy now stands at 98.2% and pro-rata small shop occupancy is 90.5%, up 10 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively, compared to a year ago.","Same-site NOI growth was positive 2.5% for the second quarter 2019 versus a comp of 3.9%, including 10 basis points from redevelopments last year. The increase was driven by minimum rent increases, which contributed 310 basis points and percentage rents and other revenues adding 10 basis points. This growth was offset by lower CAM and real estate tax recoveries of 70 basis points.","For the 2019 six-month period same-site NOI growth was positive 3.2% versus a comp of 3.2% last year. Our spread between same-site leased occupancy and economic occupancy increased 40 basis points to 270 basis points from last quarter based on the active leasing volume completed.","From a balance sheet perspective, we have no consolidated debt maturing in 2019 and only $102 million of mortgage debt maturing in 2020. We have one joint venture mortgage totaling $27 million maturing in the third quarter 2019 have and \u2013 have an executed term sheet to refinance this mortgage.","Our weighted average debt maturity profile is now just under 10 years and our liquidity position is in excellent shape with over $2.2 billion of immediate liquidity. Based on our first-half performance and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our NAREIT FFO and FFO as adjusted diluted per share guidance range of $1.44 to $1.48.","In addition, we are raising our full-year guidance range for same-site NOI growth from 1.75% to 2.5% to an increased range of 2% to 2.7%. We remain on track to successfully achieve our 2019 goals, notwithstanding the impact over \u2013 of over $1 billion of dispositions in non-core assets over the past 18 months and also the lease accounting change.","And with that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] So those instructions in mind, please hold while we assemble our roster. And this first question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi.","Christy McElroy","Good morning, everyone. With the stock price performance what it\u2019s been this year, what are your current views on where your stock trades today and potentially using equity issuance as a tool to raise capital to further sharp the balance sheet and fund the development pipeline?","Conor Flynn","Hey, Christy. Yes, we have been pleased with the stock price performance so far this year, but we still trade at a discount to NAV. We\u2019ve been looking at that carefully as we go forward and think we have some major milestones to hit this year to really execute on the 2020 Vision.","We have the funding in place from our dispositions for our redevelopment and development pipeline this year and no real debt maturities. So we continue to think that as we execute, we\u2019ll be rewarded, and hopefully our share price continues to trade closer to and hopefully above NAV. There is still pretty significant disconnect between where we trade and where assets are trading in the private market today.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then just on re-leasing spreads in the second quarter, the spread on renewals and options was lighter at 4% versus the trailing 12-month piece, which has been over 6%. Did it have anything to do with the mix of options exercises in the quarter or what sort of drove that?","David Jamieson","Yes, Christy, this is Dave Jamieson. Great question. This quarter, actually, we had the highest number of small shop renewals, when you compare this quarter versus trailing eight, which had a \u2013 which in turn had an impact on the overall spreads itself.","The reason for that is, if small shops typically are slightly shorter in term, they do have annual increases. So they typically operate closer to market. So when they do come up for renewal, you tend to see that spread being slightly less than what an anchor box should be when you look at our new lease anchor spreads as being significantly higher.","Christy McElroy","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. Last quarter, you had mentioned that you were on track to deliver $16 million to $18 million incremental NOI. I wonder, are you \u2013 is that holding or has it increased or decreased?","Conor Flynn","That\u2019s correct, Craig. We still are on track to deliver $16 million to $18 million of incremental NOI. We\u2019re comfortable with that range. And as you\u2019ve seen our projects and you\u2019ve been on site on a few, we continue to be enthusiastic that the Signature Series pipeline is really delivering.","Craig Schmidt","And then just on the buy online pick up in-store, how many retailers can be involved in that in terms of one shopping center?","Conor Flynn","I think it can be significant. I mean, we\u2019re in the early days of the retailers implementing it, some of the larger, the first movers are adapting quicker. But when you look at what\u2019s happening with e-tailers coming in and partnering with physical brick-and-mortar retailers, I think, there\u2019s a lot that can happen where the last-mile distribution hub becomes the shopping center.","And when you think about all the different types of retailers that sit in a shopping center today, it really lends itself for being that, that most convenient point of either pickup or delivery. So we\u2019re watching it closely. We continue to think that that\u2019s what\u2019s going to work in the long-term for retail and have been reinvesting in those assets.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Jeremy Metz with Bank of America, no, no, just BMO rather?","Jeremy Metz","Hey, guys. You\u2019ve always had a good start to the year. You\u2019re running ahead of your initial expectations on the core, so you raised the same-store here for the second straight quarter. I was just wondering if you could comment some of the drivers between hitting that high and low-end. And in that, what are you baking in for Dress Barn in terms of the timing there? What sort of impact that\u2019s going to have?","Glenn Gary Cohen","So in terms of Dress Barn, there\u2019s really nothing that\u2019s baked in into the 2019 number. Their plan right now is to operate the stores and pay rent through the end of the year. So there\u2019s no real impact to that.","In terms of the highs and lows, again, we are continuing to watch and be careful about what\u2019s happening in the retail environment. So, again, watching with the impact of tenants and any further fallout will hit the low-end of the range, again, the leased up and the continued rent commencement is coming online helps us towards the higher-end of that range.","Jeremy Metz","All right. And I guess, I just want to go back to Dress Barn if \u2013 when they do stop, maybe what sort of impact do you think and what is the mark-to-market there? What would be the impact, I guess if they stop at year-end? I mean, how impactful would this be to next year?","Glenn Gary Cohen","So on an annualized basis, the Dress Barn impact on AVR is about 16 basis points. It would have an impact on small shop occupancy, it could be up to 42 basis points. So that\u2019s something that we want to be mindful of.","That said, what we\u2019re seeing is great opportunities already with the backfills. And so what this does is, it always gives us an opportunity to pre-lease these boxes prior to us recapturing them and knowing that this has been an event that\u2019s been forthcoming for sometime. We had a fairly substantial runway in terms of managing the fallout and then pre-leasing. So I think when we come towards the end of the year and into 2020, we should be in pretty good shape with new leases in place.","Conor Flynn","Jeremy, it\u2019s 13 locations, 16 basis points. So we feel pretty comfortable with being able to pre-lease some of those before the end of the year, hit the ground running.","Jeremy Metz","Excellent.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.","Derek Johnston","Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Similarly, can we get an update on Forever 21 and what is going on there and the size of the boxes that you have in general?","Conor Flynn","Yes, sure. Forever 21, we had very limited impact exposure at Forever 21. We have one out in California and then we do have a lease that we did sign with Forever 21 at any point back in 2017.","What we\u2019re seeing thus far is actually what we have in place, especially the one at Dania is the position that they probably want to be in going for smaller and box size in the open air environment, lifestyle environment, which could be advantageous.","As it relates to that in our conversations with them, they\u2019re actually fully under construction and anticipate opening into the back-half of this year. So nothing\u2019s changed there. The one we have in \u2013 out in California is one that\u2019s actually expiring with a significant below-market opportunity So we\u2019re actually very enthusiastic about getting that one back when that lease rolls.","Derek Johnston","All right, thank you. And how do you guys think about balancing AFFO payout ratio really with the attractive value creation initiatives in front of you, specifically, Phase 2 at Pentagon Centre? I mean, is there any \u2013 so, Christy talked about equity, I mean, is there any appetite to possibly increase leverage here a bit, maybe adjust economics with partners, or any other unique funding methods Albertsons or such being contemplated to kind of push these projects forward in this rate environment?","Conor Flynn","I think when you look at our opportunities going forward, you\u2019re right, they are numerous. And what we\u2019ve elected to do for our shareholders is to entitle as many projects as possible. I think that really starts the process of unlocking the potential of the asset. And then we look at each asset individually about how do we fund it and how do we look at the economics of supply and demand where our cost of capital sits before we hit the go button.","As I mentioned in my remarks, we are taking the approach of using ground leases for a number of our multifamily opportunities, that allows us to get the benefit of having residents live on-site to get a cap rate compression of adding a mixed use component to the entire NOI stream. And on \u2013 and we\u2019re going to continue to monitor where we trade versus our NAV, and we do have funding sources from our dispositions that are matching up with our needs.","So right now, we feel like we have a very comfortable position. We have been talking to our partners about opportunities and mixed use, and there\u2019s no lack of capital for multifamily development right now. So that is something that we\u2019ve seen and we continue to monitor to see what\u2019s the best use of our funds, as well as matching up with the right partners.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill","Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to come back to maybe the 2020 Vision and specifically, the the ramp for the new properties that are coming online. You\u2019ve made some really good progress in headline operating metrics moving higher. But FFO growth is still negative. I recognize a lot of that has to do with property sales and development. But as you think about that ramp, could you maybe help us think about that trajectory over the next 12, 18, 24 months or so?","Glenn Gary Cohen","I guess, first, take a step back and \u2013 your comment about FFO growth. When you look at the accounting change and the impact it\u2019s had to the this year versus last year, if you back that out, actually, we\u2019re actually showing growth. So that will take that point and address it.","On the developments and redevelopments that are coming online, we do believe that that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the FFO growth for us in a year, where we are dealing with a billion dollars of dilution from last year.","And so when you combine the combination of the core portfolio producing the results that we\u2019ve done so far this year and the developments and redevelopments coming online that $16 million to $18 million of incremental NOI this year, and then 2020, we have another $15 million coming online, we feel like we\u2019re in really good shape, because it\u2019s very visible growth. And that\u2019s really what puts our EBITDA and our FFO on a growth path that we feel very comfortable with. And that really brings down our leverage and improves our AFFO coverage ratio.","Richard Hill","Got it. That that\u2019s helpful. And just one more question, if I may. On Puerto Rico, I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s touched upon that in a while. Any updates there? And what are you seeing in the financing market? The CMBS market seems to be wide open for strips in the U.S., but any loosening credit for Puerto Rican assets?","Conor Flynn","Yes. Well, first off, in terms of the operations of our Puerto Rico portfolio, I can tell you that it\u2019s been well above expectations. We continue to see occupancy actually increasing and the performance of our tenants are doing very well. So the Puerto Rican centers are doing fairly well.","To your point, there have not been any real transaction activity that we\u2019ve seen. We have stayed in touch with the market and lenders, while our assets are unencumbered. We do believe that there is financing available for assets in Puerto Rico. We have heard of equity sources that have been looking in Puerto Rico. But we\u2019re very comfortable with our portfolio with where we sit today. So we\u2019ll continue to manage that the best we can and continue to track the market if any activity starts to stir up there.","Richard Hill","Got it. Thanks very much for that transparency on both those questions.","Conor Flynn","Got it.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI.","Samir Khanal","Hey, good morning, guys. I guess, Conor, if you look at Albertsons today and you look at their metrics and then the reported earnings, I mean, financial or better, profitability seems to be trending in the right direction, net debt-to-EBITDA is coming down a little bit. I mean, I guess, I just want to kind of get your view on kind of gross or maybe over the last six months what your view on the grocer is?","Conor Flynn","We\u2019re very pleased with Albertsons results. So when you look at their performance and the positive same-store sales, they really set out some significant milestones that hit this year, and that hit all the ones that they\u2019ve laid out. Ray, you want to comment a little bit on the bonds and what we [Multiple Speakers]","Raymond Edwards","Yes, sure. I mean, they \u2013 as you saw, they announced their quarterly earnings yesterday. And subsequent to that, a couple of the bond, analysts have upgraded their bonds, showing how the leverage coming down. And if you saw from their press release at six quarters of same-site growth in their stores, EBITDA is down over two years of a $2.5 billion.","So we\u2019re doing everything in the right direction to put us in a situation to go forward with an IPO at the right time. I mean, we \u2013 our CEO just started in May or April, and he\u2019s been very well received by Wall Street and management. So, I think we\u2019re putting all the pieces in place to \u2013 with good healthy equity markets to execute on an IPO, hopefully, in the near-term versus the longer-term.","Samir Khanal","Okay. Thanks, guys. That\u2019s it for me.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, good morning. I was just wondering in terms of the occupancy, it\u2019s pretty high now at 96.2% on the pro-rata basis. So I was just wondering, going into 2020, do you think that that ends up being a headwind, or do you think that it is possible to increase it further as we move forward?","Conor Flynn","Sure. What we see right now on our box activity going forward and into the back-half of this year is very encouraging. So I think we could continue to see the potentially the lease economic occupancy actually widen a little bit further, in which case, so that would create new opportunities for rent flows in the back-half of 2020 and then going into 2021.","As it relates to this year, in particular for the second-half the year, for those that are forecasted to actually start rent flowing on an annualized basis, it\u2019s about $16 million of cash flow. And for the back-half of this year, we expect about $4 million of that to hit 2019 alone. So we feel very good about where we stand today.","Glenn Gary Cohen","There\u2019s still clearly some upside in the small shop occupancy. I mean, we\u2019re at 90.5%. We have leased up that\u2019s got to get done on the Paylesses that have vacated and there\u2019s more \u2013 with the balances of the Paylesses are going to vacate in the third quarter.","Ross Cooper","Yes. So on the payless the one thing we will be anticipating or we will be facing in Q3 is about 10 basis point impact on the remaining 19 Paylesses to vacate this quarter. Obviously, again, we\u2019ve been prepared for that. So we\u2019re in the process of backfilling and pre-leasing those spaces themselves.","So on the small shop side, you\u2019ll continue to see a bit of an ebb and flow. But to Glenn\u2019s point, there\u2019s upside, Dress Barn, as we already mentioned, could be another potential headwind for 2020, but we have a fairly long runway right now to address that. So all in all, we feel very good about the environment that we\u2019re in. The quality of our standards are really shining through as it relates to this activity.","Glenn Gary Cohen","This is an incredible demand environment that we\u2019re in right now. When you look at the the vacancies that we currently have in our portfolio and the activity that we have on them, it\u2019s really encouraging to see the different sectors, really there\u2019s a dynamic across multiple sectors, it\u2019s not concentrated in just one retail sector, which is exciting.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it on that great demand side. I guess, just back to some of the topics on watch list tenants, some of the ones that we\u2019ve seen in the news that could be closing stores, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re in the Kimco portfolio, though, in terms of closures. So it\u2019d be like Bed Bath & Beyond, Pier 1, Party City, I guess within the Kimco portfolio, do you expect headwinds from those tenants?","Conor Flynn","Yes, each of those have their own story that we watch closely and we stress test our same-site and our guidance in our budgets constantly to understand what the total impact could be. So whenever we go through our budget process, we\u2019re constantly stress testing what\u2019s worst case, what\u2019s best case.","The way we treat these is truly a case-by-case basis and lease-by-lease and really is supply demand. And within that, it\u2019s something that we have to constantly monitor and be proactive about. But we stay very close to the retailers, very closely expanding retailers to make sure that we manage it appropriately.","Glenn Gary Cohen","I think one of the examples I always point to is the Sears Kmart experience that we saw, we only got two locations back. So we only \u2013 we have 11 remaining. And the reason for that is, because we have great locations with below-market leases. So even when a tenant goes through a restructuring, they typically want to hold on to the locations that give them the best opportunity for sales growth. And so we\u2019ve been seeing that the stickiness of our leases is actually pretty strong.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. Good morning. So when you look at the lease spread page in your supplemental, you guys categorized about 20% of your leases as non-comparable. Just curious what makes those leases non-comparable? And I ask that, because if I look at the TI usage as a percent of rental value, which is the way we always look at it, it was 16% for what you call comparable, but 26% for what you call non-comparable. So just trying to understand that bucket a little better?","Glenn Gary Cohen","Sure. The difference between comparable and non-comparable is the timing when the prior tenant vacated. So we have a 16-month window between non-comparable and comparable. For example, if the lease went out six months ago and you backfill that lease within that window, it would then be comparable. On the other side, if it went out 18 to 24 months ago and then we just backfilled it today, that would be deemed non-comparable.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And\u2026","Conor Flynn","One other thing to keep in mind is those non-comparable leases obviously have been vacant for an extended period of time. So it\u2019s nice to see some significant activity in some of those boxes that have been sitting vacant for an extended period.","Ki Bin Kim","Right. And I don\u2019t want to lose sight of that whether the lease price is a little bit weaker than what\u2019s comparable or not, you\u2019re getting a lease. But just for some color, what does the leases spread look like for the non-comparable bucket?","Glenn Gary Cohen","It varies. I mean, it\u2019s such a case-by-case basis. So it\u2019s really hard. The reason why we have comparable leases is, because it\u2019s more of an apples-to-apples comparison about a true newly spread \u2013 renewal spread versus what a non-comparable is.","Ki Bin Kim","All right. And just last question. How often is it the case where tenants are willing to renew, maybe at higher rents, but coming back to you and saying, \u201cWhat, we don\u2019t need 30,000 square feet, we only need 20,000.\u201d And how is that happening?","Conor Flynn","Downsizing has not been something we have been seeing across the portfolio. When you look back at some of the retailers that have gone through a downsizing, you look at what Best Buy did back in the day of trying to take their box from 45,000 square feet down to 30,000 square feet. And then they quickly realized that the disruption that occurs inside the box doesn\u2019t justify the cost, as well as the repositioning, and they don\u2019t see any pickup in sales in terms of productivity.","So a lot of what we\u2019ve seen actually is retailers that theoretically want to downsize have come back and said, \u201cYou know what, we\u2019re better off in our existing box\u201d. So 45,000 square feet actually works. And now Best Buy even tells us that since they went with their stores in a store concept, they have over 90,000 square feet of demand from smaller retailers to come within their store. So we really haven\u2019t seen any significant downsizing across the portfolio.","Glenn Gary Cohen","I think the only other item I would add as well is that, you are seeing other retailers come out with different formats. So in terms of floor plates, a smaller format to a mid-sized format to accommodate the size of the boxes. So they themselves have become very creative in adapting to what the current environment is, because they still want the best locations and the best real estate. And so they understand at that point that they have to make those accommodations as well.","Ki Bin Kim","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital.","Wes Golladay","Good morning, guys. Can you update us on the development yields for the Pentagon Centre and Lincoln project?","Conor Flynn","So Pentagon, obviously is an early days of lease up, but we have raised rents three times since we started the process and we\u2019re very excited about the absorption rate. Lincoln has also been strong in terms of absorption. You see the occupancy on the supplemental tick up pretty significantly there. But the yields that we\u2019ve projected have been holding. So it\u2019s one that we continue to monitor as this lease up continues.","Glenn Gary Cohen","Yes. So on a mixed-use portfolio with a multifamily, we\u2019re typically targeting around a 6 to 6.5 yield on those two projects and we feel good about that.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then, when you look at the tenants that are signing leases right now throughout the portfolio, is there any region that stands out as being stronger than the other in any categories being stronger or weaker? More specifically, looking at the home furnishing category, has that slowed down with that overall housing market in the U.S.?","Glenn Gary Cohen","No, across the country, demand is extremely high. I mean, we\u2019ve seen contributions from all four of our regions really at top levels. And it truly does vary in terms use, as Conor mentioned earlier. It\u2019s fairly dynamic out there right now. So you\u2019re seeing grocery expansion, you\u2019re seeing home furnishing expansion, a home improvement expansion, fitness.","So a lot of the categories that we \u2013 we\u2019ve been discussing before continue to ramp and look for the best real estate. Obviously, experience, experiential continues to be a main focus, and whether that\u2019s in a target box or a brand new e-tailer that\u2019s coming into brick-and-mortar. Everyone\u2019s really focused on how to attract that customer and make their experience unique.","Wes Golladay","All right. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O\u2019 Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning out there. So just two questions. First, just as you guys look at the environment, both store closings, store openings, your gap between sign, but not yet opened has been rather steady. It\u2019s increased a bit, but it\u2019s \u2013 it hasn\u2019t narrowed. And obviously, there\u2019ve been a lot of headlines about store closings, but it sounds like less in real-time.","So as you guys are thinking about this year into next, do you feel that you\u2019re forecasting your modeling? Is it \u2013 is better than it was, call it, two years ago, when we were in the grips of a lot of store closings, the same, better? Just trying to get a sense for how comfortable you guys feel and forecasting where you\u2019ll be just given that the gap between sign, but not yet opened really hasn\u2019t narrowed and that there still are retailer announcements out there?","Conor Flynn","I think when you look back at that, that range that\u2019s been consistent, because we\u2019ve leased up really all of our Sports Authority and Toys\u201cR\u201dUs boxes and H. H. Gregg boxes that we\u2019ve got back. So there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s been elevated as we\u2019ve been significant. We\u2019ve done some significant leasing to backfill all those boxes to put us at all-time highs and occupancy.","Going forward, that\u2019s really something that we continue to monitor. It\u2019s a very fluid environment. We feel good about our portfolio. We feel good about where we\u2019re positioned. We feel good about the depth maturity profile and the liquidity position we have. But it\u2019s really going to be something we monitor going forward as you\u2019ve heard from a number of the retailers that they are trying to transition to the new world of retail and some will be able to and some will not be able to. But we feel like portfolio has positioned to outperform.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second question is, there were some comments earlier on pricing for assets, including portfolio pricing coming back. Just maybe a little bit more color. Previously, the comments had been smaller, maybe under $30 million one-off assets were always very strong, larger assets, maybe it was over $50 million or over $80 million where tougher portfolios were obviously tougher. Are the bigger one-off assets in the portfolios coming back in large scale, or is it just that we\u2019ve seen a few and those few have had very specific qualities why they\u2019ve traded. So maybe just a little bit more color there?","Conor Flynn","Yes, I still think the sweet spot for the majority of the private investor is in that $25 million to $30 million range. But it\u2019s been encouraging to see a number of examples of $50-plus million, $70-plus million single assets that have had strong demand. I think that part of it is specific to the asset and the retailer sales and the dynamics of what\u2019s happening in that market, a big part of it continues to be the availability of financing and with rates even lower than we started the year. It gives a very nice spread for the levered buyer.","So I think there\u2019s a very strong comfort level in the open air space and we\u2019ve seen the investors willing to pay for that. Portfolios, as I mentioned, this was sort of the first sizable portfolio we\u2019ve seen in a little bit of time. But we continue to hear about capital formations looking for more sizable portfolios of retail, so we\u2019ll have to continue to monitor the market and see how that goes.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.","Greg McGinniss","Hey, good morning, everyone. Conor, for the \u2013 this was the second time this year that you\u2019ve raised same-store NOI guidance, but maintained FFO guidance. So what\u2019s keeping you from increasing company expectations on that front, considering the outperformance in same-store growth?","Conor Flynn","Yes, that\u2019s a good point. I mean, we have raised same-store NOI guidance two times this year as the environment has improved. We originally anticipated more fallout and we seem to experience more demand, so we continue to monitor that. But if you look at the math in terms of how much the same-site impact FFO, really hasn\u2019t changed that much. And so we still feel very comfortable with our FFO guidance range for the year. We are going to be monitoring that as we go into the second-half of the year. And as the dynamics continue to be on the path we are on, we feel very comfortable with the range we have.","Greg McGinniss","Okay, thanks. Then, Ross, on dispositions, I know you mentioned you\u2019re comfortable with the range. But I think the original goal is to kind of front-end load the dispositions. So I\u2019m curious the top-end is still reasonable. Did anything change or buyers moving maybe a bit more slowly? I know it\u2019s still an active market area. Are you switching up assets to sell? Just any details would be helpful there?","Conor Flynn","Yes, sure. We\u2019re very comfortable in the higher-end of that range. Given the size of the volume that we\u2019re doing this year, which is significantly more modest than years past. A couple of deals, timing delays can change sort of the front-loading versus the back-loading.","So we\u2019re in very good shape with where we\u2019re at through the first-half of the year, or one or two assets that we thought could close in June, that would have been part of that first-half that got pushed 30 or 45 days, but are still on track to close here at the end of this month and into the beginning of August. We have a couple of closings in the next few weeks. So we feel very comfortable with that range. And again, at the higher-end of that range. So no material changes in any activity or the types of assets we\u2019re selling. It really just comes down to timing.","Greg McGinniss","Okay. And just to reiterate, so kind of thinking that, you\u2019d have probably a big Q3 here on dispositions and high-end is most comfortable for the full-year?","Conor Flynn","I think Q3 and Q4 should both be very healthy to get us to the upper-end of that range.","Greg McGinniss","All right, great. Thank you so much.","Conor Flynn","Got it.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","I apologize if I missed this. But looks like you have a few hundred million dollars of secured debt maturing over the next few years, where the rates are north of 5% and even some JV debt as well. And I was wondering, can any of that be refinanced early, just given where interest rates are?","Glenn Gary Cohen","It\u2019s Glenn. Hi, Mike. The short answer is, we have to pay a lot of prepayment penalties to go along with that and a lot of that debt came from acquisitions. So there you have these above the below-market debt components that go to it. So there\u2019s no real advantage to paying with prepayment penalties today. There\u2019s not really a lot of debt maturing. We only have $100 million of mortgage debt that matures next year on the consolidated balance sheet and a lot of the debt that\u2019s in the joint ventures for next year. A good portion of it is in our KIR portfolio and there\u2019s a credit facility that\u2019s in place to take those out and actually unencumbered those assets.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay, that was it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, good morning. So first question is a follow-up on Pentagon Centre. Just curious on the incremental opportunity there. How many more apartments could you potentially build that you get your targeted additional entitlements? And it might be a bit early, but what types of timing or returns or anything incremental can you share with us?","Glenn Gary Cohen","Sure. We\u2019re going through currently the permitting process for the second tower, which should be on the backside of Pentagon, that right now could be approximately 250 units, residential units, so that\u2019d be our near-term opportunity that we could look to activate now. We have to go through the permitting and the bid process, in which case, then we\u2019ll assess what the value potential is there.","Obviously, what\u2019s been so encouraging about the Witmer, which is the first hour at Pentagon is although the announcement for Amazon has occurred to date, there\u2019s been no Amazon employees actually occupying our building. So, as Conor mentioned, we\u2019re at 46% as of the end of \u2013 at the end of June. But that\u2019s really not taken into consideration any future influence or impact on the demand from Amazon employee.","So then when you look out two, three years by the second tower we push that forward, obviously, that will be a time in which Amazon starting to take some effect into the market. And so we can feel very good about that potential.","Conor Flynn","Just to be clear, we have $2 million square feet of additional entitlements already secured at the site. And so that\u2019s for another tower of apartments and then a hotel tower and then an office tower. And so the near-term opportunity is to activate a parking lot for the second tower residential.","Haendel St. Juste","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And one more and, Conor, for you. I guess, I\u2019m more curious on your view on M&A in the shopping center space today. Given the improvement in your stock and your multiple and your long-term portfolio goals, I\u2019m just curious, if there\u2019s a scenario in which Kimco could be a player. And maybe what are some of the more important guardrails and requirements that you would require to be involved?","Conor Flynn","Kimco has been a consolidator. We\u2019ve bought five public companies, and we\u2019re obviously very large. I think when you look at our stock today, we still trade at a meaningful discount to NAV. And so when you look at the milestones that we intend to hit to help our stock, I mean, we still have a lot of work to do and we have a lot of execution to take care of. And if we get to a point where our stock comes back and we have a cost of capital that\u2019s advantageous.","We would look at further improving our 2020 Vision, which is really focusing on our core markets, understanding where we have boots on the ground and efficiencies of scale. I think the last thing you would see us do is run back into the markets that we\u2019ve taken the last few years to exit. And so we\u2019re going to be very disciplined and we recognize that we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. But we\u2019ve been executing and continue to do so going forward.","Haendel St. Juste","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays.","Linda Tsai","Hi, how much the credit, hundred bits of credit loss reserve for 2019 has been used on a year-to-date basis? And how does that compare to the same time last year?","Glenn Gary Cohen","So far, we\u2019ve used 30 basis points of 100 basis points through the first six months. And we\u2019re a little bit better than where we were last year.","Linda Tsai","Thanks. And then most of the discussion around credit loss is focused on national chains, right-sizing their store basis. But how has credit loss trended for the mom-and-pops over the last six to 12 months?","Glenn Gary Cohen","The \u2013 when you look at the small shop occupancy, when you less out the impact of what Payless was, we\u2019re pretty much on trend to where we thought we\u2019d be in holding those small shop occupancy steady or slightly increasing. So I think that is evidence to the strength of the mom-and-pop retailer right now. Obviously, the franchise model over the last eight years out of the recession has created a really good opportunity for mom-and-pop retailers to take an existing business and expand it and really focus on day-to-day operations. So I think that\u2019s proven itself out well.","Conor Flynn","I think it\u2019s a reflection of the strength of the consumer. I mean, when you look at where we sit today and how strong the consumer is, the mom-and-pops have been \u2013 we\u2019re at \u2013we\u2019re sitting at near all-time highs for small shop occupancy, and the mom-and-pop has been a big player that.","Linda Tsai","Thanks for that. Last one, how are you weighing the decision to allocate capital towards redevelopment versus buybacks given your comment that the stock continues to trade at a discount?","Glenn Gary Cohen","I think when we look at our cost of capital today and the best use of funds, we continue to think that redevelopment is the best use today. Obviously, we bought back stock previously when we\u2019re trading at a meaningful discount to NAV, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor where we trade and continue to look at where our dispositions are trading and we can match fund accordingly. So we feel pretty good about where we sit today.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. I\u2019m just curious how you guys are sort of looking at or thinking about the Kroger-Ocado relationship. I know they\u2019ve opened up a few facilities in the US. And I\u2019m just curious if you have any centers that are nearby, if there\u2019s been any impact and how you sort of think about that relationship longer-term?","Conor Flynn","We are monitoring it. I think it\u2019s something that continues to evolve, along with Click & Collect. That is sort of the next wave of, I think, pilots of how they\u2019re going to be delivering more effectively in dense markets across the country. Right now, what we see in our grocery portfolio is a lot of groceries either typically use Instacart, or some of them have brought it in-house to boost their loyalty program.","We continue to think that the store is actually, as I mentioned in my earlier comments and what Target has seen, a more effective and more cost-efficient structure. But again, we\u2019re monitoring that closely to see what changes and how that relationship evolves.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.","Christopher Lucas","Hey, good morning, everybody. Just a detailed question on the Witmer. When do you \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this. When do you expect movements to begin and when do you go from capitalizing to expensing on that project?","Ross Cooper","Sorry, [Multiple Speakers] move-ins have began.","Conor Flynn","Move-ins have already started.","Ross Cooper","Yes, yes. Move-ins started July 1 once we got the TCO, so that will allow people to start moving in and they\u2019ll continue obviously now through the end of the year. Really, at this point, what\u2019s an interesting problem that we have is due to the velocity of the leasing at Pentagon, it\u2019s actually accommodating all the move-in requirements day-in and day-out. It becomes very, very busy and very active, but it\u2019s a good problem to have. So we\u2019re willing to take on that challenge. We have already started.","Glenn Gary Cohen","Right, the expense in gross capitalization will happen in the next quarter or so.","Christopher Lucas","Okay. And then I guess, just in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about economy, you mentioned that the rents have been, I guess, increased three times, as you thought about, sort of performing the outcome there. Where are rents today, as you sit? And then as it relates to sort of stabilization? What are you guys thinking in terms of when that occurs?","Glenn Gary Cohen","Sure, yes. On the rent side, we\u2019re typically around at blended average of about $3.24 on the units. As it relates to stabilization, we\u2019d always forecasted 18 to 24 months. So we\u2019re going to maintain that for now, obviously, we\u2019re ahead of plan. We are in a high season of leasing. So we anticipated to have a slightly higher volume today than what would happen sort of late fall into winter. So before we make any adjustments, we want to maintain our budget and our plan and we\u2019ll see how we trend through the balance of the year.","Conor Flynn","I will add that, our apartment manager there who manages thousands of units has not seen demand like this before in his experience.","Christopher Lucas","Thank you. I appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to return the floor to David Bujnicki for any closing comments.","David Bujnicki","Thank you for participating on our call today.

Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Bujnicki, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","David Bujnicki","Thanks, Dan, and good morning and I thank you all for joining Kimco's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. With me on the call this morning are Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Conor Flynn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Cohen, our CFO; as well as other key executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking. It is important to note that the Company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer the Company's SEC filings that address such factors. During this presentation management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Good morning. First, I\u2019d like to thank Milton and the Board for giving me the opportunity to lead this incredible company. At our recent Investor Day, we laid out our 20\/20 vision. Underscoring the work we have done over the last several years to position Kimco to take full advantage of the evolving landscape of open air retail and become a leader in our industry. Our team has executed over the past few years dramatically transforming the portfolio from a scattered collection of assets across the U.S., Mexico, South America and Canada to now a tightly concentrated footprint of high quality asset clusters in the major metro markets in the U.S. where we see the highest growth potential.","The top U.S. markets showcase the highest growth in population, household income, education, both significant barriers to entry, and presents the most potential to add value for our shareholders. All of our resources are now laser focused on what we do best owning, managing, leasing and redeveloping assets here in the U.S. to drive net asset value.","Our portfolio has two distinct advantages. First, we have a 37% mark-to-market opportunity that is unmatched due to the low in placed average base rent and the spread to market that we can unlock by recapturing and repurposing assets to meet the needs of today\u2019s shopper. Second, we have more raw materials to work with. The large collection of assets we own provides numerous redevelopment opportunities for [indiscernible] adding grocery components to our power centers and adding technology to extend the hours of our shopping centers to fulfill the everyday needs of our shoppers 24\/7.","Our 20\/20 vision provides the roadmap for how we plan to take the company to new heights in the next five years. The three main pillars of our strategy are simple. First, it starts with management. We have to continue to motivate and empower the best talent in the industry and create a vibrant and rewarding place to work. Second, the balance sheet. We have to be stores of capital by keeping a watchful eye on our cost of capital. So we can invest wisely and position the balance sheet to weather any storm.","Finally, our major focus on NAV per share growths. In the major metro markets in the U.S. asset values are close to peak or even above prior peak pricing as a healthy balance in supply and demand continues for open air centers. We believe the best use of our capital is to take full advantage of that demand and redevelop our assets to drive outsized growth by leaning on our tremendous team, fulfilling our redevelopment opportunities and executing on our select strategic developments.","We have planted the seed the redevelopment and development to bring to life assets that will significantly enhance the value and quality of our overall portfolio. We will continue to remain disciplined, preleasing, phasing and ground leasing are just a few of our risk management tools that are in place to analyze each and every investment opportunity versus our cost of capital and to ensure we generate the highest returns for our shareholders. ","The future is bright and we are passionate about delivering for our shareholders. ","Turning to our results for the fourth quarter and the full year. I\u2019ll give a brief overview of our portfolio metrics, a quick update on acquisitions and dispositions followed by an update on redevelopments. U.S. occupancy at the end of 2015 was 95.8%, up 20 basis points from last quarter and 10 basis points from the beginning of the year driven in large part by the small shop recovery. Small shop occupancy is 88.7%, up 70 basis points from last quarter and from the beginning of the year.","U.S. leasing spreads continues to display the mark-to-market opportunity at Kimco with an impressive 31% on new leases and a combined leasing spread of 13.1% in the fourth quarter, the highest combined spread in almost three years. U.S. same-site NOI growth was 2.8% for the quarter, primarily driven by minimum rent increases and a 20 basis point positive impact from redevelopment. For the full year, U.S. same-site NOI growth is 3.1% including a 50 basis point negative impact from bankruptcies experienced over the year.","The average base rent for the U.S. portfolio continues to improve with a 5.2% gain from the prior year rent. Competition continues to be fierce in our top market through acquisitions with some staggering cap rates recently reported in areas of California. This bodes well for the NAV of our holdings in California, which is our largest state by NOI contribution and continues to direct us to deploy capital towards redevelopment of our existing assets versus acquiring in the open market. For the year, our total growth acquisitions of $2.1 billion is heavily weighted towards the purchase of our joint venture interest in 57 assets.","In contrast, only two assets were acquired in the open market for a purchase price of $155 million. The disposition market remains healthy as we completed a total growth disposition value of $2.2 billion for the year. We completed the exit from Mexico and South America and an announced the closing of the RioCan JV transaction in Canada. That will pave the way to achieving our goal of simplifying the company be strictly U.S. focused by year-end. In the U.S., we completed the sale of 95 properties in 2015 for a gross price of $762 million at a blended 6.9% cap rate.","Pricing expectations for our disposition candidates have not changed. As we continue to see the demand for high quality anchor at open air shopping centers. Our redevelopment program remains the focal point of our strategy. For the year, we budgeted a $189 million of projects delivering at 10.6% incremental return. We\u2019re pleased to announce that due to some cost savings, we came in under budget on cost of a $184 million and above budget on NOI improving the incremental return to 11.3% for the year. Perhaps the most exciting redevelopment completion this quarter is the Stew Leonard's opening in our flagship Long Island asset, Airport Plaza in Farmingdale. Early indications from Stew\u2019s and Shoppers are incredible. And for the video footage of the parking lot, we think the benefit of this grocery addition to an existing power center will produce significant NAV and same-site NOI improvement for years to come.","In Florida, we also have successful openings of Publix in our Palm Beach re-development and Whole Foods at our re-development in Orlando. Out West, we signed two new leases with Trader Joe's, one in California and one in Washington. These tremendous grocery additions improve the percent of the AVR from grocery-anchored centers to72%, up from 65% at prior year-end.","To the best, we continue to question the status quo and take a deep dive into every aspect of operations to help to drive results. Open-air retail continues to evolve and embrace omni-channel and the physical store has proven to be a driver of online sales. Our retailers know their customers better than anyone inside their four walls. And our job is to bring more people into the shopping center and get those consumers to come back time and time again.","The open-air retail landscape is healthy as limited new supply is forecasted and our strongest retailers continue to grow store count. The shadow supply from potential closings or consolidating retailers and future redevelopment supply is what we are monitoring closely.","Looking ahead, we are starting to see the activity pick up in every category size. Big box retailers are back looking for space. Junior box players continue to be the most aggressive, traditional and specialty groceries are active and our small shop leasing indicates a healthy trajectory. All of these ingredients indicate, we are well positioned to unlock the value of our real estate for our shareholders.","And now, I will turn the call over to Glenn to provide more granularities on our results.","Glenn Cohen","Thanks Conor, and congratulation on your appointment as CEO. It\u2019s going to be a fun go for us all. Good morning to everyone. We finished 2015 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering strong results for the full year while furthering our transformation and simplification efforts. We've successfully executed on our TSR strategy plus and delivered a total shareholder return of 9.4% for 2015 in a very tough and volatile market.","In December, we unveiled our 2020 vision at our Investor Day focusing on owning and operating high quality U.S. properties and the major metro markets where we have deep concentration. We also continue to execute on our redevelopment pipeline and select ground-up development projects. Our 2020 vision includes operating with a more conservative capital structure with plenty of liquidity and even stronger debt metrics than today. Finally as an added benefit, we have the upside potential from our plus business. The vision is clear. The team is focused and aligned.","Now for some details on our fourth quarter and full year results and further color regarding our 2016 earnings guidance. Our FFO\u2019s adjusted per share our recurring FFO, which excludes non-operating impairments and transactional income expense was $0.37 for the fourth quarter and increase of 5.7% compared to last year\u2019s $0.35. The increase was driven by higher NOI from the operating portfolio of $24.8 million offset by $4.4 million of decreased management fees related to the significant reduction in joint ventures and higher G&A associated with severance charges attributable to our anticipated exit of Canada. ","In addition, interest expense was higher by $5.6 million primarily from the debt assumptions related to the Kimstone acquisition earlier in the year, the recent JV [indiscernible] in SEB and the acquisition of the Christown property in Phoenix. ","Our full year 2015 FFO was adjusted per share came in at $1.46 achieving the high end of our revised guidance range and $0.06 above last year\u2019s result of $1.44, 4.3% increase. Headline FFO per share representing the official NAREIT definition was $0.35 for the fourth quarter in line with first-call consensus estimates. Headline FFO per share was $0.02 lower than FFO was adjusted, primarily related to the $5.8 million non-cash charge for the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% Series H Preferred Stock redemption during the quarter and the acquisition related costs. ","Our full year 2015 headline FFO per share came in at $1.56, achieving the upper end of our guidance range in $0.01 ahead our first-call consensus. Our 2015 results are $0.11 higher than the 2014 amount of $1.44 share, 7.6% increase. The primary drivers of the headline per share increase was $0.06 increase in recurring FFO and the gain on the sale of our Supervalu stock investment which contributed $40 million of $0.10 per share. ","Acquisition cost and non-operating impairments offset these increases. As Conor just articulated the operating portfolio delivered solid results with improved occupancy. Our 23rd consecutive quarter of delivering positive U.S. same-site NOI growth and double-digit leasing spreads. Ross Cooper and his team are very active during the quarter on the disposition front. We completed the sale of interest in 64 U.S. properties, 23 Canadian properties and our last asset in South America generating proceeds of approximately $600 million, which we used to fund the $175 million redemption of preferred stock pay down debt and fund the acquisitions.","We remained focused and committed to operate with a strong capital structure. We finished the fourth quarter with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 6 times. The high end of our 5.5 times to 6 times range, down from the 6.6 times at the end of the first quarter, after acquiring of $1.4 billion Kimstone portfolio. We achieved this level even with the redemption of the preferred stock, which had a 0.2 times impact on the metrics. As part of our 20\/20 vision over time, we plan to reduce the consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA to a range of 5 times to 5.5 times and on a look through basis including pro rata JV debt and preferred stock to a range of 6.4 times to 6.9 times with a fixed charge coverage of 3 times plus.","During the fourth quarter, we tap the bond market issuing a $500 million seven year, 3.4% fixed rate bond, a liquidity position is in excellent shape ending the year with zero outstanding on our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility in over a $180 million in cash. We have already began to address by 2016 maturities both consolidate in our JV\u2019s, which are anticipated to be funded with sales proceeds, the unsecured bank and bond markets and mortgage financings, lower coupons in the maturing debt. ","We are reaffirming our guidance to 2016, which was provided at our Investor Day in December. Our FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO per share range is $1.48 to $1.52 and our headline FFO per share ranges of $1.54 to $1.62. The guidance range takes into account the significant level of dispositions throughout 2015 and the accelerated exit of Canada during 2016, which has a combined impact of $0.06 to $0.07 per share on the 2016 growth expectations. We anticipate that by the end of 2016 will be a purely U.S. owner and operator with assets concentrated in our key metro markets. The transactional expense in income included in the headline guidance range, but not in recurring range is primarily comprise of acquisition quest and the commencement of monetizing [indiscernible] in investment. ","As such the transactional income for this heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter of 2016. The guidance range is sensitive for timing of acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments coming online, leased up and financing initiatives. Our 2016 plans of course, our recently increased common dividend level of $0.255 per quarter, which equates to an FFO payout ratio in the upper 60% range. ","And with that, I\u2019ll turn over to Milton.","Milton Cooper","Well. Thanks, Glenn. Kimco is back to basics. The company focusing on property advantages in the United States. It took a tremendous effort by our exceptional team. They execute an all the transactions last year.","In 2015, we\u2019ve reduced our foreign investment by $1.5 billion gross of which $749 million was a last year and we reduced the number of sites and joint ventures by another 43%, a 65% decrease since 2010.","Now our portfolio was much most streamline, predominantly self-managed located the United States with 564 properties and all the major [indiscernible]. We look forward to the opportunities in the years ahead, there are some very exciting redevelopments and developments that our team working on. We committed to unlocking the value in our current portfolio and the grow NAV for our shareholders.","And now, we\u2019ll be delighted to take any questions.","David Bujnicki","We\u2019re ready to move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Due to the large volume of participants in the queue we request a one-question limit with an appropriate follow-up. This will provide all our callers an opportunity to speak with management. If you have additional questions you\u2019re welcome to re-join the queue. Dan, you may take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just with regards to the Canadian assets its looks like those that are remaining, so the assets in the same-store pool at year end, have weaker growth and lower occupancy than those that you sold to RioCan in Q4. Can you just remind us where you\u2019re in the sales process those remaining 35 assets? What portion of the $900 million of dispositions guidance [indiscernible] about? And then what cap rates do you expect on those assets, relative to RioCan deal?","Ross Cooper","Sure. Hi, Christy. It\u2019s Ross Cooper. In Canada, as of right now, we have 25 assets out of the 35, that under contracts to be sold. We expect that to happen in the next two to three months depending outcome of some of the due diligence that\u2019s still remaining and that point of time will be approximately 86% completed and some of analyze standpoint. So we still really good about the pays which is going \u2013 the pricing is very consistent with where we\u2019re in the other assets. So we don\u2019t feel that quality is necessarily lower and we\u2019re in low six cap rate range on those assets is well.","The remaining assets to that point in time. We\u2019re still working on getting into the marketplace. Doing a little bit of lease-up in some scenarios, but as Glenn mentioned, we\u2019re much on track to be completely out by the end of the year.","Unidentified Company Representative ","Christy, I\u2019ll just add. The same-site guidance that we have this is just going to be U.S. based because the balance of these assets really \u2013 is really anticipated to be sold, most of it within the first half of the year whatever stragglers by the end of the year. ","Christy McElroy","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. Just may be given some color on some of the real estate development projects where the estimated completion was pushed slightly further out. ","Conor Flynn","Sure. Hey, it\u2019s Conor. On when was that\u2019s the Whole Foods development actually the stabilization dates haven\u2019t changed is more than completion date. So that was actually compressed between the two, actually the cost lowered a little bit there. So we should see that completed this year in the third quarter. Christiana that site plan has actually changed. You\u2019ll see that the cost came down quite a bit. Originally, we had thought, we were going to be developing a product we called power center with junior box lineups, a large big box anchor has significant interest now.","So we\u2019ve redesigned the site plan to ground leasing get quite a bit of contribution from that tenant for the redesigned site plan. So that\u2019s really what changed that, that site plan there. Grand Parkway, we\u2019re finalizing the anchor lease there that we should be announcing shortly. But we have yet to finish across that finish line, so that\u2019s really why that, that was pushed out of quarter. So those are the big movie pieces there on those assets.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And just as a follow-up. On Owings Mills, do you have a sense of what you are going to do with this project? I know there is about 3.5 year lag between that opening as well.","Unidentified Company Representative ","The beauty of Owings Mills is, it\u2019s going to be a blank slate. So that\u2019s why we bought all the different pieces. So mall of redevelopment is a tricky one, especially if you don\u2019t control all the pieces. So what we did was we purchased our partners interest, we purchased the Macy\u2019s, we purchased the JCPenney, what you allows us to really start from scratch and take down the mall. And our design is really for best-in-class open air shopping center, which includes big box retailers, junior anchors, restaurants, you name it. So we have \u2013 we actually have four different site plans of working on right now that we think all will have significant value and really clear [ph] lot of value for our shareholders in the long-term.","Craig Schmidt","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, good morning. It\u2019s Jeremy Metz on with Ross. I just wanted if you can give us may be a little more color on the sales environment today ignoring the Canada stuff? Just talk about what you\u2019re seeing, in terms of investor demand? Has the buyer pool thinned, and maybe the composition of interested buyers changed, in recent months? And then is financing at all becoming an issue for sellers or for buyers in particular, on some of the secondary market stuff?","Ross Cooper","Sure. This is Ross again. As you\u2019ve seen from the numbers, we\u2019ve been executing on our plan on the dispositions. We really haven\u2019t seen any pushback or fallout of deals that we have in the marketplace. We\u2019ve already closed on a couple shopping centers so far this year. So the pace and the pricing is still very competitive. I think that you\u2019re right about the depth of the buyer pool. It certainly is may be a little bit shallower than it was six months to nine months ago, but the groups that are active are still very competitive.","We haven\u2019t seen financing really become an issue on the deals that we\u2019re selling in the secondary markets. And we think that we\u2019re going to have a very strong year. In fact, we have some assets on the West Coast that we\u2019ve sold at very aggressive pricing. And when you look at the statistics for our fourth quarter sales, our average cap rate was 6.5%, which was the lowest cap rate that we\u2019ve had on our dispositions that we\u2019ve tracked since we started the transformation. So we continue to see the cap rates become more aggressive, not less aggressive.","A \u2013 ConorFlynn","Yes, I think in the key markets in California, you\u2019ve been tracking that really the cap rates now almost start with a 4%, and some have even dipped even lower. So we\u2019re obviously being very patient there. And clearly, we\u2019re not going to win many bidding wars today, when those types of assets come to the market.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And then just one quick one on shop occupancy, it\u2019s obviously been steadily moving higher. And I think you previously mentioned the goal of getting to 90% by year-end. I know it\u2019s early in the year, but has the disruption in the markets, or general nervousness about the economy, impacted any leasing activity at all, or demand for shop space? And may be put that in context of the national and franchises, versus maybe the mom and pops? Thanks.","A \u2013 ConorFlynn","No, yes, it\u2019s a good question. I think we\u2019ve seen demand continue to improve for small shops. You see it with our occupancy pick-up there. In our pipeline, looking forward, we continue to see that improving over the year. It\u2019s a nice split between the nationals and the mom and pops. We had 55% of our small shops were done with mom and pops this quarter. So the volatility in the market has not really put a governor on the amount of small shop leasing we\u2019re able to do. And we know that that\u2019s really where our occupancy pick-up is going to be driving going forward. So we have been pleasantly surprised with the production there, and we\u2019ll continue to push that going forward.","Jeremy Metz","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Paul Morgan","Hi, good morning. Your lease spreads were, as you noted stronger in the quarter. And you\u2019ve been talking about your mark-to-market across the portfolio, and the upside potential there. I mean were there any specific catalysts on the new lease spreads that you would point to? I mean are these numbers something that you think could be achievable, as we look into 2016?","Conor Flynn","I think combined leasing spreads is really \u2013 the double-digit is really our goal. So if we can continue that, that would be fantastic. Some of notable ones we did this past quarter, we did three deals on former Anna's Linens boxes that were actually a positive 33%. So above what our previous range was that we thought we had on that mark-to-market opportunity.","And again, it\u2019s all about supply and demand. Right now, we just we see that there is retailers in all categories, whether its small shop, mid-size, junior boxes or the big box anchors. They all have been very aggressive in growing store count, and that continues to lead to bidding wars, which will bid up rents. And we continue to see that, that is an opportunity for us going into this year.","Paul Morgan","Okay. And just to follow-up. Your credit losses were also really low in the quarter, and it seemed like the bankruptcy season has been relatively light so far. I mean how is your outlook for the first half of the year, especially kind of thinking about it from a year-over-year comp perspective? And how that could benefit same-store numbers?","Conor Flynn","We obviously monitor our tenant\u2019s health very closely. Our watch list hasn\u2019t really changed all that much. I mean you know that we have been watching the same tenants for a long time now. And I think it\u2019s relatively healthy when you look out. Clearly there might be some consolidation or some fall-out in the year but overall we think we\u2019re in the sweet spot of retail. We think off-price is really becoming the darling in the U.S. and we continue to see huge demand for that type of space. And we think that this year we\u2019ll continue along that path of being just a healthy environment.","Paul Morgan","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from RJ Milligan of Baird. Please go ahead.","RJ Milligan","Hey, good morning, guys. I was just curious if you could give an update as to what you\u2019re seeing on the ground in Puerto Rico and if any of the macro issues there have trickled down into whether it be sales or leasing?","Conor Flynn","Puerto Rico is obviously one we\u2019re watching closely. It\u2019s relatively small in terms of the impact on our whole portfolio. It\u2019s a little bit less than 3%. So we watch it closely. We have seen activity on the Anna\u2019s boxes that we got back, and think we\u2019ll be able to lease those up this year. Clearly the headline, the Puerto Rico\u2019s in some serious issues. We\u2019re trying to restructure their debt but the shopper is still vibrant down there. We recently hosted a portfolio tour down there and Glenn, you want to talk a little about the traffic you saw.","Glenn Cohen","Yes. I mean it\u2019s pretty amazing. I mean I was down there on this NDR. You go into Kmart\u2019s in Puerto Rico, all the lights are on. The shelves are fully stocked. The couple that we went into, there\u2019s seven or eight registers open with three or four people deep in them and the parking lots are filled with people shopping. The discounter approach down there works really well. Although the economy \u2013 the Puerto Rican economy\u2019s been in a recession for a long time. It really is a very deep underground economy there and the people just shop. So the properties are very, very successful.","David Bujnicki","Dan, next question.","Operator","Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. In regards to development, we\u2019ve seen a lot of REITs pull back on their overall size of the pipelines. Just holistically, what are you guys seeing that gives you confidence to increase it, at this point in time? ","Conor Flynn","Yes, most of our strategic developments have a story to them, and we feel very confident about why we think it\u2019s appropriate to add these to the pipeline. If you go asset by asset, they each have a reason why. The one in Fort Lauderdale is right across from our most successful shopping center in the state of Florida and the demand has been off the charts there. If you look at the Christiana Delaware, it\u2019s right along 95 where we\u2019ve been working to rezone that from a former Sears warehouse to now a retail offering, it\u2019s right next to GGP\u2019s successful Christiana mall.","So each and every one of these projects has a story to it. And there is not going to be significant more development in our pipeline looking out, mainly because the land prices have really skyrocketed. A lot of that\u2019s due to the multifamily that we\u2019ve seen pop up. But we see the demand from our retailers to want to grow store count and the limited supply. So each of these projects has really \u2013 it\u2019s within a key market for us. The demand is there. The one in Houston obviously with Houston going through headwinds, we still see retailers wanting to be there and fill a void.","Clearly the apartments since the density around our Grand Parkway project has been there for a long period of time and I think the retail was the last sector to really catch up to meet the demand. So we haven\u2019t seen any falloff in terms of retailer demand there. And that will actually be one of our first development projects out of the ground and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that it will be a big success.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And as a follow-up, same topic. Could you comment on some of the retailers that you\u2019re \u2013 that you have as anchors for these developments like hhgregg or Sports Authority, or Target that was an anchor listed at Grand Parkway, that\u2019s no longer there in the supplemental this quarter? Just curious if you could comment on, I mean basically, the health of these anchor tenants?","Conor Flynn","I think we reposted, and the Target back on the plan there. So that was probably just a refresh that you need to do on the supplemental. But yes, you mentioned a few tenants that are on our watch list. Those tenants are obviously ones we\u2019re watching closely and monitoring. We\u2019re cautiously optimistic that it\u2019s not going to be a liquidation, if and when something happens to those retailers. So we\u2019re looking to see where our exposure is, how we can limit it and again that mark-to-market opportunity that we talk about is really our measure of safety when we get those boxes back. So we think we\u2019re trying to be careful about how we manage risk and those junior boxes you mentioned are ones that are obviously on the watch list. ","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. ","Alex Goldfarb","Good morning. First question is just on Albertson\u2019s, just given the choppy IPO market. Would you guys consider other monetization alternatives, like a private sale of your stake? Or your view is that it\u2019s not \u2013 you\u2019re fine to hold this as long as necessary, to when the IPO market comes back? ","Ray Edwards","I mean I think our intent \u2013 hi, this is Ray Edwards. Our intent right now is just to hold our interest with our partners at this point. It\u2019s a very successful business operation and we\u2019re very optimistic about it.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay. And then second is for Glenn. Glenn, in the debt summary, it looks like you guys still have two Canadian unsecured bonds outstanding. And with the exit from Canada slated for year-end, it would seem like a sort of mismatch. So just curious, especially with the strength of the U.S. dollar, does it make sense to prepay these? Or your view is to just leave these outstanding to their natural maturities, over the next, I guess, four years or so?","Glenn Cohen","It\u2019s a very fair and great question. We\u2019re very closely monitoring the progress that we make on the sales because the bonds serve as our natural hedge. So depending on the timing and the quickness of the sales, we\u2019re going to need to evaluate how we want to handle the debt. As long as we leave the cash in Canada, it stays naturally hedged. But there may come a point where it makes sense to either do across currency swap, tender for the bonds, make whole the bonds, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s very much on the radar screen that we\u2019ll have to address as we go forward.","Alex Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Vincent Chao","Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to go back to the off-price commentary. Obviously, that\u2019s been a key driver for the space overall. But I was just wondering \u2013 we hear about it, and we\u2019ve been hearing about it for quite a long time. Just wondering how you think about saturation of that concept? And maybe if you could comment on what percentage of your centers have some form of off-price in it, whether or not that\u2019s a traditional TJs or some of the newer players? ","Conor Flynn","We can get back to you on the percentage of the total portfolio of an off-price component. It would be very high and so we can give you an exact percentage. But on your question on saturation, it\u2019s one we watch closely. There\u2019s obviously a lot of new players in the off-price segment. We love the off-price segment. We think that TJX has been really the phenomenal performer for many, many years now. And if you look back not too long ago the market cap of TJX and Ross combined was relatively small compared to some of the mall anchors and if you just compare it to today it\u2019s really phenomenal just the growth that they\u2019ve achieved. ","The new players we\u2019re watching closely. You want to try and pick best-in-class and have the merchandising mix that enhances the shopping center and the amount of traffic it drives. So we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that I think that more competition is good for the off-price sector. We clearly favor the ones that have the proven business model and have been doing it for many, many years. But going forward it will be an interesting situation to watch to see who really can capture some of that market share. TJX obviously has such a lead and Ross is really ramping up their expansion plans. And then if you look at Nordstrom Rack and then some of the Saks Off Fifth, Fine from Lord & Taylor, there is a lot of players out there that are trying to really gain market share. So it will be interesting to see how competitive they are.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks. Any comments on Backstage, and how they\u2019re doing?","Conor Flynn","We have been in talks with Backstage. We have yet to execute a lease with them. So again, it\u2019s one of those newer players we\u2019re watching closely to see how they perform. ","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, good morning. I just had a quick question on Amazon. We\u2019ve heard that they\u2019ve started opening select bricks and mortar locations. And I was wondering if you had had any discussions with them, whether we could expect them to be in your centers in the future? And if you knew anything about their long or medium-term bricks and mortar plan? ","Conor Flynn","Yes, they have one open bricks and mortar location in Seattle. They continue to see that as an opportunity. We have met with them. We\u2019ve talked about opportunities with them. I think they\u2019re going to be very select and very strategic on their store opening plan. And so I think it\u2019s going to be more of a measured approach to it rather than a full-blown assault on opening a lot of bricks and mortar stores. But it\u2019s clearly an indication that a lot of pure e-commerce retailers see the value of opening physical stores, which is a real boost for our sector because there is this tethering effect. And you see it from a lot of our retailers, who come out and display the amount of online sales that go into opening a new physical location, but also the amount that they lose when they close a physical location in terms of the online sales. So it\u2019s interesting to watch and Amazon obviously being the largest is clearly a good sign for us for the long haul.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Miller of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Mike Miller","Thanks. Hi, Conor, you talked about seeing more demand from big box tenants. Can you give us a little more color on just how broad-base that is? Is it covering just existing shopping centers, the appetite for new shopping center development, et cetera?","Conor Flynn","Yes, it\u2019s both, actually. They\u2019re looking to try and enter some of our redevelopments as well as the new developments. So it\u2019s nice because a lot of the times when we were looking at the most active players, it was the junior boxes. They were the ones most aggressive on redevelopments as well as the ground up developments we have in our pipeline. And it\u2019s nice to see now that the big box anchors are coming back and looking to grow store count. And again, it\u2019s in select locations where they see opportunity or it might be a void for them. But again, the mass merchandisers have been missing for a while in terms of activity. So, it\u2019s nice to see them back looking for stores.","Mike Miller","Okay. So it\u2019s not just one category or two, you\u2019re seeing it, it\u2019s fairly broad-based.","Conor Flynn","Exactly.","Mike Miller","Okay, okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jim Sullivan of Cowen Group. Please go ahead.","Jim Sullivan","Good morning. Thank you. Conor, just a kind of follow-up in terms of the demand side of the equation, there\u2019s been a lot of press reports recently about some of the major as well as some new grocers expanding into the Mid-Atlantic market and Wakemans, Publix, Lidl and so forth. And just curious whether that\u2019s showing up, when you\u2019re talking about demand for boxes, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about big boxes as opposed to grocers, but you might be talking about both.","So are we looking at \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say a bidding war, but a really strong demand environment in the Mid-Atlantic as a result of those trends. And as part of that can you just address in terms of Lidl whether they\u2019re going into centers, are they looking at free-standing locations?","Conor Flynn","You\u2019re spot on. My comments earlier were really targeted towards the big box players. But you\u2019re right on when you talk about the grocery competition in the Mid-Atlantic. It is going to be fierce with all those new entrants into that market. And you\u2019re right where it\u2019s going to be a bidding war. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see who shakes out in terms of the winners and losers. But there\u2019s going to be plenty of aggressive entrance into that market in the Mid-Atlantic and you named pretty much the majors that are all coming and coming in droves.","So on your question on Lidl, it\u2019s an interesting one. We met with them and talked to them about their plans. Most of their plans are self-development. So they\u2019re actually looking to self develop standalone grocery stores where they can be competitors to the traditional grocery stores at a lower price point.","So most of what they\u2019ve been doing is tying up land and looking to self develops. So they have a little bit of a different approach to it than say some of your traditional grocer, who is looking to lease space. That being said, though, there\u2019s plenty of bidding going on for opportunity there, but it\u2019s already a very tight market. So it\u2019s very difficult to penetrate.","Jim Sullivan","And if I could just follow-up in terms of Albertson\u2019s and the West Coast. With Albertson\u2019s buying back some of their stores; its domination in many of the Northwest markets I guess has increased. And I wonder if you could address whether Albertson\u2019s has put any bid in I think the 33 remaining Haggen stores that go to auction next week, whether Albertson\u2019s has put a bid in for any of those as well and perhaps an update on the timing of an IPO?","Conor Flynn","Well, with respect to Haggen, I know they\u2019re looking at the 30 odd stores that are going \u2013 they\u2019re trying to sell their going concern. But again I\u2019m not sure; I\u2019m not into the detail. So I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s FTC issues about being able to take down all of those locations or not. Partly on that front, Albertson\u2019s had a lawsuit with Haggen\u2019s that was settled. So that will help get something done there. So it was a big step for them to get that resolved. With respect to the IPO, the S-1 remains on file. It\u2019s been updated for the third quarter. And the fourth quarter for Albertson\u2019s ends, I think February 22 or 23. So market conditions improve, come after the fourth quarter, revisit the opportunity in the public markets.","Jim Sullivan","Okay, good. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from George Auerbach of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead","George Auerbach","Thanks, good morning. Conor, any color on the expected yield that the new projects in Owings Mills and Pentagon? Or I guess more broadly, if I look at the active development page and add in Pentagon; what\u2019s the expected weighted average yields on these projects?","Conor Flynn","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. We\u2019re targeting between 7.5 and 8.5. That\u2019s really where the really the expected yields are for the entire portfolio of redevelopment and development projects. So obviously Owings Mills is just a recent combination of acquisitions there. So we have a few different site plans depending on the best return which one we will go with. Pentagon is obviously the apartment towers that we\u2019ve talked about in 25,000 square feet of new retail there. So the ROI\u2019s going to be a little bit lower there because of the apartments but the spread from the cap rate is still well over 200 basis points. So we feel like we have a manageable pipeline that really will deliver significant NAV for the Company going forward ","George Auerbach","That\u2019s helpful. And just one follow-up. Glenn, what are you modeling for non-cash revenue in the 2016 guidance? I saw it increase in the fourth quarter and just wondering if it sort of stays at that kind of a run rate.","Glenn Cohen","Can you be a little more specific of that non-cash revenue? ","George Auerbach","Yes, the straight line rent and FASB was something like $11.5 million. It was running in kind of the $8 million range earlier in the year. I just wondered if that was\u2026","Glenn Cohen","Yes, it\u2019s bumped up really due to acquisitions, right. Certainly when we brought on the Blackstone portfolio, the Christown asset is a very large asset that has it in there. It will probably a little bit higher, but not, not \u2013 and just modestly higher than where we see it today.","George Auerbach","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Steve Sakwa","Thanks. I guess two questions. Number one, I guess maybe Glenn in terms of the guidance of 2.5 to 3.5 for same store, I\u2019m just trying to think what you\u2019ve sort of incorporated in terms of bankruptcies and down time. I guess you had some of those in 2015, and it clipped the results. I\u2019m just trying to figure out how conservative you might have been or where that figure is in relation to where you started a year ago. ","Glenn Cohen","Yes. I mean if you think about the initial guidance that we put out last year, right, we were in this 3 to 3.5 range. We brought for the whole year we came in at 3.1.\u2013 as Conor mentioned Anna\u2019s and A&P really hit us about 50 basis points. So we would have achieved the high end of the range, but bankruptcies happen. The guidance range does incorporate a modest amount, not a lot of bankruptcies. ","So if you get to the midpoint, we think there should be a very, very modest amount. If there\u2019s a large scale bankruptcy, you probably would have a nick on us, and you probably would end up towards the lower end of the range. If it stays stable and the lease-up happens where we think we can get to the mid-to-upper end of the range.","Steve Sakwa","Okay, thanks. And then I guess just to kind of follow-up on a couple of the Albertson\u2019s questions. I believe the intent obviously in 2016 was to have the IPO and then start to monetize that and use some of that cash to fund. To the extent that the IPO either happens later in the year or maybe doesn\u2019t happen at all for market conditions, just I mean how do you think about your needs of cash and how do you supplement that? ","Glenn Cohen","Yes. It\u2019s fairly on a relative basis, it\u2019s fairly modest. I mean what\u2019s baked in the guidance from a cash standpoint is somewhere between $50 million and $100 million to us, late in the year. So for a 2016 impact, it\u2019s fairly modest. And they can be supplemented in many different ways. You might have a little bit more debt. I mean at the high end of $100 million it\u2019s about one tick of net debt to EBITDA. You may have more sales that supplement it. So in the scheme of things if it didn\u2019t go we would obviously have to deal with our headline guidance because it\u2019s baked into that. But other than that, the recurring flows are all there and it\u2019s modest to the capital plan.","Steve Sakwa","Okay. Thanks. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead. ","Chris Lucas","Yes, good morning, everyone. Follow-up actually on the last question, I guess maybe more directly. Stock price has done well. You\u2019re within a few percentage points of the cycle high if you will. Just wondering as how you think about maybe issuing some equity, modest amount in terms of de-risking sort of some of your funding needs as it goes forward particularly in light of maybe weakening conditions on disposition market and just overall capital markets uncertainty. ","Glenn Cohen","Well, the nice part about what we have is an enormous amount of liquidity. We end the year with zero outstanding on our credit facility. As you see in our guidance, we\u2019re still planning to be a net seller during the year, so there\u2019s more proceeds coming in. And the nice part about where we are today is we do have an ATM in place and we can use it opportunistically if it makes sense to do so. So it\u2019s another thing that we continually monitor and we try to take advantage of improving the balance sheet at any point in time that we can in measured form.","Chris Lucas","And then can I just add some question on the Canadian situation as it relates to where the cash is. Is the cash that is generated off the asset sale, is that in Canada right now? Is that how that\u2019s held? ","Glenn Cohen","Well, to date everything that we\u2019ve sold we\u2019ve actually repatriated so far. ","Chris Lucas","Okay. Okay. ","Glenn Cohen","We will be \u2013 so far. So the remaining assets that we\u2019ll need to sell, because they\u2019ll match up against the Canadian bonds that are outstanding, so we\u2019re not going to be repatriating that cash so quickly because we\u2019ll need to balance it with the debt, keep the natural hedge in place.","Chris Lucas","Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason White of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jason White","Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions, same topic. As you look at market rents over last year versus this year, what kind of market rent growth are you seeing in not releasing spreads but true on-the-ground market rent growth? ","Glenn Cohen","Market rent really depends on location and obviously the strength of the site and the surrounding demographics. But the market rents in the top markets continue to pick up nicely. It really is a function of supply and demand and we continue to see pretty strong leasing spreads but if you look at the pure tick-up in market rents, it\u2019s at the high end of our range where we expected it to be. And you will continue to see it improve as retailers really have focused on making sure to try and penetrate these markets but also not lose stores. I think that\u2019s more of a critical component to it is retailers that are coming to for renewals are worried about losing store count in these tough markets where they have significant market share. So you\u2019ll probably see the renewal spread actually pick up a little bit this year as those leases come up for renewal.","Jason White","As you look at kind of sales growth by the tenants and kind of low-single digits and e-commerce takes a slice of that for those tenants that do have e-commerce exposure or maybe they even have their own omnichannel presence. But with brick and mortar really being a low-single digit sales growth environment, how long can market rent growth continue to kind of outpace that and get OCRs that are probably increasing higher than potentially long-term averages would assume is correct.","Unidentified Company Representative ","It\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s one that I think as retailers look at their occupancy costs, they really have to be mindful of sales growth as well as how much rent they can pay. The nice thing about our sector is we have some of the lowest occupancy costs across any sector of REITs, so we think we have significant pricing power still left to go. And it really helps by being in the best markets and having the best assets. Those are ones that are very difficult to come by so retailers don\u2019t necessarily want to lose those store count either. So it\u2019s one that we think still has a long runway to go. And again, I think that as long as supply and demand remains in check we\u2019re in good shape there.","Glenn Cohen","Yes. I mean it\u2019s Glenn. Also, our portfolio is a little bit different because it\u2019s older. We have so many leases still that are really well below market. So even though you might not have true dramatic amounts of rent growth, per se, relative to where our leases are today, leases that are 10 years, 15 years, 20 years old. You still have a lot of upside and when you bring those to market. ","Jason White","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Rich Moore","Hi, good morning, guys. The fourth quarter jump in lease termination income, I\u2019m assuming that wasn\u2019t the bankrupt guys, because they\u2019re gone. So is there anything special in there? And kind of what are you thinking about as we look at the next couple quarters?","Unidentified Company Representative ","Yes, the lease termination was really tied to one big lease termination. It was in East Windsor, where we had a Safeway that was dark and paying and they wanted to get out of the lease and offered us a settlement. So we took it and now we have a redevelopment on our hands as well. So it was a double win for us there.","Rich Moore","Okay. And then if I could follow-up real quick on Christy\u2019s question. The \u2013 if you look at the $900 million that you guys guided to in dispositions, is it roughly $300 million Canada, $600 million U.S, is that math about right?","Conor Flynn","No, no, it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s really more $500 million Canada, $400 million U.S.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Good. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Collin Mings of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","Hey. Good morning. Just wanted to see if you could provide a little more color on the progress backfilling the A&P and Anna\u2019s Linens spaces? I think, Conor, you stated that spreads were maybe a little bit better than you referenced last November.","Conor Flynn","Yes. I mean Anna\u2019s Linens boxes, if you remember we had 21 leases. We have three fully executed leases that the positive 33% spread. We have 14 active leases in negotiation to fill those boxes. Two of the leases were assigned to. And we actually sold two. So we actually have very strong interest across the board on Anna\u2019s linens. And I think, when it\u2019s all said and done, we might be at the high end or above the initial range when we set our mark-to-market there. ","A&P the nine locations five were assigned four to Acme one to Best Yet. The four vacant boxes have significant interest. I\u2019m sorry \u2013 we have really when you break it down, it\u2019s a phenomenal opportunity to really reposition what was a struggling grocer. And you name it in terms of who the off-price retailers that want to try and take these box as well as some of the specialty grocers, and even some of the warehouse clubs that are \u2013 where we have liquidity and lease termination rights for the surrounding retail. We might have some redevelopment potential there. In addition to the Staten Island redevelopment where we plan on keeping that as a strategic vacancy through 2017 when our entitlements come into place and we have a very large redevelopment there.","Collin Mings","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","David Bujnicki","Thanks, Dan, and to everybody that participated on our call today.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki, Vice President. Please go ahead.","David Bujnicki","Thanks Gary. Thank you all for joining Kimco's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning are Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, Chief Executive Officer; Conor Flynn, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Glenn Cohen, CFO. There are also other key executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking, and it's important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website. (Operator Instructions)","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave Henry.","David Henry","Good morning and thank you for calling in today. We are very pleased to report excellent third quarter financial results which highlight very healthy fundamentals in our portfolio. Our operating metrics across the board for the quarter were excellent, led by solid occupancy gains and strong growth in U.S same-site NOI of 4.9%. We continue to be pleased with the improving trends in small shop space and our 15th straight quarter of solid leasing spreads for both new leases and renewals. As we have discussed in prior calls, limited new supply population growth and positive GDP growth have all combined to provide excellent momentum for increases in effective rents, leasing spreads and occupancies across the open air shopping center sector, particularly in high quality properties in primary markets.","While retailers in general have had a mixed year so far, there is optimism about the holiday season and many of our top tenants are doing very well, such as TJX, Costco, Home Depot, Burlington, Ross Stores, et cetera. Many of these tenants are continuing to substantially increase their store counts. Restaurants in particular are expanding in great numbers, led by the relatively new fast casual category, which includes Panera Bread, Chipotle, Chick-Fil-A and Smashburger. ","While Kimco, like several of our peers, is beginning to invest very selectively in several ground-up developments, new supply is expected to remain muted for several more years and retail space per capita in the U.S has actually declined slightly. While ecommerce continues to impact brick and mortar retailers, most large retailers have found effective ways to blend their growing ecommerce business with their store operations. The Omni-channel concept is a reality and most of us landlords smiled recently as we read that Amazon plans to open a new retail showroom in New York City. ","In terms of our overall strategy, we continue to implement our TSR initiatives, transformation, simplification and redevelopment. Glenn and Conor will cover the specifics, but we are on track in terms of selling our Tier 2 properties and selectively adding high quality property acquisitions. Our redevelopment pipeline also continues to grow with new acquisitions and as rising rents make more projects economically feasible. ","In Mexico, we are working very hard to close our last, large portfolio sale, which is under contract and which we hope to close in late November. We also have one property remaining in Chile, which is under a letter of intent. All of our other properties in Chile, Peru and Brazil have now been sold. Canada remains a strong and consistent contributor to our earnings, with excellent FFO returns despite the soft Canadian dollar. Occupancy and same side metrics, excluding currency, are very solid and property values are at very high historical levels. There are also several significant redevelopment opportunities in the Canadian portfolio which we are evaluating with our Canadian partners, particular RioCan. ","And now I\u2019d like to turn to Glenn to outline our specific financial results for the quarter, to be followed by Conor\u2019s discussion of portfolio results with Milton batting cleanup. .","Glenn Cohen","Thanks Dave and good morning. Our solid third quarter performance is the result of continued execution of our stated strategy. The significant transformation of our portfolio is producing excellent operating metrics, highlighted by strong same side NOI growth, positive leasing spreads and a further lift to our occupancy levels. We\u2019ve also made significant progress on the simplification front. Let me provide some color on the quarterly results. ","As we reported last night, FFO was adjusted per diluted share, which represents recurring FFO and excludes transactional income and expenses and non-operating impairments was $0.36 as compared to $0.33 last year, a 9.1% increase. The primary drivers of the growth are attributable to higher NOI delivered by the shopping center of portfolio, coupled with low interest and G&A expenses. FFO as adjusted for the 9 months stands at $1.05 per share. Based on our expectations for the full year, we are tightening our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to a $1.38 to $1.40 from a $1.36 to $1.40. ","The midpoint of the guidance range will represent a 4.5% annual growth rate, a solid result considering the $0.04 diluted impact of disposing of higher cap rate assets, including InTown Suites, our Mexico assets and many of the non-strategic assets sold while using the proceeds to acquire high quality U.S assets in our key target market at lower cap rates. Headline FFO, which represents the official NAREIT definition for the third quarter was $0.39 per diluted share which includes $11.7 million of transactional income primarily from the receipt of a cash distribution in excess of the investments basis and certain land sale gains. Headline FFO per share for the 9 months is a $1.07. As requested by NAREIT, in addition to our FFO as adjusted per share guidance, we are providing full year Headline guidance for 2014 with a per share range of $1.42 to $1.45. ","U.S occupancy has increased to 95.5%, up 50 basis points for the quarter and up 60 basis points year-to-date. The bulk of the increase is attributable to positive net absorption with minimal impact from acquisitions and dispositions. Overall occupancy, including Canada and Latin America, is now 95.3%, also up 50 basis points for the quarter and 80 basis points since the beginning of the year. We are increasing our overall occupancy guidance for 2014 to up 80 to a 100 basis points from our previous guidance of 50 to 75 basis points. ","The closely watched metric of same site NOI growth is very strong at 4.9% in the US, bringing the year-to-date U.S same site NOI growth to 3.1%. The drivers of this same site NOI growth for the third quarter were strong minimum rent increases, providing 370 basis points of the growth and better credit loss performance contributing 60 basis points. Overall same site NOI growth, including Canada and South America was 4.8% excluding the negative impact from currency of 60 basis points. ","The improving third quarter results bring overall same site NOI growth for the 9 months to 3.3%, excluding the negative 80 basis points impact from currency. We are tightening our 2014 same site NOI guidance range to 2.75% to 3.5% from 2.5% to 3.5%. ","The transformation of our portfolio is in its final stage. During the quarter, we completed the disposition of 24 U.S assets, generating proceeds of $192 million and recognized non-FFO gains of $91 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold an additional 17 properties, providing another $104 million in proceeds. ","We have made tremendous progress on the simplification front. During the quarter we sold three properties in Mexico for $110 million and have a contract on nine other Mexican assets which we expect to close by year end. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed our exit from Peru and expect to sell the remaining assets in Chile shortly. We remain on target to substantially complete our south of the border exit by the end of the year. As a reminder, only upon substantial liquidation of an investment in a foreign country can the impact of foreign currency translation gains or losses be recognized in earnings. ","As of September 30, the unrealized loss due to currency associated with our Mexico and remaining South America assets was $127 million. This amount will fluctuate with changes in foreign exchange rates and the final impact of currency will not affect FFO at the time it is realized as it will apply to the respective gains and losses on the assets sold. ","Continuing with the simplification theme, we reduced the number of joint venture properties by 19 during the quarter, with the acquisition of 10 assets from SEB, which now wholly owned and the sale of nine properties from the (inaudible) DRA and Mexican joint ventures. We recognize the change of control gain, which is not included in FFO of $14.4 million relating to the SEB assets acquired. ","Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired seven properties from the joint venture with BIG and sold eight other properties from this joint venture. Overall we have reduced our joint venture properties from its peak of 552 properties to 342 properties today, a reduction of over $3 billion of gross real estate investment. ","On the balance sheet front, our debt metrics and liquidity position remained in excellent shape, with net debt to recurring EBITDA at 5.6 times and over $1.4 billion of immediate liquidity available. ","Lastly, we are pleased to announce that based on our 2014 performance, our board of directors has approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.24 per quarter up from $0.22.50 per quarter, an increase of 6.7% on an annualized basis. ","Our FFO payout ratio will remain conservative in the mid 60% range, among the lowest in our peer group.","And now I\u2019ll turn over to Conor.","Flynn","Thanks Glenn. Good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll update our progress on acquisitions and depositions and then cover the operating metrics. Finally, I will recap the redevelopment progress for quarter. ","Three major themes emerged this quarter. First, the demand for U.S real estate is robust, with private REITs, public REITs, international funds, private equity and high net worth individuals seeking out the safety and consistency in a volatile marketplace. This demand is driving cap rates lower and a disconnect exists on the pricing of an asset in the open market versus what is currently reflected in the net asset values in the public markets. ","Second, in the small shop retailer, specifically the service sector is coming back to open air shopping centers in a higher than anticipated rate, accounting for 92% of the new leases signed this quarter. And third, multifamily development continues to push land prices higher. While this limits retail ground up development opportunities, it is beginning to result in future redevelopment opportunities, where we can take an existing open air center and potentially add a mixed use component to create more value for the long term Kimco shareholder. We continue to position the Kimco portfolio to take advantage of the urbanization effect. ","As outlined in our press release, we acquired our partner SEB\u2019s interests in 10 grocery anchored centers, primarily located in dense mid-Atlantic markets. After the close of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of our partner BIG\u2019s interest in seven properties, while selling them our ownership in eight properties. This creative portfolio split adds six grocery anchored centers to our wholly owned portfolio. Six of these seven properties are located in California and one in Long Island. These two transactions continue our simplification strategy by reducing the number of properties in joint ventures, in addition to increasing the percentage of assets with a grocery component to 64.4%, up from prior year end of 58.6%. ","Since the beginning of the year, we have acquired 32 properties out of our joint venture platform with a gross value in excess of $970 million making up the bulk of acquisitions so far this year. While we continue to analyze and track high quality opportunities in the open market within our key territories, we remain disciplined due to historic low cap rates and a plethora of capital chasing high quality deals. We will continue to mine for acquisitions with redevelopment opportunities, but anticipate being a net seller in the fourth quarter. ","Turning to dispositions, during the third quarter we sold our ownership interest in 24 U.S properties, 17 wholly owned and seven held in joint ventures, totaling 2.4 million square feet for a gross sales price of $263 million, including $35 million of mortgage debt. The implied cap rate for these assets is a blended 7.5% and the company share of the proceeds from these sales was $205.4 million. Cap rate compression across all quality levels continues as investors large and small, domestic and international, are seeking safety in U.S real estate. We continue to execute on our stated strategy of transforming the portfolio by selling the lower quality and flat assets. So far this year we have sold 50 properties in the US at a blended 7.8% cap rate. We continue to take advantage of the ideal market conditions to exit our noncore assets. We anticipate a similar pace of dispositions to close up the year and are on track to complete the transformation and enhance the Kimco portfolio by the end of 2015. ","Dispositions this quarter included triple net JV portfolio, a former K-mart boxes that we repositioned with national big box retailers and sold to a public REITs. In addition, the former Frank\u2019s Nursery triple net portfolio in the mid-Atlantic has been repositioned with national junior anchors and sold to a private real estate company. Both of these portfolios were 100% occupied and sold into the hyper competitive triple net market. We will continue to bring other flat triple net properties to the market alongside noncore assets and continue to guide towards a blended eight cap for the year on our dispositions. ","While the inventory of available spaces continue to diminish in the retail sector, our leasing team is undaunted as it produces an impressive velocity of deals, filling up the sparse amount of vacancies and replacing expiring leases at higher rents. In the third quarter we signed 188 new leases for a total of 843,000 gross square feet. The impact was evident as our U.S occupancy rose 50 basis points to 95.5% driven by positive net absorption. ","Significant to note is that while our anchor occupancy is now at a striking 98.2%, up 40 basis points from last quarter and 80 basis points from the same quarter last year, it has been our small shop occupancy which has soared in 2014. Non-anchor occupancy is now up to 87%, up 70 basis points from last quarter and 230 basis points from the same quarter last year. This growth has been driven by both disposition and positive net absorption. ","We are seeing a healthy return of local mom-and-pop businesses mixed with national retailers and franchisors. We executed 173 small shop deals in the third quarter, 53% of which were pure mom-and-pops retailers. Once again the population of small shop leases was heavy on service based industries such as restaurants, saloons and spas, personal fitness and medical practices. 36 restaurant leases were executed this quarter, with 20 of the 36 being mom-and-pops tenants. The other small shop uses driving occupancy include 12 medical leases, 11wireless communication stores, seven hair salons, seven nail salons and four reals estate related services. Health and wellness is now a fixture in the open air shopping center industry as we continue to expand relationships with national and regional tenants such as Aspen dental, The Joint Chiropractic, Orange Theory Fitness, Hand and Stone Massage, Massage Envy, Phoenix Salons and Salons by JC. ","Another interesting trend is the recovery in the real estate service sector. Examples this quarter include deals with Sotheby's Realty and Stuart Title. The average base rent on the small shop portfolio is now $23.96, up $0.67 year to date.","Our new leasing spreads were a healthy 10.2%, driven by positive spreads for all tenant types including junior anchors, mid shop and small shops. The average ramp per square foot for new leases in the third quarter was $16.98, 26% above our portfolio average base rent. Renewal and option spreads were 6.4%. Interesting to note that for the past two quarters our renewal spreads have been higher than our option spreads, indicating a jump in market rents. Our combined leasing spreads were 7.1%. ","The positive impact redevelopment activity is having on the portfolio can be seen in the measurable improvements by a number of our key metrics, most notably same-site NOI where 35% of the growth was attributed to sites with redevelopment projects this quarter. In the third quarter, seven projects were completed with a gross cost of $12.5 million, adding incremental NOI of $942,000 for an ROI of 13.3%. Completed projects this quarter include Glenn Square where we redeveloped a large portion of the sites in anchorage Alaska for Bass Pro. After we positioned the asset, it was sold post quarter end, marking our exit from the Alaska market. Again we remain committed to operating a focused yet national portfolio. Seven more projects were promoted to the active status this quarter, with total gross cost of $9.5 million and a targeted ROI of 12.2%. ","We are continuing to expand our redevelopment pipeline and this quarter added over $200 million of new projects to the pipeline. Currently our pipeline totals gross cost of over $1.1 billion, up from $919 million last quarter. We now have $324 million or 28% of active redevelopment projects, $596 million or 52% under design and entitlement review and $230 million or 20% in the evaluation phase. ","Our retailer portfolio reviews reinforced the demand for high quality real estate and a significant lack of products in the market today. The supply and demand dynamic is creating a huge demand for high quality redevelopment projects at proven intersections. The value generation at these projects is twofold as we have created incremental NOI, but we have also added credit tenants and in many cases added a grocery component that further compresses the cap rate on the entire asset, leading to a higher net asset value. We now have four former K-Mart boxes that are active redevelopments, three in Florida and one in Saint Louis where we are demolishing the old boxes and adding tenants such as Whole Foods, TJX and Ross. Two of these were negotiated early termination. Analyzing the best use of our capital in the current environment continues to have all roads lead to redevelopment.","In closing, I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we have made on our stated strategy as we see it begin to produce results. As a bottom up real estate Company, our passion is to showcase the strength of our people and our real estate. The entrepreneurial culture at Kimco continues to create value for our shareholders and with a laser focus on what we do best, we are seeing it bear fruit. ","And with that I will turn it over to Milton.","Milton Cooper","Thanks Conor. I will be very, very brief since our numbers speak for themselves. I\u2019m pleased as punch over our team\u2019s performance for this quarter. We are executing and delivering on all metrics and I believe that our transformation has greatly elevated the quality of our portfolio. As a result, I\u2019m convinced that our portfolio is not only much more resilient to downturns, but that we have to lay the foundation to much stronger, long term upside. But what is most, most important is Kimco\u2019s talented team of passionate professionals. They are the principle source of my optimism for our future. ","And with that we are happy to take any questions.","David Henry","We\u2019re ready to move to the Q&A portion of the call. We request that you respect the limit of one question so all callers have an opportunity to speak with management. If you have additional questions you are welcome to rejoin the queue. Gary, you may take the first caller.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Given the near term completion of the Latin American portfolio sales, I'm wondering how the dispositions for 2015 will look in total when we compare them to 2014.","Glenn Cohen","Craig, it\u2019s Glenn. I would say that the amount of disposition that you\u2019ll see next year will be significantly less probably by about half. Disposition so far including Latin America, they\u2019re in excess of $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion so far. So it will probably be less than half of that next year, primarily obviously focused on finishing up the U.S dispositions that we\u2019ve target. ","Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And are you seeing a lowering of cap rates on the stuff you're selling as well as the stuff you're looking to acquire?","David Henry","Yes, we are seeing it compress across all levels. It's pretty apparent that cap rates continue to drift lower regardless of quality. ","Milton Cooper","And part of that is driven by the financing being available for even the secondary assets out there. The CMBS market is back I think the estimates are that there will be 100 billion of CMBS done this year. That\u2019s helping us dispose of the secondary assets. ","Operator","The next question comes from Christine McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.","Christine McElroy \u2013 Citigroup","Hi, good morning, everyone. Looking at expected same-store NOI growth in Q4, would you expect another big impact from redevelopment? And Conor, as you laid out the redevelopment pipeline and everything you're working on, what sort of impact should we expect on a go-forward basis over the next year on same-store growth from redevelopment?","Conor Flynn","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. Re-development definitely has become a bigger impact on the same site NOI figure and we anticipate that to continue. As we\u2019ve shown, we\u2019ve tried to ramp up the redevelopment pipeline. So as we see the deliveries come online, that\u2019s where you are going to see it have the biggest impact on our same site NOI. So Q4 we do anticipate to have another, call it a third of an impact on the same site NOI figure. And we continue to see that being the case going forward as we deliver projects and continue to add new projects to the pipeline. ","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Morgan with MLV. Please go ahead.","Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV","Hi, good morning. Just sticking with the redevelopments, two things. First, you have roughly the dollar volume of capital that was invested that translates into that 170 basis point impact and then you added, if I got this right, a couple hundred million dollars to the pipeline this quarter, I think you said. Maybe that's a pretty big change. What was the catalyst there? Do you have any examples of some of the things that got added?","David Henry","Yeah, there were -- that\u2019s a good question. There were two large projects that were added and that become active that was added. One was a termination with K- Mart in Orlando of a redevelopment project that became active and we have a signed lease with PGA to take a portion of the box and we\u2019re negotiating with two junior anchors to take the remaining portion of that asset. And then a large that we actually enhance the scale and size of a redevelopment that\u2019s under entitlement right now which is Highland Plaza which is located in Staten Island. We\u2019ve elected to make that a much larger redevelopment project and add more density there. We also added both sides of scale to our Pentagon project which is also under entitlement. And we are negotiating shipping entitlements, what was previously entitled as an office redevelopment, we are now switching it to apartments and we are adding size and scale to that property as well. So those are the three major movers.","Paul Morgan \u2013 MLV","Did you have the other part?","Glenn Cohen","We\u2019ll have to get back to you to get you a specific amount of what was invested that generated the 170 basis point increase in same site. That's just not sitting here our fingertips. ","Operator","The next question comes from, and please pardon me for any mispronunciation, Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley","That's okay, Operator. It's not the first time, but I appreciate your effort. Hey guys. My question is, you've done quite a bit this year in the portfolio transformations. So I'm curious on how you'd grade yourself on the execution, on the pace, the pricing versus your expectations a year ago. Have they come in on target, better pricing, better pace? I guess should we assume that going forward your transactions will be more opportunistic in nature now that the bulk of the work is done as you mentioned earlier in your call? Do you have any specific strategic goals, perhaps increasing NOI or exposure in certain areas of the country as we look into potential investments for 2015 and beyond?","Conor Flynn","I guess let\u2019s take them one at a time. If you recall we decided early this year to accelerate the disposition. So we give ourselves high marks for actually accelerating the pace of what we\u2019ve done. And we\u2019ve been able to move a lot of assets out into immediately a good market to sell assets. So we think we\u2019ve taken good advantage of the window that\u2019s opened to sell assets. And as buyers get frustrated for the A assets, there are looking at the B assets in some of these secondary cities. So we\u2019ve been able to play well into that. So I think we\u2019d give ourselves a high grade for that. In terms of recycling the capital that\u2019s coming in, we\u2019ve always been very selective about what we are buying in a market where prices are quite high. ","And that\u2019s why many of our acquisitions have been from our existing joint ventures where we know the assets and we can save money both with assumption fees and brokerage fees and transfer costs and things like that by negotiating with our institutional partners, who in many case have made a nice profit anyway on these assets. We\u2019ve been selective. We know it\u2019s a good time to be careful in buying assets. We do like to try to go after assets that have redevelopment upsides. So that\u2019s one of the things we look at in an era of low cap rates that\u2019s what we are trying to do. As we get to the end and we think by the end of \u201815 we\u2019ll be largely done the disposition program. So we will have a Tier 1 portfolio if you will that we are very proud of. So the amount of recycling capital will slow down.","David Henry","And on the strategic investments, I think you will continue to see us acquire in our key territories. Boston portfolio this year was a good example of something that we think we can add significant value to and is actually performing ahead of even our own expectations. And then you will see us acquire more adjacent parcels where that we can add significant density to our existing portfolio and play off of assets that we know and love and can use that as to grow our redevelopment pipeline.","Operator.","The next question come from Jason White with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jason White - Green Street Advisors","I just had a question on small shops. You said that mom-and-pop small shop demand was up quite a bit. I'm wondering if that is truly a change in demand or if it's a change in leasing strategy, whereas you're leasing to those folks now, but potentially you were looking for different tenants before. And then maybe also on the same topic, if you can break down the organic leasing in small shops versus the portfolio change with dispositions.","David Henry","It\u2019s a good question. The actual -- we have actually been targeting both the national franchises as well as the small shop operators because I think it\u2019s important as you look at your offering in your shopping center, that you try and offer something that lends itself to the local community that\u2019s also a little different than the normal names you see in every single strip center that you drive by. It\u2019s a strategy of ours that we think it adds a little something extra to connect to the local community. It\u2019s more of a demand function and we really have been pushing that and believe that that\u2019s a nice way to add an additional offering to our shopping center. In terms of the breakdown of the occupancy versus dispositions, it was about half and half in terms of the small shop occupancy on what was pure net absorption versus disposition. ","Milton Cooper","One of the catalysts for small shops coming back in our opinion is the community banking system has gotten more aggressive about lending to local businesses. They\u2019ve now recovered nicely from the recession. So they are a little more aggressive about letting a jewelry store expand to a second store or a drycleaner expand to a second and so forth. And also as housing recovers a little bit, the home equity lines of credit are being increasingly available. Our sources of capital now too for the mom-and-pops to grow again. ","Operator","The next comes from Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group. Please go ahead. ","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","A couple of questions relating to redevelopment of that pipeline that you talked about, Conor. With a combination of declining cap rates on transactions and apparently very high yields on your redevelopment, appears that there\u2019s a very significant value creation opportunity here. In the supplement, it is indicated that the range of yields on redevelopment is from a low of 8.5 to a high of 16 or so. And I think on the projects that were completed this quarter you talked about a number in the middle of that. I just wonder from the standpoint of calculating value creation, is that 12% to 13% number a number on average that you think is fair to use going forward? And the second part of the question is, you\u2019ve talked about multifamily potentially being inserted or combined with some of these developments. Does the range of yield that you are talking about include any multifamily products?","Conor Flynn","I would guide you that on average it will be closer to a 10% number. Now certain projects obviously will be higher than that. Some will be lower as well. On an average I would guide you to the 10% to use that. Definitely there are a few projects within our pipeline that we have started working on that could add a multifamily. Most of them are in the entitlement phase. We are still analyzing all of our different elements that go into that, what\u2019s the best way to approach unlocking the most value. And those will probably be -- depending on what tact we have for those, if we go out with the ground lease to an apartment developer, that will actually have a higher yield because it\u2019s no cost for us and they will take on the construction and development risk. Or if we decide to do something different, that might also alter the returns there. I think blended as a 10 is still the best way to model our future redevelopment pipeline. ","Operator","The nest question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Are you seeing any influx of interest from traditional mall tenants in space at your centers? ","Conor Flynn"," We have. That\u2019s been a trend that\u2019s been really been occurring now for probably a few years as it\u2019s happening across all grades of malls. So the A malls are getting to a point where their occupancy costs are so high that they have now started to test the waters in terms of shifting over to open air shopping centers that are surrounding the mall to see if they can see the sales transfer and still make the business make sense. The B malls clearly have come under a lot of pressure and there\u2019s now less leverage from the Simons of the world to be able to I guess keep the B mall tenants in place where they have them in A malls. In order to keep them in the B malls they have that type of leverage over them. So we are starting to see that as well as I would say outlet tenants. Outlet tenants have now started to migrate as well to the open air shopping center. We\u2019ve seen that in one of our assets where we just recently did a Talbot's outlet as well a Chico\u2019s outlet. So you are starting to see a blend come from multiple different disciplines and it's really benefiting the open air shopping center in our opinion.","Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets","Who's the most prolific taker of space, Conor?","Conor Flynn","Gap is one that clearly is interested in moving and they\u2019ve seen that that\u2019s worked for them in the past. So they would be probably the most active of that. And there\u2019s, Torrid is also active and a few others that -- the jewelers that come out of the malls as well seems to see some nice sales transfer.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Peterson with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Ryan Peterson - Sandler O'Neill","Good morning. Just one question. Given the retrenchment of the tenure recently, have you guys noticed any change in behavior from your JV partners, either more willing to sell their stakes to you or the reverse, no longer interested in selling them back?","Milton Cooper","Not really. We\u2019ve been proactive about talking with our institutional partners and the ones that have been game to talk we are continuing to talk. And as we\u2019ve mentioned in prior calls, we have certain JV partners that are long term holders and are not interested. I think with interest rates trending down yet again, it just shows that cap rates continue to drift down for particularly the very best properties. Valuations are up and there\u2019s just a lot of interest in real estate as a hard asset and is something that yields comparatively well with other alternatives.","Operator","The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Sun Trust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just a quick question on Sears. Could you just provide a little bit of a status report on how your dialogue is going on with Sears and maybe talk a little bit about how many boxes you expect to get back in the reasonable future? One thing I noticed in your disclosure was that it seems like you provided some sub lease disclosure in your footnotes regarding Sears maybe doing some of their own sub leasing to other retailers, if you could talk about that as well. Thank you.","Ray Edwards","Hi, this is Ray Edwards. Kimco has about 30 sites with Sears and K-mart. The interesting thing is of them, over half of them, they have lease expiration coming up in the next three to five years. For us, we also have an additional benefit that three or four locations, which are in terrific locations, they have no further options, for example Staten Island. We have one in LA. We're very excited about our opportunity with those sites. Over the years we've had a lot of dialogue with K-mart and Sears regarding opportunities. We did, a few years ago, do a site in Pompano Beach with them where we bought back the location. We've done that. We are talking to them about some other sites as well. We are actually working with them in a joint venture on an old product service center that we rezoned as potential development site that we've been partners with them for five or six years. ","So we go back a long way with Sears in trying to seek opportunities with them. Currently, I think our average rent for the K-mart is about $5.30 a foot. So it's a very low rent. We see a lot of upside in a number of our centers. But on the flip side for Sears, they do have a couple of locations with us that do great sales. While they are closing stores, I think about 140 or so in this fiscal year, most of them through lease expirations that they've had, a couple deals that they've done. But they are trying to trim their properties, but we have sites with them like we have in Bridge Hampton, we're doing terrific sales. That is a great location that will be very difficult to get back for us, but there are other opportunities for us in the marketplace and we're talking to them about some sites to see if we can do some transactions. ","David Henry","It's an open dialogue. This is something that\u2019s been going on for a long period of time and we continue to see them try to sub lease positions where they can get a nice spread on their existing rent. And then where we have tenants lined up we continue to talk to them about potential termination agreements. So we continue to keep the open dialogue and think they will be more coming as we believe it\u2019s a nice pipeline of future redevelopment opportunities for us.","Ki Bin Kim \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","You said of the half that's coming due in three to five years, they don't have options on those? ","Ray Edwards","On four or five they don't have any options. The others they do, but some of those stores, it's very possible we could work out a deal for them not to exercise their option if we have a redevelopment opportunity on them. Obviously they are very flexible about sites and where they want to be in five years.","Operator","The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Linda Tsai \u2013 Barclays Capital","The dynamic that you described on why traditional A and B mall tenants are moving into shopping centers, would you consider this a secular trend that is likely not to reverse any time soon? And then just secondarily, do you see an overall pop in traffic when you introduce these traditional mall-based tenants?","David Henry","It\u2019s tough to know if it\u2019s going to reverse itself. I think that at the current state of where we are in the real estate environment, there\u2019s become -- I think our open air shopping centers have become really the preference for millennials and for others because they enjoy the campus type of environment. As that trend occurs maybe that will continue, but again it\u2019s hard to know whether or not it\u2019s going to reverse itself. Right now we think that our suite of tenants that we deal with on a day to day basis are extremely healthy and are growing and you can see that their sales continue to perform well. We think that as we add different types of mall tenants to that it will enhance the surrounding retail and it will bring a nice dynamic to our shopping centers. But again it\u2019s tough to know if it will reverse. ","Glenn Cohen","And then you have to keep it in perspective on the numbers. There\u2019s about 115,000 neighborhood and community shopping centers and about 1,000 malls. It\u2019s not like the 1,000 malls and the tenants in those 1,000 malls make a huge dramatic shift into 115,000 properties. You\u2019ve just got to keep it in some perspective. ","Linda Tsai \u2013 Barclays Capital","And then the traffic?","David Henry","The traffic as I said, it does enhance our property if we can bring something different to the table. It\u2019s nice to be able to mix and match an offering with a Nordstrom Rack of the world but then with also a potential jeweler from an enclosed mall that will enhance the surrounding retail. You really want to look at what the local community is in need of and then provide it to them with the best offering of choice."," Operator ","The next question is from Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Jeremy Metz \u2013 UBS","Hi, good morning. It's Jeremy. I'm just wondering, now that you sold a lot of your lower tier assets and your occupancy is back above 95%, should we see the releasing spreads move into double digit territory next year and what is the current mark-to-market for the portfolio?","David Henry","It\u2019s a good point we definitely have because I would say close to stabilized occupancy in our anchor pipeline. That being said, we do have over 40 anchor leases coming due in the next year without options that we believe are below market. The average base rent on those boxes is well below our anchor average base rent. We still believe our upside is significant because of our below market rents due to the history of the company being a long term owner of shopping centers. We still have some of these K-marts that average base rents of $5 a foot. As we mark-to-market that we think there\u2019s still a significant embedded upside. ","Operator","The next question is follow up from Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group. Please go ahead. ","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","In David's prepared comments, he talked particularly about the demand growth from restaurants and restaurants haven't been as big of a factor in your tenant list as is the case with some of your peers. I'm just wondering to what extent we can expect that to change, whether this is material or whether this is just at the margin. If it does change, to what extent are these deals more TI intensive?","David Henry","I think it\u2019s more of a set the margin right now. The restaurants are definitely still a large portion of the retailer world that\u2019s taking space. They are very aggressive on upfront parcels. They have taken almost a role of financial institutions or banks that used to be the highest payer for the upfront parcel. When those pads become available it\u2019s usually a bidding frenzy between the Chick-fil-A's of the world and others that really want that upfront visibility as well as drive-throughs. You are seeing that continue and I would say that if you look over a longer period, you\u2019ll see that restaurants continue to be a more substantial part of the portfolio. ","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","And where they take in-line space, are the TI dollars significantly higher?","David Henry","Some will take in-line space. Panera Bread is a good example where we\u2019ve been successful in putting them on end caps and putting them in a location where typically pad users wouldn\u2019t locate. But again they have also changed their model a little bit now because Panera is now wanting to include a drive-through. So it just depends on the strength of the real estate that if they want to be in the location bad enough, they typically tend to change their model and make it work. TIs I think is something that restaurants are definitely the heaviest in terms of Tis. It goes -- typically when we have a bake and restaurant, we obviously target to replace it with another restaurant so the TIs aren\u2019t as heavy. But when you do a new build out, there is no question about it, they\u2019re the heaviest in TIs.","Milton Cooper","But the pricing power is there also from the landlord side. We are able to get good rents to offset that. ","Jim Sullivan - Cowen Group","Okay, very good. ","David Henry","Many of the pad users, many of the restaurants that want the pads typically prefer to ground lease. So the Chick-fil-A's of the world, those are typically ground leases where the landlord costs are minimal. It\u2019s just pad prep. ","Operator","The next question comes from Lina Rudashevski with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Lina Rudashevski \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi there. I was just wondering, when you look to 2015, how do you think net investment activity will compare to this year?","Glenn Cohen","Net investment activity, again we think that our disposition side will be significantly less. The acquisition side will probably be less also. Again this year when you look at all the acquisition activity we\u2019ve acquired on a gross, close to $1.2 billion, primarily buying out joint venture partners. I would guess that it\u2019s also going to be scaled back unless there\u2019s a great acquisition that\u2019s very, very accretive. Again the cap rate environment is very challenging today. Everything is very, very expensive and we are looking for assets that have real upside growth in them. Tough to find, so when we look at it say I would expect it to be somewhat muted than what we\u2019ve seen this year.","Conor Flynn","And as rents continue to increase, that redevelopment pipeline we have will continue to increase and that\u2019s our first choice of where we deploy capital.","David Henry","I would just add, we always get our fair share of acquisitions. We seem to be able to continue to leverage our relationships in our long standing history, whether it\u2019s through with retailers or whether it\u2019s through with owners, both public and private. We continue to find our fair share of acquisitions and we still have quite a bit of JV opportunities that we think we can harvest next year."," Lina Rudashevski \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And by what magnitude do you think the pace might decrease?","Glenn Cohen","Again, it\u2019s tough to tell. I would think that the -- again on the disposition side. I think it will be somewhere around half. Opportunities come and go. So on the acquisition side it\u2019s a little tough to tell. We haven\u2019t finished remodeling out what we expect to attempt to acquire. But what we\u2019ve been doing is to the extent that we have sold assets and raised whatever capital, we\u2019ve been redeploying that, primarily focused on putting it into our redevelopment programs, some new developments that we\u2019re targeting and then where we can be the buyer of a joint venture partner or buy one-off assets. Tough to figure.","Lina Rudashevski \u2013 JPMorgan","Thank you.","David Henry","I would just add that it is opportunity driven and at the current market, we prefer not to issue equity. We try to self-fund our developments and acquisitions because we think we\u2018re still trading at a discount. So to me that is critical in terms of continuing to push our internal portfolio to the next level by redevelopment and continuing to enhance it. ","Operator","The next question comes from Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tammi Fique - Wells Fargo","Hi. Just following up on the redevelopment discussion. What are the per square foot capital requirements for releasing the anchor boxes like the K-marts that you discussed? And then maybe along those same lines, what are the expected yields on those projects? Are they within that 10% range that you discussed? Thank you.","Glenn Cohen","The average cost range on the K\u2013marts boxes, depending on obviously the tenants that are going in, because many times we are demolishing it and starting from scratch. So it can range from$70 to $100 a foot depending on the tenant fit out and the amount of spaces that you are chopping off to really reposition it.","David Henry","The point is that we do have to divide the box or we\u2019re not.","Tammi Fique - Wells Fargo","Okay and then the yield \u2013","Glenn Cohen","From a yield standpoint, again we are not doing them if they are only going to yield3% or 4%. We really are focused on doing this redevelopments where they are going to yield 8% plus. ","David Henry","Yeah. To that point we sold two K-marts this quarter where we thought the average base rent was above market and we thought there was limited upside. So we elected to move out of them. .","Operator","The next question comes from Greg Schweitzer of DB. Please go ahead.","Greg Schweitzer \u2013 DB","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just going back to some of the leasing trends, on the mall type tenants, what sort of rents have you been getting versus the $23 small shop ABI average?","David Henry","Sorry. Could you repeat that? The mall -- which tenants?","Greg Schweitzer \u2013 DB","On the mall type tenants, what sort of rents have you been able to achieve versus the average small shop rent in the portfolio?","David Henry","The mall tenants, yeah, they definitely have been paying significantly higher because they are used to mall type rents. That\u2019s the beauty of it. They can still reduce their occupancy cost but as a whole when retailers look at their rents it's more of an all-in number. They\u2019re looking at their triple nets as well. So our triple nets comparing to the mall triple nets are much, much lower. When you look at the all-in comparison, they can continue to pay pretty high rents in the 25 to 30, but triple nets are lower. So an all-in occupancy cost is still achievable for them in terms of transfer.","Greg Schweitzer \u2013 DB","Okay. Then with the continued traction that you've made on the small shop side, particularly with the mom-and-pops, any update on where you see overall small shop occupancy over the next one to two years?","David Henry","Yeah. Our goal is 90%, which I think is very much achievable as they continue to trend and the pace continues. We\u2019re very, very focused on that and it\u2019s something that we are geared off to to try and achieve. We\u2019ve been a leasing company for a long, long time and this is what we do best. So I think we are well positioned to take advantage of that. ","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead.","David Bujnicki","Good morning. And thank you for joining Kimco's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me on the call are Conor Flynn, our Chief Executive Officer; Ross Cooper, President and Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, Kimco's CFO; David Jamieson, our Chief Operating Officer, as well as other members of our executive team that are present and available to answer questions during the call.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of the call may be deemed forward-looking. And it is important to note that the Company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the Company's SEC filings that address such factors.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Investor Relations area of our Web site.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Today, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter performance and give an update on our leasing and redevelopment progress, two critical components of our growth strategy. Ross will then report on our quarterly transaction activity and describe the overall transactional environment. Finally, Glenn will provide details on key metrics and our updated 2018 guidance.","Overall, the economy is healthy and consumer confidence is near at 18-year high as we enter the critical holiday season. Retail sales growth projections for this holiday season from both the National Retail Federation and ICSC are north of 4%, and we anticipate that our transformed portfolio will benefit from increased traffic and purchasing power. Having made the strategic decision to increase our dispositions in 2018, our portfolio is now well positioned to embrace the dynamic change in retail that is unfolding right before our eyes, and moving at a faster pace than anyone could have imagine. We were seeing major shifts in consumer preferences and shopping habits, impacting every retail category, which has resulted in a form of retail Darwinism.","While some legacy retailer have been unable to adapt and compete in the renew environment, resulting in reorganization or liquidation, there are many more savvy well capitalized and experienced retailers who have successfully adapted their business models and are flourishing. We are also seeing many new and creative concepts stepping in and grabbing market share at a rapid cliff. Off-price continues to thrive. Our recent National Retail Federation survey showed that 89% of consumers shop at discount retailers and their appeal spans across ages and income groups. Retailers like Walmart and Target have gone on the offensive with acquisitions or new store concepts and the results are showing. Target, for example, recorded traffic growth of 6.4% in its most recent earnings report, by far the strongest since the Company began reporting traffic in 2008.","Comparable sales increased 6.5%, which was Target\u2019s best comp in 13-years. Health and wellness concepts and trends continue to create new demand across categories, from new forms of exercise classes to restaurants and to fashion. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, with other new retail concepts and categories continuing to emerge. So, while change in the retail sector maybe disconcerting to the investor, the fact of the matter is that there are more store openings than closings. And the changes occurring in the shopping center landscape are for the better. Why for the better? Because the survivors and new comers are better capitalized and better prepared to adapt the consumers' changing taste and needs.","Kimco's vision and strategy dovetails with this continuous evolution by focusing on place making and reinvesting in our best assets to create live-work-play experiences. The key is having the right real estate, an exceptional team and a rock solid balance sheet. The quality of Kimco\u2019s real estate is validated on a daily basis. As the demand for space in our shopping center portfolio remains strong with new and expanding retailers continuing to see great locations. This is also reflected in our key metrics with continued strength in leasing spreads occupancy and same side NOI. Our new lease spreads are 12.1% continue our streak of 19 quarters in a row with spreads over 10%.","Our portfolio occupancy remains strong to 95.8% despite the slight impact from the Toys R Us vacates.. While our small shop occupancy has reached at an all time high of 98.8%. As to Toys R Us, we have executed leases or leases have been assumed on more than 60% of Toys R Us spaces, or 13 of 21 boxes with LOIs and leases pending on all remaining locations. The demand has been strong but the primary drivers coming from the leaders and off-price furniture, hobby, fitness and entertainment.","The recent Sears Holding's bankruptcy should provide Kimco with the long weighted opportunity to reposition our 14 remaining Sears Kmart locations, which are significantly below market. And while these boxes account for only 60 basis points of our total ADR, we have been proactively marketing these locations and are ready to recapture them and start to create value.","As for our major projects, we were thrilled to host our grand opening of Lincoln Square in the third quarter with residents moving into the apartment units and Sprouts Farmers Market opening the lines around the block. This Center City Philadelphia project provides a window into the future of what we expect from our mixed use platform. Other major milestones include the opening of our first phase of Dania Pointe in Florida that is set for next week, and Costco's opening at Mill Station in Owings Mills, Maryland just last week. These signatures series redevelopments are now all over 90% preleased and are set to deliver significant growth for the Company in 2019 and beyond.","In closing, we are pleased with the momentum we are building in both our leasing and redevelopment platforms. The strength of our portfolio has given us the confidence to raise our FFO and same site NOI guidance for 2018. We believe it is more important than ever to have a motivated team that is laser focused on execution at the local level to help drive strong sustainable growth and create long term shareholders value.","And now, I'll turn it over to Ross for his transaction updates.","Ross Cooper","Thank you, Conor. We had another very productive quarter on the transaction side, setting us up for a strong year-end. In the third quarter, we sold 10 shopping centers for $154 million KIM share. An additional sale occurred yesterday in Greenville South Carolina for $37 million. With those closings behind us, we have now sold 49 centers year-to-date with total Kim share proceeds of approximately $722 million, exceeding the bottom end of our range of $700 million to $900 million provided at the beginning of the year. As such, we are raising the low end of the dispositions guidance for a new range of $800 million to $900 million. The blended cap rate through the third quarter remains within the target range of 7.5% to 8% and we anticipate ending the year firmly within set range.","As we previously indicated, given the success of our disposition activity this year, our 2019 disposition plans anticipate only a modest level of asset pruning with proceeds being used primarily to fund redevelopment. As we enter the year with our right-sized portfolio, the major focus for the Company is the internal growth opportunities. In terms of transactions market color, investor demand for shopping centers remain strong across all quality levels and geographic locations. Core institutional asset sales continue to be very competitive with substantial capital raise and dry-powder chasing limited opportunities. Cap rates for this product continues to be sticky with transactions in the low 5s and high 4s in several coastal markets.","Value-add investors continue to seek yield and are willing to stretch for asset that meet their criteria and provide upside potential. There has been a tangible increase in investor demand for our assets earmarked for disposition over the course of the year with private equity capital plentiful and debt readily available from traditional lenders, as well as non-traditional financing sources. We've also been approached by interested parties evaluating larger portfolio opportunities. However, at this stage of our disposition program, we continue to focus on finishing off the remainder of the asset sales on a one-off basis. We still believe that is the best way to maximize value.","Glenn will now provide additional detail on our financial performance for the quarter.","Glenn Cohen","Thanks, Ross and good morning. Our third quarter performance further exemplifies our continued focus on execution of our strategic plan. Leasing continues at a brisk pace, our signature suites projects are beginning to come online, our disposition target is in range and our balance sheet and liquidity position are in solid shape.","For the fourth quarter, NAREIT FFO was $0.34 per diluted share, which includes $0.03 per share charge from the early extinguishment about $300 million 6.875% bonds and $0.01 per share from transactional income, primarily from gains on land sales. FFO was adjusted, which excludes transactional income and charges and non-operating impairments, was $0.36 per diluted share for the third quarter as compared to $0.38 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. The decrease is a direct result of our aggressive disposition program, which resulted in the sale of $922 million of assets during the past 15 months and a corresponding reduction of NOI of approximately $16 million during the quarter.","The proceeds from the dispositions we used to fund our development and redevelopment programs, which are beginning to produce cash flow, as well as the debt reduction. Our transformed portfolio with over 80% of our annual base rents coming from assets in our top 20 markets nationwide is producing strong operating metrics. Our programmed anchor occupancy was 97.6% at the end of the quarter despite the 40 basis point impact from the Toys R Us boxes that vacated during the quarter, and as Conor mentioned, are being addressed at the speedy pace.","Our leasing spreads for new leases remained double digit positive and lease options and renewals produced 7.9% increase. Same side NOI growth was 2.3% for the third quarter and includes a contribution of 10 basis points from redevelopment projects. Most encouraging was the 3.5% growth in the minimum rent component of our same site NOI, which was offset primarily by higher property expenses net of recoveries due to large real estate cash refund received last year and higher credit loss reserve due to the recent bankruptcy filings of various tenants. For the nine month period ended September, same site NOI growth was 3% primarily from the minimum rent contributions with no incremental effect from redevelopments.","Same site NOI growth for the quarter and the nine month period at September both benefited from more Toys R Us leases being affirmed or assigned and anticipated and the delay in timing of lease rejections by Toys R Us. On the balance sheet front, our consolidation weighted average debt maturity profile is now 10.7 years, one of the longest in the REIT industry with no unsecured debt maturing until May of 2021, and only $120 million of mortgage debt maturing during the same timeframe. We have over $2 billion available on our unsecured revolving credit facility, which provides a significant liquidity for any opportunistic funding refinements.","Let me spend a moment on 2018 guidance. Based on our year-to-date same site NOI results, we are increasing our same site NOI growth guidance for the full year 2018 from 2% to 2.5% to a new range of 2.3% to 2.7%. We are also increasing our full year NAREIT FFO per share guidance range from $1.43 to $1.46 per share to a new range of $1.45 to $1.47, and listing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range from $1.43 to $1.46 to a new range of $1.44 to $1.46. We will provide 2019 guidance on our next earnings call. Our team remains confident and energized as we complete 2018, and look forward to realizing the benefits of our efforts in coming year.","And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","David Bujnicki","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to offer a reminder that you may ask a question with an additional follow-up. If you have any further questions, you are welcome to rejoin the queue. Anita, you can take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] The first question today comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Ross, I was hoping you can give a little more detail about the stuff you sold in the quarter in terms of occupancy, and what the mark-to-market profile look likes for those assets. And then you mentioned moving to a more modest level of sales next year. Can you put some rough numbers around what exactly that could mean?","Ross Cooper","In terms of the sales this quarter, the total amount of $154 million was a little bit less than previous quarters, but continued to be primarily geographically located within the Midwest and a couple of other assets outside of the Central part of the country. Occupancy remains very high on the disposition side just around 95% for the quarter. So we are selling fairly stabilize assets. As we get into next year, as we mentioned, it will be a meaningfully less number. We are very confident in the right size portfolio that we have by the end of this year. So we\u2019ll continue to prune assets and fund redevelopment opportunities with that, and really focus on the recurring FFO growth for 2019. But it will be a modest number.","Jeremy Metz","So is that $200 million to $300 million, is that kind of a fair ballpark to put it?","Ross Cooper","I think when you look at our redevelopment spend, which will be started in that low to mid $200 million number, the dispositions are really earmarked for that.","Jeremy Metz","And second one from me, just in terms of the bankruptcies here, the 21 Toys' boxes. How many of those are peer re-tenant boxes as is versus where you\u2019re going to need to break it up? And then can you also comment on Mattress Firm. You have the 62 leases. So do you know at this point how many are on that near term closing list? And then the rent is north of $29 in aggregate, so a little about the portfolio level. So is it fair to assume that the rents will come down here as you re-lease those or any range you can frame around that opportunity?","David Jamieson","First, let\u2019s address the Toys R Us, question. In terms of those that have already been awarded at auction or signed, there were six initially. So there is no downtime in rents. They are assumed either by retailers or other operators. From there, we\u2019ve had since before this call seven executed, six have what\u2019s should have been single tenant backfills, one of which is a box split and then that brings you to 13. Of the remaining, we have six that are in negotiation, LOI negotiation, of which three of the six will be single tenant backfills. So out of that group, you only see four that could be potential box splits.","And then on the remaining two there, they are currently flagged and are under contract for disposition. So what we've seen is really single tenant has been the dominant use for these boxes, which is obviously helped reduce the overall cost required to reposition the boxes. And then as it relates to Mattress Firm I'll turn it over to Glenn.","Glenn Cohen","With regard to Mattress Firm, eight of our 62 properties were listed sites to close in the first month of the filling and for now, we don\u2019t know of any store closings. We\u2019re working with the company. We might figure a few more might fall out as they might see want rent reductions that we don\u2019t want to give to them. But it should be pretty fast pace with them assuming by middle of November to have a plan improve to come out of bankruptcy shortly thereafter at 100% plan to the unsecured creditors.","Conor Flynn","And we're comfortable with the mark-to-market on those locations. We feel like they're pretty much right at market. We don't see any see any rent roll downs. Typically, they like to be right up in front either on a pad or on NCAP. And as our small shop occupancy, as you know, it's just hit all time highs. There is significant demand for those locations from service tenants, from restaurants, from financials. So we feel really strong that those bases will be recaptured and leased very quickly.","Operator","Next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Just with regards to the 14 Sears Kmart boxes, in terms of being ready to recapture them. I know it's early in the process. But just wondering how much progress you're looking to potentially make in the context of the bankruptcy process. And what impact does Bridgehampton being collateral in the debt financing have on your ability to get back at some point?","David Jamieson","So on the Kmart's the 14. So what we know today is that there will be four coming back to us. And right now, it actually has to go to auction. One of which is slated for dispo and then other remaining three, we have LOIs and negotiation for the balance of those boxes for single tenant users. And as a reminder as well, one of those is in one joint venture where we own 15%, while the other is -- and eventually in which we own 49%. So from a cost standpoint, we feel very comfortable there. That said, it still needs to go to auction, auction date has not yet been set yet.","So what we've been doing and what we've messaged clearly over prior quarters is we've constantly prepared for this event and we continue to be out in the market preleasing these boxes with contingent leases. So if and when we do get them back, we'll be ready to act.","Glenn Cohen","And then with regards to Bridgehampton, typically, one is that was an bankruptcy. Almost usually all the leases are part of collateral, so they're very selective here in what they did. But if there is reorganization around the company, which they're trying to do or going to [indiscernible], probably Bridgehampton will be part of that and we might not get it back. But if it's a wind down then it's doesn't matter and we'll have an opportunity to get the property back to that time.","Christy McElroy","And then, Conor, you talked a bit about the big changes in retail happening at a faster pace whenever. Just from a bigger picture perspective. Can you put in context how you're thinking about the necessary CapEx spend in that environment? So you have on hand the revenue generating redevelopment investigation opportunities created but then there is also this elevated pace of re-tenanting churn. And how you're thinking about that relative to trying to get back to free cash flow positive after dividend?","Conor Flynn","When you look at our strategic goals for the long term for Kimco, we were very vocal about what we wanted to do with the portfolio to really transform the geographic locations. We're big believers in the top-line markets in the U.S. that's where we see population growth, that's where we see barriers to entry and that's where we see retailers want to be. And they want to concentrate their store base there. So what we found is the demand for the locations in those areas have been really actually stronger than we anticipated. And that's why you're seeing us be I think well ahead of where are we anticipated for our Toy R Us leasing, because those boxes really are concentrated in our best markets.","There will be some tenant churn, as you mentioned. We've gone through a point where the legacy retailers that have not invested in the store and not put the customer really as a focal point, those are the boxes that are coming back to us. But the beauty of Kimco is our diversity, when you look at our tenant diversity, we feel like it's unmatched. If you look at the ability of us to mark-to-market on those boxes gives us great potential to really generate significant return on investment for our shareholders. And what we continue to focus on, whether it's the Toys' boxes or the Kmart boxes, we look at it as an opportunity. We look at it as a way that we've got the right portfolio now that we can unlock the value for our shareholders by repositioning the real estate with great quality tenants that are going to drive more traffic.","And then you get the halo effect that will really drive the surrounding rents on the spaces that have been living with some of these retailers that have not been driving traffic for an extended period of time. And so that\u2019s where the focus has been of the Company and we're very excited to turn the page and head into '19 with the trim down portfolio tightly concentrated in our best metro markets with the big redevelopment pipeline that\u2019s just starting about to deliver as you've seen with Lincoln Square and others where we've got, I think, the right mix of projects and place making that really makes a difference in today's world, because you can't just lineup boxes next to each other and think that someone who's going to shop it, you've got to lien, you've got to create the place, you\u2019ve got to do more from n landlord perspective.","Christy McElroy","Just one quick follow up on that, it sounded like the Toys' boxes, a few of them are going to be box foots. I can imagine these Kmart boxes, a bunch of them are going to be box splits. What impact is that have on the timeline to getting free cash flow positive? I think originally you were talking about potentially next year. I had to imagine that this CapEx spend continued to eat into that?","Conor Flynn","Well, remember six were awarded from the Toys', so we actually have no capital outlay there. And the majority of the Toys' boxes are actually individual tenants taking the existing boxes. And the cost has actually been pretty modest when you look at the TI and landlord work there. Right now, it's right in that range of $35 to $40 a foot for the Toys' location. So, we feel like we've been careful and cognizant of the CapEx that are going into these boxes. You're right when you split a box, it takes little bit longer to get the rent to commence. But since the lion share of these boxes have been single tenant users, we feel like we can get those paying tenants open quicker. And you've seen that with the compression of the leased economic occupancy spread. We put a lot of effort and put more resources behind expediting rent commencement dates and you're starting to see that happen.","Glenn Cohen","Don\u2019t forget, these are also revenue generating -- this is revenue generating CapEx. This is not just maintaining same rents. You have rents on these Sears boxes that are at 5 bucks a foot. So there is a fair amount of revenue generation that\u2019s going to come from it.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt","Looking toward future redevelopment efforts, will you be actually replacing existing anchors, given just view on winners and losers in the space?","Conor Flynn","I think that\u2019s always part of the business, Craig. When you look at how to generate the most traffic to your assets, you really want to try and put together the tenants that are going to drive traffic at all points during the day. And so, this is a long-term business. Typically, our retailers sign long-term leases. So, we would have love to been repositioning our real estate over the years with the best-in-class. But many times, the real estate is controlled by these long-term leases. So, as these boxes have been coming back to us, you've seen us get the mark-to-market opportunity, as well as the repositioning opportunity to drive more traffic.","And so there has been a lot more repositioning with the off-price players. When you look at TJX and all their banners, including their newest concepts, they are doing quite well; Homesense and Sierra Trading Post, Burlington and Rawson and then Sprouts Farmers Market; the Specialty Grocers, where we're doing a lot of deals with Sprouts and Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. Those are the types of players that we get really excited about, because it compresses the cap rate on the whole assets and it also drives tremendous amount of traffic.","Craig Schmidt","And then what is the climate of the smaller space, the small business in terms of taking new space?","Glenn Cohen","The climate for our small shops has been very, very strong. When you look at 90.8% on our small shop occupancy, which is by far in a way the highest we've ever seen in the Company. It's just evidenced you have small businesses that are continuing to look to open locations. The franchise model has been very successful in this last run up. It gives people an opportunity to focus on the business less so on specifically trying to find a business, so they can take an existing business and just start performing.","You've seen the carriers doing well, the financials doing well, fast casual, QSRs, all very, very active. You can be excited of the fact too that Amazon with the Amazon Go rollouts, how that trends, the pace of that no one knows. But just again, it's further illustrating that there is high-high for a great quality real estate on the small shop category.","Conor Flynn","We have been putting a lot of focus, Craig, on services. When you look at the makeup of our small shop tenant base, we always had the hair salon, the nail salon and now we've really seen a boost when you look at the business element in the health and wellness and beauty that has just been a major, major shift in terms of demand. And we continue to see it expand and we like those uses, because we haven\u2019t been able to figure out what\u2019s the Internet resistant type use like those fitness players where you can\u2019t do that online here.","Glenn Cohen","And just to add a little also. Having transform portfolio with all the sales we\u2019ve done, I mean it's part of the evidence that it's working. Now getting to 90.8% of small shop, it's proves where the profits are. You have properties that are in higher demographic areas, higher household incomes, higher density, higher population, it's just better market and they lead to being able to add more small shop space to the centers.","Operator","The next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Greg McGinniss","I was just curious what percent of taxable income is currently being distributed and how you\u2019re thinking about dividend raises considering the level of dispositions this year and the mid 80% if full payout I believe you have talked about before?","Glenn Cohen","We are comfortable with the dividend level is today. Again, we are focused on continuing to grow our EBITDA and our recurring FFO as we go forward. And each quarter we go ahead and we analyze and look and discuss with our board where the dividend level is. For now, we're fine and very comfortable where it is and we\u2019ll go quarter-by-quarter and continue to monitor.","Conor Flynn","As we have mentioned before, we have a very large redevelopment pipeline that\u2019s now prefunded and preleased and starting to deliver. And that really showcasing what we believe is going to really grow the recurring the FFO and EBITDA levels in '19 and '20. So, that\u2019s where we've been investing as we want to create the places that people want to come back to time and time again, which will really help us drive free cash flow.","Greg McGinniss","So how do you think about that discrepancy or -- matching out of the mid 80% for payout goal or increasing the dividend, I guess?","Conor Flynn","Again, it\u2019s a balance and we\u2019re going to continue to grow recurring FFO and EBITDA and then talk with our board and see when it makes sense to continue to grow our dividend.","Greg McGinniss","And with disposition and funding earmarked for redevelopment next year. Should we expect another year of pretty limited acquisitions? I mean, is there anything even worth buying at this point?","David Jamieson","I mean, there are certainly assets in the market that we like. We continue to be very selective and I would imagine it will be an extremely modest level for next year. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the cap rates and the prices for the high quality stocks is still very aggressive with low cap rates. With where our cost of capital is today, it doesn't make sense for us to be acquiring in the open market. So, we'll continue to monitor. We see everything that's out there. We're building long term relationships for acquisition opportunities when our cost of capital does come back. But for now, our priority is clearly the redevelopment spend where we get significantly better yield than what we would planned on the open market.","Ross Cooper","We have a very deep pipeline of redevelopment projects. And the team is spending a lot of human capital working on getting entitlements for future projects that will take us several years out. So we feel pretty comfortable that where we can deploy our capital accretively.","Conor Flynn","We will always be looking for adjacent parcels and things that could potential add to our redevelopment potential where it makes sense for value creation opportunities.","Operator","Next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rich Hill","Maybe I want to just spend a little bit more time on the cash flow side of the argument part of the debate. So, when I'm looking at your consolidated -- your condensed consolidated statement of income, it looks like your revenue came down quarter-over-quarter. Is that just due to you pruning your portfolio, or are there other things that we should be considering?","Glenn Cohen","No, it's a direct correlation to the amount of sales. As I mentioned, over the last 15 months, we've sold over $900 million of assets. That's what it relates to.","Rich Hill","But then at the same time, it looks like CapEx is up to maybe stable at the same time. Is that just because -- to go back to what was previously discussed. Is that just because you're spending more line on development at this point?","Glenn Cohen","We are between the developments, the redevelopments. Again, we put some money back into the Sports Authority boxes that are not starting to see come on line. If you look at our lease to economic spread, that's actually narrowed by 50 basis points. So again, that's from more than capital that we put in to get those flows starting.","Rich Hill","Once we get the 10-Q, I may have some additional questions. But thank you guys, I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Just two questions. First, Glenn, just with Sears, Mattress Firm, Toys, being the biggies. As we think about NOI this year versus next, how much NOI is going to be coming out of 2019 as these retailers wind down with an understanding you're going go back selling but still probably not till later in the later. And I understand that Sears maybe restructure it, so maybe that some of that NOI doesn't go away. But just can you quantify it of how much NOI is going to come out of on an annualized basis out of 2019. And then we can guess at when that may start to get come back online in the later part.","Glenn Cohen","The short answer is we can't actually do that, because we don't really know what's going to happen with Sears Kmart. We know that a few of them have been that we expect to get them but we don't know what's going to happen with the other 10. And in the case of Mattress Firm, although, there is eight on the block as Ray mentioned, we don\u2019t know what the final balance is going to be there as well. The other point I would make on the Mattress Firm is on the once that they reject, because it is 100% plan, we are going to wind up getting a full years' worth of rent as part of a rejection claim.","So, the Mattress Firm leases, I don\u2019t really think they are going to have a major impact on our '19 NOI. So, it's very, very hard to predict what it's going to be. I think the good news for us is when you look in total, Sears makes up less than 60 basis points, Mattress Firm makes up less than 80 basis points. And it does look like Mattress Firm is going to come out as a rework, so many of those clients will stay in place.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then the second question is just on Albertsons, thinking for your next steps. What are you guys thinking as far as your position there? Is it worth it -- I mean, it would seem like you don't really get any credit for it. So is pursuing a private sale and just being done with it and not having this linger over. Does that seem more likely, especially if the retail environment seems to be improving? And my understanding is Albertsons had some good sales recently or good earnings recently. Or is your hope still to try and affect either in IPO or some sort of merger?","Conor Flynn","I think that the IPO route is the way that the company is focused on it. And listen they went to all the noise over eight months of its merger with Rite Aid. And during that time period, they improved the operations they didn\u2019t get distracted from that, sales improved. They reduced their debt levels. They had about $11 billion in net debt a year and half ago and now they have about $9.5 billion in net debt. And they're getting themselves in the right shape for the company with over $1 billion of free cash flow expected in the coming year that they're going to get themselves markets prevailing and allowing us to be in a good position sometime hopefully in '19 to do something on IPO. But again markets have a little direction of whether we can do something or not. But they're running the business very well, improving the business, reducing the debt and it's all we can ask them to do for us right now.","Glenn Cohen","I'd add also Alex that -- again in our '19 numbers, there is nothing in there for Albertsons enrolled; we are focused on our core business of leasing, development, redevelopment; Albertsons when it happens, it's just going to be an outside for us. So it's not in anyone's numbers, it's not in any of our debt metrics or anything else that goes along that line.","Alexander Goldfarb","I understand, Glenn, but it's still a source of capital. So are you guys dual tracking it where you're running right now possibly, which you have to private people to sell to, if the IPO doesn\u2019t occur? I mean, it just seems like it does help you guys de-lever and get you there where that's more beneficial than maybe maximizing the last dollar.","Conor Flynn","We're not doing that at this point. We haven\u2019t considered that it, I think. We think we're very bullish on where they are going now and there is a lot of upside if they execute the plan. And you don\u2019t want to leave too much money on the table, so we're not even thinking about that, because we're very bullish on the prospects for the next year or so.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Steve Sakwa","I guess first question really is on the redevelopment development program. As you just look out for the '19, '20 and maybe even deals that you're contemplating for '21. What kind of returns do you think you can achieve? And what maybe cost pressures are you seeing on the construction side and what rents are there on those yields?","Conor Flynn","When you look at our pipeline, we actually feel like we're in really good shape, because the developments that we have really in the pipeline right now are all prefunded and heavily preleased and will start to really deliver in '19 and '20; so when you look at Grand Parkway Phase 1 and Phase 2, that\u2019s going into operations now; when you look at Dania Pointe, the Phase 1, we're actually going down next week for the ribbon cutting and it's over 90% preleased and open, and really stabilize in '19; when you look at Lincoln Square, the retail is 100% preleased and we\u2019re now really starting to bring on the multi family section of it with we just actually signed our 100th apartment lease there; and Mill Station, we just opened Cosco, Lowe's expect to open right after that and its over 90% prelease.","On the redevelopment side, we\u2019ve got some great projects that are under construction; Pentagon is topped off that\u2019s our large multifamily tower; we sit right above the metro there in Pentagon City and continue to watch that when take shape; the Boulevard in Staten Island continues to take shape, as well as few is going up. The projects that we have currently under construction really have all of Gmax contracts. So even though prices have been rising, we\u2019ve locked in our cost and feel very comfortable with our returns.","On the future projects, as we mentioned earlier, we are working hard and entitling a number of projects across the portfolio. And then each one we\u2019re going to have a decision tree of how we fund it, how we\u2019re going to actually create the highest and best returns for our shareholders. And as you have seen in our pipeline, we really identified really where our cost of capital is and how would we best unlock the value for our shareholders. We can sell those entitlements. We can ground those entitlements. We can joint venture those entitlements. And so right now where our cost to capital is, we\u2019re going to look at the portfolio and look at the opportunities we have in the future. And when we get the projects shelve ready then we\u2019re going to take the best approach, going forward.","The returns for multifamily have been in that, call it, 6% to 7.5% returns and on retail they have been much higher. And so we're cognizant of where our cost of capital is and the funding requirements and then going forward, we're going to take it on a one off basis and really identify what\u2019s the best way to unlock the value.","Steve Sakwa","So, is there a way for you to just blend it? So on average, the '19 and '20 deliveries you think will have average returns of what?","Glenn Cohen","In between 7% and 8%, I think when you look at the blended, because of the multifamily projects that we have coming online that that brings it into 7% to 8% range.","Steve Sakwa","And I realized you're not giving 2019 guidance. But as you just look forward and think about the tenant watch list and a lot of things that\u2019s happened this year and maybe the timing of like the Sears Kmart was under there this year and maybe next year. As you just look at the watch list today, how does that stack up versus maybe a year ago? And would you consider or think that your reserves would need to be as big next year as they were coming into this year?","Conor Flynn","The watch list is something obviously we talk about a lot and we continue to see that. Actually it's getting a little bit smaller with these legacy retailers liquidating and going out of business. And so, when you look at our exposure, it really is modest compared to what it has been in years past. Sears Kmart, for example, even though we have 14 locations one of them is actually already subleased to a public retailer. So we don\u2019t think we'd lose any income or have any capital outlay there at all.","We think that three of the four that are going to auction, there is a chance that a number of those locations might be purchased at auction, because of the below market leases, so again. limiting our downtime and our costs on some of those locations.","I mean, clearly, there is still some disruption going on in retail and we're cognizant of that. We don\u2019t want to sound overly optimistic but we look at the portfolio, we look at where we\u2019re positioned and we think that the normal run rate going forward of that 100 basis points of bad debt reserve is something that we continue and we'll have going forward as we look at years '19 and '20.","Operator","The next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Vince Tibone","For the seven Toys' boxes that have already been re-leased. When do you expect those tenants to open and start paying rents and what was the mark-to-market on those spaces?","David Jamieson","So the mark-to-market has been pretty much in the mid-single digits, low to mid-single digits. And in terms of flows of those, we'd expect to start seeing them coming in the back half of '19 and into '20 as well. So again, six of the seven of those are single tenant uses. So, those will be push forward and start find a little bit sooner than the others.","Vince Tibone","Were those spreads you're expecting on these spaces or is that in line with your expectations maybe a year ago?","David Jamieson","I mean, most of the significantly below market leases were one that were picked up in auctions. So when you look at the whole portfolio, the whole mark-to-market opportunity was higher. And then for those that we had remaining, they were slightly close to the market. So that's about in line with what we were expecting.","Vince Tibone","My next question is for Ross. You mentioned Kimco was approached by interested buyers about potential portfolio deals. Do you still feel that portfolio deals are being discounted by buyer versus the pricing you could achieve by selling individual assets?","Ross Cooper","I think there is still a modest level of discount but it's certainly narrowed somewhere that the discount for portfolios was when there were discussions that we were having at the early part of the year. So, I do think that there are large private equity groups that are getting a bit more constructive on retail and looking at opportunities within portfolios. So, you may see that as we get into '19 with some other portfolio owners. But for us, we're at the tail end of this program. So, we just have -- we're going to finish it off with the one-off strategy.","Operator","The next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Derek Johnston","Could you talk about cap rates that you've seen for different formats? Have you seen any divergence between power centers versus grocery anchored, especially with recent pushes into online grocery, any changes in demand or pricing?","Glenn Cohen","I think for the core major market assets, grocery anchored products is still very much in favor, particularly for the best-in-class grocers. So, there are couple of examples in Raleigh, Portland, Northern California. We've seen grocery anchored deals either closed or priced sub-5%. I would agree with the premise that as you get a little bit outside of the real major institutional type of assets that buyers are being much more critical of who the grocer is, what their performance is, if their rent is replacable. Whereas in years past, I believe that having a grocery anchored was an automotive all the proof type of investment for an investor.","So, I think there is a bit of a blending now between grocery power if you're outside the major institutional markets, people are just much more focused on who the retailer is, how their performance is, how their rent compares to market and if there is any additional upside. So, that's really what we're seeing in the marketplace today.","Derek Johnston","And no TIs and CapEx associated with new leasing activity in 3Q, it did looked a bit higher than previous quarters and the volumes looked a little light. Of course, I understand this is a volatile statistic Q-over-Q and a slightly smaller portfolio. But was this related to a specific new lease or is it consistent with breaking up some of the bigger boxes and something that may remain elevated into 2019 if there's any insight there that you can share please?","Glenn Cohen","You're spot on it was driven by a few leases that elevated the cost side. But what's also more important to look at is on the new rent side. So when you look at the trailing forward or just over 19 bucks, in this quarter we're at over $22 a foot. So there is a significant gain there as well more than compensate for the slight increase of the additional cost and that's where it was driven by. So you strip those out and you're pretty much back in your trailing four and the trend we assume will continue.","Operator","Next question comes from Wesley Golladay with RBC. Please go ahead.","Wesley Golladay","Looking at the Toys R Us, you had six Toys' boxes awarded to others. And I think you mentioned maybe some of the Kmart's maybe assumed by others. Could you talk about who are those entities might be, is it retailers with construction teams, landlords, et cetera?","Conor Flynn","So on those that we have assumed, they were all primarily retailers. So they would be managing their own construction, so doing their construction absolutely and then you get on the Kmart's same thing. And these operators, retailers, off price graphs have been popular with the Toys', those who have been the drivers of it, furniture fitness, et cetera.","Wesley Golladay","And then when we look at the redevelopment budget for next year, I believe at a higher level, it's around $250 million. Is there any part of that budget dedicated to the Siers Kmart redevelopment?","Conor Flynn","There is a fee to this that we just have as a place holder. But again, we will have to wait and see how that plays out.","Operator","Next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste","Conor, I guess for you. I know you are not ready to talk about 2019 guidance, but obviously '19, looking like a bit of a transition year held back a bit by this years' disposition activities and REIT drag. And the growing 2018 same store NOI base, you have raised guidance now two quarters in a row. I guess, I'm more curious what you think the portfolio, the Kimco portfolio can generate on the same-store NOI and that\u2019s the full growth basis on a more steady-state basis once all the noise settles down? Thanks.","Conor Flynn","Our goal long-term it to be the best shopping center REIT in the entire sector and we believe that in order to do that, we have to have same site NOI growth. That's really north of 2.5% on a long-term run rate and an FFO growth rate that\u2019s in that 4% to 5% or higher. And so when you look at the portfolio and what we're trying to do that\u2019s our long-term goal to get there. Now, '19 has some hurdles ahead of us because of the accounting change, because of the dispositions that we did and because of the developments redevelopments that are continuing to start to ramp and they continue to ramp from '19 into '20.","So, our goal is to get there. We obviously have our work cut off across '19 where we're committed to make it a growth year. And that\u2019s we continue to say is that we have repositioned the portfolio to where we see now we can really run a top quality and top-flight portfolio, going forward.","Haendel St. Juste","A question -- follow up on the tenant side. We have seen a number of traditional strip center tenants who are still opening a large number of stores of the Five Below partners starting to go into B&C Mall sometimes or next year here because it's often cheaper. Curious what you\u2019re thinking and seeing on this front and how it impacts your view on tenant retention going forward as the environment for some of these tenants gets more competitive? Thanks.","Conor Flynn","It's something that we talk about a lot and watch closely. When you look at the competitive set, we continue to look at malls as a competitor. And when you think about though the opportunity set there that retailers are looking at, the mall is really a four headed monster when you look at the anchors that they have. And really the retailers that we're used to doing business with that you listed off, they're really focused on making sure that they have great visibility to the street, big fields of parking and an exterior entrance. And so, when you think about the mall, there's really only probably one or maybe two boxes that could be repositioned to flip to the exterior and retain that type of visibility and that parking field and that exterior entrance.","And so it has very limited today and now that we've repositioned the portfolio to be concentrated in the top 20 markets, we believe that if a, A-mall gets a box back, the likelihood of them doing an off-price retailer or a discounter is probably very limited, because they're probably either going to do a luxury and redevelopment or identification for that box. And so, that\u2019s why we continue to look at the portfolio as well positioned for that channel supply that we've been talking about now for a number of years.","Haendel St. Juste","Do you have handy what the retention levels have been historically, say the last five years and maybe how we should think -- or how you're thinking about that, going forward. ","Conor Flynn","The retention levels have increased. I mean, when you look at the amount of options and renewals that we're doing, we continue to be pleased with the retention rate. Not only in the junior boxes and anchor boxes, but also in the small shop boxes, we continue to be budget on that assumption. And so, we\u2019ve been watching that closely and I think it's a reflection of the improved portfolio as well.","It's pretty evident what's happened with the portfolio when you have options renewals running in high single digits quarter-after-quarter. I mean, that's really when these tenants have the opportunity to move down the stream, go somewhere else if they think they can get a better deal. Yet they are signing renewals and options in high single digit numbers without putting any real capital into it.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Mueller with JP. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller","When you I guess through the Dania Hill Station and Lincoln Square developments, are we going to see a pipeline of new development opportunities that backfills those?","Conor Flynn","We're going to continue to look for the Lincoln Square in the world that those are real needles in the haystack and the Dania\u2019s of the world. So, we look at our portfolio and see the huge amount of opportunity on the redevelopment side. And so that's where we're going to focus and continue to look for that organic internal growth that we can add to the pipeline. Dania has multiple phase to it. The second phase obviously is now moving forward. We've been wanting to also keep in mind on Dania Phase 2 is that the apartments are under construction, which we have as a ground lease. And so it's not listed as an anchor but it's one that continues to evolve as that project really comes into a zone in the first phases opening next week. So, as you see the transformation of the portfolio, going forward, I think you're going to see more Pentagons, more of those types of redevelopment versus say these are ground ups.","David Jamieson","And that\u2019s where that the team has been working on these entitlements. It's really been able to gain entitlements where we can further identify the properties.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris Lucas","Glenn, just a quick question on where you stand as it relates to the taxable income given where you expect asset sales to come in and the pricing. Is there any need potentially for special dividend this year given the sizable volume of asset sales?","Glenn Cohen","I mean, we have done a lot of strategic planning to put us in a position where we don't think we will need a special dividend at all. But you'll see the composition of the dividend be very different than what it's been in the past. So it has to had some level of return of capital. Right now, I think there would be no return of capital it will be a pretty good mix of ordinary income and capital gains, because we have not used the 1031 exchange market to defer the gain. So, we have a pretty significant amount of capital gains that are in taxable income this year.","Chris Lucas","And then just a quick question, Conor, just on the 14 Sears Kmart boxes, if you were to bucket them between those that could potentially trigger redevelopment versus those that are more likely to simple backfills. Could you give us a sense as to what that split is?","Conor Flynn","There is a number in there that we've been focused on in terms of large scale mixed Q3 development, and it fits all. It's probably in the 2 to 3 number of ranges. And it's those assets that are in dense urban locations that we've been waiting patiently for. What we have found is that there is a number of individual retailers that are now at the table looking to take the whole box and we could either do that as a ground lease to limit our capital or we can do it as a reverse built-to-suite or just to normal PI fit out.","So as we've said, we're focusing on the ones that we have visibility on. And actually that the costs on those are in the $30 to $50 a foot range, which is a very -- probably right within our sweet spot when you look at the rents that we're achieving there and the spread. So as we go through the process, we'll continue to be ready with other retailers at the table if we get the boxes back. But that's really the spread of where we see it going forward.","Chris Lucas","And then just a quick follow up on Kmart Sears. Is there anything unique or different about their operations in Puerto Rico that we should be thinking about as they go through this process?","Conor Flynn","I would just tell that they're some of the highest performers in the entire chain. Their sales are incredible there. And so as they -- as a profitable entity were reorganized and see those are ones that create a significant amount of EBITDA for them. So, that's just something to keep in mind. The other thing I should just mention on Puerto Rico is the whole Island has been deemed in opportunity zone, which for is an interesting development as we look at our portfolio down there as that may change the cap rates on the Island.","Operator","Next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Going back to your other comments about a pretty strong or stable pricing market for asset sales, I know you\u2019ve been very consistent in your messaging that you don't want to do a lot more in 2019 in terms of dispositions. But what keep you from doing more? Is it really basically that dilution is painful and the stock market doesn't appreciate it. I know the market turn in their mentality about changing asset sales to you can do it but just don't do too much. But just curious overall, why not do more asset sales and bring down your leverage, that's little bit above 7 times to something more in line with your peers?","Conor Flynn","I mean, I think we're very confident in the portfolio with where it sits today. We're seeing strong results quarter-after-quarter in terms of the performance on the existing portfolio. But you are right. We have stated we are very excited to bring this portfolio back to recurring FFO growth here in '19. But more so than that, we just are really confident within the portfolio and think that we have a right-sized portfolio that has a strong mix of quality, core, grocery anchored centers, as well as an opportunity set for redevelopment that we really believe is unmatched. So, we're excited about the future within this portfolio.","David Jamieson","The other thing I would add is when you look at the net debt to EBITDA, it's going to naturally come down, because EBITDA growth from all of the investments that we have made and these developments and redevelopments, they are just beginning now to flow. We have $0.5 billion invested in development projects that are just now beginning to flow. So, as all that EBITDA comes on board '19 and further into '20, you will see leverage come down naturally.","Ki Bin Kim","Second question, this might be a tough one. But when you look at the applied cap rate for your internal portfolio today versus 15 months ago pre 900 million of asset sales. I know you're not going to give a cap rate for your portfolio on the call. But directionally, how has your view on the applied cap rate change over that timeframe, and has it come down 25 basis points or 50?","Conor Flynn","I think when you look at the portfolio that we have today compared to 12 months ago, the significant amount of our best asset take up a bigger percentage of our overall value. And we don't think that\u2019s been represented within the stock price yet. But we're hopeful and we're optimistic that all the work that we've done that we've put into repositioning the portfolio, as well as the redevelopment opportunities that we have as they continue to start flowing, we'll see a narrowing of that gap. But from where we sit today, there is still clearly a big discrepancy between the private market cap rate that would be on our portfolio versus where the implied is today.","Operator","The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Linda Tsai","I know you have been relying more on data and technology to help retailers understand the attractiveness of your centers. And you have said in the past you still look at 135 mile range, but now density is more of a focus and you can look geo special data to figure out a true trade area. Are there any insights you could share as to which retailers or service providers help expand the trade area? And then on the flip side, does this data help you understand the impact of competing centers and sales cannibalization?","David Jamieson","In terms of it that we actually have to draw, it's interesting when you look at, say the ethnic grocers, the aging grocers, they have a significant draw outside your traditional 135, they can pull from 15 to 20 miles away, which is pretty unique. And so, when you see them as an anchor, you keep that into consideration. As it relates to the utilization of data, we continue to be very proactive in that case and partnering with our retailers to get better understanding of how they are utilizing. And so collectively, we can have more of a joint partnership to create the best offering to the end customer, which is really, both our customer and their customer. And that\u2019s what's most important.","And with retailers such as Target and others and Walmart, I mean, how they are utilizing to draw people in on the buy online pickup in store and making more customer oriented and customer service-oriented, it's still critical for the evolution of what retail needs to be, going forward. And so you see really the winners and those that are seeing some outstanding performance, it's really a result of those efforts. So for us we see it as a critical part of our business going forward and we'll continue to work with retailers alike.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki. Please go ahead.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Andrew, and thank you all for joining Kimco's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning are Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, the President and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Cohen, Chief Financial Officer; Conor Flynn, our Chief Operating Officer, as well as other key executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking and it's important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that, we believe, help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations, net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","[Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Henry.","David B. Henry","Good morning, and thanks for calling in this morning. We are very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results. Glenn and Conor will provide the details, but, in general, our operating metrics are excellent, led by our U.S. same-site NOI growth of 4.1% for the fourth quarter and 3.8% for the full year.","The same-site number, which increased from the prior quarter, together with our substantial increase in occupancy, provides solid evidence of the continued strength and health of our core portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers.","Looking at the shopping center industry overall. Leasing activity continues to be strong with both occupancy and effective rent strengthening. The International Council of Shopping Centers, ICSC, our industry trade group, announced this week that the U.S. shopping center industry NOI grew 8% in 2013, which, while not a same-site number, represents the best annual growth rate since 2008.","Brick-and-mortar holiday sales were also up 2.4% year-over-year despite awful weather and 6 fewer shopping days. Clothing, sporting goods and hobbies were particularly strong and the \"daily spend\" by consumers is now the highest in 6 years.","National retailers continue their expansion plans with more than 81,000 new stores planning to open over the next 24 months. Despite the growth of e-commerce sales, the shopping center industry is benefiting from population growth, very limited new development and GDP growth exceeding 2%. This is translating into occupancy gains, rent increases and NOI growth across our sector.","Kimco's own key metrics and operating results are robust and give us confidence that 2014 will again produce solid results across our portfolio.","In Latin America, we continue to make excellent progress with our disposition activities. We sold 5 additional shopping centers in the fourth quarter, bringing our 2013 gross sales in Latin America to $1.1 billion. As recently announced by the buyer, a joint venture of Macquarie Mexico REIT and Frisa, Kimco has signed a purchase contact to sell 9 of its remaining Mexico shopping centers, comprising 2.1 million square feet to the Macquarie joint venture. Closing is expected within the next 30 days.","In addition, we now have signed letters of intent or contracts on 13 additional shopping centers, 12 in Mexico and our single last property in Chile. Only 5 existing shopping centers in a small net lease portfolio in Mexico remain unspoken for at this time.","North of the border, our Canadian portfolio remains strong and a significant contributor to our earnings despite the recent currency decline of the Canadian dollar. Kimco's Canadian high-quality portfolio, overall, remains well occupied at 96.3% and we are benefiting from the continued expansion of U.S. retailers in and into Canada. This week, Walmart announced plans to open 35 additional supercenters in Canada over the next 12 months. Target also announced plans to open 9 more stores in Canada, bringing their Canadian store count to 133. Nordstrom, Saks, Uniqlo and DSW are also on their way into Canada.","In the U.S., as Glenn will detail, our recycling efforts continue at a solid pace with Kimco purchasing high-quality retail properties and selling its equity interests in nonstrategic shopping centers. Step-by-step, the profile of our portfolio is improving significantly in terms of demographics, average rents, NOI growth profile and primary markets. Coupled with our redevelopment efforts, which Conor will cover, our new acquisitions and partner buyout activities will provide strong future NOI growth. We are particularly excited about our pending acquisition of the 24-property Boston area of retail portfolio, which should close in March. In addition, we are under contract for Crossroads Plaza, a Class A dominant regional power center in Raleigh, North Carolina; and Quail Corner, a Harris Teeter grocery-anchored shopping center in a high-income suburb of Charlotte, North Carolina. Subsequent to year end, Kimco also closed on the acquisition of 3 grocery-anchored shopping centers in the Greater Baltimore area from one of our institutional joint venture partners.","Now I would like to turn to Glenn to discuss the financial details of the quarter to be followed by Conor's in-depth discussion of our portfolio results. And then Milton will, as usual, provide some general observations.","Glenn G. Cohen","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. We finished up 2013 on solid footing, delivering very strong operating metrics for the quarter and the full year while continuing our portfolio transformation.","As we reported last night, FFO as adjusted and headline FFO each came in at $0.33 per share for the quarter, bringing FFO as adjusted to $1.33 per share for the full year, representing a 5.6% increase over 2012 and achieving the upper end of our 2013 guidance range. Our key portfolio of operating metrics of same-site NOI growth, occupancy and leasing spreads were the highlights of the quarter. Combined same-site NOI growth was 3.4% for the quarter, which includes a 70 basis point negative impact from currency. The U.S. portfolio was the key driver, generating same-site NOI growth of 4.1%. For the full year combined same-site NOI growth reached 3.5%, including a 30 basis point negative impact from currency and the U.S. portfolio delivered 3.8% growth.","Our pro rata occupancy rate increased 50 basis points during the quarter for both the U.S. portfolio and the combined portfolio, bringing occupancy to 94.9% for the U.S. and 94.5% for the combined portfolio. These levels represent increases of 100 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, over the 2012 levels.","Leasing spreads were solid with new leases providing an 8.2% increase and renewals and options coming in at an increase of 5.2% for a combined 5.9% increase for the fourth quarter. For the full year, leasing spreads delivered a positive growth rate of 7.7%, comprised of 15.6% for new leases and 5.9% for renewals and options. These excellent operating metrics are the direct result of our transformation and simplification efforts thus far, an improving economy and the hard work of all of our leasing and property management associates.","We've continued to be active capital recyclers and the fourth quarter was no exception. We completed the sale of 14 nonstrategic U.S. shopping centers for a gross price of $192 million and a cap rate of 6.7, and quickly redeployed the proceeds acquiring 14 shopping centers in our key markets for a gross price of $248 million at similar cap rate to those disposed of. In addition, as Dave mentioned, we sold 5 more assets in Latin America for a gross sales price of $40 million, including the complete exit of Brazil with the sale of the 2 Brazilian assets. We now have 1 property remaining in Chile, which we expect to complete the sale of during the first quarter of 2014, and 2 small properties in Peru, one which is already under contract. As part of our simplification strategy, we are in active negotiations or available or at LOIs for many of the remaining assets in Mexico. And we expect to substantially complete these transactions by the middle of 2014.","In addition to our excellent portfolio of operating metrics, we were successful in improving our balance sheet metrics as well. We improved our consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA to 5.5x and increased our fixed charge coverage to 2.9x. We took full advantage of the low interest rate environment during 2013, issuing a 10-year U.S. bond at 3 1\/8% in May and a 7-year 3.855% Canadian bond in July, using the proceeds to repay higher coupon debt, generating annual savings of over $13 million. Our liquidity position remains in excellent shape with over $1.4 billion of immediate availability and very manageable debt maturities in 2014.","We are pleased with our execution and results for 2013 and have a clear, focused strategy as articulated at our Investor Day in December. I've seen this transformation, simplification and redevelopment, TSR, to drive total shareholder return with some extra from the plus business. We plan to deliver on this strategy in 2014 and beyond.","Let me provide some color around our 2014 recurring earnings guidance. We are affirming our 2014 FFO as adjusted per share guidance range of $1.36 to $1.40 with a midpoint of $1.38. At the midpoint range, the FFO per share growth is just under 4%. This guidance range is based solely on recurring flows and does not include any transaction income or expense. We expect to achieve this solid growth level despite the dilutive impact from the dispositions of InTown Suites, the American Industries portfolio and the net acquisition and disposition activity during 2013.","Several of the underlying assumptions used to determine the guidance range include an increase in overall occupancy of 50 to 75 basis points, combined positive same-site NOI growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, the benefit of reduced borrowing costs and reduced G&A expense. In addition, we expect to continue the transformation and further improvement of the portfolio through significant disposition and acquisition activity. The guidance range assumes the monetization of substantially all assets in Mexico by the middle of 2014 and the sale of U.S. assets throughout the year, yielding proceeds in the $700 million to $900 million range. Proceeds from the dispositions will be used to acquire U.S. shopping centers in our targeted markets with a gross acquisition range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. The guidance range is very sensitive to the timing of the acquisition and disposition activity.","Our 2014 capital plan does not assume any new common equity requirements and supports our recently increased dividend level of $0.225 per quarter, which equates to an FFO average yield of 65%. We're the lowest in the REIT industry.","With that, I'll turn it over to Conor.","Conor C. Flynn","Thanks very much, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review the progress made on our portfolio strategy, give an update on asset recycling activities and address fourth quarter and full year performance.","At our recent Investor Day, as Glenn mentioned, we outlined our portfolio strategies for the next 3 to 5 years, transformation, simplification and redevelopment, to drive total shareholder return. There are significant growth opportunities embedded in our portfolio, such as redevelopment, releasing and management efficiencies, which will continue to drive net asset value.","We continue to build on the existing critical mass in our key territories where we have boots on the ground, local expertise and the ability to create value. We believe the current environment highlighted by available capital, modest interest rates and limited supply make this an optimum time to accelerate the transformational aspect of our strategy.","We continue to dispose assets where we perceive risks, either in the form of lower growth profiles, below-average metrics or that are located in noncore markets. During 2013, 35 properties were sold for a gross price of $349.7 million at a cap rate of 7.6%. But disposing assets is only one side of the equation. We have also been acquiring larger and higher-quality assets, possessing growing cash flows that are located in strong demographic markets.","For the full year, Kimco acquired 23 retail properties totaling $640 million at a cap rate of 6.8%, in line with our communicated strategy of simplifying the business and leveraging our relationships. Five of those sites were acquired from existing joint ventures. One recent acquisition is an off-market grocery portfolio that we structured as a sale-leaseback with Winn-Dixie. We acquired 6 sites punctuated by Marathon Center, a 106,000 square foot high-volume center anchored by Winn-Dixie. Marathon is also anchored by a Kmart, paying below-market rent that expires in 2017 with no remaining options and we are excited about the great redevelopment opportunities this presents. The site is located in the Florida Keys, an area with high barriers to entry and limited new development.","We expect our asset recycling program will lead to continued portfolio strengthening and a continued upgrade in quality.","Turning to redevelopment activities. During the fourth quarter, we moved 35 projects with a gross costs of $109 million to the asset redevelopment pipeline. Through the second half of 2013, we increased the redevelopment pipeline by $400 million to $778 million, comprising a total of 262 projects. We continue to mine the portfolio for redevelopment opportunities where we can add a grocery component and believe that the large expansion plans of traditional, specialty and ethnic grocery chains will provide numerous opportunities to significantly increase our percentage of grocery anchors in the portfolio.","This quarter, we signed 5 new grocery leases, including Publix at Belmart Plaza in West Palm Beach, Florida where we will be demolishing a former Winn-Dixie box and building a new Publix grocery-anchored center. In total, we acquired 11 grocery-anchored assets this quarter, increasing our grocery exposure to nearly 60% of our total portfolio of base rent.","While our redevelopment projects have aimed at retenanting our centers with quality creditworthy tenants, our leasing teams have continued to focus on recycling our tenant mix to reduce our exposure to at-risk retailers.","In 2013, we reduced our exposure to Kmart and Sears, redeveloping these bases for high-quality tenants at better rents. In Ocala, Florida, for example, we released the former Kmart box to Burlington Coat Factory for 179% rent increase. And at Fairview Heights, Fresh Thyme Farmers Market took a portion of the former Kmart box for a 279% rent increase.","Additionally, we reduced our exposure to office supply stores in 7 locations.","We are also very active on the small shop recycling front. National restaurant chains, including Chipotle and Panera, are replacing noncredit operators. Medical and personal service industries such as urgent care, weight loss centers, hair and nail salons and massage spas are showing positive net absorption. Indeed, these service-oriented businesses, which are e-commerce resistant, are a growing part of our shopping center evolution.","The increase in small shop occupancy continues to be driven by positive net absorption and the disposition of riskier assets. We continue to see significant demand for opportunities in proven retail nodes and high occupancies across the industry are driving rents. Kimco is benefiting from this trend through higher rents for a larger portion of our portfolio as below-market leases mature and anchor boxes are redeveloped for strong junior anchor lineups.","Our average base rent per square foot increased in 2013 by $0.41 or 3% from $12.58 to $12.99. And we only see opportunity for healthier increases as 86 anchor leases expire through 2017 with no further options and a 20% spread on mark-to-market. For example, there are 5 Kmarts expiring through 2017 that are 253% below market and 10 office supply stores that are 69% below market. Our 32 Kmart stores represent only 1.4% of AVR at an average base rent of $5.62 per square foot. We have 3 Sears representing 0.1% of AVR at an average rent of $5.56 a foot. As far as J.C. Penney is concerned, we have 4 locations representing 0.1% of AVR at an average base rent of $6.28 a foot.","This quarter, in Philadelphia, we recaptured a J.C. Penney box and are redeveloping this space with Burlington Coat and Bob's Discount Furniture where we will be adding vertical transportation for the multistory box. We continue to monitor our tenant watch list as we believe, in this environment, recapturing boxes will create strong leasing spreads and redevelopment opportunities.","The recovery of the small shop segment of the business continues to be a positive sign as annual increases and lease trends are creeping back to prerecession highs in our key markets. This segment will continue to improve with the economy as it is closely tied to housing market, job market and consumer confidence.","Credit quality is important to us and our large balanced portfolio mitigates individual retailer exposure. Among our top 20 tenants, we have the largest proportion of A-rated ABR among our peers. Still, we continue to monitor our watch list and believes this environment provides unique opportunity to recapture these boxes for redevelopment, resulting in stronger leasing spreads.","And now turning to our results. U.S. same-site NOI increased by 4.1% pro rata, representing the 15th consecutive quarter of positive growth. When we include LTAs, as some of our peers do, our same-site NOI jumps to 5.3%. Leasing spreads for both new leases and renewals have now been positive for 11 consecutive quarters.","Fourth quarter new leasing spreads were 8.2%, driven mainly by our junior anchor deals and midsized shops. The benefits of our redevelopment projects drove spreads this quarter with retailers like Bob's Discount Furniture and Burlington Coat Factory taking the former J.C. Penney space in Philadelphia at a 64% spread. We've additionally continued to reap the benefits of holding leases in our portfolio with a 20-year-old Stein Mart in Webster, Texas, renewing at a market rent at a 35% spread.","Over Kimco's long history, we have been able to adapt to the ever-changing retail environment. And today, we continue to employ a proactive approach to our positioning our portfolio for tomorrow. We maintain a constant dialogue with our tenants and have excellent relationships on a national and local level that help us identify new and emerging trends very early. We are constantly evaluating how we can further improve the appeal of our centers, be it through new amenities, energy-monitoring initiatives, innovative retailer incentive programs and technology, we continue to improve and pilot programs to adapt the dynamic retail landscape.","In closing, it is an exciting time for Kimco, and I look forward to providing updates on our transformation, simplification and redevelopment progress, which is well underway and already yielding results.","And now I will turn it over to Milton for his closing remarks.","Milton Cooper","Thank you, Conor. I believe we are in the sweet spot in the ownership of retail real estate. There has been virtually no growth in shopping center supply since 2009, while on the demand side, we still have strong population growth. As pointed out by an astute analyst, the 2009 to 2013 period is the first time since 1974 that GLA for shopping centers has declined on a per capita basis. The performance of our value-oriented retailers, discounters, warehouse clubs, grocers and retailers selling essential goods has been strong. Our largest tenant is TJX. They have done quite well and are planning to open 700 stores over the next 5 years. We own over 130 TJX stores in their various formats. And we plan to expand substantially with them over the next 5 years. Among our peers, we are also the largest landlord of Home Depot and Costco stores. Both of these tenants have had excellent results and have strong balance sheets. These tenants are also very positive about our property type.","Now it's not to say that the viability of retailers will ever change. Let me remind you that some time ago, an entire retail segment disappeared. I'm referring to the variety stores: Woolworths, Newberry's, G.C. Murphy, S.S. Kresge, gone. Yet all of that space has been replaced: Venture Stores, W.T. Grant, others have also disappeared, but since then, have all been replaced. Overall, we have properties that essentially consist of retailers that are value oriented or have excellent credit, such as Walmart, Target, or retailers that sell everyday necessities, grocers, services such as health clubs, nail salons and dry cleaners. And unlike other industries, we do not run the risk of technological obsolescence. There are some technology companies that sell at huge multiples and a new invention could dramatically affect their existence. Think about Polaroid, think about carbon paper, and more recently, cassettes and CD papers.","The quality of our portfolio is getting better and better as we transform it and the best test is the same-store growth in our properties and that has been outstanding. I like where our portfolio of properties is going and I like the way our portfolio of people are developing. We always talk about TSR. We're transforming the quality of our portfolios. And by the way, to sell over $1 billion of low-quality assets at a higher cap rate and to buy higher-quality assets at a lower cap rate and still, despite the dilution, delivered growth in earnings is something to pound our chest about. We are simplifying our business by exiting Mexico and South America and reducing the number of our joint ventures and we're going to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities.","Now in addition, what is really unique about Kimco is in our plus business, run by Ray Edwards and myself. Over the years, as you know, we have had a track record of having sizable profits in this business. As of today, our investment in the SUPERVALU shares has added annualized returns of 38%. In our investment analysis, we have received almost 5x our money back and our share of the equity above our course [ph] in the overall venture is still quite substantial. It's not too shabby for a small overhead operation.","As we're excited about 2014 and as Conor has outlined earlier, transformation, simplification and redevelopment programs are well underway. And we look forward to harvest the fruits of our execution. And with that, we'll be delighted to take any questions.","David F. Bujnicki","Andrew, we're ready to move to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","About 19.3% of Kimco's ABR comes from U.S. markets outside the top 40 MSAs. Just given your acquisition and disposition plans, where do you think that number might be in, say, 3 years' time?","Conor C. Flynn","Well, as you know, we're very focused on reducing that. And I think in 3 years' time, our goal is to cut that in half. It's really to -- we have our disposition pipeline now that targets about 10% of that and so 50% of what you're talking about is we plan to exit in 3 years.","Operator","The next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Conor, I have a multi-part question on the redevelopment pipeline. What is your share of the $223 million in process and the $778 million total pipeline? How would you characterize the 37 smaller projects in your in-process pipeline? And when you think about anchor replacement versus sort of true redevelopment, how do you decide what to include and exclude from your re-leasing spread calculation?","Conor C. Flynn","Why don't I start with -- the smaller projects on the redevelopment pipeline are typically out-parcels where we're creating a pad or a multi-tenant building, where we're developing it in the parking of the shopping center. Our share of the redevelopments, I can get that for you. It's really -- let me pull it up right here, it's about $409 million of the total pipeline, $409,200,000. So it really -- now a lot of those projects are still in joint ventures and we've shown that we have the opportunity to buy our joint venture partners out in certain cases. So there is a potential to increase that share as we have the kit [ph] portfolio in the market and a few other portfolios in the market. Can you repeat the third or the fourth question?","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So when you think about sort of anchor replacements versus like true revenue-generating redevelopment, how do you decide what to include in your re-leasing spread calculation?","Conor C. Flynn","Our re-leasing spread is very much focused on just the re-leasing of the box. Where it's a redevelopment, we're doing something to the box. We're expanding it, we're cutting it, we're redoing the shopping center. So if it's a pure tenant-out, tenant-in type of analysis, that's a re-leasing spread. Where we consider if we have to do something to the box then it's considered a redevelopment.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So if you're replacing a former Filene's Basement with a Nordstrom Rack and a DSW, that's not included in the re-leasing spreads?","Conor C. Flynn","That one is -- that one is, because we actually -- we didn't do anything to the box. So the box, as it stands and we're actually just putting a Nordstrom Rack in one portion of the box and DSW in the other portion.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Morgan of MLV.","Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Just on the acquisitions, you gave $900 million to $1.1 billion -- I guess, first of all, is that -- I don't recall exactly what it was before that, a higher guidance? And then a lot of the focus has been in terms of the recent activity in the Sun Belt and I'm just wondering is that an explicit target? Or is this opportunity based? And maybe kind of is the cap rate for a high-quality asset in some of those markets in the Sun Belt more advantageous to you in your view than in the Northeast Corridor and the West Coast?","Glenn G. Cohen","Paul, first, part of what we have this we've already lined up things like the Boston portfolio. We've closed on a couple of properties in our LaSalle joint venture. So almost half of the amount that I mentioned, roughly $500 million, has already been targeted. The balance is really going to come based on our pace of dispositions and the opportunities that present themselves. But those targets are based really on the activity we see coming forward and we think that we'll be able to achieve those levels. They're pretty much in line with what we talked about at our Investor Day. And again, it's going to be subject to the level of dispositions that happen.","David B. Henry","We do, Paul, on your second part of your question, we do look at a lot of transactions. The 2 that I mentioned in North Carolina where we are very excited about because we like North Carolina, long term. We like the demographics, we like the prognosis. Both Raleigh and Charlotte are dynamic good markets. And the truth is we can get a little bit higher yield in those markets than we can other places. But we look at all of our key markets actively across-the-board.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I just wanted to get a little more color on Puerto Rico. I didn't hear it in your opening comments. If you could just give a sense for how the NOI trends have been there both in the quarter and then for the full year, as well as rent spreads. And bigger part of that is, obviously, we've all read the headlines and you can see all that stuff. But just really seeing over the past year or 2, if there's been any change in U.S. tenant interest in going down to the island?","Glenn G. Cohen","Sure. I'll take the first part of it, Alex. The same-site NOI growth for the quarter was 5.7% and for the year in Puerto Rico, it was 4.4%. And the occupancy level is up 130 basis points. So it began the year at 96.7% and ended at 98%.","Conor C. Flynn","I'll just mention that our portfolio, that occupancy is the highest it's ever been. If you go to Puerto Rico, you'll start to see that the macro environment doesn't necessarily reflect the portfolio that we currently own. The parking lots are full, the retailers are doing exceptionally well and the high sales that these retailers are producing are attracting other like kind retailers to come down to the market. PetSmart is extremely aggressive down there, Petco as well. Anna's Linens does phenomenally down there. And we're continuing to see more and more retailers contact us for opportunities. But as you can tell, our portfolio is pretty well occupied so it's very hard to find those opportunities in Puerto Rico. And we anticipate another grocer coming to Puerto Rico shortly. We think that, that's a real opportunity to bring a national brand to Puerto Rico.","David B. Henry","From a very high level, Alex, when you read the negative headlines, you have to remember that Puerto Rico is very supply constrained from a retail perspective. It's got a fraction of the retail per capita that the U.S. does. And so shopping centers are generally very well occupied and rents are still on the way up despite the economic problems of Puerto Rico.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, perfect. So as far as all the headlines, I mean, none of it -- the retailers at the end of the day are focused on making money. And as long as they're still making money, they're not dissuaded by any of these headlines.","David B. Henry","Exactly.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I recognize this may be more of a mall question, but can you update us with your general thoughts on how the thread of closures from Sears, Kmart, Penney's play out? And I guess maybe as a follow-up, whether or not you think discount retailers and other box unit -- users are going to look for unit growth by retrofitting those spaces or sort of ground-up construction? And I guess, lastly, is there an investment opportunity in there for Kimco?","Conor C. Flynn","Let me take the last part. We do think that there's opportunity there. We do think that we've been -- I think, we've been monitoring this for a long period of time and everybody has their thoughts on what's really going to happen 2, 3, 5 years from now to those retailers you mentioned. We do think there's opportunities to retrofit boxes if the box is in good condition, if the ceiling height is right, if the space lays out correctly. We've seen that Bed Bath & Beyond will take the entire box and put all 3 or 4 of their concepts into the box. We've also seen it work where you have a Burlington Coat come in and take an existing Sears box. Where I think it gets challenging is if the box hasn't been touched for 50 years. But if you take a few Kmarts, for example, there's really no way to retrofit that box. You've got to tear it down. You've got to start fresh, but that's not necessarily a bad thing because that allows you to really have a blank slate, an open palette to create a dynamic retailer lineup to help revitalize the shopping center.","David B. Henry","And Jeff, I'll comment on the first part. In general, if you look across our industry, Kimco and all of our peers, our occupancy is the highest in our bigger boxes. So when you get above 10,000 square feet, we're all 97%, 98% leased these days. So to the extent that one of these big guys comes more available like Kmart, I think it will be rapidly absorbed by the junior anchors that are expanding. TJX and Ross, together, are going to open 200 stores a year for the foreseeable future. So there's this enormous growth of some of the junior anchors and boxes that we do business with. The Bed Bath & Beyonds are at least 25, 30 stores a year. The Petco, the PetSmarts, the Hobby Lobbys, I mean, they're all growing like crazy and these boxes, as Conor described, in the right situations, can work well for these tenants.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to go back to disposition commentary in terms of the pace of dispositions dictating some of the acquisitions beyond the $500 million. Just curious how demand trends are for dispositions of the type that you're trying to complete. Are you seeing a pickup in the interest? Or has some of the uncertainties that have kind of unfolded here over the fall here changed anybody's outlook or appetite?","Glenn G. Cohen","Vince, I think we feel good about being able to sell the assets that we're trying to market. We packaged up quite a few of them, and I think you'll start to see a lot more activity happening really in the second quarter on those. But I think the market's in good shape. The capital markets are in excellent shape. The CMBS market is in excellent shape. So there's clearly capital available and there is demand for the product type today because of its yield.","Conor C. Flynn","Right. So instead, the sun, moon and stars are all lined up in terms of the market right now for that type of products. So where we can expedite it, where we can do a larger package of assets, that's what we're looking at and trying to make sure we execute.","David B. Henry","And then cap rates are drifting down even for the B properties these days.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And at this point, do you think there's a portfolio sale premium? Or do you think it's still better off selling single assets?","Glenn G. Cohen","You will find out.","David B. Henry","We have a large portfolio in the market now, and we are accepting bids on both the portfolio as a whole and the individual assets. So that'll be a good test to it. We'll see.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Sullivan of Cowen.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A question really for Conor on the impact of -- excuse me, the increasing occupancy rates. In prior periods where your occupancy rates have reached these kind of levels, you've typically been able to maintain double-digit leasing spreads on a several quarter basis. And how close are we to getting to that point, number one. And number two, regarding the LTAs, in the prepared comments you noted the increase in the LTAs last year. Is that a trend, do you think, we're going to see for awhile here or not?","Conor C. Flynn","I think you're going to start to see LTAs become a factor as landlords can get more aggressive in trying to recapture some of these boxes. There's such a lack of new supply that, I think, we can be more proactive on that and really see how we can harvest the portfolio and see if we can create more opportunity that way. On your question on redevelopment...","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Conor C. Flynn","Yes, the spreads on the re-leasing, I think, you're right on. We've got probably about another, I would say, 96.5%, I think, is our target to hit in terms of occupancy. So we do believe we can raise the occupancy a little bit more. But you're starting to going to see it come from re-leasing spreads. You're going to see it come from small shop occupancy gains. And you'll see the anchor box re-leasing spreads to be strong as well because these boxes that are coming due without any options, there's bidding wars out there now, which wasn't the case a few years ago. So it's an exciting spot to be in.","David B. Henry","And rents are jumping not by 2%, 3%, they're jumping by $1, $2, $3. So that's what gives us some comfort. And rents still aren't back to prerecession levels, so we still have a ways to go.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","On Page 7 of the Supplemental, you guys disclosed kind of the lease occupancy and the economic occupancy. It's about 240 basis points today. I'm curious sort of what's that spread been historically? How tight can it get? And kind of over what period of time should that incremental NOI that, I guess, is ineffectively signed and in place but not yet income producing, how long does it take to kind of show up in the income statement?","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes, I mean, historically, it's been somewhere between 150 and 175 basis points and it takes 6 months or so. We signed a lot of leases at the end of the year and those leases, the rentals start flowing when you deliver the space to the tenants, which is anywhere from -- it can be 3 to 6 months. But on general, I would say around 6 months we'll start seeing it flow.","Conor C. Flynn","That's right. And we had a huge leasing volume this past quarter. So as Glenn mentioned, you'll start to see that flow 60 to 90 days past.","Steve Sakwa - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And is there anything different about the environment today that would allow that 150 to 175 gap to narrow?","Glenn G. Cohen","We have a very large portfolio. We're signing roughly 2 million square feet of space every quarter. So it really is dependent on the deal volume that you have. But again, if you look historically, that's where it's been. I don't see it really changing a whole lot.","Conor C. Flynn","Really, what we're focused on is trying to expedite the rent commencement date and to try and shorten that deal curve as much as possible. But it does take time to get the tenants in, to get them built and open and operating. So as much as we can, we're going to try and shorten that, but it still takes time.","Operator","The next question comes from Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Milton, you were talking a little bit about the results so far of the SVU transaction. Other than the share price performance, can you talk to us a little bit about whether or not you were able to accomplish some of the goals on the real estate front? And whether as you go into year 2, 3 and the future of that investment, whether you're going to be able to recapture some real estate at what could be an advantageous price?","Milton Cooper","That is the fourth objective and we have had several transactions where we were able to acquire real estate from the vending partners in each case. We had outside appraisals, some of it was fair. But it really has worked for us and I think that those companies are relatively real estate-rich. So bottom line is that our objective is to not only make money on the investment, but to obtain real estate other than bidding for it in the marketplace. And that's we have done and will continue to do, Cedrik.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Sorry, so how much have you been able to acquire so far in real estate from SVU?","Conor C. Flynn","We have about 3 properties we're under contract to acquire in adjacent shopping centers that we own from them and we're looking at some other deals. There are also properties where there are tenants looking to restructure some leases and things like that, that could benefit the long-term value of the property. So the company right now, Cedrik, is focused 150% on improving the business. And they want to work with us, but we don't want to distract them from their main goal of that. But I think at stabilized, we'll be able to work with them, but we don't want them to lose sight of their main goal, which is to create the value in the operating business. So the early stage is hard to get a lot in control.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess there's always got to be something and lately I've been hearing more talk that the bank branches at shopping centers are all going to disappear. And I know Bank of America, I think, is #46 on your tenant list, so not a big deal. But I'm curious what you're hearing about bank branches? What you think about that situation? And who might be likely replacements?","Conor C. Flynn","Yes, bank branches have been on a target list for awhile of understanding that they are going more to the ATM and less tellers. A lot of the banks have been putting private wealth management into the bank branches to try and create more value, but they are still reducing the amount of branches across the country. Now those pieces of real estate are typically the best located in the shopping centers. So they command the highest rents and are usually great real estate to recapture because of today's environment with all the restaurants that are very aggressive to wanting to be upfront. Those spaces are typically pads that can be repositioned very easily with significant value creation involved. So it is something we've been watching. I think that trend will continue as technology becomes. More and more people are banking online and are really using technology to go less and less to a bank branch.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just real quick, Conor, is that right that the only real exposure you guys have is Bank of America at 0.4% of rents?","Conor C. Flynn","That would be the largest in terms of the bank branches that we have, but we do have a number of banks across the portfolio. So that's the largest single exposure.","David B. Henry","And there still are banks that are expanding their branch networks. So it's not they're all going down. TD, as an example, has been very aggressive at taking branches from other banks that are downsizing.","Conor C. Flynn","And credit unions, too. Credit unions have seen a big...","Operator","The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I'm looking at Page 30 here of the Supplemental, see that new leases in Canada were down 8.2% and also down 16% in Latin America. We know you're continuing your exit from Latin America. But was wondering if you could provide some color, more color around demand for retail space in Canada and Latin America? And then in light of the positive commentary you made earlier in your remarks about Canada, when does that translate into positive leasing spread?","David B. Henry","In Canada, we were hit with a couple of things; one is the currency. Obviously, the Canadian dollar has weakened dramatically and if you took the currency impact out of it, we would have had positive same-site numbers in Canada. But in addition, as you know, Zellers closed its chain across Canada, selling most of the stores to Target, but not all. So we do have 2 empty Zellers stores that ended up in the numbers. One of those has been re-leased, so you'll see that turn around in the future. So even though this quarter's a little bit down from what we normally expect, Canada should continue to do very well. And you have to put it in the context that Canada just didn't have the decline that the U.S. had, so it's always been kind of a steady eddy for us. So it's not in a recovery phase, if you will. So we still feel very good about what's going to happen longer term in Canada in terms of same-site and rent growth. Like Puerto Rico, it's supply constrained in a sense that it's only got about 60% of the retail per capita that the U.S. has and there's enormous demand for space by retailers. And you see the evidence of that in development activity picking up mostly in urban locations in Canada. So I think this is a 1-quarter blip, primarily driven by the currency. In Latin America, we've been selling a lot of properties so the numbers are jumbled. Some of our best properties were in the early rounds of what we've sold. But on the ground, we're seeing pretty good tenant demand. Our job is to keep our operating partners focused on the leasing as we move towards closing these properties. As I mentioned, all but 5 are now spoken for. And so within the next 3 to 6 months, they should be closed and gone. So it's a little bit of wind-down activity, which should -- it's not representative of the actual demand for space in Mexico. You probably saw yesterday, they were upgraded to investment grade by Moody's, which, I think, gives you an indication of what's going on in the Mexican economy, which is strong. And both domestic and international retailers are expanding in Mexico. So I think the long term is positive for Mexico on the ground and retail space.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Appreciate that. And just to clarify on an earlier comment about your 2014 investment activity, should we assume the spreads -- similar spreads for this year as incurred last year at 80 bps more or less of dispositions versus acquisitions, is that a fair assumption?","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes, are you talking about in terms of the dilution?","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right.","Glenn G. Cohen","I mean, again, yes, it's probably around 100 basis points.","David B. Henry","Okay. I'd say it's a good solid. I mean, the better properties today are trading at that 6-ish and we're doing pretty good when we sell the stuff we're selling at 7 or maybe even a little higher. So the gross cap rate difference is at least 100 basis points.","Operator","The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just going back to your earlier comments about e-commerce, it seems like the e-commerce industry itself has slowly changed in the past 5 years. And I guess, first, it really targeted the power center type of tenants, commodity-like items and now they've gone towards more malls. So my question is if you look at your power center portfolio, what percent of the tenant mix would you categorize as very Internet-resistant? And could you comment on the difference in performance between power centers and strip centers in your portfolio today?","David B. Henry","Well, let me take a stab at the e-commerce question. Just about all retailers are affected to some degree by e-commerce and they range from very limited impact like barbershops and grocery stores and things like that all the way up to the electronics and booksellers that have been victims of the e-commerce trend. And a lot of our retailers fall somewhat in the middle. What's encouraging to us is a couple of things, almost all of these better retailers have found ways to blend their own e-commerce online activities with their brick-and-mortar activities and they're getting very good at it. And in many cases, they're taking share away from the Internet-only sellers, if you will, because they can provide delivery services much more efficiently. They're closer to the customers. And in terms of what impact it has on our space, what we're seeing is the bigger retailers are converting portions of their stores to what they call fulfillment centers. So these stores are not only showroom and sales space, but they're also delivery centers. Macy's, I believe, has announced that they've already converted 500 of their department stores, a substantial amount of the space in those 500 stores, to fulfillment centers. So as they take online orders, they take it directly out of the stores. And most of these brick-and-mortar retailers love it when goods are returned because they sell $1.30 to $1.40 for every $1 that's returned to the stores. Sometimes they get a new customer that sees new merchandise and so forth. So that they're finding very effective ways to blend those operations together. Gap is another great example of working well and I think more than 30% of their sales are now online and they've managed to bring their brands all together with online. So right now, it hasn't slowed -- none of this e-commerce activity has slowed down the demand for space. It has shrunk their prototypes. So for instance, Old Navy, I know that it used to have 25,000 square feet. Now, it's more like 17,000 as their newer prototype. But it hasn't slowed down their demand in terms of looking at that space. So we see the TJXs of the world, the Rosses, as I mentioned, the Petco and so forth growing like crazy even as they expand their own online activities. And the saving grace for us as landlords is there's just no new building out there. So instead of building 2,000 shopping centers a year in the U.S., it's down to less than 100 and retail per capita is going down instead of up. So all of that makes it an effective counterweight to e-commerce. Nobody is going to disagree that e-commerce is taking a bigger and bigger share. But the limited new construction, the GDP positive and the limited new supply has more than offset it. And that proof is in the pudding. All of our occupancies are up, our rents are up and so forth. So we're still on a good trend.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Any difference between performance and power centers or the strips?","David B. Henry","Oh, I'm sorry. Well, again, we -- there's issues that we look at in both. I think the neighborhood centers, which are generally what you would call strips, are generally grocery anchored and they're focused right on the neighborhood and they deliver, as Milton pointed out, essential goods and services. So your dry cleaner, your grocery store, your drugstore, your commercial bank is all there. They're probably a little less vulnerable than power centers that have a Barnes & Nobles, that have a Best Buy and so forth. So I wouldn't disagree with the general theory that perhaps the power centers are a little more vulnerable. But the power centers also have these boxes and chains that are growing like crazy. So the demand for space is still strong even in the power centers.","Conor C. Flynn","I would just add that it's becoming a very blurred line between the power centers and the neighborhood centers and the community centers because, today, there are more grocery retailers entering power centers that had never entered them before. So it's becoming more of, rather than a destination-oriented type shopping center, it's really becoming more of a daily shop and so that's spilling over. The sales volumes would increase across the power center. But as Dave mentioned right now, the power center has been doing quite well because there's such a lack of that big-box opportunity that there's bidding war for those types of opportunities when they come available. Where the grocery-anchored center has done well and the grocery stores continue to show that they're Internet-resistant, but they're mostly using their small shops for their growth. So there's opportunity there as well as the small shops have recovered an increased growth through small shop retail.","David B. Henry","One of the most encouraging signs that we have is the number of retailers that ask us about our watch list. So they're trying to get a proactive jump start on retailers that might give back space and they're starting to get worried themselves about the store counts that they have to achieve over the next couple of years.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Muller of JP Morgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a question on disposition guidance for 2014. The $700 million to $900 million, is that just U.S. volume? Or does that include Latin America as well?","Glenn G. Cohen","That includes Latin America. Latin America will be $500 million of it.","Operator","The next question comes from Nathan Isbee of Stifel.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you break out the same-store revenue versus the same-store expenses expectations that's baked into your guidance for next year? And where do you think there's room to drive operating efficiencies you referenced earlier?","Conor C. Flynn","I'll take the operating efficiency question. I think that when you have a very geographic-centric portfolio, you have more time spent at the property than you would if you were geographically diverse or in your secondary and tertiary markets and don't have an office located right at the shopping center. So we're looking to see as we move towards our goal of a Tier 1 portfolio in our key markets, we think we can have more boots on the ground, more touching and feeling and kicking the tires of these assets to see what we can do to generate growth. Can we come up with more redevelopment opportunities? And I think the more time you spend on each individual asset, the more efficiency you have in terms of you're managing your portfolio by having to travel less, keep your expenses low and potentially have a core group managing a shop -- a portfolio of shopping centers in a very strategic area.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So where do you think your margins can go in that?","Conor C. Flynn","I think we can probably look at -- if we look at where the portfolio will be in 3 to 5 years from now, I think our goal is to actively reduce overhead where we see fit. It's a managing a much smaller number of properties, but the NOI is still going to continue to grow. So we think that we can become more efficient. We don't have a target number yet, but we do believe that there's efficiencies in that.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right. And the guidance?","Glenn G. Cohen","Nate, can you clarify your first part of your question?","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, I mean, you came out with a 2.75% to 3.25% on the same-store NOI. I'm just curious how that breaks out between revenue and expenses.","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, you'll have somewhere in the 2% range would be coming from the revenue line so the expense side -- again, the expense recovery and piece of it is probably another 50 basis points of it and then you add the other components, which are the other rental revenue and the percentage rent piece, which is -- it's a little subject to change. But the minimum rent is the key driver of the same-site NOI growth in that 2.5% to 3.5% target range.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then non the expense side, are you baking anything in terms of reduction for '14?","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, again, if you look at our margins, they've run overall somewhere in the low-70s and their budgets as we roll them up property-by-property bring us to the same level. So when you talk about expenses, you have certain variable costs, things like snow, landscaping and things like that. It depends on how that all comes together. But our recovery side will improve and that's why there's a piece of that, that is in the same-site NOI growth.","David B. Henry","Right. As the occupancy goes up, we recover more of our expenses.","Operator","The next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Actually, Michael Bilerman. Just a question, I don't know who wants to take it. But Milton, you talked a little bit about sort for the plus strategy and low overhead with you and Ray. I'm just curious how active the plus business is internally in terms of other resources that may be at play, about whether there could be more transaction activity? And as you think about the different areas that the plus business has taken over the years, whether it just be sale-leasebacks or bankruptcies or repositioning some underperforming retail locations or financing, how should we think about potential transaction activity in the plus area?","Milton Cooper","I would think that you'll see substantial activity in 2014 and 2015. I think it'll be dramatically increased in there.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And what does that comprise? What sort of -- where is that emanating from in terms of the types of transactions that Kimco would be involved with?","Raymond Edwards","I mean, historically, we've done deals with financing with retailers that we've kind of put on the back burn for the last couple of years that have been very profitable. So that's an area we can look to grow the business again on that. And again, we're still -- we have very strong relationships with the private equity world and the other people in the turnaround world to get the -- it's really at this point for Milton and I to kind of -- which we have been doing the last 6 months or so, reach out to people and let them know we're kind of interested in doing this business again where we're basically on the sidelines the last few years. But we have very strong relationships and I think people want to work with us and they're happy to hear that we're kind of back in business with them.","David B. Henry","It's a compliment to both Milton and Ray that we are probably one of the first calls by a lot of the private equity companies and other major investors and retailers that are under any kind of distress as they try to unlock real estate value. And to your question on are there resources, we do use our regional field network to help us underwrite these opportunities and that's one of the strengths we bring to our partners. We have the ability to tell them what the replacement rents will be. We have an ability to quickly swarm over a lot of properties and help private equity and others underwrite these things. So it's a good marriage, especially when the opportunity itself is a good one like Albertsons and SUPERVALU.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So it sounds like more of those types of transactions where you'll be partnering and taking a smaller piece but be the real estate expertise.","David B. Henry","Be the real estate partner. That's the key, yes.","Milton Cooper","Exactly right.","Operator","And the last question will come from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","If I take a couple of the comments that were made on the call, including what was just said regarding the dramatic increase potentially in the plus business and then I think about what is the lower GLA per capita, which is a function of higher population, as well as the increasing demise of whether it's B malls or tertiary real estate, it kind of seems to me that we're entering a new phase for retail real estate in America where we're seeing a huge segregation in the quality and the growth prospects of retail. And I'm just sort of curious if you generally agree with that statement that the next 5 to 10 years are going to be dramatically different than the last, call it, 10 or 20 in terms of how investment returns are achieved in retail real estate.","David B. Henry","Well, I'll take one stab at that. We are seeing an increasing urbanization. The retailers want to follow the population growth and the job growth and we are seeing a desire and the value of properties that are located in some of our key markets, which are higher-density, higher-income areas. And retailers is definitely following those trends and cap rates and values are definitely following those trends, which is why some of these tertiary areas, and as you referenced, the B malls, the second-class properties are probably going down faster than other things. By the same token, the higher quality is holding up quite well. The rents are up. There's a declining supply of it. The retailers are trying to quickly rent space in these areas. So I would agree with you that there's a dividing going on here and we intend to be part of it, which is why we think it's a great time to sell some of our more tertiary assets and buy some of the things that we think are going to hold up well over the next 5 years.","Operator","And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to David Bujnicki for any closing remarks.","David F.

Today we plan to keep our prepared remarks short and sweet. We are firing on all cylinders as we drive towards achieving our 20\/20 vision and focus on long term shareholder value.","The first quarter highlights the execution of all aspects of our strategy as we focus less on short term earnings and more on creating long term net asset value. Our disposition and acquisition activity continues to produce a higher quality portfolio because higher quality is reflected in our leasing production as we continue to attract premier tenants at higher ends. Our redevelopment and development activity continues to create value and opportunity unlocking the highest and best use of the real estate, and we do all these with a cautious and watchful eye on our balance sheet at our cost of capital.","Now for some details; in the first quarter we continue to execute on our disposition strategy by closing on $323 million of dispositions in Canada and $114 million of dispositions in the U.S. The blended average cap rate was 6.9% in the first quarter and quality buyers ranging from public reads, private reads, local public real estate groups, high network individuals, international buyers and trade buyers all continue to call through our disposition portfolio. We are in the ninth inning of our transformation, and with the majority of our Canadian portfolio under contract and the progress to date on our U.S. dispositions, we are on pace to hit our target of $400 million to $475 million of dispositions in the U.S. and $425 million to $500 million in Canada by year ends and complete the transformation of the portfolio. ","Turning to acquisitions; our first quarter concluded with limited volume reflecting the competitiveness in our target markets. After quarter end we did reach agreement to purchase our JV partners interest in Oakwood Plaza in the adjacent Dania Pointe development site. These sites combined to offer over two miles of frontage along I-95 and the Fort Lauderdale, Miami corridor. Oakwood is 100% occupied but reflects what we look for in our target markets, irreplaceable real estate with blow market reps, significant sales volumes and future redevelopment opportunity. ","Dania is the adjacent development site that we now control and are happy to take this opportunity to announce the ground lease with Costco to anchor the first base and take off the pre-leasing. Both Oakwood and Dania are key building blocks to our 20\/20 vision creating value on larger assets and markets with high various entry. Oakwood is now our number two NOI producer and upon stabilization Dania will be the number one NOI contributor in the entire portfolio.","The strong leasing demand for quality real estate highlights the positive supply and demand in balance that the open air sector is currently enjoying. Keeping occupancy steady at 95.8% over prior quarter validates the portfolio quality and the quality of our leasing team as we typically experience an earlier dip due to post holiday closings. Retailer demands did not change during the stock market crash in the first quarter, and we continue this demand across all square footage categories. ","The volume of new deals this quarter included big-box retailers, grocery stores and off-price retailers, all enhancing the merchandising mix and improving net asset value. Target, Whole Foods, Giant and Traders Joe's are just a few examples that executed a lease this quarter that positively impact NAV. A high number of our new deal this quarter including the Target and Whole Foods deals are taking currently occupied space, so while we will have a short-term hit in same site NOI, and do not pick up any occupancy. We do pick up material in NAV. ","In addition, these quality times create a halo effect in our centers which allow Kimco to achieve outsize growth from the surrounding retail. New leases were signed at an average base rent of $21 a foot reflecting the embedded mark-to-market opportunities when compared to our current average base rent. Kimco's average base rent is now $14.67, a 4.8% increase over Q1 2015 and 27.9% over Q1 in 2010.","While we are currently enjoying a 38-year low in supply, we are monitoring the shadow supplies high flying closely. Recent bankruptcies and announced foreclosings in addition to pending mergers will be the primary driver of increased supply in the short run for both malls and open air centers. ","This is not new to our sector. What is new is that at Kimco today are transformed high quality portfolio makes us more ready and better prepared for these situations that is why we are approaching the Sports Authority liquidation with cautious optimism. Preliminary indications suggest that we will be a significant demand for boxes if and when they revert back to us. ","Redevelopments completed in the first quarter will deliver incremental NOI of $2.3 million with an ROI of 11.5%. Redevelopment remains the best use of our capital, and Kimco's billion dollar pipeline continues to cycle more projects from the entitlement stage to the active pipeline as additional opportunities are constantly being discovered within the existing portfolio. The amount of raw material in our portfolio and the focus on value creation has given rise to a shadow pipeline of additional redevelopment projects that account for roughly $2 billion of future projects. Acting upon the embedded opportunity will serve our long term shareholders by adding value to best in class properties.","Turning to development. We recently hit two major milestones. By securing the target deal at our Grand Parkway Development in Texas, and today announcing the Costco ground lease at our Dania Development Projects in Florida. These anchors have jump started the pre-leasing for the first bases of both projects. Due to the lack of new supply and the strong demand from open air retailers. We continue to aggressively pre-lease our strategic development projects. Each development site has a staging plan in place to better monitor and insure that our investment remains to our costing capital and to provide off ramps to keep maximum flexibility.","In closing, we continue to march toward our 20\/20 vision of being a U.S. focus tree with large pockets of concentration and high barrier to entry markets. The team is working overtime to unlock value at the property level through lease up and mark-to-market opportunities. Continuing to extend and deliver on the redevelopment pipeline and executing on the strategic development pipeline. All well-positioned in the balance sheet to be in a position that's right now and for the next cycle.","Glenn will now take you through the details of the first quarter.","Glenn Cohen","Thanks, Conor, and good morning. 2016 is also a solid start. We continue to execute on all fronts, listing, dispositions, redevelopment and development activity as part of the strengthening of our balance sheet metrics. These are the primary ingredients needed to achieve our 20\/20 vision. ","Headline FFO per diluted share which represents the official navy definition was $0.38, up from $0.37 last year and higher than first call consensus. The improved performance is attributable to a 5.2% increase in U.S. net operating income which was substantially offset by the reduction in NOI from the Canadian dispositions. Lower G&A expense and lower financing cost attributable to the redemption of the 6.9% preferred stock last year also contributed to the growth. ","Included in the headline result is a profit participation from the sale of a Canadian preferred equity investment of $5.5 million. FFO is adjusted or recurring FFO which excluded non-operating impairments and transactional income and expense was $0.37 per diluted share for the first quarter up from $0.36 last year, 2.8% increase. We accomplished this growth level despite the $0.03 per share diluted impact from our portfolio transformation. The portfolio transformation includes the substantial disposition of assets in Latin America and in Canada totaling $900 million and $600 million of U.S. dispositions in just the last 12 months. The diluted impact was more than offset with the reduced financing cost and $1.4 billion of acquisitions of high quality assets in our key markets. Many of the acquisitions were sourced from our joint venture programs.","Our portfolio operating team delivered solid first quarter results maintaining our anchor expend and occupancy at 98.2% and the increasing small shops placed by 40 basis points from the year ago to 88.6%. We remain on target for small shop occupancy to reach 90% by year end. We continue to deliver strong leasing spreads of 19.1% renew leases, up 6.3% renewals and options and 7.5% combined. ","U.S. same site NOI growth is 1.5% and includes a credit loss reserve of $3.2 million or 140 basis points related to the bankruptcy filing by Sports Authority. This reserve demand includes 100% of all prepetition amounts and $811,000 of grant for March which remains unchanged. Even with the short term impact from Sports Authority, we remain on track and reaffirm our full year U.S. same site and a wide guidance range of an increase of 2.5% to 3.5%. ","Additionally, in an effort to giving analyst and investor community further information for comparability purposes, we have included in our supplemental package the same site disclosures of strength line rent adjustments, lease termination fees and amortization of above trends.","As part of our 20\/20 vision, we are laser focused on further improving our debt metrics with a target of five to five and a half times for consolidated net debts or recurring EBITDA and a fixed charge coverage of three times plus. In the last 12 months we have reduced our net debt by $560 million from $5.5 billion to $4.94 billion on March 31. At the end of the first quarter, net debts or recurring EBITDA is 5.9 times down from 6.6 times a year ago and fixed charge coverage came in at 3.2 times.","We retain over $400 million of maturing debts during the first quarter and we paid an additional $117 million of mortgage set in April, leaving us with just about $250 million in remaining consolidated maturities for the balance of the year. A portion of the debit payment was accomplished with $138.5 million of proceeds raised from the issuance of 4.96 million shares of common equity through an ATM program, at a weighted average offering price of $28.20 per share during March and April. ","At another data point, at the end of the first quarter, our total debt to total market capitalization was down to 28%, the lowest level in the past eight years. Based on the solid first quarter results, we are reaffirming our headline FFO per share guidance range of $1.54 to $1.62. Please keep in mind that the bulk of the transactional income to 2016 is anticipated to occur late in the fourth quarter. We were also reaffirming our FFO at adjusted per share values range of $1.48 to $1.52 in the midpoint of $1.50 per share, and each of our operating guidance assumptions. And with that we'd be happy to answer your questions. ","Conor Flynn","We're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Due to the large volume of participants in the queue, we request a one question limit with an appropriate follow up. This will provide all callers an opportunity to speak with management. If you have additional questions, you're more than welcome to rejoin the queue. Keith, you may take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Michael [ph] with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","Conor, I was wondering if you can just spend some time on Oakwood and Dania just from the perspective of who approached who, whether it was you or CPP, but also how the development was effectively valued versus going forward with it as a partnership? And then I get your point in terms of wanting to have high pockets of concentration, but it would seem that between Oakwood and Dania who would rank number one and number two. That would be a very large concentration in a very concentrated location. So maybe you can just walk through some of the comfort that you got through all that.","Conor Flynn","Sure, happy to. Oakwood and Dania, we've been very proactive with our partners. As you know one of our strategies is to really own more of our assets 100% and give us total control of our destiny. And this especially was true with Oakwood and Dania. Oakwood is where we have an office, so we have a physical presence there, and we realize that with Oakwood and Dania we have a unique opportunity to really enhance the value of both assets of what we're trying to do both at Oakwood and at Dania. So we've been proactive with all of our partners, and this one was opportunistic for us to strike and really take CPP out of the transaction early on in the stage. So we were able to by CPP out of the development site at their bases which means that was extremely opportunistic, and now that we have Costco fully executed we think that it's just the beginning of a strong pre-leasing effort for the first phase.","And the second phase now that we have complete control, due to the ability to really take a step back and look at what's the highest and best use for the property. If we want to sell off parcels, if we want to self-develop more parcels or if we want to do a higher density. We have that luxury now which before we probably have the inability to do so because of the partnerships. So we feel like it gives us more flexibility and it continues to allow us focus on larger assets with significant both development and redevelopment opportunity. So that was a little bit of a history there, and in terms of the concentration, you're right that's going to be in terms of our size that number one and number two producing properties in the portfolio. But we also have tremendous pockets of concentration in California, in New York and with future redevelopments at West Lake and as well as some of our larger assets. I think that there will be large assets that may challenge the number one and number two distinction that we've given Dania and Oakwood. And we always want to love to see and make sure that we're diversified accordingly. So if it becomes too concentrated we'll have hopefully the luxury of what would be an alternative ideas there of what we should do.","Unidentified Analyst","And what percentage would Dania and Oakwood combine in terms of when you're talking number one and number two, what would be the concentration?","Glenn Cohen","Hi, Michael, it's Glenn. The total would probably be no more than 3%.","Unidentified Analyst","Combined.","Glenn Cohen","Combined, yes.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and the next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","Were all or merely all of the Sports Authority in the same store pool without redevelopment bucket?","Conor Flynn","Yes.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, and if you were to get, let's say just assume 25 of the Sports Authorities back, how long do you think it would take just maybe fill half of those stores?","Conor Flynn","Hi, Craig, it's Conor. Yes, I think that when you look at the, if you talk about half of the Sports Authority boxes, it will obviously be a case by case situation. But the one that we have really been handily marketing. We feel like we have a tremendous amount of interest on those boxes. So we have LOIs already in place on a number of them. So if you want to just take the 25% and cut it in half, it will probably take us probably another quarter or two to probably finalize the leases and get half of them fully executed. That being said, we're well aware of the interest levels of other sporting goods operators in the real estate and their lease hold positions. So we anticipate anywhere between during the auction process maybe 10 to 15 leases that maybe sold to their competitors.","Craig Schmidt","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and the next question comes from Jason White with Green Street Advisors.","Jason White","Hey, guys. Just a quick question on your non-cash rents. It looks like those jumped up quite a bit in 1Q. I mean incrementally, they are up in 4Q as well, but just year-over-year they're up quite a bit. Is there anything special in there?","Conor Flynn","Nothing's special. What happens is when a tenant leaves that had a blow market rent and they leave early you have to save the full amount into occupancy and we had that in one particular case, so $7 million. It's really what it is; it's nothing more than there.","Jason White","Got you. And can you just walk through the A&P update in terms of the boxes that you got back and where you're at in releasing those and actually turning the keys back over to the tenants to pay rent?","Conor Flynn ","Yes, absolutely. We have four A&P boxes left to lease off. One of them in Staten Island is a large scale redevelopment highland plaza. We're going to through the user process right now to add over 100,000 square feet additional density. We haven't executed lease still at the full line grocer but we can't yet disclose who it is because we're still going through the entitlement process. So not going to be a 2017 redevelopment. That's very large in scale. So we've been pre-leasing that but we have yet to disclose it as we go through the entitlements. Home Dell in New Jersey is another one where we have LOIs going with two potential specialty grocers that are bidding a portion of the space as well as the best in class off price retailers to co-tenant with them to split that box. A third one in Staten Island which is really the last piece. It's up Richmond, its redevelopment, and that's where we did the large target redevelopment and this was the last phase. We have guild approved at REC committees with retailers to split them up. One for at best in class specialty growth certainly half of it and another best in class of price user to sync the other half. The final A&P store is actually under contract to be sold to an end user. They came and approached us to purchase the asset and because of the end user is able to really pay a significant price so we're under contract there. It's probably should be closing next quarter.","Jason White","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and the next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord.","Paul Morgan","Hi, good morning. Just a little bit more on Sports Authority, I guess. Do you have an update on kind of the mark-to-market across the 25 stores on average, and I understand what you said about the half of those are just directly sold to competitors, but [ph] number anyway. And then for the ones you do get back, do you envision demising spaces or the people you have kind of lined up preliminary taking it as is and are there any kind of retail segments that are sort of most interested in that size box for you guys right now?","Conor Flynn","Yes, the mark-to-market overall is around 5% to 10%. So we do have some upside depending on which stores we get back and obviously it depends site by site. On the releasing side of it, it's going to be again case by case scenario. We do have LOIs for users who take the whole box and also users to split. Many of the offsite concepts have multiple flags, so they could take the whole box and do multiple uses in that box as well. We also have the opportunity to add grocery to 15 of our 25 locations. So we've obviously pinned that down as a priority for us to see if we can create some value there as well, and we're working with some of the specialty grocers as well as traditional grocers to take those boxes. So again the average base rep for all 25 is under $15 a foot. These are all locations that we think are very much in demand and there's very little supply out there. So whether it's going to be a competitor that just buy the lease and has to live with the existing use clause or is an off price user or a grocery store, there's also some interest from some of the home improvement sector as well from, so they're smaller boxes. So we think we're, we have costs optimistic that we're going to be in good shape here for the lone mall.","Paul Morgan","Great. And you mentioned you reiterated your same store numbers despite it's not a Q1 impact there. Was this type of scenario incorporated maybe in the low end of the range already or there are other things that have been in the first four months kind of running ahead of plan that kind of led you to the decision?","Conor Flynn","We did have a portion of it in our budget for the first quarter. So we knew our first quarter was going to be challenged in terms of sale because we are dealing with the A&P, the ANS, as well as the reserve taken for Sports Authority. The lease up continues to be robust, the portfolio. When we look at our pipeline going out, not only in the future but also looking back. The second half of the year is definitely heavily weighted towards our same side NOI top. So that's really what gives us the optimism to keep the guidance unchanged.","Paul Morgan","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you, and the next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good morning everyone. Just one more on Sports Authority. Are all 25 undergoing inventory liquidation sales today or completed that?","Conor Flynn","No, only six of the 25 are going through that process right now. So again it's a fluid situation. We obviously are marketing all the boxes but those are the only six that are going through that going out of business sale currently.","Vincent Chao","Got it. Thank you, and then just maybe beyond Sports Authority. In your opening comments you talked about shadow supply, and I was just curious it seems like bankruptcy season, Sports Authority now withstanding hasn't been all that bad. Just curious if you're seeing something different in terms of store closure expectations and future bankruptcy expectations with the balance of the year.","Conor Flynn","We would agree. We think this is a very healthy environment right now. If you look at the overall supply it's very, very well, and the bankruptcy filings that you've seen and the store closings are relatively modest especially when you compare year-over-year and when you look at our sector, we are starting to look at shadow supply a little bit differently. We're starting to look at some of the mall anchor boxes that are possibly coming back as part of our competitive set going forward. So we're being kind of sense it to be aware of it, but overall it's a very healthy environment. The new leases that are getting done today are what really the best in class operators. The off price retailers continue to add some accounts to this brand new, competition coming into that sector. The specialty grocers continue to want to add unit count. So we think that we continue to be in the sweet spot of retail, and it's a good time to get boxes back. There's no question about it.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you, and the next question comes from Jeremy Metz with UBS.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning guys. It's Ross [ph] here with Jeremy. I have two questions. The first is around the same store NOI in the U.S. excluding the redevelopments. You guys reported 0.2%, even if I add back the Sports Authority adjustment it gets back to 1.6%. I guess the question is what was going on in the quarter that made that U.S. ex-redit [ph] number? So I would have thought just contractual rent growth in the releasing spreads would have gotten that number to at least 2.5%?","Conor Flynn","It's really dealing with the A&P and that was still, that have not hit the flow. So if you look at the executed leases that we have for the pending deals we have working on the A&Ps, they won't start to flow until the second half of the year. So that's where we really start to see the uptick in the same side NOI. So that's really what were still dealing with but we have plenty of opportunity there, plenty of demands, so we think we'll be able to pick that back up and that's why we reinforced our guidance in same side NOI.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Okay, and then related question. I was looking at your tenant improvement, your TI spend and if I look at that and I divide your TI spend per year of lease, compare it to the new rents that you're getting, near the $20 rent, it looks like your TI is running at about 13% of the new annual rent. And I'm just curious have you guys think about that number, it smells, I haven't gone back and look to where it was five, ten years ago, it feels a little higher than where it would have been historically.","Conor Flynn","It's actually lower if you look at it sequentially. I mean, we always tend to take the task of trying to invest less in the retailer and more in the real estate. So if you look at a lot of our deals, they're ground leases, which will negatively impact our average space rent, but we think through the long term as the best economic deal. So we try and make the retailer invest inside this space and we do the improvements to the shopping center. So that is half of what we take for a long period of time, and we continue to look at that going forward.","Operator","Thank you, and the next question comes from Honda San Jose [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Hey there, good morning. A question on the asset tails. Given your unit eight activity there, just curious if you see any impact of widening CNBS spreads on pricing or demand for the asset that you're selling. Are you getting any push back on pricing getting re-traded, and is there more interest or better pricing on a one off or many portfolio basis?","Ross Cooper","Sure, this is Ross. I'm happy to jump in. I think that when you look at sort of the transaction environment in general, we're definitely seeing continued strength in competition and aggressive pricing for the core product. Anything that has value add or achievable redevelopment or growth story there's still an immense amount of capital chasing those deals. When we look at our transactions on the disposition side, I'd say that the biggest challenge that we're finding is generating a deep buyer pool on some of the secondary market assets. The one that are really stable income streams with no growth and no grocer, I would say that we are seeing a little bit of a more shallow buyer pool. But I think that's sort of where the private writs. We're really controlling and being aggressive in that market. So to a certain extent I think we're missing those buyers, but that being said we are still getting enough of an option going where we've been able to achieve our cap rates and our objectives. So I think when you compare the cap rates disk order, as Conor mentioned, sort of blended we're still in the very high sixes, maybe low sevens in some cases on the dispositions. But we still feel very good about our ability to get that sold. We're not seeing any real material re-trading, obviously one off opportunities, you'll see them here and there but I don't think there's any major general trends. So we're optimistic that we'll continue to hit our targets for the rest of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Seeing any portfolio demand and then any comment on change in cap rates and some of those secondary treasury markets locations?","Ross Cooper","We still believe that sorting one off is the best way to achieve our pricing. We have not seen any real premium for portfolios that have been out in the marketplace. I think when you look at the buyer pool; everybody's looking for a very specific type of asset or return threshold whether it's the location, geographics or the tenant profile. Buyers are looking for something very specific. So we've actually seen a bit of a discount for the portfolios that have been in the market. It obviously takes a little bit longer and there's a lot of blocking happening on the one off, but that's how we felt that tackling has been best for us. So we'll continue with that strategy.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and the next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning out there. If you could just talk a little bit more about equity issuance, it's obviously it's been several years since you guys last issue, and if we should expect more this year especially given Milton's focus on getting the company to an A minus. It would seem like given where you guys are relative to NAV that we're likely to see more equity issuance out of you guys to improve the credit standing?","Glenn Cohen","Hi, Alex, it's Glenn. The equity that we raise in the first quarter and the beginning part of the second quarter was really in line with what we had budgeted in terms of our overall capital plan. Now we continue to monitor the market and continue to watch what's happening with our disposition pipeline, watching the acquisition side of it. And again, we're very much monitoring very closely what happens with Albertson's, because Albertson's could be a very major component of capital that comes to us without causing any dilution at all. As a matter of fact it would be coming very free to transaction to us. So we are very focused as I mentioned on continuing to improve balance sheet metrics and bringing leverage down overtime, but we're going to do it methodically and opportunistically.","Alexander Goldfarb","So then, Glenn, as a follow up, on the transactional income where you guys said on the front of the call that it's late 2016, is that just sort of a placeholder or do you have certainty as far as the timing of Albertson's that it will be late '16 or that's the best? So trying to understand best guess versus your confident that it's going to be late '16.","Glenn Cohen","Well again, Ray, do you want to talk a little bit about just what you're aware in terms on Albertson's at this time?","Ray Edwards","Hi, Albertson's as you know the S1 that was filed back in last summer was updated in January and will be updated next month when order about financials for our fiscal year end which was the end of February done. So the investors and the company, the management's deal that the best direction for the company, its future growth is to be a public company. You have to time it correctly, but when the markets are in the right place its consideration. Nothing's definite now but we're still focused on moving forward. Company's doing very well, leading the trends on the business. Very excited about the future, obviously some things whether we want to do or not as we show in October it's not necessarily going to be the phase [ph] happen, but they're moving in the right direction to go forward with that. That's what we're basing our reason.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, so just to finish then, Glenn, so you guys may need more equity if you don't do Albertson's, but if you do Albertson's then no need for equity. That's the take on?","Glenn Cohen","Again, as I said, Alex, we are monitoring the overall capital plan and we'll do it methodically and opportunistically. Now again, just to clarify the last point of the timing. We're already in the middle of April; there is a 180-day lockout period on day one of an IPO. So you're ready in the fourth quarter and we know it's not happening for a little while longer, that's why my comment that it wouldn't be any earlier than late in the fourth quarter.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and the next question is coming from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. Just one more question on Sports Authority, if you don't mind. Your company projects have Sports Authority and the other one HS Craig [ph], but just curious how did those projects or those, that end up in your project, was it just a high renter willing to pay or was it assumption that maybe they were healthier than they seem to at that time?","Conor Flynn","The leases were signed over a year ago. So redevelopments usually take a long time to get entitlement to get going, so these were done at a time where we did a thorough review of their business plan with their CEO, their CFO and held a conference call to see what their plan was. Unfortunately, they missed their plan and they were part of the redevelopment that included, we're doing a brand new Whole Foods at one, we're doing Ross, TJX and others on those other two. So we feel there's plenty of demand for that box going forward in those redevelopments, and we have not given them any tentative approval on any of those site. So we have the flexibility to go back and re-lease those boxes if and when they're rejected and they revert back to us. So at the time they were in Florida which is their primary market where they were the dominant player at that time, and we thought they were the appropriate co-tenant but luckily because of the strength of the other co-tenants of our redevelopments we think that we'll be able to do potentially even better.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, and let's say you do get to reassign half those boxes, from a practical standpoint even if there's full assignments for half of those boxes, how much downtime is there as maybe comes in and reconfigures the space?","Conor Flynn","It really depends, it depends if they buy the lease. If they buy the lease then there's zero down time, and then we get all the rent back that we reserved for. So on the one that will be rejected, those are the ones that will take some time in terms of lease [ph] build down, building out of the space, and it all depends on what they see with the box. With a single tenant user, you probably can get your right commencement date sooner than if you were to split the box and do a potential multi-tenant pipeline up. So it will really depend on what the highest invest use for that real estate. Some of them might be grocery components on them, might be redevelopments, some of them might be single-tenant users, and then it will just have to come down to what's the best use that we can find.","Ki Bin Kim","And how does it look right now, are they sort of what you said might be reassigned or bought, would they really buy the lease or is there more set for like a retail light fix to just wait it out?","Conor Flynn","Right now it looks like there's going to be plenty of bidders to buy a number of leases from them, so they might view\u2026","Ray Edwards","Conor, it's Ray. I mean the thing is that there are the two big, Ringo Stars both circling the company. So the way to get the store is might be to be buying them through the bankruptcy versus, if brought back and then we could decide which one we want to put in for example. So simply some lively bidding between two major sporting goods stores. They have to be in to happen again, and not wait to see who comes back and try to deal with us.","Ki Bin Kim","Got it. Thanks, man. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And the next questions comes from Anik [ph] with Capital One.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Is there a role for the plus business in the current retail landscape specifically as it pertains to bankruptcy resolution?","Conor Flynn","Ray?","Ray Edwards","We've always thought that plus business was part of a differentiation of ROE versus others, and it gives us the opportunity through different cycles. We made a lot of money through plus business over the years and it continues to be opportunistic, and with retail being so challenging these days we do think that there may be future opportunities where clearly we're focused on the Albertson's that we currently have and want to create value there before we publicly do anything more.","Unidentified Analyst","Sure, and then just following up on that on the prior comment about who are the bidders for the Sports Authority is, would Kimco sort of consider playing a role in the liquidation of Sports Authority via the plus business?","Conor Flynn","I think at this point in time, probably not. I mean, Ray, you can talk a little bit more.","Ray Edwards","Yes, I mean plus business bankruptcy is where a lot times the retailers own a lot of the real estate and then Sports Authority they own I think one property, actually I am looking at that one, but this is a probably a lease portfolio. You have the users that are the highest bidders for that and the rest was just what this play out. We don't want to chase every deal just to say we're still in the process to make sure it's very profitable.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Michael Miller with JP Morgan.","Michael Miller","Hi, just want to confirm that partner buyouts, they are included in the acquisition guidance and if so, we're looking to the balance of the year, do you expect more buyouts or to be more skew toward their party acquisitions?","Conor Flynn","They are included in our guidance, the JV Partner buyouts. It will probably be a mix. We like to say we have -- maybe potential JV portfolio buyout but it will probably be more likely where it's just one off situations where similar to an Oakwood and Dania, we go piece by piece and trying to buy individual asset that we can put a little value on.","Michael Miller","Got it. Okay, that was it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and the next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC.","Rich Moore","Hey, good morning guys. Now that you've essentially got everything under contract in Canada, I'm not sure out of it already. Have you had any further thoughts on the bonds that you have up there and whether it's time to do something to get rid of those?","Glenn Cohen","Yes. Hi, Rich, it's Glenn. We continue to evaluate the bonds themselves, although we do have a lot of things under contract, we really would want the capital in hand before we start to make decisions about pulling those bonds. So we have to play it out for another quarter or so. But it's definitely on the table, it's something we're evaluating.","Rich Moore","Okay, is it safe, Glenn, to say that if you do get out of Canada entirely there's no sense to have those bonds stay on, is that right?","Glenn Cohen","I would agree with that. Yes, I think everyone would agree with that.","Rich Moore","Okay. All right, great, thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you, and the next question is a follow up from Michael [ph] with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, just two quick ones. Glenn, just on the equity, the guidance if you just take your gross FFO divided by your per share FFO, it's about $419 million average shares. I think you're effectively with the late 1Q and 2Q issuance calling about $418. So maybe to get to the average you may have like $15 million left in your guidance of issuance, is that sort of right and so we should think about anything above that level is having some potential impact diluted of how you use the proceeds?","Conor Flynn","Yes, I mean first of all you have to remember we do have option exercise still from when we're still doing that. So some of that might continue to come in. You have issuances that come from our drip as well, so just a very few point, there's a very, very modest amount that would remain but it's tiny at this point.","Unidentified Analyst","And the goal in terms of tapping the ATM in the quarter was even though you have all these disposition activity was to sort of keep some leverage neutrality as you sort of did Oakwood and Dania. I mean what really drove the $150 million, was it leverage driven, was it stock price driven in terms of the fact that you're about 28, how should we think about the rationale for tapping the ATM?","Conor Flynn","We have a longer term or medium term goal to continuing to reduce leverage and improve those balance sheet metrics. As you know cash can be tangible but if you look at the amount of mortgage that we will retain this year at close to 6%. To take the leverage down with some equity to make some sense for us. So I would say, yes, we kind of earmarked it to us, debt reduction, leverage reduction, less than about the acquisitions because much of the acquisition activity is being fueled by proceeds coming from disposition activity.","Unidentified Analyst","And just last one, Conor, and I may have missed this. But the re-leasing spreads softened a little bit in the first quarter from recent trends, was there anything specific to that impacted average and then I don't know how that translates into what you're starting for the rest of the year?","Conor Flynn","The first quarter definitely has more renewals and options in terms of the total high when you look at the combined leasing spreads so it doesn't weigh on the combined leasing spread, but overall we still feel very confident that we can deliver a high single-digit, low double-digit combined leasing spread going forward. We still think there's lots of opportunities to unlock value and mark-to-market opportunities there.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And as there are no more questions at the present time, I would like to return the call to management for any closing comments.","Conor Flynn","Thank you for participating in our call today. As a reminder, additional information for the company can be found in our supplemental that is posted to our website. Have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"12460":["Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) Q4 2011 Earnings Call February  9, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","David F.

Please be aware, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce your speaker today, Dave Bujnicki. Please proceed, Mr. Bujnicki.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Cynthia. Thank you all for joining Kimco's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning is Milton Cooper, Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Pappagallo, Chief Operating Officer; Glenn Cohen, Chief Financial Officer, as well as other key executives, who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call represent the company and management's hopes, intentions, beliefs, expectations or projections of the future, which are forward-looking statements. It is important to note that the company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements is contained in the company's SEC filings.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors to better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","Finally, during the Q&A portion of the call, we request that you respect the limit of one question, so that all of our callers have the opportunity to speak with management. Feel free to return to the queue, if you have additional questions.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave Henry.","David B. Henry","Good morning. Thanks for calling in today. I'm a little under the weather, so I'm going to ask Scott Onufrey to read my prepared remarks, but I will be available for any easy questions after that.","Scott G. Onufrey","We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, and we believe they represent continued solid and steady progress on our key goals and objectives. Our earnings release contains the detailed numbers for the quarter, but I would like to highlight certain areas and provide further updated information on others. Overall, and step-by-step, our retail portfolio continues to strengthen as evidenced by the key metrics or, as we like to say, our vital signs. Seven straight quarters of positive same-store NOI growth, positive leasing spreads of 4.9% and a 30 basis point increase on our occupant -- in our occupancy, altogether present a strong and improving picture. ","The economy and our retailers are both showing tentative signs of shrugging off the anemic recovery and focusing on growth. With virtually no new development in our retail sector, sustained population growth and improving GDP numbers, we are beginning to see an increase in effective rents, particularly in our strong core markets, such as Long Island, South Florida, Baltimore, Washington, Puerto Rico and Canada. We also continue to make good progress in reducing our non-retail portfolio. ","From $1.2 billion in early 2009, we now stand at $495 million, representing less than 4.5% of our total assets. Our largest remaining single investment, the InTown Suites portfolio is attracting increasing levels of interest as we have now broadened the marketing efforts with our partner's permission and as hotel properties are again beginning -- being aggressively pursued by investors. There are several parties which have conducted extensive due diligence, and we are confident that we will be able to sell the portfolio in the near term. ","At the property level, InTown continues to perform very well with RevPAR increasing substantially. We also have a significant number of other non-retail properties under contract, which will further reduce the amount of the remaining non-retail portfolio. ","Under Mike Pappagallo's leadership, we are also making strong progress on our recycling initiatives. In 2011, we sold 31 nonstrategic retail properties, while at the same time, we bought 17 high-quality shopping centers, virtually all in our core markets. We are committed to continuing to sell our nonstrategic shopping centers, which will upgrade our portfolio and permit us to concentrate on superior properties in our core markets. ","Internationally, our Canadian portfolio is maintaining its very high occupancy and benefiting from strong retailer expansion, highlighted by targets commitment to open 24 -- 25 stores in Canada, each quarter beginning in March 2013. The Canadian economy remains strong with 2% GDP growth forecast for 2012, continued low interest rates and moderate unemployment levels. We are pleased that we are able to buy a high-quality grocery-anchored center in December in the Greater Vancouver market, and we hope to close on another attractive grocery anchored center in Edmonton shortly. ","In Mexico, our retail portfolio is making leasing progress hitting 84% combined occupancy in the fourth quarter, including several new developments. The Mexico economy is strong with 3.9% GDP growth in 2011, higher than that of Brazil for the first time in 8 years. The strengthening currency and strong retail sales performance. Overall, Mexico same-store retail sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. We are seeing increased leasing demand from national, international anchors and sub-anchors. Interestingly, anchor retailers in our Mexico portfolio pay percentage rents exceeding $2 million in 2011. And as I like to remind everyone, all of our leases in Mexico contained full annual cost of living escalators. ","As we move forward into 2012, we feel very pleased with our results. And we believe 2012 will be another year of increasing FFO. Portfolio improvements and success in recycling capital to create a very high quality retail portfolio in our core markets where we have scale, terrific demographics and strong retailer relationships. ","On this call, I would also like to acknowledge and formally thank Barbara Pooley, for her hard work and contributions during her 5 years with the company. Her departure was on good terms as reflected in the mutual and amicable separation document filed with the 8-K. Barbara remains available to the company for advisory services and consultation for an extended period. ","Now I would like to turn to Glenn to discuss the financial details of our fourth quarter to be followed by Mike and Milton.","Glenn G. Cohen","Thanks, Scott, Dave. We hope you'll feel better quickly. Our fourth quarter results demonstrate the continuation of the strategy that we set forth at our Investor Day almost 18 months ago. The strategy that is focused on our property operating matrix, which Dave has coined our vital signs, such as occupancy, same-site NOI growth and leasing spreads. We continued monetization of non-retail assets and the disposition of nonstrategic retail assets, while using the proceeds for acquisitions of shopping center properties in the key markets we have identified. All these activities are being executed with an eye towards a strengthening balance sheet, strong liquidity position and improved debt metrics. I'm pleased to report we have been executing on all aspects of this strategy. ","Let me expand upon the results noted in the earnings release. Headline FFO per share came in at $0.33 for the quarter, bringing headline FFO to $1.27 for the full year, as compared to $1.21 for 2010, a 5% increase. The fourth quarter 2011 headline amount includes $0.04 of transaction income and $0.01 of impairment charges. The results I just mentioned have been adjusted to reflect a NAREIT revision to the FFO definition, which now excludes impairments of depreciable operating assets and depreciable asset impaired in joint ventures. We have adopted the revised definition and have adjusted previous periods to reflect the modification. ","Our recurring FFO per share for the fourth quarter was $0.30 with a full year recurring FFO per share result of $1.20 compared to $1.14 for 2010, a 5.3% increase. This meets the top end of our guidance range. The recurring FFO increase is attributable to a 5.7% increase in recurring retail contributions, fueled by positive results at the operating property level. The revised NAREIT-FFO definition has no impact on recurring FFO and FFO per share. ","Our shopping center metrics continue to improve. Gross occupancy for the U.S. portfolio increased 30 basis points from last quarter and is up 50 basis points from a year ago to 93.2%. Gross occupancy, on a combined basis, including the U.S., Canada and Latin America, increased 30 basis points to 93.3%. Same-site NOI growth was 1.6% on a combined basis, representing the seventh consecutive quarter with positive results. Our same-site NOI was negatively impacted by about 20 basis points due to the weaker Canadian dollar and weaker Mexican peso. We also had positive leasing spread this quarter of 4.9% combined from new leases, renewals and options. I will net them toward our non-retail monetization objectives continue with the sale of $7 million of liquid bonds, the return of our preferred equity capital, plus a $9.6 million promote on one of our preferred equity investments, the sale of several urban assets in our Canadian hotel portfolio. In addition, since year end, we have monetized several other non-retail assets, bringing the balance to $495 million or a reduction of over $300 million since the beginning of 2011, exceeding our annual target. ","During the quarter, we sold 5 nonstrategic retail assets from the consolidated portfolio and 2 others from joint venture programs for a total proceeds of $55 million. For the year, we disclosed the 31 nonstrategic retail assets. Proceeds from the non-retail and nonstrategic asset sales were quickly put to work with the acquisition of 10 fully-owned assets from an aggregate purchase price of $204 million. ","Our balance sheet and liquidity position is in excellent shape. Our net debt to recurring EBITDA was at 6.2x. If you pro forma in the EBITDA from the late fourth quarter acquisitions, the metric stands at 6.1x. We remain committed to a net debt to recurring EBITDA level of 6x by the end of this year. As a result of the transaction income during the quarter, the headline net debt to EBITDA was 5.5x. We have an excess of $1.4 billion of immediate liquidity to our recently renewed revolving credit facility. Our consolidated debt maturities are well staggered, with only $350 million of maturing debt this year, mostly in the latter half of the year. And bank market and public capital markets are open with noticeable spread tightening for unsecured bonds and perpetual preferred issuances. This may present an opportunity later in the year for us when our 7 3\/4% perpetual preferred insurance becomes callable in October. We will continue to monitor closely the capital markets. ","Lastly, I'd like to provide additional color around guidance. As a result of our completed property-by-property detailed budget process, we are reaffirming 2012 recurring FFO per share guidance of $1.22 to $1.26. This guidance is based solely on recurring flows and does not assume transaction income or impairment charges, if any. Assumptions used in determining this guidance range include an increasing combined portfolio occupancy of 50 to 100 basis points by the end of 2012 and combined positive same-site NOI growth of 1.5% to 3.5%, providing a mid-point increase of 4% from recurring retail flows. We anticipate a decrease in the non-retail contribution as a result of the continued monetization of these assets, including the InTown Suites portfolio and the continuation of the capital recycling plan. As a result, our capital plan assumes no new equity requirements. These assumptions support our dividend level of 19% -- $0.19 per quarter. ","And now I'll turn it over to Mike for his report on the shopping center portfolio.","Michael V. Pappagallo","Thanks, Glenn. On the operating side, we are pleased with the solid finish in 2011 in terms of the portfolio metrics of occupancy, leasing spreads, internal growth and the investment and disposition activity, as reported to you last night. ","Lease occupancy improved across the board, both anchor spaces and small shops, as well as overall in our strategic portfolio. The 70 basis point increase in the overall U.S. occupancy rate over the past year was driven by both positive absorption, as well as the effective dispositions of the bottom tier of the portfolio. Another encouraging sign is the continuing deceleration of vacancies, of smaller box users coming out of the holiday season. Vacates of space under 10,000 square feet for the first quarter were at their highest in the first quarter 2009 with 645,000 square feet, then dropped to 557,000 square feet in 2010 and 361,000 square feet last year. Through January of 2012, we are trending even better than that, providing a bit of positive news in the health of this component of our tenant mix. And as a fun fact, I would offer that not only is our portfolio getting healthy, but so too are the consumers visiting our centers. Loss of square footage since 2009 in the small spaces included many video, books and music shops, all sedentary-type activities. Some big net gainers in that same timeframe include specialty health and spas, yogurt shops and weight reduction centers, just in case you are wondering. ","The recycling process, both continues and will be continuous. This is not a one-shot initiative. And the asset decisions are driven by each regional president's assessment of their own portfolio strengths and weaknesses. A great example is in our Southeast and Florida region. Over the past year, Paul Puma and his team have sold 10 properties with 5 more slated for the first half of 2012 which, combined, represent about 1.2 million square feet and $8 million of net operating income. The total sales proceeds of $95 million has partially funded the $133 million of the region's purchase of new centers that will generate about $9.5 million in NOI. While the sale, cap rates were around $9 million and the purchase cap rates were about $7 million, we moved out of poor markets with either weak anchors or chronic vacancy into well-leased and well-positioned assets in our core markets. ","The U.S. same-site net operating income of 1.1% for this past quarter, as well as the third quarter was nicked a bit by the effect of the borders and A&P bankruptcies, which shaved about 60 basis points from the fourth quarter number. That said, the news on those spaces is good. We have now signed new leases with supermarket users for each of the 3 A&P lease rejections totaling 150,000 square feet. Of the 16 Borders, we now have 4 leases executed, and we expect another 8 done by mid-2012. At this point, the composite releasing spreads are actually a slight positive, contrast that with the 15% to 20% downside on the Linens N Things and Circuit City boxes from 2 years ago. This reflects the quality of the real estate and the changing market per space. The interest level in these boxes underscore what we and other landlords have been saying for a while, that there is continued demand by retailers for space and a declining inventory to satisfy it. ","Within the Kimco portfolio, the number of anchor spaces, 10,000 square feet and greater, as we define it, has been reduced to a little over 100 boxes or just 2.7% of the total GLA, which essentially means that opportunity is to capture stronger retailers and concepts will be more from rollover or recapture of maturing leases and yes, even more bankruptcies. That may not result in big increases in reported occupancy, but more a continuous repositioning and value creation opportunities within the existing shopping center portfolio. We're seeing that in a couple of very recent examples. In Pompano, Florida, we negotiated a termination of an announced Kmart closing with limited term left and are currently pursuing a redevelopment for a supermarket and hard goods retailer. Conversely, in San Diego, we took a longstanding dark and paying supermarket at a location with a 2012 lease end date and re-let it to a fitness club alongside a sporting goods co-tenant at a much higher spread. And considering the ongoing action in anchor leasing and retention, the big pushes in the smaller spaces, ranging from redoubling our efforts in the traditional approaches, pursuing alternative use, combining spaces where economically viable and sometimes demolishing and refocusing available land for out-parcels. ","2012 will be very much a year of working the small details, the nickels and dimes of shopping center leasing and management. And beyond traditional approaches, we're also pursuing any and all angles to secure new users and enhance shopping center performance with a series of initiatives ranging from preapproving locations with franchisors to market to potential users, mobile marketing technology and site-specific programs to support mom and pops and ancillary income from cell tower, solar trash management and other programs. ","And finally, in our Mexico portfolio, our team met their goals for leasing by signing 732,000 square feet of new deals and driving the composite occupancy rate to 84.4%. Our target is an additional 800,000 square feet for 2012. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Milton.","Milton Cooper","Well, thanks, Mike. We are in an environment of low interest rates. There is little inflation and there are signs of improvement in the job market and other economic indicators. Much more is needed but we are heading in the right direction. If the trend is confirmed and continues, all commercial real estate will benefit. Of course, we have no control over the economy, but what we do control are where our focus must lie is in our portfolio and our strategy. And what does that mean for Kimco? One, continue improving our key portfolio operating metrics. Two, continue our momentum of exiting our non-retail assets and our nonstrategic shopping centers. Three, anticipate the ever-changing landscape of retail and seize opportunities as we have done on so many occasions in the past. Overall, we feel very good about the prospects of many of the retailers and their increasing need for space, restaurants, health clubs, service businesses such as dry cleaners, all are relatively immune to the Internet in a rapidly growing [indiscernible]. The positive news is that there is an essentially no development -- new development as I expected and specifically, there have been no new malls built within the past several years and some of the existing mall tenants are seeking space, enabling community shopping centers to meet their expansion needs. With relatively few new retail developments and continued population growth, there should be improvement in both occupancy and rents. ","I also believe that cap rates will compress. The spread between 10-year treasuries and cap rates is simply too high compared to historic trends -- spreads. My sense is that it is good to control close to 1 billion square feet of land in a growing country. We continue to seize opportunities with weak retailers with strong real estate using our extensive experience and contacts in the bankruptcy arena. We recently took back 3 leases in both the Syms and A&P bankruptcies that will allow us to either redevelop the centers or simply re-lease at higher rents. We are continuing our program of rationalizing our portfolio by selling nonstrategic assets. ","Now let's look back and note what we have achieved since the depth of the great recession. Since the S&P 500 index reached its lows in March 2009, Kimco's total return of 182% compares very favorably to the S&P 500 total return of 74% over the same time period. We also outperformed the NAREIT Index. We've been through many cycles and we now have more than 20 years' experience of being a public company and celebrated our anniversary last year. It was a special celebration for all of us at Kimco, and we're excited about our future and the prospects for our company. ","And we that, we will be delighted to answer any questions that you may have.","David F. Bujnicki","Cynthia, we're ready to move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Milton, you just said you expect cap rates to compress further and I was wondering if maybe you can add a little color there. And then just to the extent that you think that, that is upcoming, will that affect your acquisition and disposition appetite? Do you expect cap rates to compress? Would you kind of hold back a bit on dispositions and wait for that or similarly kind of accelerate or change the target set for acquisition?","Milton Cooper","Let me answer the latter part of the question first. It will not affect our desire and momentum to exit the nonstrategic assets and the lesser quality assets. Our objective is to have the highest-quality portfolio. And I do think that cap rates, as I mentioned, as a spread -- if you're buying a cap rate of 7%, let's say, or even 6%, it's still a spread of over 400 basis points at the lower end of the treasuries. And when you consider the possibilities of inflation, the fact that there is a tax savings and having depreciation and real estate assets, that residual value should increase as the country grows. We will have 39 million poor people in America at the end of the 10 years. It's more than the population in Canada and Australia. So residual value, I'll tell you. So that is my thesis for my view that cap rates will compress.","David B. Henry","And Paul, we're seeing it every month in terms of the high-quality centers we're bidding on. There's more and more bidders for those very high-quality centers and cap rates continue to drift down.","Operator","We will take our next question from Quentin Velleley with Citi.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm here with Michael Billerman as well. My question just focuses on the small shop occupancy, so maybe for Mike. In terms of the occupancy in the quarter sequentially, I think it was up about 70 basis points. Obviously, there's been some changes in terms of asset acquisitions and sales. So first, I'm not sure if you had a -- like a same property, what the occupancy increased by over the quarter? And then, as you looked to 2012 guidance, can you give us sort of an expectation of where you think small shop occupancy's going to move throughout the year?","Michael V. Pappagallo","Quentin, my first question back to you is were you looking for same-site occupancy for the smaller spaces only?","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, just for the small spaces.","Michael V. Pappagallo","Yes, I've not broken that down at that level. What I can tell you is that the increase in the small store occupancy, and even the anchor occupancy came about, I would suggest, half and half. Half from positive absorption and half from the disposition activity as we sell some of these poorly occupied centers, this nonstrategic part of our portfolio where we're gaining disproportionately, if you will, in the small store vacancies. So while I didn't give you the numbers, I think we could take from the comment that a lot of the improvement has come from addition by subtraction. Now your question on 2012 with respect to targets and the underlying assumptions of small ticket leasing. Glenn had pointed out that the overall occupancy increase is going to be 50 to 100 basis points. That's a combination in our planning of both positive absorption, as well as that ongoing disposition activity. Again, I think it'll probably be a half and half proposition with the high end, the high-end improvement of the occupancy reflecting more aggressive disposition activity. Hopefully, that helps.","Operator","We will take our next question from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You had commented on the progress in Mexico. I was wondering, when do you think the leasing levels of Mexico will be sort of in line with the rest of your portfolio? And are there any challenges to getting there? Or -- and what's the concentration of vacancy like small shops, whatever?","Glenn G. Cohen","Our budget is to try to get to a 90% level for the entire basket. And you have to remember the entire basket has some recently completed property. So that's why it's not there yet. Leasing is accelerating. We feel very good, as we said in the remarks. We're seeing increasing activity from Mexican retailers, as well as the continued activity from the international retailers. And we're seeing a pickup in Mexico, just like the U.S., in the small shop leasing. The challenges to getting there, obviously, especially in an election year in Mexico, is possible turmoil in Mexico. But honestly, it really seems that they're just powering through the headlines that you may see. And it's helped by the fact that Mexico continues to be under stored by any metric you want to look at compared to the U.S. And the underlying economy is strong with sustained GDP growth between 3% and 4%, low unemployment, manufacturing basis coming back very strongly there. So we feel good. So test us if we get to the 90% level by year end. But that's our firm goal.","Glenn G. Cohen","And just one other thing to add to that, Craig, in terms of reaching that goal, and if you will, to your point about catching up to the rest of the portfolio. If things proceed as planned, it's really a 2013, 2014 type full stabilization point across the entire portfolio where we hope that U.S. occupancies and Mexico occupancies will be flat and then termed indistinguishable, as long as results will be good. But that's our timeframe.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.","Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the hotel portfolio. It sounds like the interest has increased as you broaden the marketing. Can you give us a sense of, perhaps, pricing as you compare to where you were last summer and maybe some expectation for timing?","David B. Henry","Well, you hit the 2 things that really make us firmly believe that we will get this baby sold this year. One is that the whole market has picked up since the second half of last year when the CMBS market imploded and we were headed towards another downturn. But we're seeing the exact opposite right now. There's an increasing level of interest in the hotel portfolio. And with our partner's new permission, we have broadened the marketing effort and we do have a number of very interested parties. Our pricing remains exactly what we established before, which will get us out whole in terms of our book investment and maybe a little more if we're lucky. Underneath it, as we mentioned, the properties are doing very well. The RevPAR is increasing substantially. And I think that's what's going on as there's the hint of recovery out there. Investors are looking at hotel assets, which can be priced daily or, in our case, weekly as possible inflation heads. In our case, even at our price, you're buying way below replacement costs and it's an established brand and a platform and so forth. So we feel good about making something happen with this relatively soon.","Glenn G. Cohen","I mean, from a modeling standpoint in our guidance, we modeled in that it will get sold sometime during the third quarter.","Operator","We will take our next question from Christy McElroy with UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to follow up on some of the prior questions, so just to be clear on 2012 guidance. I'm wondering if you could talk about, just for the U.S. portfolio, what is your same-store NOI growth and your occupancy outside expectation? And then, if you could also provide a total dollar volume for non-core and nonstrategic disposition assumption for 2012?","Michael V. Pappagallo","On the U.S. same-store NOI, and Glenn gave you the range of 1.5 to 3.5 and our base case in the U.S. lands right in the middle of that range and that's why we range that out at such. So for us, the upside case in the U.S. is really accelerating the timing of getting some of the leases that were signed late in '11, as well as some of the planned leases signed in early '12 to get those commencing rent sooner than our plan. And that's the primary driver more than it is occupancy increases. The upside in occupancies was really just the level to anticipate if the economy continues to recover more strongly, that will have a disproportion of positive effect in some of our small store strategies. So a long way of saying, Christy, that the U.S. piece of the puzzle is very consistent with the combined piece of the puzzle. Glenn, you want to comment on the disposition specification?","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes, so in terms of non-retail disposition, as we mentioned, it was is $495 million of book value assets remaining. We expect that have modeled in to sell around $250 million during 2012. So it's going to bring the number almost in half. And then on the nonstrategic retail assets, we modeled in there about $250 million of sales as well. So you can do that in conjunction with our overall capital plan. That's why we just remain in this recycling program and no need for further equity at this point in time.","Operator","We will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just going to look at the buyers of your non-core, the stuff that you're selling. Curious what -- how their financing? If they are cash buyers? If they're using local banks? Or if it's just by simply assuming the existing mortgage and maybe they don't have to put that much equity into it. And as a follow-up to that, the banks, at least at the community bank level, seemed to be -- everyone loves apartments. Curious what their view is of shopping centers that -- of the type that you're selling.","Michael V. Pappagallo","Alex, the predominant buyer of our shopping centers, the quality smallish centers in our non-core markets are almost always local guys. Local guys who either have capital available, have a local banking relationship, may be coming off a 1031 exchange of selling and other property. But it is very, very local. Our strategy has been on a one-off basis because these assets are diverse. There's no comment directed to them. It's not a single market, et cetera. So because of that and we're oftentimes asked about how the CMBS market has affected our program or the capital availability in general, it really hasn't. The thing that more impacts the velocity of our program is the fact that because this is the bottom line of our portfolio, there is, on the normal course of business, more tenants fall out. There's more questions about viability of some of the smaller tenancies and the resiliency of whatever anchors are there. So there's a lot of horse trading that goes on. We tried to accelerate the process as best as we can. And we'll need to make concessions in certain cases, but we're committed to move. It isn't financing that's going to drive the bus, at least for this round of disposition.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then, as for as rate staying low for -- through potentially the end of '14, are you seeing -- Milton, you spoke about cap rates coming down which makes sense just given the environment. But are you seeing the lenders coming down commensurately? Or you see that gap between financing and cap rates widen?","Glenn G. Cohen","Alex, it's Glenn. I mean, when you look at nonrecourse mortgage financing, rates have definitely started to compress. Spreads are starting to compress again. As you know, the market got pretty frozen again during the latter half of '11. That has definitely thawed and there's a lot of activity again. And you're starting to see spread compression, both on the nonrecourse side, and you're seeing spread compression even in the unsecured bond market, even at the levels that treasuries are out today. So I think the capital markets are actually in very, very good shape. And it also goes to the bank market. Bank market spreads have also come in.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Actually, I just want to maybe follow up on Alex's question. Can you talk about the spreads that you're seeing between cap rates, between A and B and C centers? And maybe how that's changed in the last 3 to 6 months? I'm just curious if it's widening and tightening and maybe what's driving -- which segments are moving around most.","Michael V. Pappagallo","Jeff, the lease, as we see it through the lens of our disposition again with the peculiar nature of the property, the cash of sale -- exit cap rates have generally hovered in the 9s, as an average. Some are less, some are more. Depending on what type of asset we're really exiting. So it's remained, relatively speaking, at that level, not withstanding some of the compression in financing spread. So again, because there's much more real estate risk associated with some of the assets. As to the higher-quality property, now the A, the B pluses, we're just echoing what Dave had said is as the continual slight to quality persists, we're seeing more and more compression of cap rates. So as Milton suggested, as the cap rates are going down, you're clearly seeing it on the front tier of the As and the B pluses.","Milton Cooper","What I would add, cap rates and interest rates are tied at the hip. And I think Glenn has pointed out to us that financing is available -- tenure financing is available at the fullest. And if you have tenure available at the fullest, you can readily determine that cap rates are going to be less than 7.","David B. Henry","But it really is a tale of 2 cities out there, the high quality, very low cap rates and the B properties and secondary markets or tertiary markets, limited bidders and higher cap rates.","Operator","We will take our next question from Nathan Isbee with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you just give us a little incentive how you're game planning for the remaining 48 Sears, Kmart locations in your portfolio? Maybe how you stratify the stores between easier relief and those that might languish for a while?","David B. Henry","Well, we do have a business plan for each and every Kmart location. Primarily, our exposure is Kmart. There's a handful of Sears, but there is a game plan and they are in different buckets. Milton, if you want to...","Milton Cooper","Well, again, the Sears are very tiny portion. And so far as Kmart is concerned, there are 2 aspects. One, they have credit and when we look at their credit, it's still a $4.4 billion equity market cap. And thus far, they have not closed any of the stores in our market, indeed in Pompano. We paid to cancel the lease to Kmart and we're replacing that with a very aggressive supermarket and sporting goods. We redeveloped that very well. So you get back to the fundamentals of real estate. And when the real estate is good and the rents are good, we should be able to recycle those that are closed. There has only been one closed in our portfolio.","David B. Henry","And if you remember, in 2002, when Kmart went bankrupt, the very high rent leases or the very poorest performing stores were rejected at that point. So the portfolio at that time, that we were left with, was a very high-quality portfolio, either in terms of very low rents or very good location. And we just want to assure, everybody, we are being very proactive about this. And to the extent we can take back some of these properties early, we will do so and they should find good homes.","Milton Cooper","Another comment on the Sears, Kmart credit. You must remember, one, that Sears owns a very large bank in Sears Canada that has wonderful assets and doing relatively better. Two, they have an Internet function that has been quite successful. So that may be the reason why there is that $4.4 billion market cap.","Operator","We will take our next question from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I saw a gain on the sale of development properties in the income statement and it reminded me of the old KDI days. And I'm curious, I guess, 2 things: One, was that a KDI gain? And two, how do guys think about KDI going forward? Is there a possibility we could see more life to the merchant development sort of concept?","Glenn G. Cohen","We haven't had a merchant building gain in quite a while. This was a KDI asset. So it wasn't merchant building asset and we had the opportunity to sell it. It's an asset that is in our taxable REIT subsidiary. And as we've always done, merchant building gains have been included in FFO, but only to the extent of the economic gain. So will you see a lot more of it? Probably not. There's not a whole lot of KDI assets that are left within the TRFs. There's a few. And we'll keep an eye on them as we go. But again, the main focus, I think, for us is that we continue to focus on the recurring flows and the gain, again, as part of the headline number, but not in the recurring numbers.","David B. Henry","Two comments. One is we will probably, very unlikely, that we will ever go back into the trading business, merchant building where we build and sell. To the extent the economics makes sense, we will build and hold. We are a believer in the long-term recurring income, especially if we're going to build a quality property. We're going to hold that. But just to clarify, Glenn, a lot of that gain in the numbers came from selling a KDI property into a new joint venture with SEB.","Operator","We will take our next question from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just going back to your views on cap rates, to the extent that GAAP, perhaps, between the not so good assets and the high-quality assets has continued to widen. Does that make you want to accelerate your disposition program in order to increase the base with which you're investing in better quality properties?","David B. Henry","Yes, I think we've -- we are accelerating it. And we do believe that not withstanding these higher cap rates for the lower quality properties. Interest rates are at historic lows. Real estate is attracting capital again. It's an inflation hedge, as I mentioned, an alternative investment that yield virtually nothing. So it's a good time to sell, not withstanding these higher cap rates. And we can offset the dilution in many different ways.","Michael V. Pappagallo","And Cedrik, I'll just again restate what I said earlier and what Milton said. We continue to aggressively pursue the disposition of these assets. We're not going to wait for any further lowering of cap rates. Our biggest hurdle, quite frankly, is the fact that these are, again, a series of assets across the countries, small and not in any one particular market. It's very much a ground more of individual negotiation. If I had an entire market I was getting out of, then we'd probably package it up and market it to a different set of buyers. We don't have that in this situation. So we're moving as quickly as we can. But it's going to be a lot of singles and doubles and not a lot of grand slam home run in any one transaction.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just had a follow-up question on Sears. I apologize if I missed it. But do you guys have an estimate of the mark-to-market on the remaining stores? I know it's quite low but...","Michael V. Pappagallo","In other words, suggesting whether the market rents on the spaces are above or below the contract rent?","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm trying to get a sense of what the order magnitude is. I mean, obviously, the leases are pretty low rental rates in place. But just trying to get a sort of order magnitude sense of what the market rents would be today on those stores.","Michael V. Pappagallo","Well, the average base rent, Vincent, is about $5.62. So on balance, we feel that market rent for the available space is higher. Okay, but that's a theoretical comment in the sense that since many of these leases still have a significant amount of term, trying to extract their sales, trying to get out of those leases so it's a little bit more of a difficult proposition. But yes, theoretically, we feel that the market rent is higher now, whether it's 10%, 15%, 20%. That's tough to gauge because it's pretty diverse. The one example we always like to give is, depending on the market, it could be substantially higher. We only talk about the target that replaced the Kmart in Staten Island, a very dense market with very limited supply. And that upside was tremendous. That was about 1 percentage of that.","Milton Cooper","I would say that it was 15x the prior rent.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I knew that. So it varies across the board.","David B. Henry","But I think it's safe to say, what 75%, 80% of these leases are below market. Some of them significantly below market. Do we have some that are above market? Sure. But most of these are under market and not bad locations that we should be able to replace them relative easy if something happened. And in the meantime, we are being proactive on the stores that perhaps Kmart or Sears want to close, trying to work with them, trying to get the space back early if we can on a fair basis.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I dropped off the call so I apologize if this was asked already. But Glenn, can you walk through for 2012 guidance? What's embedded in there for investment activity, so just thinking about either on balance sheet, investment activity through to the funds, non-core retail, as well as non-retail?","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, from an acquisition standpoint, we've modeled in roughly $350 million of our investment dollars. So that will be a mix of consolidated fully-owned properties, as well as any capital that we would invest further with joint venture partners. So that's our target. On the disposition side, as I mentioned, roughly $250 million of non-retail assets to be monetized over the year, as well as another $250 million of sales of nonstrategic retail assets.","Operator","We will take a follow-up question from Quentin Velleley with Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, it's Michael Bilerman. I just want to come back to this debt yield and sort of asset yield, cap rate spread. And Milton, I recognized you're not an economist and have been doing real estate for a few years. But given the fact that the bottom market has been right about where our economy has been and going for the last 5 years, what do you think the bond market is actually telling us with these sort of low rates? Are we sort of in this low inflation, low growth type of market? Or are we simply having a technical bubble because we've have this massive globally induced policy that has pushed a thirst for yield and safety that's going to reverse and cause rates eventually will skyrocket. And then, given the fact that rates and cap rates are joined at the hip, as you said, we could be in for -- to your asset value compression. So I'm just trying to figure out sort of where your mindset is about what the bottom market's telling us.","Milton Cooper","Well, how much of it is influenced by the actions of the Fed and the government, I'm not sure. We all are aware that these rates can't last forever and that there will be much higher rates in the future. Now coming back to the cap rates. In the worst times, and believe it or not, I remember a time when prime was 21, when the 10-year treasury was north of 10%. And even in those periods of extremely high interest rates on decent shopping centers, it never went really above 10%. There was -- people felt it was an asset. They wanted a safe yield, there were benefits of depreciation, feeling there will be ultimate residual values. So historically, Michael, even if you had it now, as 10% is a long way off from 6% and 7%, what I'm trying to put in perspective, it doesn't mean that as rates run away, that cap rates will go to 13% or 14%, et cetera. And the other thing that has happened, the demand for real estate as a portion of total investments has increased. The performance of REITs compared to other common stocks has been excellent. You will not have any internal scandals. You don't have to have any global crossings. By and large, there are management's with entrepreneurs and decent track records, good characters and they do have yields. So I -- while I'm a pessimist before the Great Depression, I still feel optimistic that we're not going to revert to very high cap rates. I hope I've answered it.","David B. Henry","And I would just add that we're seeing an all-time high level of interest from life insurance companies, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds getting back, if you will, into the real estate market as they look at -- look for higher yields. There are alternatives in terms of treasuries and corporates are just so low and they're -- in many cases, insurance companies need actuarially much higher yields. So the level of interest that we've received in investing in, again high quality, is very high.","Operator","We will take our next question from Todd Lukasik with MorningStar.","Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You mentioned the role that the local market leaders have in the capital recycling program in terms of identifying assets to sell and ones to purchase. And I was just wondering if there are any sort of hard and fast targets or guidelines from corporate with regards to demographics of the markets or perhaps expected NOI growth with regard to those assets, particularly on the acquisition side or whether or not that sort of decision made on a market-by-market and asset-by-asset basis.","David B. Henry","We are trying to be more disciplined. We've identified, how many? 25 or so...","Michael V. Pappagallo","30.","David B. Henry","Core markets that's basically consistent with some of the larger MSAs and with strong demographics. So we've restricted our acquisition activity to those core markets with maybe one exception. But in general, we are going after where we have already scale, where we have presence, where we have long-term relationships and we like the long-term prognosis. With respect to what the field, in effect, is identifying to sale, there's lots of things that go into that calculation. One is whether it's in one of our core markets or not. Secondly, whether they're possibly worried about the local neighborhood or the tenant mix or the anchor tenant or so forth. It's -- they make their case about which properties they think we should sell and put into the nonstrategic bucket. And we review that. And I think, Mike, the bucket is pretty much fixed?","Michael V. Pappagallo","Right. It is fixed at this point, in terms of what we rolled out from Investor Day on forward. But one of the points that I made in my prepared remarks is that it is a continuous program. And we will -- we asked our regional leadership to continually reevaluate the markets and submarkets, their individual asset level business plan. So this \"portfolio\" will expand and contract as need be. So if you move beyond the straight white line about what's strategic, what's nonstrategic, the more important dimension to understand about where we are coming from is that recycling will be an ongoing part of the landscape going forward. We are not simply accumulating for accumulation's sake. Size does have advantages. But it's not the be-all and end-all. And we've really started to think more aggressively about how we create the optimal portfolio, not the largest portfolio.","Operator","We will take a follow-up question from Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, just a question actually about your, I think it's your fast-track leasing program. I was curious how that works if all franchisees are preapproved and maybe how much business you feel you've done as a result? And is that really what's -- is that helping your small shop leasing activity?","Michael V. Pappagallo","Yes, we've recently launched that, Jeffrey. And essentially, what we do is we -- the Kimco team reaches out to established franchisors to develop a program and get our locations preapproved based on the franchisor's criteria. Then this facilitates marketing those spaces to the prospective franchisees. So we've recently launched it. I think we have about 16 different franchise concepts that are part of the program. We are starting to see some traction in terms of access to our web page that this program links into, wherein franchising events and conferences. And we're starting to gain some traction in that regard. It's one among a whole variety of things that we have been pursuing. And almost all of these initiatives that I had mentioned before, there are coming from the ground. Deeper than that, corporate-induced programs where, say, I'm sitting here in New Hyde Park coming up with the next great idea. All of these ideas are bubbling up from our regional people who, based on the market, based on the needs, are coming up with different ideas. We test them out in maybe a market or a region. And if we like what we see, then we bring it across to the entire portfolio.","Operator","Our final question is a follow-up question from Quentin Velleley with Citi.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","One quick one. The severance payment that's being paid to Barb. How is that being treated sort of in guidance? Is that going to be a onetime thing this year? And can you just pounce on the size of the payout? I recognize she was a named executive but the size of the payout certainly was significantly in excess of when you include all the bells and whistles in there and certainly in excess of what was in the proxy, so how that sort of came about.","Glenn G. Cohen","Quentin, it will show up in the first quarter as part of a onetime nonrecurring. So we won't include it in our recurring FFO. But it will show up in the headline number and impacted there.","David B. Henry","And to just add to my remarks, we do want to acknowledge that Barb made some wonderful contributions to our company over the years that she was here specifically, in the property accounting group, Latin America. She was extremely helpful. And most of you on the call know her from her investor relations activities, which were second to none and we appreciate that. At the end of the day, they were just a number of things we didn't see eye to eye on. And we're a generous culture. And that's the form of the payment.","Operator","This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Bujnicki, I'll turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.","David F.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dave Bujnicki. Please go ahead.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Andrew. Thank you all for joining Kimco's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning is Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Pappagallo, Chief Operating Officer; Glenn Cohen, Chief Financial Officer as well as other key executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking statements. It is important to note that the company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave Henry.","David B. Henry","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We are very happy with our second quarter results as they constitute strong progress on our strategic goals and objectives. Key items are summarized in our earnings release. But I would like to provide a general high-level economical review, together with updated information on certain disposition activities.","Overall, the neighborhood and community shopping center sector continues its solid upward trend evidenced by increasing occupancies, higher effective rents and solidly positive same-store NOI growth. With virtually no new construction activity, continued population increases and a growing GDP, we are confident about the short- and intermediate-term prospects for our business and our portfolio. While retail real estate and consumer spending are vulnerable longer term to any form of economic double-dip, for now there is strong momentum among the majority of retailers as they execute expansion plans and growth strategies in the face of a shrinking supply of high-quality retail space. A recent research report notes that more than 76,000 new stores are expected to open over the next 24 months, 9% more than corresponding 2011 levels. Restaurants such as Five Guys, Subway and KFC are leading the pack, but dollar stores and discount box stores are also accelerating their store openings.","As Glenn and Mike will provide the specifics of our solid second quarter earnings and portfolio performance, I would like to anticipate several questions and provide an update on some of our key initiatives. With respect to the disposition of our InTown Suites investment, we have now executed a formal exclusivity agreement and related confidentiality document with one of the finalists in our marketing sales process. While we can provide no assurances, we are hopeful that we will enter into a formal purchase and sales agreement in the near future. Under the terms of the signed exclusivity and confidentiality agreement, this statement represents the extent of the information we are permitted to disclose at this time.","At the property level, the InTown operations continue to perform strongly across-the-board with RevPAR, occupancy and EBITDA all exceeding budget projections. In addition, the most recent Highland Group hotel industry report indicates that InTown's top line growth exceeds its economy segment competitors in almost all categories. With regard to the shopping center acquisitions and sales markets, we continue to see both increasing prices for high-quality shopping centers and a more active market with slightly higher prices for B properties and secondary markets. Both trends are encouraging signs that the retail sector is fully back in favor among all types of investors and buyers.","E-commerce is now perceived as a reduced threat as most national retailers have adopted an integrative store and Internet sales strategy, which has enhanced both aspects of their operations. In addition, there is a growing belief that the patently unfair state sales tax advantage held by e-commerce retailers is coming to a well-deserved end. The House Judiciary hearing on the Main Street Fairness legislation went well a week ago and the Senate has now scheduled a hearing on its version of the bill for August.","On behalf of all of us in the shopping center industry, we thank our shareholders and others that have lobbied hard on behalf of the Main Street Fairness legislation. This is a critically important issue for our retailers and our industry.","On another front, Glenn deserves to take an appropriate bow for taking the initiative to tap the perpetual preferred market 2 weeks ago at a record low rate. This was our second preferred stock issued this year and helps lock in long-term, low-cost capital. Under almost every measure, we have the liquidity, a strong balance sheet and the staggered debt maturities to weather any prolonged economic downturn or softness.","As a brief note on our international operations. The economies of both Canada and Mexico are strong and growing impressively with corresponding benefits to our shopping center portfolios in these countries. The recent election results in Mexico bode well, and we continue to see our U.S. retailers expand aggressively in both countries. Our project in San Juan Del Rio recently represented Home Depot's 97th store opening in Mexico.","As we move into August, we are very happy with our results. We are confident that we have strong positive momentum and that we will achieve success this year in growing our FFO, improving the profile of our shopping center portfolio and maintaining our very strong balance sheet. It is worth noting that in terms of our ongoing strengths, stability and diversity, Kimco remains the largest landlord of Costco, Home Depot, TJX, Target, Ross Stores, Walgreen and Bed Bath & Beyond, all strong investment grade companies.","Now, I would like to turn to Glenn to discuss the financial details of our second quarter, to be followed by Mike and Milton.","Glenn G. Cohen","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. The positive second quarter results are clear indicators of the execution of our strategic objectives. Once again, we have achieved positive same-site NOI growth, further improvement in occupancy and positive leasing spreads, better known as our vital signs.","Our capital recycling program is on target with the continued monetization of non-retail assets, which is now down to 3.9% of gross assets and the disposition of nonstrategic retail properties while selectively acquiring shopping centers in markets, which have long-term growth potential.","In addition, we continue to focus on further strengthening of the balance sheet and reducing our overall cost of capital. Let me provide you with some specifics. As a reminder, we are using the term FFO as adjusted to represent recurring FFO. FFO as adjusted was $0.31 per diluted share for the second quarter as compared to $0.30 last year. Headline FFO came in at $0.34 this quarter, which includes approximately $12 million of transaction income primarily related to a distribution from our Albertsons investment, an investment that keeps on giving us we have received almost 5x the original investment; and the recognition of a gain on the sale of air rights  and several promote participations.  Headline FFO last year was $0.31.","We continue to be active on the disposition and acquisition fronts. We recognize almost $9 million of non-FFO net gains from the sale of 12 shopping center assets and 2 non-retail urban assets including the sale of Montgomery Plaza, a Kimco development asset, for the formation of a new joint venture with RioCan. RioCan is the 80% partner and Kimco is the 20% partner and manager of the asset. Total proceeds from these sales were $105 million, which were quickly redeployed with the acquisition of 5 unencumbered properties and the remaining 70% interest in our Towson, Maryland property, which we previously owned 30% of for an aggregate cost of $180 million.","Our shopping center portfolio metrics continue to deliver solid results. U.S. occupancy on a pro rata basis increased 50 basis points from the first quarter level to 93.3% and up 20 basis points from the beginning of the year and 70 basis points from a year ago.","U.S. same-site NOI growth was 2.1% for the second quarter and represents the ninth consecutive quarter with positive growth for this metric. Combined same-site NOI growth, including Canada and Latin America, was 2.6% before the impact of currency which nicked the metric by 90 basis points due to the strengthening U.S. dollar, bringing the combined same-site NOI growth to 1.7%. For the 6 months, U.S. same-site NOI growth was 2.2% and the combined same-site NOI growth was 2.9% before currency impact. Overall, leasing spreads were positive at 4.5% with new lease spreads at 5.4% and renewals and options at 4.2%.","Now even with what appears to be a slowing U.S. economy, the debt markets including the bank market, unsecured and secured markets and equity markets continue to function well with new record low coupons being achieved by numerous companies as investors search the yield from high-quality companies. We are pleased with our access to over $1.5 billion of new capital raised so far this year from the unsecured bank market, the mortgage market, both CMBS and on-book lenders and the perpetual preferred equity markets. Our balance sheet metrics are strong with a consolidated net debt-to-EBITDA had adjusted up 5.6x. And if you include the transaction income, the net debt-to-EBITDA stands at 5.1x.","Also, if you pro forma the EBITDA from the $92 million of acquisitions completed in late June, the net debt-to-EBITDA would improve by another 0.2x.","Our fixed charge coverage remains solid at 2.6x including the impact of prefunding our upcoming debt maturities in November of this year for $200 million and $100 million in January of 2013 with a new $400 million term loan, which closed in April priced at LIBOR plus 105 with a term of up to 5 years. In addition, we've prefunded an anticipated redemption of our $460 million 7 3\/4% perpetual preferred issuance, which becomes redeemable on October 2012 with a new $400 million 6% preferred issuance, which was completed in March, and most recently in July completed a new $225 million perpetual preferred issuance at 5 1\/2%, which is believed to be the lowest coupon ever for this type of security.","We are using a portion of the proceeds to redeem our $175 million, 6.65% preferred issuance on August 15. Please keep in mind that the dilution associated with the term loan and the preferred issuances will have a $0.03 impact for the full year 2012. However, once the redemptions are complete, the annual savings will be approximately $11 million annually and provide further reduction of our fixed charge costs.","As a result of these activities, our liquidity position is in excellent shape with over $380 million of cash on hand at the end of the second quarter and over $1.7 billion available on our revolving credit facility.","As noted in the press release last night, we anticipate declaring our quarterly common and preferred dividends on or about August 15. The timing is to ensure technical compliance on the Maryland law as we consider the redemption of our 7 3\/4% Class G preferred stock, which becomes redeemable on October 10, 2012.","Lastly, we are pleased to increase the low end of our FFO as adjusted guidance from $1.22 to $1.24, thus narrowing our FFO as adjusted guidance range to $1.24 to $1.26 even with the $0.03 dilution from the pre-fundings previously mentioned. The FFO per share guidance does not include transaction income or expenses or noncash charges for the redemption of preferred stock. Our guidance assumptions do include achieving combined same-site NOI growth ranging from 1.5% to 3.5% and increasing combined portfolio occupancy for the year of 50 to 100 basis points and a further reduction of our non-retail due to the continued monetization of those assets.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mike for a review of the operating portfolio.","Michael V. Pappagallo","Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone. At the midyear point, I'm pleased to report that the portfolio vital signs remain strong and continue to reflect the momentum in the shopping center fundamentals over the past couple of years.","Occupancy has picked up noticeably from the prior quarter, the consequence of both positive net absorption and portfolio recycling efforts. The occupancy levels are at their highest point since the fourth quarter of 2008, underscoring the improved supply and demand dynamics for space.","In the U.S. portfolio, occupancy levels for anchors, using space over 10,000 square foot as the definition, remained robust at 96.3%. But more significantly, we made big improvements in the small space leasing with a 1% uplift in the occupancy level to 83.3%.","Leasing spreads remain in the right direction. And while we weren't as high as the 10% combined number from the first quarter, we've been running positive for 6 quarters now.","Same-site NOI, as I mentioned, showed another positive result at 2.1% for the U.S. and 1.7% overall, with the aggregate numbers being influenced down by the FX. But similar to last quarter, the NOI growth numbers do reflect the drag from the temporary loss in rents from the former Borders and A&P boxes with roughly a 60 basis point effect. Of the 22 boxes vacated by Borders and A&P during their prospective bankruptcy processes, we now have re-leased 17 with a composite 3% spread. And these replacement deals will start to positively influence the NOI metrics over the next few quarters.","Our non-U.S. operations also have continued to achieve its growth objectives when analyzed on a local currency basis. The Latin America portfolio is about 8% ahead of plan so far and it's 15% over last year's numbers in terms of NOI contribution. The big push, however, remains the leasing plans for the next 6 months as we're about halfway to our 800,000-square foot leasing goal. Canada remains a solid performer with occupancies remaining at 96.5% and same-site NOI growth at 3.8% for the 6-month period in local currency terms.","Moving beyond the operating results. I thought I'd make a brief comment on Kimco's exposure to SUPERVALU, considering the recent unfavorable news coming from the supermarket chain. We currently have 27 leases in the portfolio across all of the SUPERVALU banners, which represent just under 1% of base rates. Most of these sites are valuable supermarket locations, and 2\/3 of the current leases are at rates we feel are at or below market. Notwithstanding SUPERVALU'S announced pursuit of strategic alternatives, we do not see a short-term issue for us.","So while we keep a watchful eye on the SUPERVALU situation, I'd also point out a couple of other positive developments within our tenant universe.","The completion of the acquisition of Cost Plus by Bed Bath & Beyond gives them a new avenue for growth and it's certainly a benefit to the 17 locations of Cost Plus in the Kimco portfolio. Similarly, the acquisition of Charming Shoppes by Ascena Group not only expands the Ascena customer base but will cast a different light on Charming Shoppes' strategy to close its fashion bug unit. Although those store closures will take -- still take place next year, as a landlord it's much better to work through any store closing and lease mitigation issues with a strong retailer with whom you have a broad relationship with.","And positioning is always much more manageable when you have a better inventory of real estate to work with, which brings me to our recycling activities.","While our disposition levels are not necessarily headline-grabbing, I'd like to reinforce a few statistics on the recycling efforts in the past 18 months. We have sold more assets than we have bought in terms of numbers; 63 versus 42, but have acquired larger properties, and as a result, had a net addition to GLA of about 125,000 square feet. The assets bought were 93.8% occupied. The assets sold were 80.9% occupied. Average rent of property sold, $9.35; of acquired, $13.60. And while populations were roughly on par, the average household incomes of the acquired properties were almost 30% higher. Bottom line is that there has been a real impact on the portfolio base from these activities. We estimate that the properties acquired, since late 2010, now represent a bit under 6% of the U.S. shopping center gross asset value.","The other piece of the recycling effort is putting money back into the strategic portfolio base. The basic profile of our shopping center portfolio is large with wide spread of risk across a variety of markets. So, too, is our investment activity. While there aren't any 9-figure, high-execution risk projects, there are a wide series projects that provide solid returns and limited risks to enhance cash flow and asset valuation. In addition to the active projects disclosed in the supplement, we have an ongoing pipeline of opportunities, either in the entitlement phase or under valuation. It represents about 15 different properties that can launch within the next 2 to 3 years with rough spend of about $250 million. They include our centers in Live Oak and Altamonte Springs in Florida, the Owings Mills project in Maryland, a potential new center in Delaware and our center in Cupertino, California directly across from the main access point of Apple's planned new corporate headquarters.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton for some final comments.","Milton Cooper","Well, thanks, Mike. We have reason to be proud of our ability to withstand headwinds and improve our core metrics in a soft economy. Notwithstanding these uncertain times, we've strengthened our portfolio, we have divested non-core assets, acquired high-quality assets in tough MSAs and focused on generating higher recurring FFO and creating value.","One question on everyone's mind is where is the market going from here? Four years ago, we were at the onset of a strong rally in corporate bonds. Investment grade corporate bonds yielded as high as 9.5% in October of 2008. Since then, yields have plummeted. Corporate BAA yields are below 4.8%. Real estate is, above all, an income-oriented investment, and cap rates are tied at the hip to interest rates. This is just one of the factors hinting at further cap rate compression. Lack of new development in our sector is another. The thirst for yield is in August. Just from a purely income-based perspective, real estate and REITs should be beneficiaries in the current environment.","Looking at Kimco in particular, we have a conservative dividend payout ratio of 61% of recurring flows, one of the lowest in our sector. So we believe our dividend is safe and strong.","I would like to add an interesting fact that some might not realize. At the end of the year, the much talked about fiscal cliff is looming, the Bush tax cuts will expire and unless some agreement is reached, the dividend tax rate will increase. Currently, ordinary dividends from a REIT are not afforded the special low tax rate of 15% enjoyed by many investors in non-REIT corporations. Ordinary dividends received from a REIT would, therefore, not be affected by the dividend tax increase. So it seems that on a relative basis, the corporations REITs could become even more attractive from an after-tax income perspective. We will continue to monetize our non-retail assets. We will continue to take advantage of unique situations, such as distressed retailers with good real estate and similar opportunities.","Now every 4 years, we're just amazed at the performance of the world's best athletes competing during the Olympic Games. Looking at our business, our team of real estate athletes are trained and are prepared to achieve superior performance as well. We are back to our basic retail real estate core expertise and focusing on growing our property cash flow and creating value. Our team is doing great work in accomplishing these objectives.","And now, we'd be delighted to answer any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Christy McElroy of UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Given the attractive terms with what you've been able to issue your most recent preferred, would you expect to do another deal this year? And has your philosophy changed at all in terms of how you would structure your balance sheet going forward, or do you plan to sort of keep the same balance of debt and preferred?","Glenn G. Cohen","I don't see us doing another deal this year, Christy. We have taken care of what we think we can do so far. We've prefunded our debt maturities that are coming up. It's a very well-spread maturity profile. But the program of continuing to try and modestly produce leverage and bring our net debt-to-recurring EBITDA into that mid-5x range, no higher than 6, is where we want to target. So we're just going to continue on the path we've been on.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm looking Pages 30 and 31 of the supplemental. I'm just wondering if you could comment on the negative leasing trends in Latin America as well as the shorter lease term relative to Canada and the U.S.?","David B. Henry","Well, I'll take a quick stab at Latin America. There are still some residual effects from, call it, the Great Recession in terms of local rents rolling down a little bit from some of the very high levels we had. But the sample is small. The actual number of leases you have to look at is small. And the underlying trends are strong. The retailers have resumed their expansion. We're seeing lots of demand. And what's encouraging is the small shops just like the U.S., are coming back in Mexico. So we expect over time that, that will reverse. In Canada, it's all good. Some of the -- again, we have a smaller sample up there than we do in the U.S. so I wouldn't take away any distinct trends in terms of the shorter leases up there. The demand is strong.","Michael V. Pappagallo","Craig, I would just add that, to echo Dave's point about Mexico, it is a small sample size. Mexico still has very strong positive same-store NOI because leasing in absolute terms, coupled with the annual cost-of-living adjustment on existing tenants more than outweighs some small negative leasing spread for a small sample. I'd also say that, overall, these terms are a little bit shorter. I think that reflects the changing composition of the new leases signed whereas historically there's been more anchors. Now, we're getting more small space leased up and those terms are generally smaller -- shorter. So you're going to see the average terms of lease shorten up a bit as we fill up the small spaces.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You talked about the disposition market getting a little bit easier as the demand for some of the secondary market assets improves. I mean, a couple of things, would you consider accelerating your volumes of sales into strength as it grows? And then, second, what kind of cap rates are you seeing for those assets relative to the core that you're buying?","David B. Henry","I think you have seen the company accelerate its disposition activities. We are being very deliberate, and we're committed to selling these lower-tiered assets and we are heartened by the fact that the market is improving for these lower-tier assets. I think it's because so many people have tried to buy the higher quality and there's just so many bidders that they're forced to go down a notch in terms of the markets to get their -- to get retail today. So we are seeing cap rates improve a little bit even in the secondary markets, which is good. So we're committed to it. And we have accelerated it over time. And we are trying to take advantage of the decline in the market to do it. Conversely, we are trying to be very careful about what we buy and make sure it's the better stuff and we're trying to do as many off-market situations as we can. So you'll continue to see us do this recycling activity.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I think this is the first quarter you guys have broken out same store with and without the impact of FX. Can you just talk a little bit about your view of FX? How you -- given the odd situation that the dollar finally seems to be strengthening, how you think about your overseas operations? And then also, what the per-share impact is from the appreciation of the dollar?","David B. Henry","Well, I'll just take a very high level. As you probably know, in Canada, we're pretty effectively hedged between both the Canadian mortgage we have that are in Canadian dollar terms and the equity we've invested has been in the form of Canadian dollar-denominated bonds. So the investment, itself, in Canada is pretty well hedged although the income is not so. We're subject to fluctuations there. Mexico is a little different because we have very few mortgages although we do have some Mexico peso mortgages. And we have a relatively modest peso line of credit that we have used to fund some of the equity. But in Mexico, we are relying in large measure on the cost-of-living increases that are built in every single lease in Mexico. So since 40% of the income does come from strong tenants like Wal-Mart and Home Depot, we can pretty much count on that. So to the extent the peso weakens, it's generally because inflation has picked up and we do get a corresponding offset in terms of the revenues. So I think we're pretty well hedged long term.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","And what about the per share impact of the appreciation of the dollar?","Glenn G. Cohen","It's fairly modest, Alex. Because to Dave's point, in Canada, we are naturally hedged so you have more interest expense as depending on which way the dollar goes, there's the income goes so they kind of offset each other. Mexico, again, has a little bit more of an impact. But on an overall basis, it's relatively modest.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Dave, just want to go back to your comments about the value improvement in B properties or secondary markets. Is the compression in the 10-year treasury that we've seen since the end of last quarter, do think, contributing to lenders looking to step out the yields factor and then maybe get a little more aggressive on advanced rates for those markets and that's, I guess I'd say, the ultimate catalyst there for that segment? Or do you actually think B property fundamentals are beginning look better than A property fundamentals for people?","David B. Henry","I would say both, I would say both. Clearly, there's a thirst for yield. People are just tired of sitting on cash. Real estate, especially good decent real estate, remains an inflation hedge on one hand and a cash-yielding asset that exceeds all kinds of alternatives from treasuries to corporate bonds. So real estate is increasingly in favor. Retail is one of the established food groups, if you will, for all kinds of investors. And there is a frustration in terms of a limited supply of truly high-quality retail in primary markets. So just like every other cycle, it has now moved downwards towards the B properties. It's interesting to look at a country like Canada where the cap rates are much more compressed than here in the U.S. The difference between the As and Bs and the Cs is much more compressed than here and I think you'll eventually see the U.S. move towards that same sort of situation where cap rates will begin to move more together.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And you're seeing retailer demand extend out into the B markets at this point?","David B. Henry","Yes, by necessity as there's a shrinking supply of stores that are having to take a harder look at stuff that they passed up. There are so many good national retailers that are committed to increasing their store count. And there's this critical momentum to these expansion plans that they're forced to look at all kinds of alternatives. And they want immediate occupancy. They don't want to go back in the old days of wait 3 or 4 or 5 years for a new development project to get entitled and get built and so forth. So they are taking a harder look at boxes they didn't look at before.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Rosivach of Goldman Sachs.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm just on your guidance detail page and it looks like the biggest piece of it that went up was the non-retail component. And I'm just curious is that related to InTown timing because the transaction is getting done later than you might have anticipated?","Glenn G. Cohen","Correct. It is, Andrew. When we came out with our original guidance, we had incorporated selling it by the end of the third quarter. So we've built in the last quarter. It's the bulk of it.","Andrew Leonard Rosivach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So and just to follow up on that, should we assume most of the full $0.04 of dilution is incrementally going to happen in '13 or is some of it going to happen this year?","David B. Henry","In terms of losing InTown, yes, you're right. Most of it will occur. We think this asset will remain effectively on our books this year because even if we started the closing process tomorrow, there are mortgages to be just assumed, and by definition, that always takes a while.","Operator","Next question comes from Nate Isbee of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Mike, as you look at the recent progress in the small shop occupancy side, is there any meaningful trends that you can point to that the small shop gains you're experiencing are stronger at centers where you recently refilled vacant boxes, or would you say that the improvement is more broad-based?","Michael V. Pappagallo","I would say it's more broad-based. Now clearly, Nate, to the extent we filled an anchor, that always has a positive effect. But I think more than anything, we've seen a lot of traction in our generally stronger geographic markets. We've also seen an increased demand as we've talked about in earlier calls from the national retailers, franchise concepts, et cetera that are filling the space. The markets for a true mom-and-pop demand is so somewhat tepid and that is also very geographic-focused. So I would sum it in saying that it's been a broad-based improvement, but clearly a bias towards the stronger geographic markets. Now, the 1% occupancy increase in the small stores, about 60 basis points of that was due to absorption and 40 basis points was due to our recycling efforts, getting rid of properties that had structural and chronic vacancies that we felt would not -- never lease up or not lease up for the foreseeable future.","Operator","The next question comes from Quentin Velleley of Citi.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just in terms of some of the stress that we're seeing in this value supermarkets or grocers, do you think you could see opportunities emerge similar to your experience with Albertsons? And if an opportunity did emerge, would partaking in something be consistent with your current strategy?","Milton Cooper","The answer is absolutely yes on both. There will be opportunities. The conventional supermarket has strained from the warehouse clubs that are 70% food, from Wal-Mart superstores, from the specialty retailers such as Whole Foods. From all these, there is just avalanche of new users and wherever there is a retail that's distress with strong real estate, that's been our strong suit for a long time. So the answers is an unequivocal yes.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And do you think that's something more near-term or is it something that'll transpire in sort of 2 or 3 years' time?","Milton Cooper","I think there's a good possibility it would be near term.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just going back to the B class and secondary market commentaries. Are there particular secondary markets that are noticeably improving, and then are there ones that you can point to specifically?","David B. Henry","Well, let me go back to one of the questions that was asked about cap rates on these B markets. I think it's a very broad range and it depends on how secondary or tertiary the markets are. But we're seeing cap rates range from 8% to 10% on these kinds of markets. And what's interesting to me, there are markets, let's just take a Jacksonville, Florida, which are not perceived to be gateway cities or 24-hour cities or \"primary markets\" that a lot of the institutions would look at. But we would consider that a very solid B market and there is a bit of an arbitrage today between the cap rates on equal quality shopping center in Jacksonville versus perhaps Long Island, New York metro markets. So that would be one example. Now if you go all the way to the other end of the spectrum, to Huntsville, Alabama or something like that, that would be considered a pretty tertiary market and have not much appeal to the institutions. There may be local buyers that believe they can make something happen to that asset and create great cash flow. So as we sell our B properties, depending on the market, we're selling a lot to local investors that aren't concerned about how secondary or tertiary that market is. They like the cash flow and their local people. They believe they can make something happen with these assets.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Following up on the small shop occupancy increase. When you look out over the next 12 to 18 months, what do you think the goal is, or what can you achieve in terms of ramping that up more? It sounds like it was 60 basis points this quarter. I mean, where can that go to?","Michael V. Pappagallo","Mike, I've been doing this too long to predict things 12 to 18 months out. We would like to get the occupancy up to an 85-plus percent level within the next 12 months. But a lot of things need to happen so I can't -- I really don't want to make that a prediction. I think the big part of it is where the economy goes in the short term. There has been a slowdown. That doesn't certainly mean it's going to go in reverse, but the timing and the relative demand of small shop leasing, certainly the backbone is the strength of the economy. So we'll see where that takes us.","David B. Henry","I mean the trend line is good. We feel good about the short-term trend line. We, like the rest of the world, worry about everything from Europe to the fiscal cliff and so forth, so we're very reluctant to give you a prediction. But on the ground, we are feeling good. Our leasing people are feeling good, and our regional presidents are feeling good about what's happening short term.","Operator","The next question comes from Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just going back to Mexico. When I look at the development schedule for Mexico or what's left pending stabilization, do you think you can reach the same levels of occupancy in these projects as you have in the rest of your portfolio, or is there anything in this project where you think that stabilization is going to be a lower number?","David B. Henry","No, I do think over time you are going to see the basket of properties we have a Mexico achieve comparable levels to the U.S. These are generally very high quality properties. Unfortunately, they were developed at the top of the cycle, if you will, and they've been a little bit slow to lease up and some of the structural items that happened in Mexico have slowed it down from an international retailer perspective. But it's all green signs for the moment, as I mentioned, in my comments. People like Home Depot have resumed strongly their expansion plans and we're seeing improvement on the small shops now. The Mexican economy is over 4% GDP growth. Unemployment is very low. Manufacturing is very strong. It's got great oil revenues. Believe it or not, tourism is still doing well there. And the election is now behind them. Every 6 years people hold their breath in Mexico and now that's behind them, so retailers are much more confident about making plans. And our leasing people in Mexico also feel very good today about some of the leases they have pending and some of the retailers that they're working with to expand. And as I mentioned before, when you're dealing with a market of 100 million-plus people and only 1,000 shopping centers versus the U.S. with 300 million-plus people and 100,000 shopping centers, it's just a different dynamic. But there's every reason to believe that, over time, the occupancy will achieve the U.S. level. And then we will see better than normal growth because of the CPI increase that's built into even the anchor leases.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to go back again to the Canadian same-store NOI. I realize that the foreign exchange had an impact, but seemed weak for the quarter even when that's taken into account, and I'm curious if the Canadian economy softening is part of that. And then also, the transactional income seem to be in Canada and I'm curious what that was.","David B. Henry","Well, let me take the latter first because it's something we're particularly proud of. It's the sales on air rights that was done in our RioCan joint venture actually 4 years ago. We just needed the cash 4 years ago and some of conditions precedent to booking that income we were able to get done this quarter. So I think it was $5 million or $6 million in term of an air right sale in Canada orchestrated by our friends at RioCan. So that was the primary driver of the transaction income in Canada, although we did, I think, we got some income on some other things and then we got Albertsons in the U.S. so -- but in terms of Canada, I think there was a little bit of other income out there as well. Honestly, it's a smaller sample in Canada, as we mentioned, but we don't see any real slowdown there particularly among the U.S. retailer demand for space in Canada. People like Marshalls and you just read about Lowe's making a major move to expand in Canada. These things are driving some good things in Canada. And as you know, it has about 1\/2 the retail space per capita that the U.S. had. The economy of Canada is strong and so forth. So underlying some perhaps noise in some specific leases that might have rolled down or something like that, the underlying fundamentals of Canada are strong. I don't think we've ever been below 97% aggregate occupancy in Canada. So it's -- we still feel very good about it. We have converted a couple of preferred equity investments into long-term joint ventures and some of those projects, I think, had a little bit lower occupancy and perhaps some of the leases are a little bit less than some of the RioCan leases. But in general, we -- honestly, we don't see any clouds up there at all.","Operator","The next question comes from Samit Parikh of ISI.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Back to Mexico real quick. Fibra UNO recently did a pretty large transaction, I think it was valued at about [indiscernible]. Based on sort of what they're doing out there, does this entice you at all for an exit strategy in Mexico anytime in the near term?","David B. Henry","It certainly entices us to take a hard look at valuations in Mexico and look at possible ways to create value for our shareholders over time. The Fibra UNO transaction, as you know, is little bit complicated in terms of it's multi-property type. There was some development assets in that. So it's a little bit tougher to get a good handle on the exact net cap rate, if you will. But we're looking at it. I think that's a fair thing to say.","Operator","The next question comes from Tom [indiscernible] of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unknown Analyst","Glenn, you made some comments about where your balance sheet stands and you guys have obviously made some good progress on getting to your targeted balance sheet. Any comments about -- you guys have targeted debt-to-EBITDA. Any comments on debt plus preferred to EBITDA and how you kind of manage that part of the balance sheet?","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, again, we've had preferred, perpetual preferred as a component of our balance sheet for a long time. I think the way you we see it now is it's going to stand at around $800 million. We don't really expect to increase it much more. We've kind of used it as a somewhere at around 10% of our balance sheet, of our capital structure being in the preferred component. So we'll try and keep it around that level. The metric, though, even the net debt plus preferred to EBITDA, if you look at that metric, it has come down quite a bit as well over these last couple of years. So we do watch it in total. But we look at that metric. We look at fixed charge coverage, which continues to improve as well. And I think you're going to see much further improvement next year as we get the benefit of the refinancing of these 2 preferreds, I mean we're going to save at $11...","Unknown Analyst","EBITDA growth from the acquisitions, too, right, so yes, I definitely understand that. And any comments on obviously the 5.5% execution was very good perpetual capital. But you guys have now done 2 sets of preferreds and term loan rather than unsecured bonds. Any commentary on the relative attractiveness of those types of capital versus unsecured bonds?","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, at the time we did our term loan, our term loan was priced at the time probably 120 basis points tighter than what we could have done in the unsecured bond market, which is why we went that route. The preferred that we've done are really refinancings of much more expensive preferreds, right? We have one that's 7 3\/4%, one that was at 6.55%. So we brought them down to 6% and 5 1\/2%.  So those are just straight refinancings that way we look at them. The unsecured bond market more recently has tightened. You've seen deals that are getting done 40, 50 and 60 basis points through their secondaries. So it's a market we constantly watch and we always try to be opportunistic. So we'll continue to watch and if it makes sense, we would tap it.","Operator","Next question comes from David Harris of Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Milton, you mentioned the [indiscernible] fiscal cliff. Capital gains would go from 15 to 24 or more, plus or minus. I wonder if that's animating any of your potential sellers of property? And more generally, are you aware that fiscal cliff considerations are causing anybody to sort of hold back from signing long leases or commit to investments on -- through your joint venture programs?","Milton Cooper","No. Insofar -- first, let me take the latter part first. There are sellers who are very worried where tax rates will be next year. And they feel this is the last shot that they have at the lower capital gains, right? So how much we'll be able to get in year-end closings, I don't know. But we're certainly trying to be fast on our footwork to accomplish opportunistic purchases is one of the reasons Glenn has kept the balance sheet so strong. Insofar as the retailers are concerned, I don't think -- they must expand. Just imagine retailers depend on people working in the stores and those people are the ones who deal with their customers and if the retailer is stagnant, it's going to lose its best people. You wouldn't want a sister or a relative to be working in the store where there'll be no opportunity to become an assistant manager as they grow stores managers. So if retailers do not expand, they -- it's a self-fulfilling prophecy about losing good people. So I don't see the capital gains or the tax issues as an inhibition on moving forward with new stores.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Any comments on investors' inability to underwrite after-tax returns?","Milton Cooper","I happen to believe, over time, tax returns are a factor, but people still want to have yield. I remember when there was an excess profit tax and taxes were as much as 90%, people still want to invest to get the other 10%. They will look at relative opportunities. And with yields as anemic as they are, real estate and cap rates have a very large spread, historically high spread between 10-year treasuries and cap rates. So I think the demand will increase.","Operator","The next question comes from Christy McElroy of UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One of the most common themes we hear in support of continuing strength and fundamental trends is lack of new supply growth. But as you mentioned earlier, Kimco's starting to pick up redevelopment and development activity as are most of your peers on the margin. I'm wondering at one point the increase in construction sort of extends beyond the REITs who again seems to be doing it at a relatively judicious pace, but at what point could it sort of accelerate from there given that there's free yields that's out there and the fundamental strengthening that we've seen? And the second part of that question is what are you and your peers sort of doing differently this time around, if anything, to try to avoid some of the oversupply issues in certain types of space that we faced a few years ago, whether it's at the project level or investing where certain criteria are met?","David B. Henry","First of all, there's just a huge difference between expanding an existing shopping center or building out some land that you already have in your inventory versus, call it, the prerecession days when people would buy 100 acres of land and spend the next 5 to 10 years getting it zoned and then titled and fighting off the environmentalists and then working with major anchor tenants to do pre-leasing and then arranging for construction financing and equity financing and so forth. The retailers do not have the patience for that anymore. A lot of them got caught up in bankruptcies and half completed development deals. Secondly, the economics are tough. Rents haven't recovered enough to really justify a significant amount of new construction. On an incremental basis, where you already own the land, where you already own the center, it's much easier to make the numbers work. So you will see the redevelopment activity pick up a little bit, but it's nowhere close to the addition to supply that we saw in the old days, if you will. And it's going to keep demand higher than addition to supply, I think, for quite a while. Now it's hard to say at all it won't come back at some point, and I'm sure it will, because everything's is cyclical. But the old days of buying these big sites and adding millions of square feet to new supply, which by the way, was somewhat dependent upon growing housing and we're probably a long way away from the growth in housing or \"rooftops\" again to justify all that. So I think you're going to see limited supply for quite a while.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the portfolio leasing detail that's on, I think, it's Page 25 and 26 of the supplemental. The square footages decline across your 8 investment management portfolios over the last several quarters and as you sold off assets, the in-place average space rent has also declined as well. I think in the most recent quarter, it's something like 6 or 8 of the portfolios were flat or down Q2 versus Q1. I know there may be a lot going on beneath the surface, but is that decline in average rent just is a function of rents rolling down the market over the last several quarters, or could it stem from selling off the higher rent, higher-quality assets in those portfolios?","David B. Henry","Well, we'll give you one great example. We bought out our partner on Towson Place. This was a very high quality asset with very, very high rents and so forth so we've taken that out of the investment management business, if you will, and it's on balance sheet. We haven't sold it off at all. So I think there are situations where we have bought out our partners on the very high-quality stuff. But I don't think anything dramatically different is going on in the investment management portfolio than our general portfolio. And in general, many of these joint ventures have very high quality properties and so perhaps you do have some top of the market rents that rolled down a bit. But we're very happy, generally, with the quality of what we have in the investment management business.","Michael V. Pappagallo","And Jeff, I think the tagline is that the investment management program in terms of -- have been relatively stable in terms of their composition with some movement out like the Towson example and the rents have moved a little, the average rents, but not something which would detect a fundamental shift in the underlying quality or composition of the portfolio. In one particular portfolio where there was a little bit more meaningful shift down in the average rent, it did have to do, to Dave's point, with particularly roll down as that portfolio has a concentration of properties in the Las Vegas and Reno markets.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I recognize this is a very small part of the company, but you have a pretty small total hold in countries like Peru and Brazil and even arguably Chile. And those markets aren't necessarily as deep as the U.S. either, but how do you guys think about the benefit or operating in those -- operating those properties versus the cost of operating in those countries and your ability to grow your platform over time because it's been quite some time that you've really had pretty steady base in those markets.","David B. Henry","Well, you're right. We have less than 20 total properties in 3 countries at all. What we have has been successful. In Chile, in particular, where we have, I think, 15 properties they've been very successful for us; Peru, we have 2; and Brazil, we have 2. So it's a foothold. It's been a place cardholder coming out of the recession, if you will, as we concentrated on Mexico. I think the challenge for us from our shareholders, from our board, from Milton is prove the case in Mexico. Get what you have in Mexico leased up, have it produce wonderful FFO earnings, and if that indeed happens, then perhaps we can expand what we have already -- the seeds we have planted in South America. But it's fair to say our focus and our concentration today is on Mexico and making that a very profitable part of the total portfolio that we have.","Operator","The next question comes from Quentin Velleley of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's actually Michael Bilerman speaking. I just want to come back just in terms of sort of the portfolio acquisitions and dispositions and tie it a little bit to Milton's comment about investors' thirst for yield being enormous. And it would appear as though if you look at the transaction activity, especially more recently, that more is being done with Kimco's own capital on balance sheet rather than with joint venture partners. And I'm just curious if investors have this enormous thirst for yield, why aren't you using that capital more in terms of the existing investors that you have or seeking new investors for funds versus potentially levering up a little bit and taking more assets on balance sheet relative to the assets that you're selling.","David B. Henry","Well, first of all, we have had the balance sheet capacity to buy for our own account, if you will. So as we have found good high-quality acquisition, we have put them on our books. And as we have sold assets, both nonstrategic retail asset and our non-core asset, we've had capital coming into the shop, if you will. So rather than needing institutional capital, we've been able to use our own capital. That is not to say, over time, we will go back to some of our very valued partners and help us acquire a very competitively priced asset because to Milton's point, as cap rates continue to decline, we may need to tap the pension funds and the life company to be competitive because some of those cap rates are getting very, very low. But for now, you are right. We are buying more on our own balance sheet than needing institutional capital.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And maybe Mike, can you just clarify. You talked about all the acquisitions relative to dispositions in your opening comments and you gave us some of the stats about base rents and occupancy and trade areas. Can you just comment on what the cap rate that you bought, the $900 million, and the cap rate that you sold, $360 million, just so we get a sense of spread and...","Michael V. Pappagallo","Yes, I think, Michael, the rough number averages out to about 6.9% cap rate on the acquisition and 9% on the disposition. I think those are good numbers to use for your financial analysis. And the one comment I'd make on the dispositions. We've talked a lot in this conference call about B properties, I would submit that many of the assets we sold in this first rush would qualify as C properties. So it's very different type of asset and even in good -- Milton's saying they're even D properties. So put that in perspective as I give you those cap rates.","David B. Henry","And before you compute the math on the dilution, Michael, remember some of the non-retail assets that we have sold, some of our urban properties, as an example, were totally nonearning so we sold them at effectively 0 cap rate and that capital comes back into the equation, if you will.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. I don't think it's even in the 365. I think you've sold more than that as you liquidated like the Valad stake and everything else, that you've netted more proceeds from your disposition program.","Michael V. Pappagallo","That is correct. And again, the statistics I've given you reflect the sum total of the activity, which goes back to September of 2010 as we've got the more recent transactions, obviously the cap rates have trended lower, versus those that we acquired late in 2010. Again, just a reflection of the marketplace, but it does average out to the numbers I provided to you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Harris of Imperial Capital.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Sorry, if I missed this, but your cash leasing spreads in the quarter were up 4.5% compares to a 10% spread in first quarter. Is that just a mix question?","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes. It just reflects back in the first quarter, we had an unduly large 40% new leasing spread driven by the Target taking over an old Kmart lease in Staten Island, New York, so that obviously averages way up in that first quarter.","David Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","So 4.5% is more your run rate number?","Glenn G. Cohen","As we've generally talked about, a mid-single digit leasing spread in this environment to be a good run rate absent any more significant macro issues. There'll be pluses and minuses every quarter as there always are, but trend lines, I think, second quarter reflects where we are as a portfolio.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And any comment on CapEx, leasing CapEx, is that sort of pretty much running at similar?","Glenn G. Cohen","It remains relatively consistent actually this year on -- slightly lower than the first half of last year, but again it was nothing that implies any structural shift in dealmaking.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Bujnicki for any closing remarks.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Andrew, and to everybody that participated on our call today.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Bujnicki, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Yusef. Thank you all for joining Kimco's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning are Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Cohen, our Chief Financial Officer; Conor Flynn, our Chief Operating Officer; as well as other key executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking statements. It is important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","And finally, during the Q&A portion of the call, we request that you respect the limit of one question so all of our callers have an opportunity to speak with management. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave Henry.","David B. Henry","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report a very strong and eventful second quarter. In addition to solid financial results, we've made excellent progress on many of our long-standing key goals and objectives.","First, let me officially welcome and introduce Conor Flynn, our Chief Operating Officer. To those on the call who may not have met Conor over the years, Conor has now passed his 10-year anniversary with Kimco in a wide variety of regional operating roles, most recently as President of the Western region. Conor brings to the senior team a wealth of field experience, including leasing, property management, construction, asset management, redevelopment, acquisitions and dispositions. Conor is a proven manager and leader, and we are very happy to have him join us here in New Hyde Park. Giving up sunny, seasonal and exotic San Francisco to relocate to New York shows Conor's dedication and commitment to Kimco. I encourage everyone who has not met Conor to spend some time with him as opportunities arise at industry events, analyst roadshows or property tours.","Glenn will provide financial details for the quarter this morning. But in general, we are very pleased across the board in terms of exceeding our income projections and delivering very strong operating metrics.","Overall, our industry maintains its quarter-by-quarter recovery. Retailers continue to grow their expansion plans and, coupled with a 35-year low in new supply, effective rents are moving up materially. Consumer spending and retail sales are also doing well despite the sequester and the beginning of rising interest rates.","The annual ICSC meeting in late May in Las Vegas was very positive, with attendance up significantly and a net increase of 100 exhibitors in the convention hall. Planned new store openings continue at a 5-year high, and most retailers remain optimistic about 2013.","In retrospect, and with full credit to Glenn, our timing on our $350 million 10-year bond was wonderful, and we were also very happy with the 7-year $200 million Canadian bond we issued 2 weeks ago. The new Kimco bonds, together with last year's preferred stock offerings and our steady stream of mortgage refinancings, have created substantial interest rate savings for years to come.","During the quarter, we also achieved several important milestones. Permit us a small celebratory dance as we note the final closing of the InTown sale, which, together with a large number of other nonretail property sales, results in a current total of nonretail assets of approximately $180 million, representing approximately 1.5% of our total assets.","We truly believe that the nonretail aspect of the company is now almost completely behind us, and our energies can be totally focused on delivering strong operating metrics and significant improvements in the demographics and profile of our high-quality retail property portfolio. We're committed to continuing our recycling efforts whereby low-quality, secondary market assets will be sold and replaced with high-quality properties in our core primary markets. Our scorecard to date, selling 121 properties since December 2010, totaling approximately $900 million, while concurrently adding 66 properties, totaling approximately $1.5 billion, reflects our commitment to this ongoing program to upgrade our portfolio.","With respect to Latin America, we closed on the previously announced sale of Kimco's interest in a portfolio of 9 shopping centers in Mexico for a gross sales price of $274 million. In addition, the pending sale of our industrial portfolio in Mexico to Terrafina for $600 million remains on track, with Terrafina shareholders voting to approve the transaction on June 17.","As a final note, we also sold our interest in 9 of our 16 South American properties last week to Patio, our primary operating partner in Chile, for a gross sales price of $50.2 million, which includes existing debt of $35 million and a solid gain. We anticipate the remaining 7 South American assets will be sold by year end, 5 of which are currently under agreement.","The second quarter was also noteworthy with respect to the purchase of a number of properties and joint venture equity interests from existing institutional partners. The previously announced purchase of UBS Wealth Management's equity interest by a new Blackstone\/Kimco joint venture was completed based on a gross purchase price of $1.1 billion and a nice accretive cap rate.","During the quarter, we also acquired essentially full ownership of 2 large properties, Marketplace at Factoria and Canyon Square Plaza, from existing joint venture partners for a gross purchase price of $146 million, while also increasing our ownership stake in both the Kimco Income REIT, KIR, and the Kimco Income Fund, KIF. As Milton has noticed -- had noted before, our large joint venture portfolio represents a reservoir of opportunities to acquire high-quality properties on a negotiated basis, whereby we benefit from having managed and leased the properties for many years and being able to easily assume any existing debt.","Now I would like to turn to Glenn to discuss the financial details for the quarter, to be followed by Conor's in-depth discussion of our U.S. portfolio results. And then Milton will, as usual, bat clean-up with several general observations and trends.","Glenn G. Cohen","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Our positive second quarter results are a continuation and testament to the strategy we articulated and have been executing since our 2010 Investor Day. The quarterly results are highlighted by solid operating metrics, the monetization of the nonretail assets and further capital recycling. We have used the proceeds toward the acquisition of higher-quality assets and joint venture interests. In addition, we continue to reduce our cost of capital and maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and access to capital. Let me provide some detail around the quarter.","As a reminder, we continue to use the term FFO as adjusted to represent recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expense and nonoperating impairments. Headline FFO represents the official NAREIT definition.","As we reported last night, headline FFO and FFO as adjusted came in at $0.35 each per diluted share, up from $0.34 for headline FFO last year and $0.31 for FFO as adjusted last year, representing a 12.9% increase for FFO as adjusted.","Headline FFO includes impairments of $15 million related to undeveloped land under contract and $15 million of transaction income, including marketable security gains. The drivers of the FFO as adjusted growth are primarily attributable to a $7.7 million increase in NOI at the property operating level and reduced debt and preferred stock cost of $7.6 million compared to last year. The operating team delivered strong operating metrics.","U.S. occupancy increased 60 basis points, bringing it to 93.9%, and combined occupancy reached 93.7%, a 40-basis-point increase from last year. Our U.S. leasing spreads were 16.7%, with new leases coming in at 28% and renewals and options at 13.7% for the quarter.","Our U.S. same-site NOI growth was 4.2%, and combined same-site NOI growth, which includes Canada and Latin America, was 4%, representing the highest levels in the past 6 years. This solid performance is the result of our continued effort to upgrade the portfolio through our capital recycling program.","Since mid-2010, we have sold 121 properties with an occupancy of 85% and an average base rent of $8.72 and replaced it with 66 assets with an occupancy of 95.7% and an average base rent of $14.28 in our key markets, with population levels 20% higher and income levels 30% higher. We've also benefited from a portfolio that has hundreds of leases that are over 20 years old with below-market rents and an improving economy during a period of minimal new development.","We are focused on the review of each asset and where we perceive significant risk. We will market those assets using the proceeds for future acquisitions of wholly-owned properties and joint venture interests for properties which we already manage.","With regard to capital recycling, we sold 20 shopping center assets, of which 9 were in Mexico, generating proceeds to the company of approximately $125 million. We recognized $39 million of non-FFO gains on the sale, offset by impairments of $16 million.","Subsequent to quarter end, we sold 9 assets in Chile, leaving us just 7 assets remaining in South America. As for the monetization of nonretail assets, we are just about done. With the sale of InTown Suites and other nonretail investments during the second quarter providing proceeds of $177 million, and the sale of 2 urban assets and certain nonretail-preferred equity investments after quarter end for an additional proceeds of $40 million, the remaining nonretail book value is down to approximately $180 million. We recognized approximately $36 million of impairments on the sale of the urban office properties. We are working on the sale of another $100 million of nonretail assets by the end of the year and, as Dave mentioned, with that, the discussion of nonretail will be history.","We have been very proactive on the right side of the balance sheet as well. In May, we tapped the U.S. bond market, raising $350 million at a coupon of 3.125% for 10-year money. And then in July, we executed a $200-million, 7-year Canadian-denominated bond at 3.855%. The proceeds from these issuances were earmarked to repay significantly higher coupon debt, including a $100-million bond at 6.125%, a $75-million bond at 4.7%, an upcoming $100-million bond at 5.19% and mortgage debt with a weighted average of just under 6%. The Canadian proceeds will be used to repay a 5.18% $200-million bond in August.","These transactions, coupled with the significant cost savings generated from the $635 million of perpetual preferred stock redeemed last year and replaced with lower coupon preferreds, has provided a portion of the FFO growth.","Our liquidity position remains in excellent shape, with over $1.6 billion of immediate liquidity available and less than $150 million of debt maturing for the balance of the year. We remain committed to our BBB+, Baa1 investment grade ratings and expect to continue to operate with a consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA level between 5.5x and 6x, currently at 5.8x, and a fixed charge coverage of at least 2.5x, currently 2.9x.","We are pleased to report that based on the strong first half performance, we are raising our FFO as adjusted per share guidance to $1.31 to $1.33 from the previous guidance range level of $1.29 to $1.33. Please remember, our guidance does not include transactional income or expense, but does include the loss of income from InTown, which was quite profitable.","Using the midpoint of $1.32 would represent a 4.8% increase over last year. The guidance estimate incorporates the sale of InTown, as I just mentioned, which has a dilutive impact of approximately $5 million per quarter, or $0.025 for the balance of 2013, and the benefits of all of our refinancing activity.","In addition, we have increased our forecast for same-site NOI growth to a range of 3% to 4%, up 50 basis points from the original estimate of 2.5% to 3.5%. It is worth noting that since 2010, we have successfully grown our FFO as adjusted per share each year as we executed a significant recycling program which has yielded a stronger, higher-quality portfolio, exited nonretail assets and significantly improved our balance sheet metrics.","And now I'll turn it over to Conor for his inaugural earnings call as COO to discuss the shopping center portfolio.","Conor C. Flynn","Thanks, Glenn. I'd like to thank, Milton, Dave and the Board of Directors for the opportunity and confidence that they have placed in me.","Our second quarter portfolio performance is not only indicative of the solid market fundamentals in our sector, but also highlights our successful efforts to improve our portfolio and previews where we are headed in the future. We have improved the quality of our portfolio by focusing on 3 major initiatives: first, actively managing the core portfolio and exiting out of investments that have significant risk; second, reinvesting in our high-quality assets as we continue to see double-digit returns through redevelopment efforts that will enhance and reposition our portfolio for long-term stability and growth; and third, investing in our core markets that have significant barriers to entry with above-average growth.","U.S. same-site NOI growth of 4.2% was fueled from leases signed with high-quality retailers. Also contributing to the growth were healthy contractual rent increases and improved overall credit loss across the portfolio. The 4.2% same-site NOI growth in the U.S. is the highest reported since Q3 2007 and is the 13th consecutive quarter of positive same-site growth.","Notable rent commencements include: 2 Walmarts, a Target, 3 leases with TJX, 2 Weis Markets, 2 Michaels, 5 ULTAs, a Kohl's, a Bed Bath & Beyond, a CVS, a Giants, a Trader Joe's, a Whole Foods and a Nordstrom Rack.","Our leasing and asset management team continues to focus on adding best-in-class retailers, who in turn improve the portfolio quality. We signed 185 new leases for a total of 698,000 gross square feet, bringing the overall occupancy levels up 40 basis points higher than 1 year ago for both gross and pro rata share.","In the U.S., pro rata occupancy increased by 60 basis points from a year ago. On a U.S. same-site basis, occupancy rose 30 basis points pro rata mainly due to positive absorption. Second quarter versus first quarter, our overall occupancy was up 10 basis points pro rata in gross. Anchor occupancy was up 20 basis points to 97%. Small-shop occupancy was up 30 basis points to 84.3%, a 100-basis-point increase from the second quarter of 2012, which demonstrates the improving health of our small shops. However, activity in the small shops is still primarily driven by national small-shop operators, regional players and franchisees, so there is still work to be done and, thus, opportunity to improve.","Our new leasing spreads of 28% was attributed to positive spreads on every single lease signed above 5,000 square feet. Other highlights include a new lease at our redevelopment project in Fairview Heights, Illinois, where we are replacing a 15-year-old Kmart with a 28,000-square-foot Fresh Thyme Farmers Market. In addition, we signed 2 new leases with ULTA, and Hobby Lobby signed a new lease this quarter to replace a former Syms in Miami, Florida.","Renewals and options leasing spreads posted a 13.7% increase, our highest ever, which included a 40-year-old Kohl's lease that expired in Salem, New Hampshire that was paying $1.47 and renewed at $13 a foot. Overall leasing spreads in the U.S. increased 16.7% and have now been positive for 10 straight quarters.","The redevelopment pipeline is my passion project and is now a focal point for future growth. During the quarter, we toured over 100 assets, and I'm excited by what I saw and the opportunities that are embedded in our portfolio. We have added significant projects for the future value creation in every region. 19 projects became active this quarter for a total cost of $30 million and a targeted ROI of over 10%. Anchors driving these projects include Walmart, Bass Pro, CVS, Burlington Coat, LA Fitness, PetSmart, ULTA and Dollar Tree. We now have $165 million in active projects, $179 million in the planning stage and have identified another $460 million of future redevelopment projects that are now under evaluation.","20 new leases were signed this quarter that were either combining space or splitting boxes for new retailers, which make up the lion's share of our new deal costs.","Redevelopments produced a strong return on invested capital in addition to higher residual values that are harder to quantify. A dynamic new retailer can drive traffic to the asset or increase the frequency of visits and have a trickle-down effect on the surrounding tenants.","A redevelopment creates a more attractive and safer environment that brings down operational expenses as a result of improvements in site lighting, waste management, solar energy and other technologies that decrease the retailer's total occupancy costs. We are mining Kimco's large portfolio for opportunities like these, small and large.","Our best-in-class operations team allows us to differentiate ourselves from our peers and provides both shoppers and retailers with more tools to be successful. Our focus on technology, sustainability and creativity inspires us to push the envelope and to look at our properties and ask, \"What more can we do?\" We have been working on unlocking new sources of revenue by developing a national ancillary income strategy focusing on revenue-based advertising, kiosks and vending programs. We are looking to expand our solar program and other tenant energy services and build out Wi-Fi networks and web portals that would enhance the tenant and shopper experience. We are reducing occupancy costs by investing in lighting technology that will cut common area spending. We are streamlining utility management bill processing and enhancing mobile tools for property managers so they can now snap a photo with their iPad and send it directly from the site to a qualified vendor and quickly receive a bid, reducing paperwork and expediting repairs from the field. These are just a few things we were working on as our scale allows us to be creative with pilot programs, when, if successful, are then expanded nationally.","Dave mentioned our acquisition activity in the second quarter, which continues to reflect prudent use of our capital by purchasing partnership interests and assets that we have lived and breathed for a number of years. On the dispositions front, we've sold 11 properties in Q2 for a gross sales price of $71.6 million at an implied cap rate of 7.7%. We are taking a fresh look at our disposition list and are now taking it a step further and focusing on inherent risk at the property level. We have had 3 more closings since the end of the quarter, with another 16 properties under contract. Actively managing the portfolio, anticipating risk and predicting the shift in demographics and retail nodes will continue to shape the portfolio.","And I will now turn it over to Milton for his closing remarks.","Milton Cooper","Well, thanks, Conor. Our entire management team is excited about their interaction with Conor. His enthusiasm for retail real estate and his creative energy to enhance value through redevelopments is absolutely contagious. Conor's passion is redevelop, redevelop, redevelop, and I think it's a great menu. When a center can be expanded at double-digit returns, it is not only a superb use of capital, but it increases traffic and enhances the value of the existing center. We have almost 900 properties that will provide Conor with a wonderful canvas to work with.","Now having said that, our portfolio has undergone a dramatic transformation. When Kimco first started back in 1958, we were acquirers. The strategy was that whatever we owned would, over time, substantially increase in value as the country grew, suburbs grew, inflation grew, et cetera, et cetera. So by way of habit, we were acquirers and accumulated large portfolios for both public and private companies. Over the past 3 years, we have kicked the habit and our strategy has been much more refined. We have been selling where we perceive risk, and we buy higher-quality properties with growing cash flows. And we've started to see the benefits of this strategy in our metrics.","I would like to also give you my thoughts on valuations. When a common stock or any security is bought, its multiple depends to a great extent on future growth from the business. When a property is acquired, there is an Argus run for 5 or 10 years, and the cap rate depends upon the growth and future rental streams. And it follows that a portfolio should be similarly valued. Our portfolio has had 13 straight quarters of increases in same-store growth, and so far this year, our same-store growth has been outstanding. And we believe we can continue to deliver strong recurring growth into the foreseeable future, and hence, an increased valuation.","Now additionally, we've always had an opportunistic bed by creating values out of opportunities with retailers with strong real estate, referred to as our plus business.","Our plus business has created substantial value and profits that can be reinvested into high-quality shopping centers with recurring income. In this connection, we are pleased with the results of SUPERVALU and confident that the new management will increase the value of almost 8.2 million shares that we acquired in March. We are excited, we are motivated and we are moving forward to our goal of being a world-class retail REIT with growing cash flows and growing dividends.","And now, we'd be delighted to answer any questions.","David F. Bujnicki","Yusef, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy with UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Glenn, can you discuss what your bond issue might have looked like if done today from a pricing standpoint? Can you provide some sort of general comments around the changes you've seen in the financing markets over the last 2 months and whether or not you've seen any impact on private market transaction pricing? I know there's a couple of questions in there.","Glenn G. Cohen","Sure, sure, Christie. Well, certainly, the one big difference for sure is just look at the base treasury rate. When we did our bond, we issued when the 10-year treasury was 196. Now you're looking at basically a 260 treasury. And spreads have definitely widened out a little bit. I mean, our spread on that deal was 125 over. Today, we'd probably be around 140, 145. And if you asked me that 2 weeks ago, I probably would tell you it was about 160. So markets move pretty quickly on that side of the world, but it's definitely gotten better and you're seeing more traction. But rates' all-in coupons are definitely higher. The Canadian bond is a different -- it's a different market. It's a smaller market there. Those are done as private placement deals. So again, we feel pretty good about what we were able to do. That market is probably around the same where it is today. So we're probably, on a 7-year deal, somewhere around 180 over. As far as it relates to transactions, we really haven't seen a drop-off in transactions because of it. You still have a pretty wide spread between really where 10-year treasuries are and cap rates from a historic basis. So it really hasn't slowed things down. The CMBS market is open. The bank market is open. The bond market is open. So for right now, it looks pretty healthy to be able to conduct and to transact.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","While I recognize you're never done with the culling of the portfolio, I wonder where you think you stand with the recycling of the retail portfolio at this point?","Glenn G. Cohen","Craig -- I mean, again, it's something that we continue to look at. Conor and I have -- these 2 months here, we've spent a lot of time looking at the list, working through it and making further decisions about it. There's definitely more that we want to sell, but the amount of ABR that those assets make up, it's pretty -- getting to a level point where it's pretty modest. The assets are smaller. But you're going to continue to see us sell assets, and you're going to -- I think, as you look out 2, 3, 4, 5 years, it just becomes part of the fabric of the business. We are going to continue and analyze where properties, in our view, have risk. And if we see a declining NOI in the future, where the population growth is going the wrong way, you're going to see us market those assets. It's just a different view and a different look at how we view the portfolio today.","Conor C. Flynn","I would agree. I think that actively managing the portfolio is something that's just become a fabric of our company. And going forward, we're just going to continue to take a look at the shifts in retail nodes, the shifts in demographics, and continue to analyze each and every site individually and look to see if it's opportunistic to exit.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm just wondering -- I've sort of got a sense that we may be shifting into a little bit heavier redevelopment mode as opposed to a buying and selling mode. But thanks for the feedback.","Conor C. Flynn","That's accurate. I think we're definitely -- you're going to see us shift much more into reinvesting in our properties and taking the funds that we can generate from our dispositions and reinvesting into our existing portfolio and redevelopment pipeline.","David B. Henry","Craig, we've basically concluded there's 2 wonderful ways to invest capital. One is in redevelopment, where it's so accretive and so incremental to our earnings; and secondly, buying out joint venture partners because we're able to achieve better-than-average cap rates on those acquisitions. Because we're buying partial interest, we can assume the debt, there's no broker, it's negotiated off-market and so forth. So both of those are wonderful places for us to invest capital on, and that's where we've been concentrating.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samit Parikh with ISI.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","David, can you just sort of remind us what's left now in Latin America? You said you've sold -- subsequent to the quarter, you've sold 9 assets in Chile. So there's 7 left there, and sort of what the value, you believe, of the -- I guess it's remaining retail assets there are in Mexico, as well, and sort of what your thought process is in terms of the timing of probably disposing of those assets, going forward?","David B. Henry","Yes. Well, let me take it in 2 pieces. We're definitely committed to exit in whole in South America. And of those 7 remaining assets, 5 are essentially spoken to. The 2 in Brazil are still formally on the market and being marketed by Brookfield. But we think we're close on them. The biggest asset we have in South America remains our multi-story mall in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, and we have a tentative deal on that, and that should happen over the next couple of months. So that will essentially clean up South America. Mexico, the market continues to be wide open in terms of the acquisition appetite by the Fibras, or the Mexican REITs, both existing Fibras and Friba want-to-bes, I guess I would say, and we continue to get some nice offers on the remaining properties we have, which are roughly, depending on how you count, maybe 35 shopping centers plus some net lease properties. Plus, we have our Kimco land fund. We've got a one-off industrial property still that wasn't included in the Terrafina sale. So we've got some multiple stuff down there. So we are looking at offers on those. We have not signed any agreements on those in terms of contracts. But it remains an intriguing window of opportunity to sell Mexico assets at cap rates, quite frankly, we didn't think we'd see on an exit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just a follow-up to Craig's question. But as Milton said, Conor, you have a pretty big canvas to be looking at, and I guess, just in the U.S., you have, I think, about 70 million square feet of retail space, and 70% of that is in your top 40 metros. I know you're focused -- or I guess I'd say you seem focused now more on being better rather than bigger. And then when you think about 3 to 5 years forward, do you expect to see similar metrics for Kimco's portfolio? I mean, will they be equivalently sized or equivalently concentrated? Or do you expect to sort of change that mix over the next 3 to 5 years?","Conor C. Flynn","Yes, I think you're going to see us continue look to acquire larger assets that have more meat on the bone, is what we like to say, or more redevelopment opportunities. Those -- really, when you have the acreage involved in a site that's quite large, you have a lot more opportunity to focus on creating value on the property. I think you'll still see us selling out some of our smaller tertiary markets and looking to invest in high-quality properties in our core markets and with a constant analysis towards value creations. So I think going forward, we may not change in GLA, but our site count may change, but as a focus of -- toward the lower assets with higher potential for redevelopments.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And you're not -- put differently, you'd be substantially smaller than being in 40-plus metros?","Conor C. Flynn","I think that's accurate.","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes, jeff, it's Glenn. I would say we plan to maintain our national presence. That is something that's very important to us. So you may see us shrink some of the markets that we're in, but the national presence and the diversity and tenant mix that we offer, we think, is a real differentiator for us. So we don't expect that to change.","David B. Henry","It's all within the context of upgrading the portfolio. So it's going to be higher and higher quality over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I just want to follow-up, actually, on that question through the national presence being important to you guys. What -- can you be specific, I guess, in describing what you see as the benefits of this large national presence versus -- would be the benefits of being more concentrated into, let's say, a dozen markets?","Milton Cooper","Cedric, it's Milton. I'm going to take a shot. It's a good question. And let me say first, from my perspective, national diversified portfolio geographically tenant mitigates risk. In my mind, it gives to me a measure of safety from a point of view of what may happen in a particular month. But most important, the national platform helps our business in this sense. If a retailer wants to -- if a foreign retailer wants to come to the United States, interested in non-mall locations, what a better place to start than Kimco? And it also is an advantage, Cedric, to our plus business. Because when retailers have issues and come, and we have -- in the SUPERVALU, in the -- all of the Save A Lots, we're being compensated and we get opportunities nationally. So the national platform is in a wonderful advantage in that connection, Cedric.","Conor C. Flynn","I would just add that on our portfolio reviews with our retailers, we're really focused on the regional players that are looking to become national. Sprouts Farmers Market is a good example, where they've started out west and are now growing nationally, and we can offer -- and we can show them an opportunity list that is really unmatched by our peers. And we're the largest landlord for a lot of these tenants as well, so that becomes opportunistic when we're going through renewals or looking for opportunities for these retailers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Kimco has been very active buying centers from the joint venture partners. Can you comment on how big of an opportunity this will be going forward?","David B. Henry","Well, we still manage a combined portfolio of almost $10 billion, of which about 60% is held by all kinds of third parties. We probably have 2 dozen institutional and other partners remaining, some of which have indicated an interest to be -- to dispose of their interest. So we continue to have discussions. I'd say UBS was particularly large, so I don't anticipate -- or we don't anticipate a very large one like that. But we are due -- in discussions with some of the moderate-sized partners, and we hope to bring them to fruition in the near future. And as I said, it's probably, next to the redevelopment, #2 on what we want to do. So we're being very proactive in this.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Cheatham with SunTrust.","Brandon Cheatham","It's Brandon Cheatham. I also have Ki Bin Kim on the line. Just was wondering if you guys could comment real quick on -- with the rise in interest rates, how that's changed valuations, and specifically, if you could break out any differentiation between the high-quality assets that you guys are looking to purchase versus the low-quality that you are looking to sell?","Milton Cooper","The first metric that you have to look at is the difference between buying a bond, the 10-year treasury, and an income-producing piece of real estate. The major difference is that with inflation, at the end of 10 years, the purchaser of bond is lucky to have purchasing power of maybe 60%. In a shopping center, you not only have a growing asset but residual values are higher. And historically, while there is a direct connection between cap rates and interest rates, there are limits. There was a time when the prime rate was 21%, treasuries were double-digits. But during that time, cap rates did not go above 10%. So they have been kept in a band that's much narrower than the fluctuation of interest rates. And you have an addition, the benefits on a portion of your cash flow and buying real estate assets tax-free by way of depreciation. So historically, while there is a connection, it's not a direct connection.","David B. Henry","And I would also add, there remains fierce competition for the A -- the prime-quality assets out there. So the east hills [ph] of the world have seen no real slow down in the competitive bidding for the very high-quality assets in primary markets, and those cap rates have definitely continued to be less than 6 for many of those high-quality assets. Also, the general trend towards favorable pricing for even the B assets continues. There's just more money chasing these B assets because there's been frustration out there that people can't acquire the A assets. So the cap rates have continued to drift down into the B category. So as a very general comment, I'd say stuff we sold that was clearly B or B- a couple of years ago were in the 9s, now they're in the 7s. So -- and we haven't seen that back up at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Isbee with Stifel.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You've had some success over the last year or so. It seems it's becoming more regular pulling some of these older leases out of the bag with well-below-market rents that you've been able to redo at much higher rents. And you have made reference to the 1,000 leases in your portfolio that are older than 20 years. Can you stratify, perhaps, as we look out over the next few years, how many of them potentially are coming due, just to give a sense of what type of growth it could provide to the portfolio beyond just the favorable macro momentum?","Glenn G. Cohen","Nate, it's a little tough because many of them have options in them. So it really depends on when they're exercised, whether they're exercised or not exercised. So it's a little bit tough to really pinpoint it specifically. But we know, and as you've seen quarter-after-quarter, we get them. I mean, the Kohl's example is a great one. I mean, it's a very old lease at under $2 a foot. You bring this to market. So it's a real benefit of the age and size of the portfolio. Well, Nate, I'm going to out on a limb and give you one example just to make you feel good. We have a property in the city of New York. There's a 100,000-foot tenant who is paying probably a rent that with taxes is almost flat, 0 or negative. And on that 100,000 feet, I think we'll go from 0, negative just to $20 a foot in 2017. That's the one example I can give you.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I mean, of those 1,000, how many would you say are coming -- or don't have any renewal options left?","Conor C. Flynn","I think it's about 500. So we're running that analysis, and we're digging into the expiration schedules to see where the options are. Some of them have fair market value options or are escalators involved that -- what we can take a deeper dive into. But it's about 500 of the 1,000.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If we're thinking about the non-retail asset sales, which are wrapping up, what you're doing in Mexico and just the non-core U.S. properties, and then kind of match that up against what you're doing with the JV buyouts, third-party acquisitions, on a look-forward basis, does it feel like you're going to be a net acquirer going forward for the balance of the year and, say, 2014?","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, I would say, for the balance of the year, we're probably going to be a net seller if it all comes out the way we think it will. Coming into 2014, what we'll -- we'll give you a better feel for it probably on the next call, but my guess is you'll probably be a net acquirer somewhat in 2014, but it's going to -- Mike, it's going to be about us looking at assets that aren't just based on what that initial cap rate is. It's really about where we see growth and opportunity in those assets. You're not going to see us buying large, large portfolios of assets that we think have issues with them. It's really -- we're going to be very, very judicious and careful and disciplined about what we're acquiring.","David B. Henry","That said, I would add, besides ramping up the redevelopment, which takes capital and proactively trying to buyout partners, we continue to have opportunities to buy assets in the marketplace, some of which are intriguing to us, and some of these we may be able to negotiate off-market. So I'm a little more optimistic on the acquisition side given our history and our nature. So I'd say we'll probably be at least even this year. But we'll see.","Milton Cooper","Well, if you take Conor's passion, he's outlined, over time, $750 million of redevelopments at double-digit yields. That, over time, augurs a very healthy increase in our yields and in our flows.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question with Samit Parikh with ISI.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Dave, I just wanted to ask the question on those -- the low-market leases in a different way. In your opening remarks, you said 35-year low in supply effective rents moving up. Your trailing 12-month blended spreads in the U.S. are around 10%, which really isn't that far off from the 2005, 2006 days. So given that you've been saying that you don't expect much supply to come on in the next few years, do you think blended rent spreads over the next 2, 3 years for Kimco should surpass the prior peak?","David B. Henry","It could well. I personally continue to be fascinated by this lack of new supply. Historically, on average, roughly 100,000 shopping centers out there in the U.S., there's been a new supply of about 2%. Today, we're at a run rate of 0.1%, and it is not expected to increase substantially above that level for several years. The old days of buying 50 to 100 acres and going through years of entitlements and environmental fights and then pre-leasing and then getting construction financing, I -- we just don't see that coming back anytime soon. So although we're all looking at second phases and some redevelopment, it's still not material in terms of substantially increasing the supply of space. So at -- couple that with a 5-year high of retailers opening up stores. 80,000 new stores are going to open up over the next 2 years, so that's really quite amazing demand that we can work with. So we're optimistic that the industry is healthy. We're definitely on the recovery track. We're, of course, subject to some very high-level macro events because we're all about consumer spending and consumer confidence, but that said, the fundamental supply versus demand is shifting back in our favor after a very rough 3 or 4 years.","Operator","Our next question is also a follow-up question with Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The first part is, I always find that the same-store NOI and rent spreads don't necessarily translate down to FFO as I guess I would expect. Can you tell us how much of your portfolio the same-store NOI metric applies to and maybe perhaps in broad strokes how that's calculated for NOI and leasing spreads?","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, from a leasing spreads standpoint, it's a little tough because it depends on when the rent commences. So signing a new lease and having it commence is a different time period than what's embedded in your same-site NOI number because the same-site NOI number is a cash basis. But if you look at our same-site NOI growth, it is roughly -- and I don't know, I think the same-site NOI was up about $7 million. We do it -- we have a disclosure which breaks down the dollars, so maybe that can help you with your model.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Yes, I'll dig into that a little deeper. And maybe just as a follow-up, when you look at leasing spreads and -- I guess this is a question more about whether or not it's possible, Glenn, is that when you guys do the comparisons, for example, on the trailing 4 quarters on new leasing spreads in the U.S., I think the numbers are new rents are 18% and the prior rents are 14%. Are you able to unearth what the TIs were on the previous deal? And the reason I ask is just because if we amortize in the TIs on the current deal, it's about $4 a square foot. So if you think of it like an economic rent versus the prior rent, it would almost appear flat, and I think probably a more interesting analysis would be kind of net of TIs.","Glenn G. Cohen","We haven't done -- we really haven't done that, Jeff. If it's something that could help you, we -- I'm sure Dave Bujnicki could go over some of the details with you after the call.","David B. Henry","And also, if you amortize it over the initial base term, yes, you can get a little nervous about that. But most of these have options built in, and so a reasonable way to look at that is to amortize those TIs over a much smaller period of time.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with UBS, another follow-up question.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Conor, just wanted to follow-up on your comments on redevelopment. It sounds like you've identified about $0.5 billion. Milton mentioned $0.75 billion about -- of redevelopment projects, potentially. How does that -- sorry if you've mentioned this, but how does that break out in terms of what you're expecting for annual redevelopment spend? And in your opening remarks, you also mentioned some things that sound like -- more like renovation CapEx. So if you could just sort of talk about what you expect to spend in terms of redevelopment spend and then renovation CapEx? And can you also remind me, in your same-store NOI growth, does that include or exclude the impact of redevelopment?","Conor C. Flynn","It includes it. I'll start with the last question. And just going through the redevelopment pipeline, the projects that were added, which Mr. Cooper referenced earlier, is that we're looking at every single asset, and it can range inside the projects. So the specifics of the ones that became active this quarter, it's an LA Fitness being built in Staten Island, it's a Burlington Coat being built in Florida, it's a relocation and an expansion for ULTA Cosmetics, it's developing a PetSmart in Puerto Rico, it's downsizing a Best Buy and then adding an ULTA, it's splitting boxes, it's also adding outparcels in California and redeveloping and adding significant GLA on a few other properties. So the range of scope of what you're looking for in a redevelopment project can vary greatly. And I think on the timing side of it, it can be very lumpy. There's -- if you've ever done a rehab project even in your own house, you know how the timing of it can be very hard to pinpoint. But on our analysis of active projects, we tend to think that those will be at -- that we are spending money on currently, that those flows will hit in the 1- to 3-year period. And then the ones that are in the planning phase will hit in the 3- to 5-year period. And then the future ones will be 5 to 10 out. So that gives you a little bit of a perspective of the timing of it.","David B. Henry","I think it's also fair to use Milton's wonderful word, \"reservoir of opportunities,\" when you look at our very large portfolio of shopping centers that Conor has taken a hard relook at and has found many more redevelopment prospects than perhaps we've found before. So you've seen a rededicated, reenergized look at this stuff, and it's yielding results.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So if I think about it in general terms, just sort of annual starts and annual spend, I know it can be lumpy, but over the next few years?","Glenn G. Cohen","Christy, it's Glenn. You probably should expect us to spend somewhere between $100 million and $150 million a year. And again, depending on how -- to Conor's point, it gets a little lumpy. If it's a bigger project, we might spend more. But I think that's at least a target range to start with.","Operator","Our next and last question comes from Brandon Cheatham with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","This is actually Ki Bin. Just a couple of quick cleanup questions. One, what is your small-shop occupancy? What was it at the peak on an apples-to-apples basis? And I...","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, the small-shop occupancy, we started only tracking it maybe 4, 5 years ago. We think, at its peak, it was right around 90%, so that was its peak. Today, we're sitting at around, what, 84.3%? So we feel that there's definitely more upside to come there.","Conor C. Flynn","That's correct. I mean, I think you're starting to see the small shop health really improve. Even if you look at our spreads on just the small shops, over 60% of them were positive, which is a very, very unique factor for us because it's been flat to negative in the past. So we're starting to see that health metric improve.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So we can model this -- as I model this -- low-single digit positive? So most of the positive leasing spreads were on the 10,000 square feet and greater space? Is that right?","Conor C. Flynn","That's correct.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a last question. You guys have gone through a lot of capital recycling and it seems like you probably have more pull-through to reinvest. How do you -- so how does that impact your acquisition parameters? And should we expect that you guys are going to buy more higher-quality, somewhat stabilized assets? Or would you actually be willing to take on more of these at-risk, or you can add value on acquisitions?","David B. Henry","We do intend to be very disciplined. Just because we have some more money coming in, we're not going to be particularly aggressive. We're disciplined. We do look for properties that have, a, very high quality; and b, growth embedded in the asset. And we are looking as best we can for off-market opportunities, where we leverage relationships of Milton's or others to get those kinds of deals. And again, we refer you back to the opening, where our first place to put capital is into our own properties, where we can get wonderfully accretive incremental yields. Secondly, buying out partners where the cap rates are generally above market. And then third, looking for these selective opportunities where there's good growth and very high quality.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

We are very pleased to report strong first quarter financial results and operating metrics. Glenn and Conor will cover the specific details, but the solid fundamentals of our portfolio continued to drive excellent FFO earnings growth and same-site NOI increases. Small shop occupancy improvements are particularly encouraging as the economy continues to recover. While recent retail sales growth has been modest, national retailers are still committed to robust expansion plans, all in the face of a declining inventory of retail space. Discounters and service-oriented tenants, such as theaters, health clubs and restaurants, continue to expand rapidly, helping to increase effective rents and occupancy in our portfolio and across the open air shopping center sector. Lower gas prices are also expected to give a boost to consumer spending and in a good sign for shopping centers. Rich Moore of RBC continues to point to 5-year high levels of planned new store openings, while Craig Schmidt of BofA Merrill notes a recovery of retailers focusing on the middle class. The renewed strength of middle-class purchasing power is expected to disproportionately benefit neighborhood and community shopping centers anchored by conventional grocery stores, casual and fast-casual dining and discount anchors such as Walmart, Target and Kohl's.","Overall, we feel terrific going into 2015 as new supply remains muted despite population growth, growing household formation and the slow but steady growth of the U.S. economy.","With respect to our overall strategy, we've essentially completed our exit from Latin America, with pending deals on our last shopping center in Mexico and various land parcels. We also continue to take advantage of a strong market for shopping centers, even in secondary markets, by selling both our second tier assets as well as those located outside our long-term growth markets. Our U.S. property dispositions, in total, are on track, with all of the identified assets largely sold or targeted to be under contract by year-end, this potential.","In general, sales proceeds from our dispositions are being recycled into our large pipeline of redevelopment projects, selective new developments and purchases of our institutional partners' ownership interest in existing Kimco assets. We believe these activities in general are excellent accretive investments and superior to the acquisition auctions of high-quality stabilized shopping centers owned by third parties. Our recent Blackstone purchase, for example, allowed us to fully consolidate 39 high-quality properties we have managed and leased for approximately 10 years. We know these assets and we know these markets very well, and we are excited about their long-term growth potential.","We have also increased our efforts to purchase out parcels or retail properties adjacent to or within existing high-quality properties we already own. These acquisitions are usually very accretive and increase our scale and leasing leverage in some of our very best properties.","Looking at our Canadian operations. Our occupancy remains strong at approximately 96%, and our Target exposure is fully covered by parent company guarantees on all 9 of our Target Canada leases. Interest from other retailers is growing, and we believe at least 8 of our 9 Target stores will find new anchors this year.","Also, as noted in prior statements, we have begun to selectively sell certain Canadian properties where we can benefit from historic low cap rates and high institutional demand. RioCan, our largest Canadian partner, has purchased our 50% interest in 3 of our RioKim joint venture properties, comprising 545,000 square feet while concurrently selling us their 80% interest in a premium joint venture property we originally developed and currently manage in Dallas-Fort Worth.","Our RioCan venture is also selling 2 large properties in Qu\u00e9bec in areas where we believe growth will be constrained.","On a separate topic, we continue to be pleased with both our SUPERVALU and Safeway investments. SUPERVALU reported excellent quarterly results, and we took the opportunity last week to partially monetize our SUPERVALU stock at a large gain. In addition, the Safeway Albertson's integration is proceeding well under Bob Miller's direction. While the Safeway investment headlines are Plus business, it is important to note that over the years, we have completed many smaller transactions within the Plus business, which have led to either individual property sale-leasebacks or acquisitions of retailer-owned real estate. Generally, these investments have been off-market, a direct result of our relationship with retailers, their advisory firms and private equity contacts.","As a final comment, Glen and our treasury team continue to do a wonderful job in the capital markets. Our first ever 30-year unsecured bond was a particularly noteworthy achievement and helped stagger our debt maturities while taking advantage of today's low interest rates. Now I'd like to turn it to Glenn, Conor and Milton for their comments.","Glenn Gary Cohen","Thanks, David, and good morning. 2015 is off to a strong start. Our solid first quarter results are the product of strong execution on all fronts, including leasing, acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments and capital raising. As we reported last night, headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.37, up from $0.34 last year, an 8.8% increase and $0.02 higher than first call consensus.","The improved performances is attributable to higher NOI contribution from the operating portfolio, lower G&A expenses and higher transactional income from our investment in Albertsons, which contributed $6.5 million or $0.015 per share growth year-over-year. FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.36 per diluted share for the first quarter, up from $0.34 last year, a 5.9% increase. This level of per share growth was achieved even after a $0.055 per share diluted impact from the significant transformational portfolio, including the substantial liquidation of our share of assets in Mexico totaling $480 million, nonstrategic U.S. asset sales of $850 million and the impact from currency fluctuations. The diluted impact was more than offset by the purchase of 5 quality assets totaling $2.1 billion over the past year, many from our joint venture programs including the Kimstone acquisition during the first quarter, and by our reduced debt cost from refinancing higher coupon debt.","Our portfolio operating team kicked off the year with solid results, delivering U.S. same-site NOI growth of 3.2% and combined same-site NOI growth, which includes Canada, of 3%, before the negative 100 basis point impact on currency. The same-site NOI growth was achieved primarily from top line revenue growth generated from increased occupancy, which is 95.7% for both the U.S. and the combined portfolios.","Leasing spreads were strong with a 19.1% increase on new leases signed and 8.1% for renewals and options, bringing combined leasing expense to 10.1% for the first quarter.","We were very active on the capital raising front. During the quarter, we sourced a new $650 million term loan with a final maturity in 2020 priced at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. We used the proceeds to repay a $400 million term loan, which was priced at LIBOR plus 105 and to partially fund the Kimstone purchase. In addition, we issued a $350 million 30-year bond and a coupon of 4.25% yielding 4.31%, including the lowest 30-year coupon in the REIT industry and extending our weighted average maturity profile by 2 years.","As a result of the significant acquisition volume in the first quarter, our net debt to recurring EBITDA is 6.6x and 6.4x when you pro forma for the full quarter EBITDA from the Kimstone acquisition, which was closed in February. We expect to bring net debt to recurring EBITDA back to 6x by the end of the year, consistent with our stated objective of operating in a 5.5x to 6x range. Our liquidity position is in excellent shape, ending the quarter with over $1.6 billion available on our revolving credit facility and as another source of low-cost capital.","Based on our strong first quarter results and expectations for the balance of the year, we are raising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.50 to $1.55 from the previous range of $1.45 to $1.53. The headline FFO guidance range includes $32.4 million or $0.08 per share gain from the partial monetization of our SUPERVALU investment, which was completed during the second quarter. We are also increasing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.42 to $1.45 from the initial range of $1.40 to $1.44. We are reaffirming our operating guidance assumptions for occupancy of 25 to 50 basis points and U.S. same-site NOI growth of 3% to 3.5%, as well as our acquisition and disposition targets. Keep in mind the guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisitions, dispositions and financing initiatives. And with that, I'll turn it over to Conor.","Conor C. Flynn","Thanks Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will start by recapping our progress on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by updates on our development and redevelopment pipeline and finishing with a quick recap of the operating metrics.","Overall, we had a good start to the year and are pleased with the team effort that showcases how Kimco continues to execute on all fronts. The evolution of the open-air shopping center gives our talented team a tremendous opportunity to enhance net asset value. We continue to execute on our transformation and simplification strategy with the previously announced closing of the Kimstone transaction. At the time of closing, the cap rate on the portfolio was approximately 6% and it has since performed above our own internal expectations.","In addition, we acquired a Sprouts-anchored center in Houston, also at a 6 cap, which gives us control of 3 corners at the dominant intersection of Highway 6 and Spencer Road. We also acquired 4 adjacent parcels to our Tier 1 portfolio as we look to expand our footprint, where we see the opportunity for future redevelopment. The acquisitions market remains red-hot and we remain disciplined. We continue to be selective about targets and are focused on unlocking opportunities at strategic locations within our core markets.","The disposition market does not shown any signs of slowing down, with cap rates continuing to compress for dominant secondary market assets. The definition of core appears to be shifting with numerous buyers willing to step out on the risk spectrum for a slightly higher yield. We sold 6 shopping centers this quarter at an average implied cap rate of 7.25% in addition to 37 triple net assets for a $10 million gain. We plan to have the final phase of our disposition program complete by the end of the year, and then we'll take a fresh look annually on how to continue to improve the portfolio by selling our lowest tranche and mass funding those proceeds into our redevelopment and development activities.","In the first quarter, we completed 12 redevelopment projects at a cost of $35 million, giving us a return on investment of 11.7%, which was 114 basis points higher than our original estimates. Notable completions this quarter include: the Whole Foods at Pompano Beach; the 2-level Publix at our Miller Road asset, Miami; and the opening of Nordstrom Rack at Redfield Promenade.","The redevelopment pipeline is focused on the emerging trend of a adding traditional and specialty grocers to our Tier 1 power centers. This quarter, we completed and have under construction 12 grocery stores, including 2 Whole Foods, 2 Publix, 2 Safeways, 2 Fresh Thyme Farmers Markets, a Stew Leonard's, a Harris Teeter, a Lucky, and a Trader Joe's. These projects now bring our total percent of ABR from a grocery-anchored center to 71.2%, up from 65.8% last quarter. We believe this is the sweet spot for our redevelopments as we identify and incentivize our team to execute on creating a grocery opportunity that boosts daily traffic and surrounding retailer sales, and ultimately improves NAV. We have made great strides with this initiatives as a unique way for Kimco to create significant value and have improved from 56.3% in 2010 to over 70% today.","In addition, this quarter, we broke ground on the mixed-use redevelopment in Columbia, Maryland, where we ground leased a portion of the grocery-anchored asset to an apartment developer, who is now under construction, adding 230 units to complement our retail at Wild Lake.","Currently, we have a total of $289 million in active redevelopment projects, with another $659 million in the design and entitlement phase and $117 million that is currently under review. For the quarter, redevelopment added 70 basis points to our same-site NOI.","Moving to development. Our development pipeline remains on track and each development is a special case where we feel the team has sourced an opportunity to either expand upon a successful asset or add an additional Tier 1 asset in our core markets. Whole Foods at Wynnewood is under construction and on schedule for a mid-2016 opening.","The 3 other development projects are in the early stages of securing entitlements, and we will soon be announcing major anchor signings. The Dania Beach project sits along I-95 and adjacent to the Fort Lauderdale airport and our successful Oakwood shopping center. The Christiana, Delaware project also sits along I-95 and is adjacent to GGP's Christiana Mall. And finally, our Grand Parkway project sits along the new Grand Parkway in close proximity to the new Exxon Mobil campus in the Woodlands area of Houston.","The lack of supply and strong retailer demand has given us confidence that we will be able to achieve a risk-adjusted return on each of these projects between 200 to 300 basis points above exit cap rates, and provide the company with long-term hold assets and help boost internal growth in major gateway cities.","I am very proud of our leasing team and their achievements for the first quarter, historically the most challenging quarter from an occupancy perspective. For the first time in 5 years, we were able to maintain our U.S. pro rata occupancy from prior quarter. This is no small feat on a portfolio of our size, and the credit goes to all those hardworking deal makers.","The small shop occupancy drove the performance with an increase in pro rata occupancy to 88.2%, a 20 basis point increase from prior quarter, a 260 basis point increase over prior year first quarter. We achieved this in spite of RadioShack's bankruptcy filing, which had a negative 20 basis point drag on our small shop occupancy.","Our combined leasing spreads were over 10% this quarter, an improvement over the prior year, and were boosted by new deals with Whole Foods, Publix and our first Stew Leonard's. We welcome Stew Leonard's to anchor our Airport Plaza in Farmingdale, Long Island. Stew Leonard's, who is also known as the Disneyland of dairy stores, will be the only Stew Leonard's on all of Long Island and create a one-of-a-kind signature asset.","In closing, we continue to see improving fundamentals across the major metro markets in the U.S. and believe the slow recovery will soon take hold of the middle class that will provide a further boost to our retailer sales.","The U.S. same-site NOI improved 3.2% due to the positive boost of net absorption, redevelopment and less-than-anticipated tenant fallout. The ABR of the portfolio is up 6.2% year-over-year, an increase from $13.18 to $14.","Our new leases are being signed at $17.35, 24% above our current average base rent, showcasing the significant embedded value and the mark-to-market opportunity we have here at Kimco. We remain focused on improving net asset value through aggressive early terminations, dynamic redevelopments, adding grocery components, diligent small shop leasing and adding density to unlock value. We are ahead of our internal plan for the year, thanks to our talented team and strengthened portfolio. But as you have heard us say many times, there's more work to do.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton for his final comments.","Milton Cooper","Well, thank you, Conor. Great properties, great people and a great future. That's what I think about when I think of Kimco. Since the announcement of our transformation strategy at our 2010 Investment Day, we have bought and sold over $5 billion for properties. Think about that for a moment. Not only is that a staggering figure in and of itself, it is a size that represents an equity market cap that is larger than many of our peers, but it's also reflective of the transformation of our portfolio. The result? Our portfolio is now better located, of higher quality, more resilient and offers tremendous growth opportunities for redevelopment.","A transformation, however, is not limited to our portfolio. It extends to our management team as well. And this is what I'm most enthused about. Our transformed management team led by our future CEO, Conor Flynn, is a unique blend of energy, talent and experience. With our new Chief Investment Officer, Ross Cooper; and our new Executive Vice President of Asset Management, David Jamieson, who joins Conor, Glenn, Ray Edwards, and our spectacular and pragmatic General Counsel, Bruce Rubenstein, I believe we have several -- an executive dream team at Kimco.","But that's not all. I've often trumpeted our deep bench strength at Kimco. And that phrase sometimes connotes a backup team and nothing could be further from reality. At our headquarters and in our regions, we have many talented leaders, who are moving Kimco forward every day. These include Will Teichman, our senior Director of Strategic Operations; Chris Freeman, our Vice President of Property Management; and Tom Taddeo, our Chief Investment Officer, and there are many others. And I've watched these talented individuals grow over the years, and I'm even more excited to see what they will accomplish in the years to come.","And now we'd be delighted to answer any questions.","David F. Bujnicki","We're ready to move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. Frank, you may take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Conor, I'm wondering if you could provide your thoughts around Whole Foods, new concepts of lower priced stores aimed at millennials. It sounds like they've already started negotiating some leases for the new stores. If you're able to provide any color on whether or not you had discussions with them and what size and type of locations they're targeting? And also, is this a game changer potential here? Or are they up against some pretty steep competition to that demographic?","Conor C. Flynn","Yes, it's a good question, Christy. We have an open dialogue with Whole Foods. As you've heard in my remarks, we have a number of deals pending with them in different forms of construction. So we do think that it's going to be an added benefit to our portfolio, especially when you look at the size that they're considering because many times when we try and add a grocery component to one of our assets, the size of the box sometimes restricts what kind of retailers we can add. So I think their price point going after the millennials, trying to probably be a little bit more competitive with some of the new specialty grocery concepts that have done so well in the recent years. I think that's their strategy, and I think it's a good one because I think that they have, for a long time, been the highest price point in terms of the grocery sector. And I think if they launched a competitive line of millennial-targeted grocery stores, I think it will fit nicely within our portfolio and others.","Operator","Next question comes from Samir Khanal from Evercore.","Samir Khanal - Evercore ISI, Research Division","As you mentioned in your opening remarks that the debt to EBITDA number had ticked up in the quarter, which seems to be because of Kimstone. Just trying to -- can you expand on that? And just kind of remind us how that leverage sort of goes back down based on kind of the options you have available? I mean, there is the ATM. I don't think that was utilized. Maybe it's equity raise or even possible asset sales. Just trying to get a sense of how you kind of prioritized these options as you kind of work the leverage down?","Glenn Gary Cohen","Sure, Samir. Well, obviously, the leverage is up due to the Kimstone portfolio. We brought on balance sheet roughly $1.1 billion of debt, and it is our goal to bring it back down to the 6x level. As I mentioned, it's 6.4x today when you really pro forma in the full amount of the EBITDA, right? We closed in the beginning of February, so you're missing a full month of EBITDA. So you have to really start at that 6.4x. And then we have multiple options and levers to pull. Selling the SUPERVALU stock is one piece to it, which happened in the second quarter, so that will help bring down leverage. That's an asset sitting on our books that had no EBITDA, so the cash will go to reduce debt there. We have the balance of our sales that we're working through as well. And we do have our ATM program in place, which, at the right time, we'll be able to use, and we've modeled that into our forecast. So we feel comfortable that we'll get it down one way or another to 6x by the end of the year.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm wondering as you head into Las Vegas, I can see ICSC convention. What are your top priorities? What do you really want to get accomplished with this convention?","Conor C. Flynn","The ICSC in Vegas is really -- it's a time and a place to go through the portfolio, but also think strategically with our retail partners. We've obviously upgraded our portfolio. We're adding a lot of redevelopment projects in the out years as well as some development projects. So I'd like to think of it as a way to look at the out years, to try and see what we can do strategically together and where our retailers are expanding and what they're looking for from the landlord today. I think the landlord's perspective has changed in terms of what we want to try and offer at the shopping center. And we want to see what the retailers are looking for as well in terms of what we can do to be a more proactive landlord. So hearing from them, obviously putting -- getting together with some of our largest partners is always a benefit and seeing what they believe is in store for the year ahead and years ahead.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And -- are the retailers pushing to you for new developments to open stores in?","Conor C. Flynn","Absolutely. They have some pretty significant store counts that they need to fill, and they are looking at all of our ground-up developments as well as our redevelopment. So they're very aggressive in trying to get into the high-quality shopping centers. And the supply and demand is definitely in the landlord's favor, and we're utilizing that to the best of our ability and making sure that we have the right portfolio to grow with our retailers.","Operator","Next question comes from Jim Sullivan from Cowen Group.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Recently, we have seen that Sears has been very active with mall owners to reposition its mall-based Sears locations. I know your Kmart exposure declined in the first quarter. But just curious if they have been more receptive and active to the same strategy with respect to the Kmart locations in your portfolio?","Raymond Edwards","This is Ray Edwards. First off, you should appreciate that the mall locations, Sears owns those properties. And for the mall owners to joint venture with them for the redevelopment is very important. Kimco has lease positions with Kmart. We have a number of locations that have no term remaining for the next 2 to 3 years that we'll be getting back. So we're focused on those, and we are working with them on some other locations, but we have a lot more flexibility with Kmart. They're all leased positions. We're working with them. They don't have control of the spaces for a tremendous amount of time, and we are working with them. We have done deals with Kmart and Sears in the past. And particularly, we closed last year on Christiana, which was a property that they owned, that was a product service center for them. And we worked with them for 5 years to get that site redeveloped. And then upon getting the site rezoned, we were able to acquire the property and develop it on our own. So we have a good relationship with them, and we'll work strategically where it makes sense.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, regarding the comments Conor made regarding the power center redevelopment strategy. Just curious whether you found that grocer-anchored power centers kind of consistently sell at lower cap rates than [indiscernible] when you estimate that, that can result in?","Conor C. Flynn","Yes, it definitely compresses the cap rate when you can add the grocery component into a power center. It's probably between 50 to 150 basis points depending on the location and who the surrounding retailers are. But not just from a cap rate compression standpoint, it's a great thing to boost surrounding retailer sales because the traffic flow is dramatically increased when you have that grocery component. And originally, we thought that this new strategy was only going to be dedicated toward the specialty grocer sector. But what's been a huge boost for us is now the traditional grocers are trying to take advantage of this as well, and it might have something to do with the supply and demand factor where boxes are just not readily available. So when we can put together spaces for these grocery concepts, it's fantastic for us.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, then finally for me. In the past, merchant developers have been a major source of acquisition opportunities in the industry, but development starts have remained relatively low this cycle. I'm just curious, and again, in anticipation of ICSC, I'm just curious whether you're seeing any evidence of any material increase in terms of merchant development starts?","David B. Henry","No, we really haven't. We think it's going to remain muted for quite a while. The few developments you are seeing are generally smaller and generally food anchors. So those large 800,000 to 1 million square-foot large scale spec developments of years ago, they just haven't come back yet. So the total supply in terms of new supply, we expect to remain very, very low for a while. Remember, we're still in a recovery mode in terms of rents getting back to previous high levels. So the economics are still tough for developers to make a lot of sense for a lot of [indiscernible].","Conor C. Flynn","And multi-family developers are really driving up prices in terms of land. So we really -- when you do a retail development versus a multifamily development, it's really hard to make the numbers pencil.","Operator","Next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Glenn, I guess one for you, a question on the guidance. In the guidance detail on the back of your supp, we see that the full-year portfolio contribution is up a bit in the forecast for this year versus what you were forecasting last quarter. Despite you leaving these same-store NOI outlook unchanged. So is that reflective of dispositions, perhaps, occurring later in the year than expected? Or maybe you're taking a wait-and-see approach for your same-store NOI guidance and maybe you'll wait until next quarter before revising it upward?","Glenn Gary Cohen","Well, again, it's up. It's up modestly, right? If you look at where it is, it's only a few million dollars up. So it doesn't move the same-site NOI needle all that much. And part of it is a little better performance really coming from this Kimstone portfolio, which is not in the same-site NOI number. But overall, the portfolio is performing better. So it is early in the year, though. But we feel comfortable with our guidance range.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then a question on the impact for the first quarter of snow. I'm just curious on how much that might have taken a bite out of your NOI in the first quarter?","Conor C. Flynn","Yes, we actually saw the snow have a 15 to 20 basis point impact on our same-site NOI numbers this quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I saw that you're marketing the centers in the big portfolio out on the West Coast, and I was wondering if that was a JV you guys expected to exit outright? Or if that's just part of a -- I'll call it a price discovery process, maybe under a right of first refusal?","Conor C. Flynn","It's part of our simplification strategy, that is a JV that back last year, if you remember, we split the portfolio into 2, and this was the remainder of that portfolio. We are in the market with that portfolio, and we'll see what the pricing comes in at. But it's a portfolio that has some good locations, but also is mixed. So we're marketing it as a portfolio to see what kind of price discovery we can find.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just a follow-up on the TIs on new leases, excluding redevelopment assets, has been running kind of in the $20 a square foot range the last few quarters. I think Kimco used to pride itself on really its lack of TI contribution in prior years. Is that just, I guess, what's necessitated in this environment? Or is that really a function of your shift to sort of a higher quality type of property that's maybe driving increased TI contribution?","Conor C. Flynn","I think it's a little of both. Historically, we have been running as the low cost provider and many of our assets, I think, require some upgrading. So you're seeing that in terms of when we reposition an asset with a new anchor, we want to make sure that we bring the asset up to a competitive level. So we are investing quite a bit in terms of redevelopments as well as some property upgrades to help curb appeal, and the TIs have ticked up a little bit, but I think that's part of our strategy going forward.","Operator","Next question comes from Jason White from Green Street Advisors.","Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on size. It looks like obviously guys are the biggest in the group. But as you look at some other sectors, there's kind of behemoths in their group. So is there a benefit to even larger scale in the shopping center peer group? Or is size, once you get to your level, kind of irrelevant?","David B. Henry","Well, we think we have 2 benefits. One is the total size and the number of properties we have, but also being national in scale. That helps us with retailers. We're at the top of their list in terms of landlords they want to sit down and talk to and review their expansion plans and their desire to meet their store count. So it does give us a little bit of an edge having so many properties and having so many relationships with these different retailers. It also helps from the cost standpoint on our side. We're more productive and there's more efficiencies in our back office when you spread our cost over so many properties and so many different leases.","Conor C. Flynn","I would just add that I think size makes a difference when you have a controlling interest in specific submarkets. So as you can see when you look at our map, we're trying to get a lot more concentrated around the major gateway markets because we believe that there is significant pricing power when you can control significant submarkets, and that's what we're trying to get to. I don't think that the size necessarily matters in our sector because of the amount of strip centers that are in the population. But if you can concentrate your ownership around corridors, retail corridors that are very successful, then you can use us to your advantage.","Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","So if Kimco was to, say, double in size, you don't think there's much incremental benefit to the extra square footage added?","Conor C. Flynn","It really depends on where those -- when you double in size, where those assets are. If you own the 3 or 4 corners in the best market, absolutely, then you can definitely use that to your advantage as leases roll and you can see how to upgrade the tenants and push rents. But again, and maybe, it'll add significant redevelopment opportunities when you do control a lot more real estate. But it really is, I think, market specific and what you want to try and capture there, is where the growth is coming from.","Operator","Next question comes from James Bambrick from RBC Capital Markets.","James Bambrick - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Regarding the 37 net leased properties you sold in the quarter, were those the same net leased assets you acquired a couple of years ago? And also does that eliminate your net lease exposure? Or do you have a bit more that you're looking to sell?","David B. Henry","These R&D part of the portfolio, a large portfolio of net leased restaurants we did acquire a couple of years ago that was fairly public. So far, we've sold 42 of those net leased restaurants. Original cost was about $58 million, we've sold them for $70 million. So there were some nice gains in that. We have 29 more to go, 20 of them are under agreement to sell, so we are liquidating those net leased restaurants. But you shouldn't confuse these net leased restaurants with our net leases that we have lots of different net leases with different types of tenants. We just think it's a great time to sell these net leased restaurants and some of these are in secondary markets and the 1031 market in particular is very aggressive right now.","Operator","Next question comes from Nathan Isbee from Stifel.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Some recent press reports have the Safeway consortium preparing to tee it up for an IPO. Can you discuss what you've accomplished there so far and how close you are to an event?","Raymond Edwards","Again, this is Ray Edwards. With regard -- the Safeway transaction [indiscernible] closed in the end of January this year. And the one thing that is public, that is out there, is that we did come to agreement with SUPERVALU regarding the transitional service agreement and the wind down of our dependency on them, so we can be a standalone company. So that's what we're really focused on. Bob Miller and his team are working on merging a 20-store [ph] chain right now and focused really on getting that done. We're very happy with its performance to date. As to what our exit strategy is? Obviously, you think about that every day, but it's really too early to tell where we're going to be and how it's going to end up.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Jim Sullivan from Cowen Group.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Sure. Just a quick follow-up question here. Conor, you had mentioned about the acquisition market for secondary markets particularly being red-hot. And I'm just curious -- obviously, it's been a strong appetite across the quality spectrum, but I'm just curious, in your view, if you think that the cap rate -- we're seeing cap rate compression between primary and secondary markets or whether the spread remains where it was, say, about a year ago?","Ross Cooper","This is Ross Cooper. I would say that there is a little bit of compression certainly between the secondary markets and the primary. But at the same time, you're also seeing the primary markets continue to go further lower, as Milton has indicated in prior quarters that he expects. So there is a little bit of compression certainly, but we're also seeing the A quality in primary markets come down a little bit as well. So it's a good time to be a seller in those secondary markets, but it's also a pretty challenging market to be buying in the A and primary markets as well.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I know that can be difficult to assess exactly why this might be happening, but do you see more buyers out there for the secondary markets now than they did a year ago? And there was reference to the yield-driven acquisition strategy. But does there just seem to be more funds teed up who want entry into that product type?","Ross Cooper","Yes, I would absolutely say that's accurate. On our disposition when we're in the market, we're seeing significantly more bidders and all different types of bidders, both private institutions, bidding on properties that a couple of years ago may not have had the same response. So we're very excited about where we are on our exit strategy for the secondary market assets and expect that to continue through the end of the year.","David B. Henry","It may be worth adding that the growing CMBS ability of obtaining financing is helping for the secondary market acquisitions. CMBS is back and financing is available for the secondary assets now.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Please go ahead.","David Bujnicki","Good morning and thank you for joining Kimco's first quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me on the call are Conor Flynn, our Chief Executive Officer; Ross Cooper, President and Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, Kimco\u2019s CFO; David Jamieson, our Chief Operating Officer, as well as other members of our executive team that are present and available to answer questions during the course of this call.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of the call may be deemed forward-looking, and it is important to note that the Company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements, due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the Company's SEC filings that address such factors.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Investor Relations area of our website.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll provide a high level overview of our first quarter 2018 performance. Ross will then report on our transaction activity for the quarter and share his views on market trends and conditions. Finally, Glenn will provide details and color on key metrics and our 2018 outlook. ","2018 is the year of execution for our team here at Kimco. More specifically, we are focused on four major initiatives to help position the company for 2019 and beyond. First, execute on our disposition plan. Our disposition plan is designed to improve the quality of our portfolio, fund our developments and redevelopments, and reduce debt. ","Despite concerns that continues to surround retail real estate, we are enthused about the volume, pace and pricing of our sales. And while the equity markets continue to wrestle in valuations for retail real estate, the debt markets remain wide open to finance open air shopping centers due to the strong credit tenants that are performing well in the changing environment. ","While Ross will go into more detail on the dispositions and market conditions generally, I think it is worth noting here that even while we are funding projects to provide no current yields and reducing debt at rates lower than the average disposition cap rates, despite this dilutive activity, we are still producing solid results and we think earnings growth is balance sheet strength. ","Second, notwithstanding our record-setting leasing year in 2017, we expect to further improve upon our leasing volume this year and are off to a strong start. Our leasing volume is almost exactly where we were at this point last year, and for the first time in over ten years, our sequential occupancy in the first quarter improved and now sits at 96.1%. ","Occupancy for our anchor boxes increased slightly to 98.3% and we maintain small shops at 89.6%. This is quite a feat for the first quarter which historically experiences elevated seasonal store closures and bankruptcies and is another indication of the healthy demand for our core markets for high quality open air shopping centers. ","In terms of our leasing spreads for the quarter, new leasing spreads came in at 15.6% and renewals and options at 7.3% for a combined 8.1%. Our leasing efforts resulted in same-site NOI of 2.6%, which is our 32nd consecutive quarter of positive growth. The portfolio continues to dramatically improve as our average base rents is up 19% to $15.69 from $13.18 in just four years. ","Third, continue to deliver on our development and redevelopment pipeline to create high-quality high-growth assets. Tenants at Grand Parkway Phases I and II are now open and operating and generating above average sales for our best-in-class retailers. ","We are pleased to announce that Dania Phase I is now anchored by a Lucky specialty grocer to fill out a great line of retailers set to open this summer. Dania Phase I is currently 93% pre-leased. ","As we have said on numerous occasions, real estate is about location and this area of Fort Lauderdale is tracking as one of the fastest growth areas across the United States. Lincoln Square, our mixed use project in Philadelphia Center City is now pre-leasing apartments and we are excited to announce that Sprouts Farmers Market will anchor that project by retrofitting the historic train station on the site. ","Our signature series projects are making tremendous progress as we continue to unlock the embedded value of our real estate allowing them to become major growth contributors for Kimco going forward. ","Fourth, further improve the balance sheet to enable us to reposition our portfolio for the future and provide safety for a steady and reliable dividend. We ended the first quarter with consolidated net debt-to-recurring EBITDA at 5.7 times and only $8 million outstanding on our $2.25 billion unsecured line of credit. ","While we are proud to be only one of a dozen in Triple B Plus or BAA1 rated REITs, we continue to seek opportunities to improve upon this rating. We recognize there are some challenges ahead as we move to execute on these initiatives and are confident that we\u2019ll prepare to meet them head on. ","For example, our 22 Toys \"R\" Us locations which represent 90 basis points of our total annual base rents and a 130 basis points of occupancy are already seeing significant demand from our list of growing retailers that are in search of high-quality locations. ","In addition to the thriving categories of off-price, health and wellness, specialty grocer, home improvement, furniture, arts and crafts and entertainment, we have started to see new demand coming from co-working facilities, hospitality groups, and medical facilities. The quality of our centers creates future opportunities to reposition or reinvest them for the highest and best use to drive long-term shareholder value. ","In conclusion, our team remains both motivated and focused to reach and exceed our goals. Our high-quality coastal related portfolio combined with the strength of our platform will generate significant long-term shareholder value through numerous levers of NOI growth and a stable and safe dividend. ","And now, I will turn it over to Ross. ","Ross Cooper","Thank you, Conor. We are extremely pleased with our first quarter transaction activity as outlined in the related press release earlier this month. With the sale of 21 shopping centers or $210 million of Kim share, we continue to execute on our 2018 disposition goals and are well on our way to hitting our target of $800 million at the midpoint. ","In line with our continued focus on owning a coast related portfolio, a majority of the properties sold were located in the Midwest. The blended cap rate was at the low-end of our expected range reflecting positively on both the quality of the centers being sold and the investor demand. Through the first four months of the year, we are impressed by the level of activity and the profile of those bidding on our properties. ","Demand for our sites is being driven by the combination of cap rates in the mid to high seven range, coupled with readily available debt capital at continued low interest rates resulting in compelling returns for the investor. On average, we are receiving five to six bids per property compared to an average of three to four in 2017. ","Indeed, new capital formations have emerged to take advantage of the opportunistic yields that can be achieved. Additionally, we are seeing pass buyers who have been sidelined in recent years reemerge after being priced out of the market. Other buyers include private regional operators with strong track records, partnering with institutional and private equity capital with significant liquidity and a desire to own retail.","While supply of centers on the market has ticked up, in our experience so far this year, the demand has met the supply and we don\u2019t envision this dynamic changing. Within our specific portfolio, we have sold to private operators, private equity, 1031 exchange buyers and private REITs. All has been active given the strength and stability of the cash flows we are selling coupled with debt capital to match at historically wide spreads. ","We currently have another $500 million plus under contracts with an accepted offer and maintain our full year guidance range for both net sales volume and cap rates. We continue to see within core major markets; there is no shortage of demand for institutional quality assets with prices continuing to achieve historically low cap rates. ","Given our anticipated spend on the development and redevelopment program, coupled with our focus on improving debt metrics; we maintain our disciplined strategy of passing on new acquisition opportunities in the short-term. ","Bottom-line however, is that retail real estate is in demand. Glenn will now provide additional color and insight on our financial performance for this quarter. ","Glenn Cohen","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. 2018 is off to a strong start as evidenced by the level of leasing activity, same-site NOI growth and the execution of our disposition plan. In addition, solid progress has been made on our development and redevelopment projects which will further fuel our growth in 2019 and beyond. ","Now for some color on the first quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $0.3 per diluted share for the first quarter 2018 as compared to $0.37 per diluted share for the first quarter last year. The current quarter includes $7 million of transactional income comprised primarily of $4.2 million forgiveness of debt, $4.7 million of profit participations from the disposition of certain preferred equity investments, as well as $1.5 million of unrealized losses related to our marketable security portfolio. ","The latter charge results from the adoption of new FASB guidance on financial instruments for acquiring unrealized gains and losses from marketable securities to be included in the income statement instead of the equity section of the balance sheet. ","Also during the first quarter, we reclassified personnel cost directly related to property management and property operations from G&A to the operating and maintenance account in the income statement. We believe this change provide a better comparability to our peers and old periods have been adjusted to reflect the change which had no impact on reported net income, FFO, or FFO as adjusted. ","In terms of FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes non-operating impairments and transactional income and expense, first quarter 2018 came in at $157.8 million, compared to $155.8 million last year with $0.37 per diluted share in each quarter. ","2018 first quarter results include increased consolidated NOI contribution of $6.6 million resulting from higher minimum rent and recovery rates attributable to greater occupancy from a year ago. Offsetting this increase was higher financing cost primarily attributable to the larger level of preferred stock outstanding as compared to a year ago. ","As Conor mentioned earlier, the operating portfolio delivered solid occupancy growth, positive leasing spreads, and same-site NOI growth. Same-site NOI growth excluding redevelopments was 2.6% for the first quarter 2018 compared to a comp of 2.1% last year. This was substantially driven by minimum rent increases contributing 240 basis points, improved \u2013 tax recoveries adding 60 basis points and offset by lower percentage rent of 30 basis points and higher credit loss of 10 basis points. ","Our first quarter same-site results well outperformed the 1.25% level we initially guided to. This is attributable to several positive factors including a lower level of vacates than budgeted, no leases rejected from the Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy during the first quarter, and the timing related to certain dispositions. ","As a result, we are raising the low end of our full year same-site NOI guidance range from 1.25% to 2% to 1.5% to 2%. On the balance sheet front, we paid off $173 million of non-recourse mortgage debt during the quarter ending the period with liquidity in excess of $2.4 billion. We had minimal debt maturities through 2020 and our weighted average debt maturity profile stands at 10.7 years one of the longest in the REIT industry. ","During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $15.17 totaling $24.3 million under the company\u2019s common share repurchase program. And as previously announced, the underwriters exercised their overallotment option in January 2018 on our Series M 5.25% preferred originally issued in December 2017 providing us additional proceeds of $33.4 million. ","Consolidated net debt-to-recurring EBITDA improved to 5.7 times from the 5.9 times level at year end and six times a year ago. On a look through basis including our pro rata share of JVs and preferred stock outstanding, net debt-to-recurring EBITDA was 7.2 times. Our objectives are to reduce consolidated net debt-to-recurring EBITDA to 5.5 times and on a look through basis to 6.5 times by 2020. ","A key driver to this will be the EBITDA contribution expected to come from our signature series development projects, which are at varying stages of completion with $465 million invested to-date. We are extremely pleased with the construction and leasing progress made during the first quarter. Grand Parkway Phase II, Dania Phase I, Lincoln Square and Mill Station remain on track to begin cash flowing in the latter part of 2018 and be significant contributors to 2019 growth. ","Regarding guidance, we are reaffirming our NAREIT FFO per share and FFO as adjusted per share guidance range of $1.42 to $1.46. The key to our success is continued execution. We remain confident we will deliver and with that we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions. ","David Bujnicki","Ready to move to the Q&A portion of the call, to make it more efficient, we ask that you may ask a question with one additional follow-up. If you have additional questions, you are more than welcome to rejoin the queue. Natalia, you could take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] ","David Bujnicki","You can take Jeremy please, I guess, he is the first on the queue. Natalia? Hey Jeremy, are you there?","Jeremy Metz ","Hello, can you guys hear me?","David Bujnicki","Yes, we can hear you.","Jeremy Metz ","Yes, thanks and good morning guys. So, in terms of the Toys, you have the 22 boxes here. I think last call you were talking about kind of seeing where that process shook out. It didn\u2019t necessarily sound like you are assuming all went dark this year. ","So just given the outcome here, I was wondering if you could talk about how much room this leaves you in terms of your bad debt and closing reserves, for additional closures from this point and then also if you can talk about what the mark-to-market is today on those boxes?","Glenn Cohen","Sure, it\u2019s Glenn. Hi, Jeremy. In terms of where our bad debt reserves are, we\u2019d remain comfortable that our 100 basis points of credit loss that we have budgeted for in our guidance is enough to support 2018 as it relates to Toys \"R\" Us. Again, keep in mind where we are. They have paid rents in full for all sites through April so far. ","There are four sites I believe that have been rejected and those stores are closed. And we haven\u2019t gotten rejection notices on the balance of them. Now we\u2019ve budgeted that many of them will close in the second half of the year, but we can remain very comfortable where we are that our guidance incorporates that closure. ","David Jamieson","And then Jeremy, this is Dave Jamieson. Just as it relates to the mark-to-market, we are seeing this as the mid-double-digits in terms of a positive comp for a spread amongst the 22. And just to clarify, the closures we have budgeted most of them to go vacant in Q2 and in terms of the level of activity that we\u2019ve been seeing on all these boxes, it\u2019s significant and we have leases out for several already. LOIs working on the balance of the locations. So, as Conor mentioned in his script we feel very optimistic about the opportunities here.","Jeremy Metz ","Appreciate that color. And then, Conor, just one for you in terms of the buyback. You did a modest amount here in the first quarter. The stock has clearly been under pressure. So, I am assuming it remains an attractive capital allocation option today as well. But you still have a lot of developments you marked for ht year, so with that in mind, should we expect buybacks should remain rather minor, at least in the near-term given your current spending needs?","Conor Flynn","Well, you are right. We do think it\u2019s in a compelling option for us where we sit today. We are getting further along with our dispositions and that\u2019s really what we have earmarked to match fund our redevelopments and developments. We\u2019ve seen nice, as Ross covered in his remarks, we have seen nice execution there and continue to see more sales closing weekly. ","So, as we look forward, we get more comfortable with the 5.25 that we\u2019ve earmarked for our redevelopment and development this year. And then look at our cost of capital, look at where our shares are trading, and continue to think that buying back of the shares is a compelling option for us. ","Jeremy Metz ","Thanks, guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson. ","Ki Bin Kim ","Thanks, good morning everyone. Going back to the disposition topic, it looks like you\u2019ve made a lot of progress already early in the year. And I know dilution is painful and you don\u2019t have much debt maturing, but what are the factors that are kind of stopping you from doing maybe more later in the year or next year? ","Conor Flynn","Well, I think that we are constantly evaluating our portfolio. We \u2013 as Conor mentioned, the 5.25 is first and foremost the priority in terms of spend \u2013 for the redevelopments and developments. We do want to continue to delever where we can notwithstanding the fact that there is not a whole lot as that matures in the near-term. ","But we are going to continue to execute on the plan. We have a lot in the market today. Not everything will close. We have other deals that are awaiting some lease up or options to be exercised before they\u2019ll be introduced to the market. ","So, we do expect there will be some new assets that are now in the market currently that will be brought to the market in the latter part of the year, some of which may trickle over to the beginning of next year. But we are very focused on completing our dispositions for this year and then determining where we sit as to the latter part of this year as we look into 2019. ","Ki Bin Kim ","Okay. And, maybe a question for Glenn, if I remember correctly your lease spread definition comp floor spaces that are \u2013 that hasn\u2019t vacant for under a year. Is that correct? And if you have any additional color on, if you made that definition more inclusive of maybe two years or longer, how would your lease spreads look like?","Glenn Cohen","We have not changed the definition of our lease spreads and it\u2019s been 16 months for \u2013 like ever.","Ki Bin Kim ","Okay.","Glenn Cohen","So no change,- we don\u2019t change. ","Ki Bin Kim ","Basically \u2013 yes, or four quarters? ","Glenn Cohen","It\u2019s right, okay. In four full quarters. ","Ki Bin Kim ","And then, but if you made that definition a little bit longer for spaces on maybe not two years or so, would that make any kind of material difference on your lease spreads?","Glenn Cohen","No, not necessarily. I mean, I think what lease spreads is, I think we\u2019ve communicated in the past as well, it is lumpy. It\u2019s about the population that under renewal or seems time in any given quarter. So you always have to keep that into consideration, but when you look at the historic trend and where we see going forward, we are pretty much right on track as that gets customary practice from what we\u2019ve seen of our peers to utilize the four quarters or 12 months. ","Ki Bin Kim ","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. ","Christy McElroy ","Hi, good morning everyone. Just going back to the same-store NOI growth, just it sounds like this is the higher Q1 number versus what you are expecting was occupancy-driven. Maybe with the Toys closures and everything happening in terms of commencement versus the vacancies that you are expecting. ","Maybe you can kind of walk us through the same-store trajectory for the rest of 2018 and then, with the Toys boxes, kind of vacating mid-year and recognizing that it\u2019s in your 2018 guidance, but how should we be thinking about sort of that growth rate heading into 2019 given that Toys has a much greater impact on next year?","Conor Flynn","So, at least, in terms of the current projection, again, we raised the lower end of our guidance from 1.25% to 1.5% with a full range of 1.5% to 2%. We still remain comfortable at the high-end of that range even with the impact of Toys \"R\" Us. Again, it\u2019s going to be impacted on the latter part of the year and if you look at really even the first quarter, the key driver which is very encouraging for all of us, the key driver was minimum rent increases. ","I mean, the bulk of the increase, 240 basis points is coming from minimum rents coming online. A lot of the lease ups and the leasing we\u2019ve done over the last year is now starting to flow, right. Cash \u2013 same-site NOI, cash base for us the way we are doing it. So you are getting starting to get all the flows from many of these TSA boxes and other boxes that we are baking that are coming on. ","Now we still have an economic occupancy versus leap occupancy gap of 260 basis points. It\u2019s narrowed only 10 basis points. As the Toys boxes start to vacate, that gap could widen again, but there is a lot of opportunity for that gap to narrow over time. So, again, we remain very comfortable with where we are with 2018. The impact on 2019, it\u2019s a little early to tell you. ","We really need a little bit more time to see what\u2019s really going to happen with all of these Toys boxes. Again, we don\u2019t have rejection notices on the rest of them yet. Some of our boxes were in the \u2013 which also filed for bankruptcy recently. But they are trying to sell a lot of those leases. So, I mean it\u2019s possible some of these leases get bought by someone else and new tenant just continues on with no gap. So, it\u2019s too early to really tell how much is going to happen in 2019, we\u2019ll get there. ","Christy McElroy ","Okay. And then, just, Ross, you had talked about, in terms of buyer demand, more bidders out there, financing markets wide open. One of your peers this morning, which is primarily selling assets on the West Coast and buying talked about fewer bidders out there and financing less available. Do you think that that\u2019s geographic in terms of the differential in what you are seeing based on what you are selling versus other areas of the country or by asset type? What do you think the differential is there?","Ross Cooper","Yes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s geographic as we are selling assets nationally even though the majority have been in the central region this quarter. When we look at the assets that we are selling, I mean, we really position them to be put on the market at a point in time where we think that they are extremely attractive to investors. ","We just closed yesterday actually on a large power center in Springfield Missouri that was north of $50 million and we had a substantial amount of bidders beyond the 5 to 6 that I mentioned on average. So, I think for the right products, in the right market with good credit tenants that\u2019s financeable. We\u2019ve seen a lot of interest in those assets. ","So, clearly with the number of assets we have, some are more attractive than others, but we are executing on a large percentage of those that we are marketing and we don\u2019t see that trend slowing down. ","Christy McElroy ","All right. Thanks for the color. ","Ross Cooper","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.","Rich Hill ","Hey, good morning guys. I want to just dig into G&A a little bit. I recognize that you sold assets over quarter-over-quarter and look like you have some pretty good velocity there. But it look like maybe G&A came down $10 million 1Q 2018, versus 4Q 2017. Bigger number than maybe what we are expecting. Anything to that or any way we should think about that?","Glenn Cohen","Sure, Rich. It\u2019s Glenn. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we reclassified personnel cost, specifically related to property management and operations from G&A into the O&M line. And if you look at the change in the guidance, the G&A guidance, it\u2019s about $32 million less from where we first put it out after we do this reclass. ","So, G&A is a little bit lower, but the bulk of it really is a reclass from G&A to O&M, about $8 million and you will see that consistently. Also, as I mentioned, all of the periods previously have booked and adjusted. So you can have an apples-to-apples mix.","Rich Hill ","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just, one thing coming back to the same-store NOI guide, obviously, a really impressive 2.6% this quarter. Am I thinking about this correctly that if you look at the midpoint for your revised guide of 1.75. ","Then that implies that you are going to be about less than 1.5 for the rest of the year and is that really just reflective of \u2013 sort of maybe some timing in Toys \"R\" Us and while 1Q was a little bit better, the rest of the quarters might be some headwinds as you do get those stores back? Or how should we think about the velocity of that same-store NOI for the rest of the year?","Conor Flynn","Well, as I mentioned earlier, we are comfortable towards the upper-end of our guidance range. We remain there. We want to play it out a little bit. Again, it\u2019s very hard to really forecast the total impact on 2018 for Toys \"R\" Us, because we just don\u2019t know how many we are going to get back. So, midpoint of the guidance overall, we\u2019d get 1.75. But as I mentioned, we still remain comfortable with the higher-end of our current guidance range. ","Rich Hill ","Got it. Thank you for clarity. I appreciate it. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Nikki Yulico with UBS.","Nicholas Yulico","Thanks. I guess, just on Albertsons. How should we think about, if Albertsons, the Rite Aid merger doesn\u2019t go through, how does that affect your thinking in terms of the need for more asset sales to help fund development and redevelopment in 2019?","Glenn Cohen","It really doesn\u2019t impact us. I mean, the models that we are using internally had not modeled anything in for Albertsons. So, if and when, and we hope it\u2019s when, it happens, that\u2019s just going to be upside for us and provide us enormous amounts of optionality in terms of where our cost of capital is at that point to figure out the best way to deploy the capital that is earning zero today. ","Nicholas Yulico ","Okay. And just one other question going back to the guidance recognizing the bump at the low-end to same-store NOI wasn\u2019t a huge change. How come there was no benefit though to FFO guidance?","Glenn Cohen","Well, again, it\u2019s early \u2013 and it\u2019s really early in the year. We just put out our guidance in February. We want to again still see how Toys \"R\" Us plays out and we think, we better up leaving our guidance where it is for another quarter and then we\u2019ll see where we are at the end of the second quarter. ","Nicholas Yulico ","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. ","Craig Schmidt ","Thank you. I just wonder of the assets sold and those under contract, what percent of the dispositions will be from the Midwest?","Conor Flynn","Yes, we\u2019ll continue to see a majority of the dispositions coming from the Midwest. We\u2019ll continue to prune assets out of other regions throughout the country. But we are very much focused on reducing the exposure in the central part of the country and ensuring that the coast become a more prevalent part of the portfolio. ","So, we actually have an asset that\u2019s set to close tomorrow, a power center in Chicago. I mentioned that the deal closed yesterday in Missouri. So, we do continue to make progress on exiting the central region over the course of the year. ","Craig Schmidt ","Great. And then, maybe this is for Dave. On average, how long will the time be between let\u2019s say, a rejected Toys being leased and when it\u2019s actually occupying and paying rent?","David Jamieson","Sure. Yes, Craig. Yes, as each of these boxes vary in size and location dependent on what you love to do with the box, the timing itself can vary. So, you can look at anywhere from eight to ten months some time, it could be slightly sooner, it could be slightly longer. ","So, again, it\u2019s really hard to tag a specific timing. It\u2019s really a matter of what you do with it. Do you back sell with a single tenant, do you choose to split the box and get higher rent, or does it create a new opportunity for repositioning or redevelopment and otherwise wasn\u2019t possible unless you got the Toys back.","Craig Schmidt ","Great, thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. ","Samir Khanal ","Hi, good morning guys. I guess, your same-store NOI growth in the quarter was certainly much higher and I think most people expected with \u2013 I know there was a jump in the recovery ratio and that was a benefit. Can you provide a little bit more color around that?","Conor Flynn","Sure. So, we\u2019ve been on a program over the last year-and-a-half to convert more tenants to this camp versus just waiting on pro rata. And I think that\u2019s actually starting to take hold and has some positive impact on the recoveries. ","Samir Khanal ","So, as we kind of model going forward, is that kind of more of a 1Q related item, because you went from sort of 77% to 80%. So what\u2019s sort of\u2026","Conor Flynn","It\u2019s probably more weighted towards the first half of the year. Again, as you think about what happened during the first quarter, right, so the amount of landscaping that you are doing, the amount of roofing, the amount of patching and parking lots that you are doing, those are more items that are happening in the second, third, and fourth quarters when the weather is a little bit better. ","So, we do benefit a little bit in the beginning part of the year from that fixed term analysis. But, I think overall, we still feel that our recoveries will be stronger than they have been in the past. And we have higher occupancy. Don\u2019t \u2013 we also have higher occupancy. So the revolving rate is higher from having occupancy up 80 basis points. ","Samir Khanal ","Right, okay. And I guess, as a follow-up, can you maybe talk a little bit about your watch list today versus maybe six months ago. I mean, you\u2019ve certainly highlighted sort of all the positives, but as I kind of think about growth in the second half of 2018 and even in 2019, I mean, what are the categories that could create noise or sort of be the sort of derailed growth, let\u2019s say, in 2019, I mean there is certainly, the Petsmart, Petco come up, what are the other categories that you are concerned about? ","Conor Flynn","Yes, I think that when you look at our watch list tenants, I mean, the categories really haven\u2019t changed at all that much. And when you look at some of the retailers that have run into a bit of trouble, it\u2019s really sometimes debt-related, because they are overleveraged and they are running into that. So, when we look at our sector, we continue to think that one of the biggest benefits of owning Kimco\u2019s shares is the wide diversity we have from a tenant base. ","And we continue to see the benefits of that as Sports Authority and Toys are really, yes, we are getting boxes back, but it gives us an ability to mark-to-market those boxes. The mark-to-market opportunity within our portfolio is significant and just on the anchor boxes alone we are 66% below market and when we say that over 98% occupied in our anchor boxes, those are opportunities we love to get back and we are really seeing the benefit of this transformation of the portfolio that we\u2019ve been doing over a number of years. ","And so, this is the first time we\u2019ve actually seen occupancy uptick in the first quarter in ten plus years. So, all the hard work that we\u2019ve been doing is starting to pay off and so, we do see that there is going to be opportunity to continue to have mark-to-market opportunities within the portfolio in the future. ","Samir Khanal ","Okay, thanks guys. ","Operator","Our next question comes from [Indiscernible] from RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, my first question, so, for the 260 basis points of that spread of lease versus the occupied occupancy, how much is shop versus anchored tenants? And then, how much will \u2013 of that space will be occupied by year-end?","Conor Flynn","We are going to have to get back to you on the break out of that 260 point spread. The majority of it \u2013 I would say is, probably anchor base, but the split, I\u2019ll have to get details for you.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then, on the Dania point, it looks like the cost went up by about $21 million. Is this due to the addition of Lucky\u2019s market and what type of return will you see on the incremental investment? ","Conor Flynn","It is key to the Lucky\u2019s grocery store that we have added to the line-up there. We are excited to have a grocery anchor now to really benefit and round out the last anchor box in that asset. We\u2019ve also added a pro rata share of offsite improvements for the site into the cost and are actually returns have gone up since we\u2019ve added Lucky\u2019s to the pro forma. So, we are enthused about having them to be the last anchor box. ","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. ","Alexander Goldfarb ","Good morning. Good morning out there. Just two for me. First, on the Albertsons, I saw that they passed the \u2013 they got passed the Hot-Scott period that expired. What are the next hurdles that they need to go through on the merger as far as timing? And is there anything that\u2019s come up that you think would delay anything?","Conor Flynn","Hi, this is ready. The next step for the merger is for the S-4 which was filed about two weeks ago and the 30 day comment period by the SEC. Once that is completed and the financials are updated, because Rite Aid and Albertsons reported new earnings and they filed it, they will file that with a proxy, probably early to mid-June with a vote we expect in July. We have no reason to think that is not on schedule at this point. ","Alexander Goldfarb ","Okay. And then, the second is, just going \u2013 if we look at the 2020 leverage targets that you have outlined, if we then look at the dividend, it still remains basically a full payout in 2019 even with the developments coming on. So how are you guys thinking about as far as future capital plans, asset sales, as well as trying to improve the dividend coverage?","Glenn Cohen","Well, I think that the action to dividend coverage continues to improve through 2019 and through 2020 as EBITDA comes on \u2013 more and more EBITDA does come online. Now, again, although we haven\u2019t baked in any Albertsons transaction, to the extent that there is a monetization, those are further proceeds that would go towards some level of debt reduction or depending on where cost of capital is investment in assets that yield as well, which will either lower debt, and increase EBITDA. So, I think you are going to see our AFFO payout ratio continue to improve once these projects will start coming online. ","Alexander Goldfarb ","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeff Donnelly ","Thanks, Glenn. Actually, maybe just building on Alex\u2019s question about the dividend, are you able to walk through maybe more specifically to the puts and takes to AFFO that could bolster that payout ratio in your favor for the common dividend? ","It just seems like you are making progress but there is a little bit of ways to go to get to your target and, I guess, maybe what consideration do you guys use to exploring a change in the common dividend, something that\u2019s more sustainable as a way to fund your redevelopments in lieu of \u2013 or instead of dispositions?","Glenn Cohen","Well, we remain very comfortable that now that the dividend is clearly sustainable. And everyone does AFFO a little bit differently. And when you look at the CapEx a lot of this CapEx that we are investing in, good portion of it is revenue generating. So, it takes time for us to finish it up and get it flowing. But we remain very comfortable that coverage is there, certainly from an FFO standpoint, it\u2019s clearly there. ","And, look at our liquidity position. We have really no debt maturing. And we are pretty optimistic about on projects that are \u2013 when you \u2013 if you go and visit these projects, whether it be at Pentagon, Lincoln, Dania, all of these projects they are getting close to completion and will start flowing. ","It\u2019s clear to us they will start flowing in the latter part of 2018 and into 2019 and that\u2019s just going to further improve our coverage, because as we continue to execute on the dispositions, that is our funding mechanism through the development and redevelopment cost that we have. So we are not putting more pressure on the dividends. ","Jeff Donnelly ","And then, just maybe one follow-up. I know, it might be difficult to do it in the fly, but back when you guys had rolled out the 2020 vision. You had to walk through with NOI growth to get to your \u2013 sort of I think it was about 4.5% to 6% growth, that was based on four factors, organic growth, leasing creation, redevelopment and ground of development. ","I am just curious do you had to revisit that plan today, given how the landscape has changed, I guess, how do you think the composition of those contributing segments might shift? Did you think they would be as equal as they would be before? Or do you see that some have taken greater or lesser prominence?","Glenn Cohen","The one building block that is obviously changed significantly is the net acquisitions. We have obviously been a net seller this year and we\u2019ll continue to be a net seller this year. And because of where our cost of capital sits today, we think that the right capital allocation strategy is to sell lower growing assets and reinvested in our redevelopments and developments that are going to continue to improve the portfolio quality and improve the growth of the portfolio. And so that\u2019s the one piece of that that\u2019s changed and obviously the wins against retail REITs have moved against that. ","Jeff Donnelly ","Okay, thanks guys. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from \u2013 sorry?","David Bujnicki","Go ahead. ","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. ","Vincent Chao ","Hey, good morning everyone. Just going back to the comments on the private market side. Lot of the debt commentary is similarly what we\u2019ve heard for a little while from you guys, but, the number of bids being up was encouraging. Just curious if you had any sense of why now in 2018 there is more capital forming and what\u2019s really driving the increase in the number of bidders here?","Glenn Cohen","I think it\u2019s the compelling yields. While interest rates have ticked up modestly over the last few months, the spread between the cap rate and the debt that can be achieved is still extremely wide. So, it\u2019s a compelling return. ","The 7.5 to 8 cap that we are selling at are cap rates that have gotten to a point where groups that couldn\u2019t buy high quality assets at that pricing are now excited about coming back into the marketplace. So we\u2019ve executed on transactions with groups that we\u2019ve sold to in 2014 and 2015 that were pretty quiet over the last couple of years until now. ","Conor Flynn","It might also be tied to some of the retailer commentary that came out recently. If you go back and look what CEOs said about the thriving Old Navy brand and how many new stores they plan to open without banner because of the traffic and the sales that are generating there. ","Kohl\u2019s CEO came out recently and said how important open-air shopping centers are to their brand and why they think they are positioning in open-air shopping centers because of the traffic. TJX and others have come out and said, they want to be very aggressive on store opening plans, because they see the traffic generating in shopping centers. So I think the commentary it may have something to do with that, they see the value of open-air shopping centers and really the investment opportunity that sits there.","Vincent Chao ","Gotcha. Thank you. And then, just in terms of the Toys boxes, in terms of the assets you are looking to sell over the balance of the year are any of them assets with Toys in them and just curious if that\u2019s \u2013 if the announcement has shifted to thinking on those sales or buyers or \u2013 what \u2013 how that\u2019s changing buyer interest in those types of assets?","Conor Flynn","Yes, there are certainly a few assets that are on our disposition pipeline with Toys or Babies. Those as I mentioned earlier are a few of the examples where we are working on leasing to backfill that, that may push an asset that was originally slated or thought to be put in the market early in the year to the latter part of the year. ","So we are being very prudent about backfilling those making sure that we provide activity at a minimum letters of intent or leases for those spaces, so that we make sure that we are able to obtain value before we go and sell those assets. So, it may delay us slightly, but based upon the activity level that we have in those boxes, it shouldn\u2019t deter us from selling assets into the latter part of the year. ","Vincent Chao ","Okay. But no interest in selling them vacant at this point?","Conor Flynn","No. ","Vincent Chao ","Okay. Thanks. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Hong Zhang with JPMorgan. ","Hong Zhang","Hey guys. As it relates to your net disposition guidance, should we consider any assumptions of acquisitions throughout the year? Or is that\u2019s \u2013 how should thorough that?","Conor Flynn","We have no current plans to acquire assets throughout the course of this year and we are not currently working on any acquisitions. Nothing in the pipeline. So, the plan is to continue to sell and make sure that we fund all of our obligations and needs for this year on the redevelopment and developments, and delever. ","So, with where cap rates are for the types of high quality assets that we would look to acquire, if our cost of capital were different, it doesn\u2019t make sense for us at this current time. So, we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined and execute on the dispose and see where we sit going into 2019. ","Unidentified Analyst","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays.","Linda Tsai","Hi, in terms of properties being marketed for sale, today\u2019s release noted a $115 million on the market, but on the 1Q transaction activity released earlier this month, it was $330 million. What changed?","Glenn Cohen","Yes, it\u2019s a handful of those assets that were previously on the market have shifted into the accepted or under contract and then a few assets including the one that we just mentioned that closed yesterday has now moved into the closed transaction. So, as we made progress the numbers have shifted around a bit. ","Linda Tsai","Okay, thanks. And then, for Pentagon, Dania Boulevard, how are you thinking about the merchandizing for these larger scale type developments? What are some of the trends to focus on?","Conor Flynn","Well, Pentagon is a mixed use project, where we are adding in a residential tower above of the existing retail site. We think it\u2019s going to significantly drop the cap rate on that asset. We have been extremely pleased with really the market rents in that surrounding area of the projects that are recently delivered. So, we are cautiously optimistic as Pentagon comes online in 2019 that we are really well positioned to have that via a signature asset for the company going forward. ","On Dania, we really think that now with adding Lucky\u2019s grocery. We\u2019ve really rounded out the perfect mix of what we think the future of retail real estate really looks like. It\u2019s a blend of grocery and specialty grocer, especially to drive more traffic. ","Then you\u2019ve got fitness, health and wellness. You\u2019ve got really the off-price user who loves to drive traffic with these at the treasure hunt. So it\u2019s really a nice blend as well as some restaurants as well. So that\u2019s really the merchandizing mix that we think drives traffic at all points during the day and repeat customers that love to come back. ","Linda Tsai","Anything on Boulevard?","Conor Flynn","The Boulevard is making great progress too. When you look at, again, those are merchandizing mix there. We\u2019ve got a very strong grocer that\u2019s already executed. We\u2019ve got a movie theater that\u2019s going to be the entertainment piece of it. We\u2019ve got a health and wellness and fitness component that again we like to think as a complementary use. ","We\u2019ve got an off-price user that\u2019s going to drive that treasure hunter. We\u2019ve got a beauty concept that\u2019s signed up. And we\u2019ve got a restaurant row that we think is really going to be vibrant main street for that project. So, we are well ahead in terms of our pre-leasing there and think that in terms of the City of New York, that asset is going to be another signature project for Kimco. ","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","Operator","This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Bujnicki for any closing remarks.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Go ahead, sir.","David F. Bujnicki","Thank you, all, for joining Kimco's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning are Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Cohen, Chief Financial Officer; Conor Flynn, Chief Operating Officer; as well as other key executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking, and it's important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website. [Operator Instructions]","And with that, I turn the call over to Dave Henry.","David B. Henry","Good morning, and thank you very much for calling in this morning. We are very pleased to report strong second quarter results. Glenn and Conor will provide specific details, but our operating metrics continue to be excellent, led by significant increases in portfolio occupancy, including small shop space, and our 16th straight quarter of solid leasing spreads for both new leases and renewals.","With respect to the retail industry overall, the fundamentals remain strong with effective rents and occupancy improving across the board. National retailers continue to expand in the face of population growth, positive GDP, and limited new retail supply.","The annual ICSC shopping center convention in Las Vegas in May was upbeat with attendance and the number of exhibitors increasing over prior years. Given the increase in market rents, we are beginning to see the first signs of new development activity, although by no means near the size and scope of the large speculative projects built prior to 2009. In general, national retailers have found effective online strategies to complement their physical store presence, and the top 3 retailers in online sales growth all have physical stores, Macy's, Walmart and Apple.","Overall, it is encouraging to note that retail sales per person have increased by 16% from the prior peak in 2008. Consumer confidence now is at the highest level since October 2007, and retailers, in general, are very optimistic about the back-to-school shopping season.","Looking at the neighborhood and community shopping center sector itself, the industry is strong and healthy. And we believe most of our retail tenants fall in the internet-resistant category as they generally focus on necessity-based goods and services. Services alone account for 2\/3 of consumer spending and are growing. Restaurants, dry cleaners, health clubs, urgent care centers, nail salons are all examples of products and services that are very difficult to obtain in an e-commerce world.","In terms of our strategy, we continue to be focused on what we call TSR+: T for transformation in terms of upgrading our portfolio, S for simplification as we exit Latin America and reduce the number of our joint ventures, and R for redevelopment or our pipeline of active redevelopment projects is approaching $1 billion with excellent projected returns.","And finally we have our plus business, which very selectively invest in retailers who own much of their real estate. This has been a small but opportunistic and very profitable part of our company for many years and provides synergies, knowledge and experience dealing with retailers of all types.","As outlined in our earnings release, we have made notable progress across the board acquiring full ownership of many portfolios of high-quality retail assets by purchasing the interests of our institutional partners in existing joint ventures. Most recently SEB, KIF and LaSalle, with BIG scheduled to close soon. Overall, since the bottom of the recession in 2009, Kimco has purchased full equity ownership in 88 properties totaling $2.3 billion in gross value from existing joint venture partners. Many of these acquisitions were completed at very favorable cap rates due to timing and the cost savings involved in loan assumptions, transfer taxes and the lack of third-party brokers being involved.","Supplementing these acquisitions of existing Kimco-managed assets, we have also selectively acquired excellent retail properties from third parties in strong long-term markets such as Boston, Charlotte and Raleigh. Combined with the aggressive sales of secondary retail assets in our U.S. portfolio, now 180 sites comprising approximately 18 million square feet since late 2010, our portfolio has been transformed, with much improved demographics, higher average rents and increased portfolio occupancy. These actions taken together have created a significantly superior national portfolio of excellent retail properties with robust projected NOI growth and significant redevelopment opportunities.","For those interested in the status of Kimco's participation in the previously announced pending merger of Albertsons and Safeway, the transaction remains under FTC review, but our partnership is cautiously optimistic of closing the merger by year end. The Safeway shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the transaction on July 25.","With respect to Latin America, we closed another portfolio sale of 4 retail properties in the second quarter, and the announced sale at the Fibra shop of 3 more retail properties should close shortly.","In addition we have a signed letter of intent for 9 additional Mexico shopping centers, which will leave us with only 1 large shopping center in Mexico not currently under contract or letter of intent, although we do have a number of interested parties reviewing this asset. As a result, we continue to be on track to sell essentially all of our Latin American properties by year end.","Fortunately, the market for Mexican REITs, known as Fibras, continues to be strong with substantial demand for existing income property type -- of all types.","Looking quickly at Canada. Our Canadian portfolio remains a strong and solid contributor to our earnings, notwithstanding the recent softness of the Canadian dollar. Our Canadian properties remain well occupied at 95.9% with leasing spreads of 10.4% and same-site NOI growth of 3.6% before currency. There are also several significant redevelopment opportunities in the Canadian portfolio.","And now, Glenn will outline our specific financial results for the quarter, to be followed by Conor's discussion of our portfolio results, and then Milton, as usual, will provide some high-level observations.","Glenn G. Cohen","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Let me provide some detail on the results reported last night. As a reminder, we use the term FFO as adjusted to represent recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expense and nonoperating impairments.","Headline FFO represents the official NAREIT definition.","FFO as adjusted per share was $0.35 for the second quarter, up from $0.34 last quarter and $0.35 a year ago. For the 6 months ended, FFO as adjusted per share was $0.69 as compared to $0.67 last year, a 3% increase. The key drivers of our second quarter FFO as adjusted performance were attributable to increased U.S. shopping center NOI of approximately $19 million from higher occupancy levels and increased rental rates, coupled with contributions from the significant acquisition activity completed. We also benefited from lower interest expense of $2.2 million as a result of the reduced borrowing costs on our recent debt issuances. These increases were reduced by the sales of the InTown Suites investment and the American Industries portfolios last year, which contributed $11 million of FFO to the second quarter last year.","In addition, NOI was reduced by $8.5 million from the sales of the assets in Mexico and Latin America.","Headline FFO per share for the second quarter was $0.34, which includes $2 million of transactional income associated with the gains on land sales and promotes earned on the disposition of preferred equity interests. Headline FFO also includes $4 million of transactional expenses related to acquisition costs, and severance related to the wind down of our Latin America operations.","The property operations team delivered strong operating results this quarter. U.S. occupancy reached 95%, up 30 basis points from last quarter and up 110 basis points from a year ago. This is the highest occupancy level in 5.5 years, and we believe we have room to improve it further. Combined occupancy now stands at 94.8%, up 30 basis points from last quarter and up 110 basis points from a year ago.","Combined same-site NOI growth was 2.8% before the negative impact of currency of 80 basis points. Same-site NOI growth for the U.S. was 2.5%, in line with our internal forecast. We expect stronger same-site NOI growth levels for the third and fourth quarters, based on the strong leasing and occupancy gains over the past year. We are maintaining our full year guidance of same-site NOI growth in the range of 2.5% to 3.5%.","We continued to acquire high-quality properties in denser, higher-income markets from third-parties and our joint venture partners. Year-to-date, we've acquired 26 new properties for a gross price of $393 million, and the remaining interest in 25 properties from our joint venture partners valued at $777 million, including the recently closed SEB portfolio.","We furthered our recycling program efforts with the disposition of 15 U.S. nonstrategic properties for a gross sales price of $186 million during the quarter. We recognized non-FFO gains totaling $107.8 million during the quarter from property sales and the KIF portfolio transaction.","In addition, as a result of our accelerated and shortened expected hold period, we reviewed book values of over 170 properties and took non-FFO impairments of $85.7 million on those assets where we believe the fair market value is less than the book value. Please keep in mind there are substantial non-FFO gains that will be realized upon the sale of the assets which were not written down.","We are in the final phase of our exit of Latin America, with under $400 million remaining after the completed sale Dave mentioned. We have a contract for the sale of 3 properties for $96 million, our share, which is expected to close shortly. In addition, we have an LOI for the sale of 9 more properties in Mexico for $167 million, and in negotiations to sell our last asset in Chile.","As we have previously disclosed, under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, not until a company substantially liquidates its investment in a foreign country can the impact of foreign currency translation gains or losses be recognized in earnings. As of June 30, the unrealized loss due to currency associated with our Mexico and South American assets was $117 million. The final impact of currency will apply to the respective gains and losses on the sales of these operating properties and will not affect FFO at the time it is recognized.","Our acquisition target range for the year is $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, which has been substantially completed. And our disposition target range, including Mexico and South America sales, is $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion.","We continue to keep our balance sheet metrics and liquidity position in excellent shape. Early in the second quarter, we issued a $500 million 7-year bond at a coupon of 3.2%, using the proceeds to repay higher coupon maturing mortgage debt and unsecured bonds. We ended the quarter with net debt to recurring EBITDA of 5.8x, in our target range of 5.5x to 6x, and fixed charge coverage of 3x. Also, we have over $1.4 billion of immediate liquidity available to us through cash on hand and our revolving credit facility.","With respect to guidance, we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance range of FFO as adjusted per share of $1.36 to $1.40, with a bias towards the midpoint of $1.38. The guidance range includes the dilutive impact from the acceleration of dispositions and the exit from Latin America, as well as the positive impact from the significant acquisition activity and refinancing savings.","With that, I'll turn it over to Conor.","Conor C. Flynn","Thanks, Glenn. Today I will update our progress on acquisitions and disposition, and then cover the progress on our redevelopments. Finally, I will recap the leasing and operations activity for the quarter.","As outlined in our press release, we had a very active second quarter, acquiring a large portfolio in Boston and buying out our partners from the Kimco Income Fund. After the quarter end, we also bought our partner SEB's interest in 10 properties. Since the beginning of the second quarter, we have acquired 46 properties with a gross value in excess of $950 million, primarily in our key territories. The quality and demographics of these assets are excellent, and the blended cap rate is 6.2%.","While we are active in the open market, we are proceeding with caution due to historic low cap rates and continue to search for acquisitions with redevelopment opportunities that will allow our skilled associates the opportunity to unlock value for our shareholders. Recent transactions on high-quality assets reflect aggressive pricing, making our redevelopment pipeline an even more attractive use of our capital right now.","Turning to dispositions. During the second quarter, Kimco's sold ownership interest in 15 U.S. properties, 7 wholly-owned and 8 held in joint ventures, totaling 1.7 million square feet for a gross sales price of $185.6 million, including $23.3 million of mortgage debt. The implied cap rate for these assets is a blended 7.4%, and the company's share of the proceeds from these sales is $121.5 million.","Cap rates continue to compress across all quality levels as the thirst for yield has investors stepping out on the risk spectrum in search of places to put capital to work. I'm pleased with the pace of our dispositions so far this year, as we have sold 37 properties at a blended 7.8% cap rate and are taking advantage of the ideal market conditions to exit our noncore assets.","In the first half of the year, we have been a net acquirer in the U.S. But we expect to be a net seller in the second half by completing the sale of multiple portfolios and individual assets that are currently under contract. We currently have 44 properties in the U.S. that are under contract, totaling approximately $325.8 million at an implied cap rate of 8.5%.","We have prioritized the dispositions of our low-growth assets and our at-risk assets. An example of this during the quarter includes flat long-term triple net leases, 2 with Winn-Dixie in Louisiana, and 1 with Costco at a center in Ogden, Utah, marking our exit from the state of Utah. Another example is a center we recently sold in West Palm Beach, Florida, that has a Kmart at above market rents in a location where the retail note has shifted dramatically.","Bidders on these properties include public and private REITs, pension funds, high net worth individuals, international and 1031 buyers. We are cautiously optimistic that our transformation to a Tier 1 portfolio will be substantially executed over the next year.","Redevelopment projects enable us to optimize the operating performance of our core real estate holdings and continue to generate accretive returns on our invested capital. The strength of our real estate holdings provide us with an incredible opportunity to unlock value by understanding the highest and best use and delivering a superior product to fit the needs of the local community. Our redevelopment projects include multiple improvements that will create an environment that engages and focuses on the customer experience, which is critical in today's world.","All of our redevelopment projects include a significant change to the footprint of the asset. Alongside adding density, redevelopments also include site upgrades that will reduce capital expenditures for many years to come. With a focus on sustainability and asset repositioning, we have improved site lighting with LED upgrades and gateway controls that have produced energy savings of 18%. We are now integrating mobile irrigation controls, mobile lighting controls, and Wi-Fi enabling our assets to provide our shoppers a greener, safer, and omnichannel-connected environment.","Specialty grocers continued to expand and perform above the expectations, giving us the ability to add a grocery anchor to sites that have never before had all the benefits of a grocery component. This blurring of lines across traditional grocery-anchored centers and power centers bodes well for our portfolio.","The percent of our portfolio with a grocery component, based on ABR, is now 63.7%, up from 58.6% at the end of 2013. Recent deals with Whole Foods, Sprouts, Fresh Thyme Farmers Market and Lucky's provide a luxury that we previously did not have in our power centers. A specialty grocery will help drive sales to our surrounding retailers, and improve Kimco's net asset value as more and more of our shopping centers become grocery anchored.","The retailer demand is significant for these opportunities, and a great example is where we have 2 redevelopments in Florida, Tri-City Plaza in Largo, and Renaissance Center in Altamonte Springs, where the centers are close to 100% pre-leased with Whole Foods, LA Fitness, Sports Authority, Ross and PETCO all before breaking ground. We are continuing to expand our redevelopment pipeline, and this quarter added over $100 million of new projects to the pipeline. Currently, our pipeline totals $919 million, up from $792 million last quarter. We now have $314 million of active redevelopment projects, $344 million of projects under design and entitlement review, and $261 million in the evaluation phase. I am encouraged by the progress we have made to date and believe there is more to come as we comb the existing portfolio for opportunities to recapture boxes that call for a higher and better use, and focus our acquisitions to require a redevelopment component.","Before diving into leasing metrics for the quarter, I would just like to say that the U.S. same-site NOI growth of 2.5% did receive a nice pop of 40 basis points from redevelopments that we delivered this quarter. Thanks to our prolific dealmakers, the leasing volume continues to show no signs of slowing down, as we signed 183 new leases for a total of 916,000 gross square feet. U.S. occupancy rose 30 basis points to 95%, driven by a 29 basis point gain via positive net absorption and only 1 basis point gain due to dispositions. This is a great data point showcasing the hard work done by our team to fill up our remaining vacancies.","Drilling down. Anchor occupancy increased 20 basis points pro-rata to 97.8% compared to the prior quarter, and a few notable new leases this quarter include TJ Maxx, Ross, Bed Bath & Beyond, CVS, LA Fitness, Fila, Peretas and Sports Authority.","Small shop occupancy increased 70 basis points pro-rata to 86.3% compared to the prior quarter and is up 200 basis points pro-rata compared to the same quarter last year. The small shop leasing recovery continues to be led by a mix of service-based tenants and restaurants. Multiple deals this quarter were executed with national small shop operators, such as Chipotle and AT&T, in addition to regional players, including MOD Pizza and multiple deals with franchisees such as Subway and Jersey Mike's.","Of note, we also completed 91 deals with pure mom-and-pop retailers out of a total of 161 small shop leases, a good indicator that local business is bouncing back, predominantly hair and nail salons and 10 new medical deals.","Our average base rent for small shops on the entire portfolio now sits at $23.75 a foot, up $0.46 from the beginning of the year.","I would also like to welcome a new tenant to our portfolio this quarter, Expedia.com. An Expedia franchisee rented a small shop from us in North Carolina, where they plan to staff the space to help customers with their travel needs. We take this as a sign that if it helps their business, online vendors will continue to open brick-and-mortar locations.","Our new leasing spreads of 13.3% pro-rata was driven by across-the-board double-digit positive spreads on junior anchors, mid-sized shops and small shops. The average base rents on new deals was $15.93 pro-rata, which is 20% above our current average base rent. Renewals and options leasing spreads posted a 8.2% pro-rata increase, and overall leasing spreads in the U.S. increased 9.7%.","In closing, the asset base at Kimco has never been stronger, and our operations team is aligned and focused on showcasing what we do best. If you get a chance to visit a Kimco Center, I hope you notice the difference. We have received 10 city beautification awards this year and our pride of ownership is evident. We intend to give our everyday shoppers the ultimate shopping experience to keep them coming back time and time again.","And with that, I will turn it over to Milton.","Milton Cooper","Well, thank you, Conor. From time to time over the years I have trumpeted the fact that, as compared to other real estate assets, one of the unique attributes of neighborhood community shopping centers is the very, very high ratio of land to total value. The typical shopping center is comprised of a one-story building and 5x as much land as the square footage of the building's footprint. The land component often exceeds the parking requirements, and thus becomes an additional asset.","In a growing economy, land is one of the best and least risky long-term investments. It is irreplaceable, indestructible and a natural hedge against inflation. And as the land increases in values, it allows the center's extra land to be set aside for a land bank, as I like to say, for additional investment opportunities. In the meantime, the revenue generated from the improvements covers the real estate taxes and other tariff costs and other carrying costs of the land.","Today the opportunities that land banking affords us can take many forms, including the expansion of existing centers, development of our parcels, sales to third parties and possibly mixed-use development. As markets change and evolve, it is incumbent upon us to make sure that we are maximizing each asset's value in order to maximize top shareholder return.","In addition to our redevelopment projects spearheaded by Conor, we have on occasion drawn down from our land bank to unlock additional value in a mixed-use context. Where the opportunities for mixed-use projects exist, we are careful to make sure that any non-retail component enhances the primary retail component. It is this synergy that increases the overall asset's value. So for example, in 2 quality centers in Washington, D.C. and Boca Raton, we are working with the best-in-class developers to build residential apartments on excess land that we believe will create more demand for our centers' tenants, and overall, to create a better asset for long-term. Let me be specific. In Pentagon Plaza, just outside Washington, D.C, a 750-apartment project is under consideration. And in Boca Raton, Florida, we are looking at 300 residential units to complement our shopping center.","We are also considering a smaller residential project in Columbia, Maryland, which we believe will further enhance our existing retail center. Now in another instance, in the Bronx, in a shopping center that lies in the shadows of Yankee Stadium, adjacent to the Bronx County Courthouse or Bronx Municipal Building, in one of the densest parts of New York City, we built with a partner on excess land that we own behind the retail center, a five-story, 67,000 square foot office building.","Our ability to unlock additional value in our current portfolio can play an important part in our future growth. And given the size of our portfolio, and the length of ownership of many of our properties, some have been owned for more than 50 years, I am confident that we will continue to find value-creation opportunities within our portfolio.","And with that, we'll be happy to take any questions.","David B. Henry","As Milton indicated, we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Paul Morgan from MLV.","Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","If I heard you right, the 44 assets that are under contract were at an 8.5 cap rate, is that right?","David B. Henry","That's correct.","Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Is there anything that's higher than what you're blended number has been? Is there anything in terms of the mix that's noteworthy there? I mean, obviously you've been talking about cap rates across the quality spectrum compressing. And as we think about in the rest of the year and into 2015 and look at the quality of what you have that you'd like to sell from then on, I mean, is -- what's the right number to think of?","Conor C. Flynn","It's a fair assumption to say that the cap rate will continue to decrease over time. 8.5% is really the last tranche of assets that we're moving out of from the Midwest. And it's a portfolio deal that we are anticipating to close this year. And once that's completed, the assets that we will continue to look to dispose of will be at a lower cap rate.","Operator","Next question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","With your growing ground-up development initiative, can you talk a little bit more about some of the markets you're targeting and the yield you're underwriting?","Conor C. Flynn","We've started to look at our key markets. For all of our ground-up developments going forward we would develop to hold long-term. So these are our key markets where we already have boots on the ground and a portfolio of assets. And we are looking at potential adjacent parcels. We're also looking at areas where there's a lot of growth, whether it's employment or population growth. So Houston is one that we're looking at right now. Fort Lauderdale is another one that we're looking at, as well as Christiana, Delaware. So those are the 3 that I think we're really focused on to see if we could put together development deals for the next stage of the cycle. And we're underwriting to somewhere between a 7.5 to 9.5 yield.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wonder if we could get a little bit more color on the reason you're expecting the anticipated acceleration in same-store NOI in the second half, whether it's leases signed, not occupied, the pickup in small shops or maybe even a little more friendly currency exchange market?","Conor C. Flynn","Yes. No problem, that's a good question. We still have a large cushion between our property leased occupancy and our economic occupancy. There's actually 230 basis points between the 2. So those are deals that are fully baked and are yet to start flowing. And those we anticipate to come online in the second half of the year. We actually budgeted -- each year we do an in-depth asset by asset budget, and we saw that the second half of the year was actually significantly higher in terms of our same-site NOI growth. The other thing to keep in mind is we are coming off a pretty tough comp, up 4.2% in the second quarter of last year.","Operator","Next question comes from Sameer Kanal from ISI Group.","Sameer Kanal","One your leasing spreads, you guys put out at close to 10% on a blended basis here. Looking forward, maybe into next year, do think this is a good run rate? I mean the demand is certainly strong from retailers to maybe push renewals maybe into the low-double digits and mid to high double-digits do you think for new leases?","Conor C. Flynn","The demand is definitely there to continue on that trend. It will probably -- spreads tend to be driven sometimes by one large deal so you need to keep that in mind. But overall, because our portfolio is large, we do believe that our spreads will continue on that trend. The demand from retailers is not subsiding, and we continue to see, really, a good pipeline of new deals, not only on spaces we currently have vacant, but on spaces we plan to recapture. So I think that's a fair assumption.","Operator","Next question comes from Jason White from Green Street Advisors.","Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on your redevelopment pipeline. I know this is a tough question to pinpoint, but if you can kind of broad brush, when you look at the amount of the spend that's going to be on -- in deferred maintenance type projects versus true kind of expansion projects, can you kind of split that out in what's parking lots and roofs versus actual new square footage?","Conor C. Flynn","We can go in and give you more detail on that and break it out for you. Right now, the way that we look at our redevelopment projects, it's really all-encompassing. So if we have an old Kmart that we need to reposition and demolish, improving the parking lot, improving the site lighting, improving everything at the asset really goes into the redevelopment project. But if it's a smaller scale project where we're taking down only a portion of the asset and expanding it for a junior box, those are ones that really -- the majority of the costs go into the expansion of the box rather than more site improvements. But we can go into more detail there and break it out for you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Ryan Peterson from Sandler O'Neill.","Ryan Peterson","Just 1 question for me. I wanted to ask, given the demand for large boxes and scarcity of that space, is it possible that the economics might start to make sense for you to deepen small shop space and create more big boxes?","Conor C. Flynn","It's a good question. We actually have seen that be a trend, where junior boxes are actually stepping up their rents to be able to make the economics work. We have done it on a number of different sites where we combine small shops and expand out the back of the shopping center. TJ Maxx, Ross are the two that are probably the most active in that space because there's such a lack of new product and lack of supply. So there's definitely that occurring in our portfolio, and we're actually working on a number of those deals going forward as well.","Operator","Next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you've talked extensively about the captive acquisition opportunities with your existing JVs. So my question is on the cap rate spread differential between open market purchases and these JV opportunities. And I understand every deal is different. It looks like the Boston portfolio and open market deal was acquired at about a 6-ish flat yield, while the recent SEB JV was consummated at a high 6 yield. So wondering, should we view this as a representative spread? And then also, can you talk about potential disposition and redevelopment opportunities within both portfolios?","David B. Henry","Well, first of all, they vary widely. Over the past couple of years, as we've been aggressively talking with our partners, some of these deals are tougher negotiations than others. And the portfolios themselves are very different. You're right there was quite a different spread differential between the SEB transaction and the Boston portfolio. In general, we believe there's around a 50 basis points difference, if you take a look at them altogether. And a lot of that savings is not necessarily a difference in just a negotiating grade. It's the fact that there is a true win-win in these situations. There's generally not a third-party broker involved. There's generally much less transfer taxes involved. We're not talking about mortgage assumption fees. We have the right to do these things. These are very quick acquisitions. We don't have to do a lot of due diligence. We know these assets. We've been managing them. So truly is a win-win in many cases here.","Conor C. Flynn","And on the dispositions and redevelopment question. We will be selling 2 assets out of the Boston portfolio, 3 assets out of the SEB portfolio, and we've already completed 1 of 2 out of the KIF portfolio. And then on the redevelopment question, because we've been managing the SEB and KIF portfolios, we've worked over those assets pretty significantly, and the majority of our redevelopment potential comes from the Boston portfolio. There's a number of out parcels we plan to -- we actually have in the market right now to users as well as some mixed-use components where we have to go through a lengthy entitlement process in Boston, that we are optimistic about, long term, in creating value there.","Operator","Next question comes from Ross Nussbaum from UBS Securities.","Unknown Analyst","Jeremy Mertz [ph] here. Obviously you guys are making some good progress in the small shop space. You mentioned a fair amount of leases of mom-and-pops this quarter. Can you just talk about where you see small shop occupancy going in the next 12 to 24 months? Does it get up to 90%? And also, what do you think is helping drive a bit of the rebound in mom-and-pop?","Conor C. Flynn","It's a good question. I think in 24 months, we should see it get to 90%. We do have a large pipeline of pending deals that will continue on this trend in the upward momentum. We've shifted our focus to the small shop space because we think that's really a large portion of our growth going forward. But we do see still growth involved in the junior anchors and the vacancies we have left there, as well. So we do anticipate that, that will continue. And we see the rebound in local businesses. It's pretty apparent in our key markets that the mom-and-pop has come back in a major way. Hair salons, nail salons, service-based industries, restaurants, family businesses have all come back to our shopping centers. And we anticipate that to continue as the economy strengthens. The housing market seems to continue to improve. And that should coordinate -- that should correlate to more small shop deals.","David B. Henry","I would just add that the community banking system has recovered fully now and are more aggressive about local lending. Most of these smaller businesses rely on the community banking system. So if you're a jewelry store or a local dry cleaner looking for a second, you really need that community banking system to be healthy. And it is now healthy. And those loans are going up and increasing, so that's healthy.","Conor C. Flynn","I would also just add that it's such a local business, real estate, especially for the local users, that in order to target those operators you've got to have people on the ground combing the portfolio for those types of retailers to come into your shopping center. So in order to have that growth, we've really focused on putting more people into the field at the property level.","Operator","Next question comes from Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You suggested it seems that there'll be about another year, I think, of disposition activity before you're largely through with the disposition process. And I'm curious, what is the volume that you think you have left in terms of, I guess, dollars of disposition activity? And then when you're complete, what do you think your long-term same-store NOI growth rate would look like?","Conor C. Flynn","We still have about a year left to go on our dispositions pipeline, you're right. We have close to 200 assets still to move, and we think that that's going to be right around $1 billion worth of assets. From the same-site growth perspective, we think we're exiting out of our lower growth assets as well as our at-risk assets that weigh us down for such a large portfolio. And we're still targeting 3% for -- 3% plus for a continual growth rate for our portfolio.","David B. Henry","And to somebody's earlier question, we do anticipate the cap rates drifting down from that 8.5% level we've been averaging on this next $1 billion, if you will. So it shouldn't be quite as dilutive as we've had in the past.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering if we're thinking about development and redevelopment deliveries over the next 2 years, what sort of an annual number are you contemplating? And then how do you see the mix shifting to include more, I guess, new ground-up activity?","Conor C. Flynn","Right now, our focus is really on redevelopment. We've built up the pipeline relatively quickly, and we anticipate $130 million or so to deliver this year, $150 million to deliver next year, $190 million to deliver the year after that, and then $230 million to be delivered in 2017, and then continue to ramp it from there. Our ground-up developments will be additive to the pipeline and should give us a little bit more growth on the out years, because these redevelopments are assets that we can deliver in the near term. While the ground-up development when we go through the entitlement process and the pre-leasing process, it should add growth to our portfolio in the out years.","David B. Henry","What is a great sign for our industry and our company is that rents have moved up enough to justify ground-up development now. So that's a significant milestone in terms of recovering from the recession.","Operator","Next question comes from Jim Sullivan from Cohen and Associates.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Question for you guys regarding this position on Safeway. There was a shareholder vote recently that was in favor of the deal. And I guess as you proceed toward hopefully completing the deal, you have to go through the FTC. I wonder to what extent, and I can understand if you're not comfortable talking about detail on this, but I wonder to what extent the likelihood of some store closings is having, any impact at all on pricing in the market? I.e, if a lot of the Safeway\/Albertsons boxes are going to have to come back on the market with stores being closed. To what extent is that inhibiting demand or pricing or terms on deals for those grocers looking to expand in the market now?","David B. Henry","Let me first of all say that there's not any intent to close any stores. What we're working through with the FTC is whether stores have to be divested. And by that, meaning that we have to find other operators that could continue the stores in operation post-closing. And in a sense to keep it a competitive marketplace. So to close a store and cease the operations would not make it competitive [indiscernible]. So the FTC is going to be looking for us to find other buyers that are qualified by the FTC to run these stores. And at this point, there's no planned store closings due to the merging of the companies.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities.","Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","David, just a quick follow up on the comments you made about development. When you think about the timeframe over which this has happened, is that a recent phenomenon where rents have met the threshold where development makes sense? And are there -- is this a national or very specific locally phenomenon?","David B. Henry","I believe it is a recent occurrence, where rents have significantly jumped and particularly these national retailers are beginning to be particularly anxious about meeting the store count that they've promised Wall Street and internally. And I don't think it's related to any particular market. Obviously, there's stronger markets, and some of these primary markets we've talked about before are magnets for retailers that are obviously looking for where there's job growth and good demographics and population growth, is where these retailers want to expand. And I think Conor gave you a good range in terms of Houston, Florida and New Jersey as being the 3 that we're looking at now. But 6 months ago, we weren't looking at ground-up development. And I doubt many of our peers were, either. So it is a significant milestone, in my opinion, that rents have jumped to this level and the economy is doing well enough and, as I mentioned, consumer confidence being at an all-time high compared going all the way back to October of 2007. I mean, that all bodes well, I think.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Today, I'll give a brief overview of our 2018 achievements, discuss the retail real estate landscape facing us in 2019 and outline some of the things we hope to accomplish this year. Ross will then follow with an update on the transaction market, and Glenn will close with our financials and outlook for this year.","A year ago, we set some ambitious goals for leasing, development and disposition, but we knew it'll require extraordinary execution. Here, we're one year later, and I'm proud to announce that we've exceeded those goals and delivered positive results across the board. We've surpassed the high-end of our initial guidance range for FFO and same-site NOI and achieved an all-time high-small shop occupancy at over 91%. We completed several development and redevelopment projects, including our first large-scale Signature Series mixed-use development and exceeded our goal for disposition, enabling us to end the year with a much stronger and better position portfolio.","These accomplishments are testament to the exceptional efforts of our quality team. I want to thank all of our associates who live and breathe the Kimco Notwithstanding our 2018 accomplishments, we'll not and cannot rest. On the contrary, how we respond to the challenges and opportunities of 2019 and beyond will determine our future success. Winston Churchill famously said, if you don't take change by the hand, it will grab you by the throat. These words ring true as much today as when they were first Change is occurring all around us, and the retail real estate landscape is not immune.","And as the retail environment continues to evolve with new concepts and strategies to meet the needs and demands of today's consumer, the status quo is not an option. E-commerce and distribution have dramatically changed some of the most long-standing retail concepts, trade area, store counts and even what constitutes sale, just to name a few. 2019 will produce new winners and underperformers. Store sizes will change, and more e-commerce retailers will open physical locations. So while the demand for high-quality real estate in 2018 remain strong, as evidenced by our solid performance, the landscape in 2019 and beyond continues to change, and we've repositioned our portfolio to capture those opportunities that change inevitably brings.","Our strategy is simple own the best real estate in the top 20 markets where consumer demand is high and supply constraints. Our portfolio is now tightly concentrated in high-growth areas where there are significant barriers to entry. We have removed the drag from underperforming assets and have invested in our best assets and our people. We believe that the high-quality, open-air shopping center that comprises our portfolio is the right product for the future. First half, the physical store is here to stay. It may look different in the years to come, but the physical store continues to be the heartbeat of a healthy brand experience and the cheapest and most effective form of customer acquisition.","Moreover, many retailers have made it clear that they price the visibility, convenience, accessibility and modest occupancy cost that our sites offer. More specifically, retailers value with visibility of store nearby streets and highways has an important marketing tool. In addition, as more and more retailers add quick and collect shopping to their customer experience, retailers find that the local convenience and easy access of open-air shopping centers to be a marketing advantage. Retailers are also seeking other sites because of their suitability for redevelopment and our plans to create mixed-use campuses that had residential, hospitality and entertainment components, not to mention drive throughs, quick and collect areas and home delivery house.","So while the threat of from is real, we believe that in those instances where the mall space is competing with high-quality, open-air space, open-air space will often win out. As a case in point, in 2018, we were able to lease 80% of our Toys\"R\"Us boxes in just six short months, bringing in driving retailers that will enhance the overall volume and experience at these centers. Similarly, if opportunities arrive at the we're confident that we can create value and worth noting is our exposure in now limited to just 13 locations that represent 60 basis points of Kimco's total","Our Signature Series developments and redevelopments continue to come online, and we expect 2019 to be another year of successful milestones for these projects. Dania Phase I is now opened and operating and over 93% leased. Phase II is under construction with strong leasing momentum. And we've just added Phase III to the pipeline, as demand continues to be robust in the market of Fort Lauderdale Beach.","Our Lincoln Square mixed-use project in Philadelphia continues to shine and was recently voted the best new building in Philly by local residents in an online poll. The Whittemore city mixed-use project in the D.C. market is topped off and will start to lease up later this year, perfectly timed to benefit from its ideal location directly across from Amazon's new headquarters. Construction of the Boulevard Staten Island is progressing nicely in place and the project is now over 92% pre-leased. We believe the Signature Series portfolio will be a key driver of growth as the current projects are completed and the pipeline with new carefully selected redevelopment opportunities.","2019 is said to be an exciting year at Kimco as we capitalize on our Transform portfolio and drive increase cash flow and value. And now, I'll turn it over to Ross.","Ross Cooper","Thank you, Conor, and good morning. All in all, it was an excellent year in terms of the execution by our team, and I couldn't be more prouder. We finished the year selling an additional 16 shopping centers and two land parcels during the fourth quarter, totaling $357 million gross, with $228.4 million Kim share. For the full year, we sold 68 center and eight parcels with a value in excess of $1.1 billion, with approximately $940 million as Kim share, exceeding the high-end of our $800 million to $900 million guidance range.","The weighted average blended cap rate on these sales closer to low end of our targeted range right at 7.6%. In order to maximize the pricing, we primarily utilize the one-off approach consummating 71 individual transactions. So in this level of properties on a one-off basis is no easy task, and again, a real testament to our team, which includes the deal team, the legal staff, the accounting and tax departments and many others that had a critical role in making sure the execution went over smoothly.","The steps we have taken in 2018 have enhanced the overall quality of our portfolio and consisted the right and geographic locations. The redevelopment and value-creation opportunities would generate a sustained and growing level of recurring cash flow that will drive a higher NAV. We've now sold over $8 billion of real estate since 2010, reinvesting the capital higher-quality real estate in major markets with substantial future growth opportunities. As we previously indicated, given the success of our disposition activity in 2018, we anticipate substantially fewer asset sales with just a modest level of asset pruning in 2019. Proceeds will be used primarily fund expected development and redevelopment activity.","As the current trends in the market, we continue to see strong investor demand for shopping centers. During the fourth quarter, we sold a grocery and that sub-5% cap rate, with another Northern California grocery deal under contract at sub-5%. And with the 10-year treasury retreating back below 3%, pricing remain strong in all levels of quality with healthy demand. Overall, the supply of new shopping centers on the market-for-sale has decreased at several and REITs, including Kimco, have reduced their disposition pipelines for 2019. This will serve to keep the supply-demand balance favorable for sellers with cap REITs being low for the foreseeable future.","On the acquisitions front, we anticipate maintaining a very disciplined and selective approach with our most accretive use of funds earmarks primarily redevelopment opportunities within the portfolio. We still continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that come along and enhance the value of our holdings. Subsequent to year-end, we closed on a modest $31 million sale leaseback transaction with Albertson's to acquire the grocery anchors at three of our Tier 1 West Coast assets. This included one location in San Diego and two Safeway located in Phoenix and Truckee, California. We'll look forward to the opportunities and challenges ahead, I'll now pass to the Glen","Glenn Cohen","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. We ended 2018 with a stronger and higher-quality portfolio, the result of successful execution on the disposition front, strong leasing activity and the completion of several Signature development projects. With a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity position, we're poised to begin growing again. Now let me first provide some details on our 2018 fourth quarter and full year results and then commentary on our 2019 guidance.","NAREIT FFO per diluted share was $0.35 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year 2018 amount to $1.47. Included in the full year results was net transactional income, which is net of transactional expenses of $7.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share. This was comprised primarily of profit participations from our preferred equity investments, receipt of insurance proceeds related to our Puerto Rico properties in excess of our book basis and various land sale gains offset by $12.8 million of early prepayment charges related to our unsecured bond payoffs. For 2017, NAREIT FFO per diluted share was $0.38 for the fourth quarter and $1.55 for the full year, which included $11.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share of net transactional income.","FFO as adjusted, which excludes transactional income and expenses and non-operating impairments, was also $0.35 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $0.39 for the same quarter in 2017. The primary driver of the decrease was a reduction of $22 million in NOI from the sale of over $900 million of assets during 2018, offset by a $6 million reduction in financing costs due to lower debt","Full year 2018 FFO as adjusted came in at $1.45 per diluted share, in line with our previous guidance. This compares to $1.52 per diluted share for 2017. Here, again, the primary driver of the decrease is lower NOI of $27 million related to the asset dispositions during 2017 and 2018. The proceeds from the sales were used to fund development and redevelopment investment of $420 million, reduces outstanding debt by $400 million and buyback $75 million of our common stock at a weighted average price of $14.72 a share.","Turning to the operating portfolio. We continue delivering excellent results. Pro-rata occupancy for 2018 at 95.8%, with anchor occupancy at 97.4% and small-shop occupancy at 91.1%., the highest level of small-shop occupancy we've ever reported. Anchor occupancy was impacted by the Toys\"R\"Us and Sears bankruptcies during the year. However, as Conor mentioned, excellent progress has been made on releasing those boxes.","Pro-rata leasing spreads remain strong for the fourth quarter, with new leasing spreads increasing 12.2%, renewals and options produced a 5.6% increase, bringing total combined leasing spreads to 7% for the fourth quarter. For the full year 2018, combined leasing spreads were a positive 8.3%. We're pleased to reflect same-site NOI growth of 2.6% for the fourth quarter and 2.9% growth for the full year of 2018, which exceeded the high end of our previously increased guidance range of 2.7%. Most encouraging is that the same-site NOI is primarily the result of accelerated rent growth produced from the significant leasing activity over the past year.","On the balance sheet front, we finished 2018 with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 6x and 7.5x on basis, which includes our pro-rata share of joint venture debt and perpetual preferred issuances. Our total consolidated debt stands at $4.87 billion, which is $605 million lower than the amount at the end of 2017. Our consolidated weighted average debt maturity profile is 10.5 years, with no debt maturities in 2019 and only $45 million of debt coming due in our joint venture this year.","Our liquidity position is in excellent shape with over $2.1 million of availability from our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. Now for some color on 2019 guidance and the underlying assumptions. As a reminder, our 2019 guidance excludes any transactional income and expense. As such, our guidance for 2019 NAREIT defined FFO and FFO as adjusted are the same. We'll incorporate transactional income and expense as it occurs.","Our initial FFO guidance range for 2019 is $1.44 to $1.48 per diluted share. This guidance range takes into account the impact of the new lease accounting announcement, which among other things, now requires the expensing of certain previously capitalized internal leasing and legal costs associated with leasing activities. The impact is approximately $12 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Without this change, our year-over-year growth in recurring FFO per share would have been 2.8% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Also included in the guidance range is the dilutive impact from the 2018 disposition program. Other assumptions include incremental NOI of $16 million to $18 million coming online from our completed development projects as well as a $5 million to $10 million reduction in interest expense attributable to the lower debt level.","Our initial range for same-site NOI growth is 1.5% to 2.5%. The range considers the impact of the Toys\"R\"Us and Sears leases already rejected as well as potential from additional bankruptcies. The range also considers the growth opportunities that exist from the 240 basis point spread between our leased versus economic occupancy. We begin 2019 with great enthusiasm and look forward to being back on the path of sustained growth for years to come.","And with that, we'd be happy to answer your questions.","David Bujnicki","[Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets.","Jeremy Metz","Conor, you opened up talking about change in the status quo not being an option. You meant ramping supply that's out there. Just wondered how we should think about this from a capital spending perspective, both in terms of needing to more invest in existing assets to protect and improve conditioning, but also attract tenants? And so not just from a development spend with a direct ROI, but allowances, building spend, additional capital you need to - might need to spend in this environment?","Conor Flynn","Jeremy, I think, it's a good question. I mean, when you think about what landlords need to do today, we can't sit back. We really have to be engaged with driving traffic and just not rely on the retailers being the ones that are the focal point of the experience. So on the spending purposes, you really got to look at our costs have been relatively stable for the last few quarters in terms of deal costs, specific backfilling that we've been doing. On the redevelopment side, that's where we feel real opportunity for growth and the value our real estate. You see now that we've completed our first mixed-use redevelopment. And it was voted best new building in Philly and it's way ahead of our internal expectations. We have a big pipeline of future redevelopment opportunities. When look at our opportunities within the portfolio for mixed-use is pretty significant, but we continue to see the demand be there for our repositioning portfolio. I think the overwhelming seen when you talk to retailers today is that they're going to be investing in their most productive stores, and we want to invest alongside them. They're going to be remodeling, they're going to be adding significant technology inside the store. And when we look at what we can do from a landlord perspective, we can add amenities as well, whether it's Wi-Fi, whether it's right pickups, location, but significant below market leases are, obviously, still a critical advantage to Kimco. And that's where we see we can unlock the value of our real estate through repositioning.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. Second for me. Just in terms of the guidance, you obviously have a range here for Wonder if you can walk us through what you're baking in to the top and bottom in terms of tenant and disruption? And then how the releasing of Toys and Kmarts into that? And then not maybe a quick update on Albertsons and what your best case scenario would look like?","Conor Flynn","You're going beyond that follow up.","Jeremy Metz","Sorry the guidance then. How about just the guidance?","Glenn Cohen","So our guidance includes a few things and some of things that I've already mentioned. But credit loss - there's a 100 basis points of credit loss that's baked into the number. So that gets you at the lower end. You'd have further bankruptcies, potentially that would come through. The impact of Sears and what happens to the rest of the leases there has some impact on the lower end. On the upper end of the guidance, again, if better credit loss comes in, that will be a positive to it. Further lease up and additional rent commencements as we go through the year is another part to the positive side.","Conor Flynn","Two other things that also impact the same-site, Jeremy, is that, there's about 35 to 40 basis point impact from the loss of Toys for - in 2018 and 2019 same-site level.","Glenn Cohen","In addition, again, a key component to the growth is the developments coming online. As I ioned [ph], it's $16 million to $18 million of incremental NOI that is in the numbers. So depending on the timing of that, speed or slow down for any reason, that has some impact as well within that guidance range.","Raymond Edwards","About your third question this is Ray. With regard to Albertson's, I mean, I imagine your couple of weeks ago, they released their earnings for the third quarter. They had - they really had improved the business operations store sales of 2% year-over-year for Albertson's. There's still - they reaffirmed their $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion EBITDA for the fiscal year, which would give about an 8% increase over last year. They've also paid down $1 billion of debt as of the end of the third quarter and then closed on another $650 million of sale leaseback you that might to further reduce the debt of the company. So they're doing everything they can [indiscernible] done a great job in motivating the team. And they're really have ride the ship and really in a good shape to see what we ought to do in the coming year or two for the company.","Operator","The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Ki Bin Kim","Just had some questions regarding your 2019 guidance. So first on the 2% same-site NOI guidance. You mentioned 100 basis points of credit loss. How does that 100 basis points of credit loss compared to previous years of guidance? Second, income tax and other is expected to benefit by 1 or 2 pennies in 2019 versus the negative $0.01 hit in 2018. So anymore color around that? And last one. In the fourth quarter, you capitalized $2 million more G&A than you did in the third quarter. Half of I can see is tied to just more leasing volume, which is great, but is there any element of G&A that you're capitalizing incrementally more-or-so in 2019 vs this 2018?","Conor Flynn","Okay. So let me try to take a piece at a time here. In terms of credit loss for prior years, it's run anywhere between 75 and 125 basis points in total. I think if you look for 2018, the credit loss was around 70 basis points. So we came in a little bit better for the year. So again, we feel comfortable at this 100 basis point credit loss level and that kind of takes into part of the guidance.","Raymond Edwards","To be clear, the 100 basis points and the exact same as previous year. So there has been running a little bit better, but we feel like that's the right number for now to have as our assumption.","Conor Flynn","As it relates to the other category, again, that's an item for all our other accounts, including corporate taxes, non-real estate income, interest, dividend income and other non-real estate depreciation and amortization. So that number vary year-to-year. If you went back to 2016, it was a positive number. Last year, it was somewhat of an expense. We do expect higher interest dividend in other investment income from our non-real estate investments as well as you'll see further interest income that comes from our cash balances just because interest on those balances is higher than it has been as interest rates were a little bit higher from the Fed's activities. And we also do expect to have lower tax expense during 2019. During 2018, there were certain deferred tax valuation allowances that we took that won't repeat. I guess, your last question was on the G&A just quarter-over-quarter, you're right. So the leasing activity was strong. So you have some Internet leasing commissions that were capitalized as well as we do capitalize internal construction So the construction activity on the site is another component to the G&A capitalization as well as some system development capitalization related to the new ERP system that we're putting in place.","Ki Bin Kim","The fourth quarter, how much of that led through in your thinking for 2019 guidance?","Conor Flynn","G&A capitalization will actually be less in 2019, primarily due to the $12 million that I mentioned for the internal leasing and legal commissions being expensed for the new guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.","Greg McGinniss","Conor, feels like this year situation is still in a bit of a flux despite Eddie getting his way. But could you give us your updated expectations on what's baked into the midpoint of 2019 guidance regarding closures? And then what you expect on redevelopment expense? And maybe just some color on the interest you're seeing from retailers on those boxes as well?","Conor Flynn","Well, as Glen mentioned, we have the low end of the guidance, really focused on liquidation of the actual entities there, but we'll have to wait and see. I mean, there's very clear that there are different forces at work there. And I believe it's on Monday when the to meet and decide on the fee. So we'll have to wait and see. We obviously have not been sitting back. We've been very proactive in terms of the locations we have remaining, but we don't necessarily have any visibility yet. So as soon as we gain visibility, we'll be able to share it. But again, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're very confident in our platform and being able to create value on those locations.","Greg McGinniss","Okay. And just one more follow-up here. So given the small-shop occupancy has been up year-after-year, which is nice to see. I'm just curious where you've been seeing the most expense, most success with small-shop leasing? And whether or not you expect this trend to continue in 2019?","Glenn Cohen","Yes. I mean, we continue to see the growth category and in the health and wellness section, the service the hair salons, nails, the specialty fitness is continuing to be a growing category as well as medical, the urgent care facility, et cetera, continuing to rise the top with complimented by S&P as a growing category with all the franchises that continue to expand and do well. So we continue to do that on a go-forward basis. I think the other big component of us exceeding our small shop trend is the retention levels. Our retention levels are significantly higher than they've been in the past. And that directly attributed to a higher-quality portfolio. When you just look at the velocity of vacates in our small shop year-over-year, it's down almost 30% to 40%. So there's evidence that we're retaining higher-quality tenants for longer and they're renewing. So we'll continue to see that trend going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Christine McElroy Tulloch from Citi.","Christine McElroy Tulloch","Just following up on some of your comments around project deliveries. You've talked about an incremental $20 million of NOI from development and redevelopment projects in 2019. Can you provide an update and maybe some greater context around those expectations? And I know that the 1.5% and 2.5% seems range is excluding redevelopment impact, but can you disclose what you expect that, that redevelopment impact to be in your reported range?","Glenn Cohen","Christie, it's, Glenn. So the $20 million that we've talked about during the year, as I mentioned on - in my prepared remarks, the range we're using is $16 million to $18 million. And the reason is that more has come online actually at the end of 2018. So the incremental amount - the total number is still the same, but the incremental amount is just a little bit less. So the projects are moving along the lease up has gone very well. So baked into the numbers, again, the $16 million to $18 million of incremental development NOI coming off from those projects.","Conor Flynn","And on the redevelopment impact on the same-site NOI guidance range will be very muted for this year similar to last year.","Christine McElroy Tulloch","Okay. And then just some clarification on toys and mattress So you had talked about the boxes being 80% re-leased. And I think Dave you had mentioned a 35 to 40 basis point net impact on same-store. Can you talk about the timing of the commencement to any of those commencements in 2019 that would be impactful? And then just on mattress firm, it looks like you closed 11 stores in Q4. The rent contribution went down by $1.4 million. Was that entirely the result of the closures? Or do you provide rent release on the remaining 51 as well?","David Jamieson","So as it relates to the toys boxes, we'll start to see the cash flow from the re-leasing accelerate to the back half of this year. So that helps offset some of the total impact about 25 basis points of dilution for '19. And with the balance of our boxes that we have, we have with a number of tenants. So we feel good about the remaining basis that we have. As it relates to Mattress Firm...","Conor Flynn","So with regards to the stores that are continued to operate and about 30% to 35% of them, there's some rent modification of lease-term modification that we've worked out with them. We're all the sites. Besides that they had with us, they did reject 8 or 9 of the locations. We actually negotiated on one site to have - to do lease termination backfill opportunity on that. And then there was another site that actually had lease expiration was occurring during the bankruptcy. So the store we expected to close and to get back, but we have - majority of the stores are operating. And it's a company that came out of bankruptcy basic converting $3.3 billion of debt and being the balance sheet into equity. So it's a very strong balance sheet for the company going forward. So net-net, we have a much better credit on the 50-odd stores we have with them.","Christine McElroy Tulloch","Okay. So the rent modifications right away, whereas the rent loss from the rejected leases, is there a delay in that until 2020?","David Jamieson","Well, the interesting thing with the rent loss is that because it's case Mattress Firm case is going to be 100 plan getting about a one year rent damage claim for all the 10 locations that we've gotten back. So for '19, we'll cover all the money basically.","Glenn Cohen","So in '20 is when you'll see the impact.","Operator","The next question comes from Samir Khanal from Evercore ISI.","Samir Khanal","I guess, can you walk us through sort it doesn't look like you're generating much sort of free cash left the dividend and you still have plans to spend about $300 million on the kind of redev and the development piece. So some - you don't have any sort of targets for dispositions here. So I'm just trying to how should we're thinking about the funding of that redevelopment, especially, without any sort of targets for dispositions here? How should we think about that?","Glenn Cohen","Right. So when you think about the development spend and the redevelopment spend, somewhere in this $250 to $325-ish range. There will be dispositions. And the dispositions will fund a good portion of that I'd say. And then the balance because we do not have any expectations to issue equity nor do we have any expectations to range any other debt or anything during the year, the balance would come from funding from our revolving credit facility and our cash on hand that's available.","Conor Flynn","You'll see a level of dispositions that will fund the good portion of the development and redevelopments.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Craig Schmidt","I was wondering how many retailers you think may convert to order online pickup in your portfolio?","Conor Flynn","Craig, this is Conor. I think it's going to be a trend that continue that will see the majority of them convert to that. You've seen recently that is no longer doing e-commerce delivery of groceries. I think a lot of retailers are figuring out how to drive traffic back into the store and click and collect or buy online and pick up a store has become a boost to not only the actual retailer themselves, but to the store traffic. So I think we've seen a lion share of them starting to implement it. And I think that will continue as really as the new retail way evolves. I think the shopping center is well positioned because of the convenience factor to really capture that because typically the shopping centers, they closes to your house or they closes to where you work. And so buying online and picking up in store is, ultimately, a very convenient way to get what you need.","Craig Schmidt","I mean, they definitely seems to help traffic. Is there also an opportunity to increase the revenue whether you create areas for access to that help order online and pick up in stores?","Conor Flynn","Absolutely. I think when you think of the store reformatting, there's going to be ways where they can, obviously, get the once you get the person inside the store. So there's a lot of data coming out in terms of how much of the incremental consumer once you get them in the store. So it's not just what they ordered online, but they always seem to buy something else once they're inside the store. So retailers, I think, will take advantage of that. And then we can take advantage of the increase traffic and make sure we're trying to increase cross shopping as much as possible and take advantage of that increase traffic.","Operator","The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows","Maybe just on the leverage side. So including the joint ventures, now you guys are at 6.3x debt to EBITDA. I guess, how does this compare to your target and kind of how and when do you expect to get there?","Conor Flynn","Yes. So in terms of leverage, I mean, again, we want to get down to around the 5.5x consolidated net debt to EBITDA and then about a term less when you on a basis, including the joint ventures and the preferred. So somewhere in that approaching a 6.5x over time. Leverage will stay relatively the same as we go through the year, but you'll start to see leverage coming down as we look into 2020 with more and more EBITDA growth coming at basically the same debt levels. So you'll start to see it's coming down into 2020 and beyond.","Caitlin Burrows","Got it. Okay. and then maybe just in terms of the 2018 same-store NOI growth having coming better than expectations, are there anything if you can just talk about some of the positive surprises that you saw at the end of 2018? And whether or not they could continue into this year?","Conor Flynn","I think you had some rent commencements that accelerated, which was definitely helpful. And retention of tenants was, obviously, very important to the puzzle and then credit losses were a little bit better as well.","David Jamieson","So part of the benefit large dispositions we did, we just have a much better and stronger performing portfolio today than we did a year ago.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","I was wondering going to same-store again, can you just run over the 2 9 last year versus the midpoint of two this year. It seems like there's the 30 basis point difference in the credit loss reserve that's part of it the 1% budget versus 70 bps last year. And then what's driving the other 60 basis point delta again?","Glenn Cohen","Well, again, you have different populations as we've sold lots of assets. And we think that our range of 1.5% to 2.5%, as we roll of our budget, is a pretty reasonable place to start for the year. We have taken into account what's happening really at the tenant level. We'll have to see what happens with Kmart and some other. So it's really an initial range based on our original forecast - our initial forecast, I should say.","Michael Mueller","And in Kmart and Sears in that credit reserve or are you thinking that separate from that?","Glenn Cohen","There's a good portion of that, that is in that credit reserve.","Michael Mueller","Okay. And I guess, on the follow-up just something different here. The 275 to 350 development, redevelopment investment that's anticipated for '19. How do you see that number trending once you go to 2020 and then the next few years out?","Conor Flynn","It does start to moderate. I mean, when you look the pipeline of projects that we have in the supplemental, you'll see that the development pipeline starts to skinny down. as those projects really deliver. And what I mentioned in my script is, we'll be looking to a lot of our redevelopment opportunities as we think that's the best risk adjusted return for the long term for the company. But we plan to really have, again, that $200 billion to $300 billion range going forward as an annual investment spend and to deliver significant recurring growth for us in the future.","Operator","The next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","On FAD dividend payout ratio, where do you expect this year to shake out? And can you give us an idea of what the target is over the next 2 to 3 years? I know it was a bit elevated than '18 due to all the CapEx, but just trying to get an idea where you expected to settle?","Glenn Cohen","Yes. I think the dividend payout ratio will come down modestly this year a little bit, but again, it's still relatively close to that 100% level. You'll start to see really start improving as we go into 2020 and 2021 as EBITDA really starts to ramp up from the coming online of our really our development projects and our redevelopment projects starting to kick in, places like Pentagon and The Boulevard on Staten Island. And then, in terms of the target, we want to try and get back down to a high 80s percent dividend payout coverage.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And I guess, as a follow on, how many leases do you have expiring in 2019 and have no remaining options with approximate square footage and mark-to-market if possible?","Conor Flynn","Again, most of our anchors have pretty sizable mark-to-market on it. We didn't specifically call out with the mark-to-market is for '19. But again, from what we've done over the last several years, it somewhere in that 30% plus range. So again - and depending on what happens with Kmart, it could really be sizable when you look into '19. We can follow and give you the specific numbers of the leases that are expiring at that options. And typically, what we've been north of 30% on the mark-to-market when leases more options.","Operator","The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","So two questions. First, just going back to Sears, because I think the bankruptcy, the hearing on Monday. So if he does win, how does this affect the centers where you have the 13 Sears Kmart? How does this affect your plans for those centers? And were these centers potentially on your list for adding to the redevelopment such that as you were looking over the next few years, these would provide a growth, Glen, maybe help you get to that sort of mid-80s FAD payout for the dividend? Or were these centers that it doesn't matter either way of Sears stays or goes?","Glenn Cohen","You're right set for Monday. So we'll have to see how it unfolds. The 13 are in our current pipeline for redevelopment, but clearly, some of them land themselves to future redevelopment. We don't have visibility on which ones we'll be able to recapture. But clearly, as I mentioned earlier, we've been sitting back, we've been proactive getting ready to recapture all of them. So we'll have to wait and see in terms of where is the visibility is coming from and then see what we can recapture. There's a lot of value we believe with our platform that we can create, and we'll see if we can recapture them","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then just overall big picture, are you guys now done with all of the unwinding of all the legacy investments like from going forward as we think about Kimco, this is the portfolio that will be, Glen, to your point on funding redevelopment is going to be sort of match funding for dispositions? Or are we - do you think that possibly, let's say, cap rates hardened or something like that, we may see another big wave of sales from you guys?","Glenn Cohen","No. I think you're spot on. When you look at the portfolio today, we feel like we've really done the heavy lifting to transform the portfolio to what we believe is a high-quality, high barrier-to-entry that we unlock a lot of value from going forward. We put a lot of time and effort into getting the portfolio to where we believe the future of retail is headed. That convenience factor that we believe is so critical to the consumer today. And now, we're really excited to showcase what the portfolio can do and how the tremendous amount of redevelopment opportunity in the future as we work to entitle really unlocking the highest best use from our asset base. So to your point, we believe we'll transform the assets. And now, it's on us to continue to grow going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities.","Haendel St. Juste","Conor, I guess, the question for you on non-real estate investments. I'm just curious thinking about the longer-term picture for that. Should we expect your income from that - your other income bucket to continue to declining over the next two years?","Conor Flynn","Can you repeat that? I didn't come through, Haendel.","Haendel St. Juste","Sorry about that. Question on how you're thinking longer-term about non-real estate investments - your non-real estate investments curious about how the income from your other income bucket, should we expect that to continue to decline over the next two years?","Conor Flynn","We've always had an opportunistic investment arm of the company that looks potential retailers that are real estate rich. And the key there is real estate rich. And so I think when we look at our how much real estate they still own on the Coast, we believe long term that investment and actually has paid off quite handsomely to date. So we believe that that's a pretty unique opportunity said that we have a Kimco. Now the population of retailers that actually real estate has So that may limit the opportunities in the future. And we also want to measure how much we have invested at anyone point in time So our focus is really on harvesting and making sure that we can redeploy that capital back into the portfolio fund redevelopment, pay down debt and get to our long-term positioning that we really want.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. That's helpful. Ross, a follow up, maybe a bit more color on the assets sold in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe share the average occupancy mark-to-market for assets? And did you notice was there any noticeable change in the buyer profile? And then maybe some color on cap rates this year? I know that you guys have given discrete disposition guidance, but just curious about how you're thinking about cap rates this year versus last year on a like-for-like basis?","Ross Cooper","Sure. I think the market remains very healthy on the assets that we sold. The buyers are still able to generate and to receive pretty strong debt financing within the markets. Obviously, the 10-year staying below 3% really helped the cash on cash returns for our investors, for our buyers on these properties. So the occupancy of the sites that we sold over the course of the year, which is pretty consistent in the fourth quarter, was right around at 93% range. So it gives a little bit of value at opportunity for potential buyer, but relatively stable for the most part. But when you look at the rents of what we sold, it was just under $12, but $11.73 to be exact of the sold sites. So again, I think, that the assets that j be looking to sell in 2019, we'll really be opportunistic with that set of opportunities for potential buyers. So we can ensure that the one that we bring to market for us to maximize value. When we executed this year at the blended 7.6% cap rate, I think, that generally speaking that should be more or less in line with expectations for what we saw in '19 depending on that specific population if and when we move forward with certain assets. So I would say that the demand continues to be healthy. We have a higher-quality asset base even within the potential disposition candidates there. So we'll just have to see how the year progresses, but we're very comfortable with the target that we're putting out year.","Conor Flynn","There's still a very large disconnect between public and private pricing. I think when you look at the shopping center as a whole, there's trades that happen every day. So it's a very - the price discovery occurs regularly. And so for us to execute on a $1 billion of disposition and see that it's really in that 7.6% cap rate range, I feel like we've really executed well on our strategy. And now, we're starting significant capital formation for shopping centers from private equity and other owners that the fundamental that we've been producing consistently. And so that's really where I think differentiates our sector from others in the retail world is the fundamentals are starting to actually shine and people are starting to notice that.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Hawthorne from RBC.","Brian Hawthorne","I guess, first one, what is driving the higher development\/redevelopment spend? I guess, in your 3Q presentation, you had 250 that is for 2019?","Glenn Cohen","Yes. Some of it's timing. And the spend that was done really during '18. Some of it shifted back into '19, but it's primarily driven by Damien Phase II, Pentagon Phase III and The Boulevard. I mean, those are the predominant sites that are capitals earmarked for.","Conor Flynn","There's a lot of targeted towards adding Phase III of Damien to the supplemental. That's the new project that we added.","Brian Hawthorne","Okay. And then, I guess, on renewal spreads, it looks like there's kind of been trending well over the past 1 2 '17. I guess, what's drying that? And then how is renewal spreads for the shop space?","Conor Flynn","Yes. So on the renewals, our trailing fourth quarter has usually been around at 7%. This quarter, it was slightly lower just over 5%. We did over 200 renewals this quarter. And they're really three that drove to down below that 5%. So if you remove actually bringing back to the trailing around seven. So it's fairly consistent what we've seen in the past. And on the shop space side, shop spaces, small shops are typically closer to market. And you do see upside on renewals and if they exercise the options around the 3% to 4% range. And so you'll continue to see that going forward, especially, with the higher retention levels.","Operator","The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Barclays Capital.","Linda Tsai","Given the nearly $1 billion in assets in 2018, how much of that represented power centers? And has that changed your overall to this format?","Glenn Cohen","Yes. It's a good question. We've reduced our exposure to power centers from the dispositions. I would say just to be clear, though, we don't believe that all power centers created equally. So we do feel very agnostic between power grocery depending on location, demographics, density, et cetera. So we did modestly reduce our exposure to power centers. But again, we're still feeling very comfortable with the power centers that we have remaining in the portfolio. In terms of the actual number of power centers that we sold this year, yes, it's approximately 12 to 16 depending on the classification but it was about 16 power centers for - I'd say of the top of my head and I could follow with the exact, but it was about 35% to 40% of the asset sales volume sold was through power centers.","Linda Tsai","And then relative liquidation, what's your exposure there?","Conor Flynn","We really don't have anything we have one, I think so it's one.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.","Christopher Lucas","Just a couple of quick questions. You mentioned on the renewal rates that three of them sort of drove the numbers down. Were those market renewals for those fixed price renewals?","Conor Flynn","Sorry the question, again, we've broken out.","Christopher Lucas","I'm sorry. So on the renewals you mentioned that this lease spread was impacted by three leases, correct?","Glenn Cohen","Correct.","Christopher Lucas","Okay. So on those three, were they all mark-to-market renewals? Or were there fixed-price options in those renewals that we're drying that?","Conor Flynn","No. There was one Mattress Firm, which was a slight concession for shorter period of time. And then the other one was an adjustment to market. Again, keeping them in place while we look another opportunity to redevelop.","Christopher Lucas","Okay. And then just on the same-store NOI guidance for the year, just curious as to whether the pacing we should expect to ramp towards the back end? Or whether or not we'll sort of stay kind of range bound during the course of the year? How do you guys thinking about...","Conor Flynn","Quarter-by-quarter, it always moves around little bit, but you'll probably see a higher towards the back end of the year fourth quarter should be higher.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","In your 2019 guidance, what you're embedding for lease spreads?","Glenn Cohen","Lease spreads, I think, it's pretty consistent from what it - what happened last year. So I'd say trailing 12","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And our lease modifications reflected in the lease spreads that you show in the supplemental?","Conor Flynn","[Indiscernible] extend over a year. So on some of those lease modifications 12 months as included.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just last one. Just to be clear, there will be some from Kimco this year, but not in the FFO guidance currently?","Conor Flynn","No. I mean, dispositions are in our guidance number. I mean - and again, the dispositions are also, as I mentioned, will fund a good portion of our development and redevelopment spend during the year. So there is a level of disposition that is baked into this guidance number. We think disposition is part of the natural management function for the company going forward. So in that $200 million to $300 million range, we think it's a natural run rate to continue to constantly evolve our portfolio focus on where demographics occurring and continuing to execute that. So we don't build up a future larger disposition pipeline.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. That's good. Because I think there were some questions from regarding if there was actually in the guidance, but that helps. Thank you.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI","Samir Khanal","Sorry, I got disconnected before. but just so wondered follow up on sort of cap rates and question was asked before, primarily on sort of grocery anchor centers and sort of secondary and tertiary markets where you're seeing there, especially, with some of the traditional groceries the anchor, what sort of the headwinds from e-commerce? I mean, have you seen cap rates in kind of that bucket?","Conor Flynn","Yes. I think that's an accurate statement. We've seen in the core major markets locations, grocery anchor continues to be very aggressively priced. I mentioned a couple of the examples of ones in the major markets in the West Coast that are sub-5%. You've seen a little bit of widening out of grocery anchor deals in the secondary and tertiary markets to come more in line with some of the other cap rates on power centers and otherwise within those markets. And we've talked about, there's a pretty significantly changing evolving grocery landscape. So I think that's something that investors are taking a look and really have to be careful to the sales per square foot as well as the performance and the financial viability of the specific user. So by way of example, again, we talked a little bit about the three sale leaseback properties that we acquired on the West Coast. Those locations, we're doing a blended $775 a square foot in the sales. So very attractive opportunities. That's where, I think, investors are becoming much more focused on the performance of the existing grocer as well as their financial viability longer term.","Samir Khanal","Okay. So if you have a grocer, that's doing sort of below $500 a foot secondary, tertiary market type bucket, how much do you think those cap rates have expanded, let's say, in the last sort of 6 to 9 months?","Conor Flynn","Yes. 6 to 9 months, I'd say pushing it back even in the last 12 months from - in 2018 over the course of the year. I think, you've probably seen a widening of maybe 50 or 75 basis points in those secondary and tertiary markets if the grocery performance is not well above the average.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Bujnicki for any closing remarks.","David Bujnicki","Thank you very much for participating on our call today. I'm available to answer any follow-up questions you may have and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","This conference is now concluded. Thank you for joining today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead.","David Bujnicki","Good morning and thank you for joining Kimco's fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. Joining me on the call are Conor Flynn, our CEO; Ross Cooper, President and Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, CFO; and Dave Jamieson, our Chief Operating Officer, as well as other members of our executive team.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking, and it is important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements, due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP metrics can be found in the Investor Relations area of our web site.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Good morning and thanks for joining us today. We finished off 2017 with a tremendous effort by the entire Kimco team. Our leasing activity in the fourth quarter capped off a record year, validating the desirability of our portfolio, with positive trends and occupancy, leasing spreads, same site NOI, and recurring FFO. Our portfolio has proven resilient, but we recognize that the goalposts are constantly moving, and that's why we continually strive to enhance the quality of our portfolio.","Our primary focus in 2018 will be to further upgrade the portfolio, by disposing off assets that do not meet our long term objectives. While continuing the development and redevelopment projects. While this will have a short term dilutive impact, that positions us for long term growth and as a leader in our space. We anticipate another year of mixed results for retailers in 2018, with store rationalization continuing and additional store closures. To us, this means the need for continued focus on our 2020 core principles; create a portfolio of the highest possible quality, with a significant runway for growth; maintain a solid balance sheet that will continue to provide flexibility in this rapidly changing environment; and continue to run a redevelopment program that creates substantial value.","To achieve these goals, we are taking the following steps; first, further improved portfolio quality, by becoming more weighted in coastal markets and grocery anchored centers. The majority of our portfolio is becoming concentrated in New York, the D.C.-Baltimore-Philadelphia corridor, Miami, Los Angeles, and the Bay Area.","Second, notwithstanding our ample liquidity position, favorable debt maturity profile, and capacity to repurchase stock, we remain focused on strengthening the balance sheet and maximizing it's flexibility. We have already made progress on this goal, and Glenn will go into more detail on the strides we have made during 2017.","Third, we will continue to strategically recycle assets, which serves double purposes; it strengthens the overall quality of our portfolio, as we further refine our demographic and geographic mix, and improvise the growth capital to support our development and redevelopment programs. We also will provide more details on our objectives for 2018.","Fourth, maintain our strong leasing momentum and increase same site NOI. The lifeblood of the business is leasing, leasing, leasing, and we continue to see strong demand for Kimco's high quality and well located properties. David Jamieson and the team are working non-stop to stay ahead of the changes occurring in retail, partnering with innovative retailers and service providers, and exploring ways to streamline and expedite the leasing process.","Fifth, unlock the embedded value from our existing redevelopment and development projects, both of which offer significant value creations and outsized yields. These projects include the redevelopments of Pentagon Center and the Boulevard and the developments of Lincoln Square, Dania Pointe Phase 1, Grand Parkway Phase 2, and Mill Station, which we recently announced will be anchored by Costco. Grand Parkway Phase 1 is now open and continues to enjoy strong demand.","With respect to our Christiana development, we elected to reclassify this into land held for future development category. Given the change in our cost-to-capital and funding requirements for our other projects that are closer to being finished in generating cash flow.","And finally, we will continue to focus on our margins and improve efficiency across the company. As an example, we recently made the decision to close our Midwest office, and streamline a regional operating structure. Glenn will cover this in more detail.","We believe these steps will produce a higher quality portfolio, more flexible capital structure and long term growth. I can assure you that our management team is committed to continually improving Kimco's overall performance and is working tirelessly to achieve each of the steps I just outlined. Demonstrated and continued confidence in our plan, the board has put in place a $300 million share repurchase program, that will serve as another vehicle to return value to shareholders.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Ross.","Ross Cooper","Thank you, Conor. Overall, we had a very productive fourth quarter and full year 2017 on the investment side, with gross transaction volume close to $950 million. This was highlighted by accelerated fourth quarter dispositions, amounting to $234 million with Kim's share of $174 million. We ended the year as a modest net seller, as a result of our strong fourth quarter sales execution. The blended cap rate on the 16 centers sold in Q4 and for all 38 shopping center sales in 2017, were in the mid-7% level.","On the acquisition side, we acquired Whittwood Town Center in Los Angeles, California, with long term redevelopment and value creation opportunities.","As noted previously, this year, we intend to be substantial net sellers, totaling between $700 million to $900 million. Any acquisitions we undertake in 2018, will focus on accretive, adjacent, or unowned anchor parcels, within our existing portfolio.","On the investment landscape, we continue to see a bifurcation in pricing, between high quality core markets and those outside the major institutional focus. Cap rates on the best assets remain sticky, and at all time lows, with recent transactions on both coasts, trading in the fours and low five range, driven by strong investor interest, whereas non-core secondary and tertiary assets, particularly those without a grocery component, continue to rise.","While each asset is unique, we see the spread between core and non-core anywhere from 250 to 300 basis points at this time. Although there is an increase in supply in the market, related to our disposition plans and those of several peers, there continues to be plenty of interest in capital available, primarily from local regional operators, with the backing of private equity capital providers. These buyers are finding the going in yield attractive, and are able to access the debt markets, thereby providing a healthy cash-on-cash return.","Even with interest rates moving up over the first 45 days of the year, we have not seen any pullback related to the ability or cost of obtaining financing. This gives us confidence in our ability to execute on our 2018 sales targets, and we have gotten off to a great start, with $30 million of dispositions completed, and another $300 million under contract or with an accepted offer. Additionally, we now have over $475 million of properties in the market for sale.","Glenn will now provide additional color and insight on our 2018 guidance and financial performance for the quarter.","Glenn Cohen","Thanks Ross and good morning. We finished 2017 with positive operating results, a solid balance sheet and a strong liquidity position, and are now focusing on our 2018 objectives, as outlined by Conor and Ross.","Now some details on our 2017 fourth quarter and full year results, and then further color, regarding our 2018 guidance. NAREIT FFO per share was $0.38 for the fourth quarter, which include $5.2 million or $0.01 per share of severance charges, associated with the consolidation of our central region, as part of the corporate restructuring. We are marketing many of the properties in this region for sale, which we anticipate selling in 2018, with the remaining high quality assets, having been absorbed by our other regions.","For the full year, NAREIT FFO per share was $1.55. This includes $11.3 million or $0.03 per share of transactional income, net of transactional expenses, comprised primarily of the $23.7 million from Albertsons, and a $14.8 million foreign exchange rate. These gains were offset by early debt repayment and preferred redemption charges of $9 million, land impairments of $11.8 million and severance charges of $5.2 million just mentioned.","FFO is adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expenses, as well as non-operating impairments, was $0.39 per share for the fourth quarter, $0.01 above the $0.38 per share reported last year. Our fourth quarter results benefitted from an increase in NOI of $9.5 million, including the pro rata portion from our joint ventures. This was driven by higher minimum rents and lease termination fees, despite a $1.8 million negative impact from our Puerto Rico properties, due to Hurricane Maria. Offsetting the increase to NOI was prior interest expense attributable to the higher debt balances.","Now full year 2017 FFO was adjusted -- was $1.52 per share versus $1.50 per share for 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to improved consolidated NOI of $18.7 million and lower recurring G&A expense and tax provision of $5.4 million collectively. This was offset by lower JV FFO contribution of $10.9 million due to assets sold and transferred, including those related to our exit from Canada.","Our FFO growth has been impacted in the short run from the $402 million invested in development projects, which will begin cash flows late in 2018 and into 2019 and beyond.","Our operating metrics remain strong, as we enter 2017 with occupancy of 96%, up 60 basis points from a year ago and up 20 basis points since last quarter. Anchor occupancy increased to 98.1% and small shop occupancy finished the year at 89.6%.","For the fourth quarter, new leasing spreads were higher by 13.2%, with renewals and options rising 7.9% for a combined housing leasing spreads of 9.2%.","Same property NOI growth was 1.2% in fourth quarter, and includes a reduction of 40 basis points from redevelopment projects and a negative 120 basis points, due to the impact of Hurricane Maria on our Puerto Rico properties. Absent these items, same property NOI growth would have been 2.8%.","For the full year, same property NOI increased by 1.7%, including a 30 basis point reduction attributable to Puerto Rico. Beginning in 2018, our same property NOI population will exclude our seven Puerto Rico properties.","Turning to the balance sheet; we finished 2017 with consolidated net debt-to-recurring-EBITDA of 5.9 times and on a relative basis, including the pro rata portion from JVs and preferred stock outstanding, of 7.1 times.","In December, we issued $230 million of 5.25% perpetual preferred stock and in subsequent year end, an additional $34.5 million, as the underwriters exercised their overallotment option.","During 2017, we issued 1.25 billion of unsecured bonds with a weighted average interest rate of 3.78% and a weighted average maturity of 14.6 years. In just the past few years, we have increased our weighted average maturity profile to 10.7 years from 5.3 years. Subsequent to year end, we repaid $162 million of secured debt, leaving only $23 million of debt maturing for the remainder of 2018. Our liquidity position is excellent, with over $2.1 billion of availability on a revolving credit facility, and just over $400 million of debt maturing through 2020.","Now for some color on 2018 guidance and the underlying assumptions; as a reminder, our 2018 guidance excludes any transactional income and expense. As such, our guidance for 2018 NAREIT defined FFO and FFO as adjusted are the same. We will incorporate transactional income and expense as it occurs.","Our FFO guidance range for 2018 is $1.42 to $1.46 per share. This guidance range takes into account the dilutive impact of our fourth quarter 2017 dispositions and the financing costs associated with the $264.5 million of 5.25% perpetual preferred stock that was recently issued. The guidance range also assumes net dispositions of $700 million to $900 million, with blended cap rates between 7.5% to 8%. The proceeds from these sales will help satisfy the funding requirements related to our development and redevelopment projects, which are projected to total $425 million to $525 million in 2018. As a reminder, only Phase 1 of the Dania development is expected to start generating cash flow in 2018.","Any proceeds received in excess of the development and redevelopment costs, may be used to opportunistically reduce debt, redeem callable preferred stock or repurchase common shares pursuant to the common share repurchase program we have announced today.","Our growth range for same property NOI is 1.25% to 2%. The low end of the range reflects our expectation for the first quarter same property NOI level, which we believe will be the low point for 2018. This is due to several bankrupt tenants that were in place in the first quarter of 2017, but subsequently vacated. Our range also consists the uncertainty around tenant bankruptcies and fall out [ph] for the holiday season, including Toys\"R\"Us. Despite the potential negative impact of these circumstances, we are comfortable with the upper end of the same property NOI growth range, given the widespread between our leased versus economic occupancy level, which stands at 270 basis points.","As a final point, our team is focused on execution, are highly motivated and confident about our future.","And with that, we'd be happy to answer your questions.","David Bujnicki","We are ready to move to the Q&A portion of the call. To make this more efficient, we ask that, you ask one question with an additional follow-up question. If you have any additional questions, you could rejoin the queue. You can take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. I know Ross, you touched on it; but I thought the cap rates were going to be a little lower, given that this was -- improved assets, given the first rounds of disposition. So just wondering about that 7.5% to 8% cap rate?","Ross Cooper","Yeah, that's a good question, and we have seen consistency in the pricing and actually I have been very encouraged by the buyer pool and some of the new capital formations that we have seen. The bids that we have been receiving on the assets, we have been putting into the market have been pretty aggressive. So we are certainly helpful, that we will continue to achieve the lower end of that cap rate range into the mid-7s. But we are giving ourselves, I guess, a little bit of flexibility to continue to execute on our strategy and ensure that, we hit our targets, which we are very comfortable that we will.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And just maybe for Glenn, where would you target your dividend to AFFO payout ratio? Where would you be comfortable that being?","Glenn Cohen","Well overall, we wanted to be around 90%. Today, it's a little higher than that, but as the EBITDA starts coming online from our development and redevelopment projects, that will help drive it down.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Samir Khanal","Good morning guys. So Conor, just on the transaction market again. I guess, what gives you the confidence that you will be able to execute on kind of that $800 million for the year? I mean, many of your peers are sort of doing the same thing. It feels like, assets are flooding the market, and you are not getting a lot of -- there isn't much bid for anything sort of over $50 million. So it feels like there is a lot of work to do, with the $15 million to $20 million kind of one-off assets, and I mean -- is there a risk that some of this could kind of trickle into 2019 at this point? I am just trying to get a sense of, when you think about dispositions, is it -- what's under contract and should we think of it being more sort of first half weighted or how much of that could trickle into the second half of 2018 here?","Conor Flynn","It's a good question. I think when we look at our execution on the dispositions of the portfolio to-date, that gives us confidence, that we are going to be able to execute. So I mean, we have been able to do a one-off strategy for repositioning the portfolio significantly. We have sold now close to $6 billion worth of real estate, to feel like we have the team in place, we have the execution ready to go, and that's what gives us confidence to be able to hit those ranges.","Ross, what do you think?","Ross Cooper","Yeah I mean, I would just add that, over the last few months, I mean, we have had countless meetings and phone calls with investors, operators, brokers, and there really has been, I think, in some sense, a renewed interest, from some players, that really, frankly have been on the sidelines for the last few years, and are starting to reemerge, as they are seeing attractive pricing and cash yields in today's environment. So we have $300 million under contract or with an accepted offer, with a significant amount behind that, and as you said, I mean, the average deal size for us really is in that $15 million to $20 million; maybe $25 million range on some deals,, which seems to be the sweet spot for investors.","There is no doubt, it is a significant amount of work to do it on a one-off strategy. We are talking with groups and are looking at a few smaller sub portfolios, although we think that a larger portfolio is too heavy a discount for us to take. So it's no doubt a lot of work, but our team is motivated. Everybody is working hard to get it done, and we are confident that we will hit our targets.","Samir Khanal","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks and good morning guys. So let's say you get everything done that you want, and $900 million of asset sales this year, it probably doesn't change your leverage ratio a whole ton, because you are using all those proceeds for redevelopment. And I know there is a timing issue with EBITDA flowing in; but reasonably speaking, how much more could we expect in asset sales in 2019?","Glenn Cohen","It's a good question. I think when we look at our portfolio today, we really want to have a clean portfolio in 2019. So we are going to make sure that's why we have an elevated disposition plan for 2018. So that going forward, we have a clean portfolio, that's really heavily weighted toward the coasts. That's where we see the highest growth, that's where we see the biggest barriers to entry. So that's where we are positioning ourselves going forward. We know we have to execute on that, and our team is geared up to do that. But going forward, that's our game plan.","Ki Bin Kim","But the question is, does the $900 million get you there, or is there possibly another round that you have to do?","Conor Flynn","That gets us there. That really cleans up the portfolio and gets us to a run rate, where we see us continuing to be well positioned for growth into the future years.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just last question, when you look at the composition of things you are looking to sell, any large power centers in there, that might be a little bit from problematic?","Glenn Cohen","Yeah. The composition really is a bit of a cross section of our portfolio. So there is some grocery, there is some on anchored centers. But it is heavily weighted towards power. The deal size is primarily in that $20 million to $25 million range. There is one or two assets, that I would say are larger power centers. One of them that we have in the market today, in Missouri, we are getting exceptional early interest. So we are confident that we are going to hit our price targets there. I think you saw yesterday announce, there was a big power center in Idaho, that was recently acquired, north of $75 million. So there are buyers for that type of products, and we are confident that we are going to be able to move the few that we have, that are a bit larger in size.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, good morning. Ross, going back to one of the earlier questions on dispositions in the 7.5% to 8% yields here, are you factoring in raising any capital from new joint ventures? Is that something we could see this year as a way to possibly raise some more attractively priced capital, in addition to selling that bottom rung in that high single digit range?","Glenn Cohen","We always look at our disposition program, in a way to try and execute and get those assets out of the portfolio. For potential new opportunities, I think we have always stated that, we have an existing JV platform. Three very strong partners that want to continue to do business with us. We don't currently have any plans to announce today, of a launching a new JV. But again, we have that as an arrow in our quiver.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And then, in terms of the buyback, you obviously have a pretty full pipeline of spend here, nearly $500 million of redevelopment, $100 million of maturities and amortization. I think you took care of some of that already so far this year. You have also talked about delevering further with proceeds. So trying to understand exactly where the buybacks fit on a priority scale? Would you be willing to increase bid dispositions further to fund it, and kind of what it means for your long term goals of getting a rating upgrade?","Glenn Cohen","Again, the ratings continue to be very important to us. As you know, we are BBB+, solid and stable and continuing to head towards -- over time, what would get us to that A-, AAA rating. But that really is an overtime issue. As it relates to the buyback, first and foremost, we are focused on funding our developments and redevelopments, as we have talked about. So as with this [ph] $425 million to $525 million range. And then we have options that are really open to us. We will see where the stock is trading. We have $575 million of perpetual preferred, that's all callable today. And then, debt reduction, we have already paid $162 million of debt already this year. So this is really not a whole of debt more than we could pay down. The next bond that we have is October of 2019, and that's at 6X and 7X [ph]. So that's another option for us to take a look at earlier on.","Conor Flynn","We do think our stock is incredibly cheap. I mean, that's the reason why we always have the share buyback program in place, and we do see that as an opportunity to really showcase the disconnect between public and private pricing right now.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Hey, good morning everyone. Appreciate the color on expectations towards the upper end of the same store growth range. Can you just give us a sense for exactly what's buffered in there for tenant fallout? Just a little bit more color on that, what you know and what you don't? And you had previously expected, I think a bit of an uplift, so higher growth rate in 2018. What has changed exactly in the last three months?","Glenn Cohen","Hi Christy. We are still looking to see what Toys does. I mean, they are trying to reemerge from bankruptcy here. We have seen their lists, and yet they are still trying to figure themselves out if they had a very difficult holiday season, as you know. So there are still a few things early on in the year, that have to play out, and really will determine where we fit on that guidance range in terms of same site NOI. We do like the demand we are seeing from our stable of tenants, that continue to want to grow stores with us. We see that that's very-very strong. We are monitoring shadow supply, as we have been talking about, as we continue to reposition the portfolio, and move a bit more coastal. I think we will continue to see more demand for our centers.","Christy McElroy","Great. And then just, with regard to what you already have leased, just -- there is a big difference obviously between the leased rate and commenced rate. Can you just give us a sense of the magnitude of dollars of leases that have been signed but have yet to commence, and sort of the timing of those commencements, as we sit [ph] through the year?","Glenn Cohen","The total dollars of what's signed is probably in the $10 million to $15 million range of what's there already. So that's going to stop coming online, as we get more towards the middle of the second half of the year, and we think that that gap should start closing, that 270 basis point gap.","Conor Flynn","You did see it close.","Glenn Cohen","Right. So you saw 50 basis points tighten already. And again, we will have more leasing, and then you have ins and outs that go with it. But we expect that that will start to tighten, as we get later into the year.","Christy McElroy","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rich Hill","Hey, good morning guys. I want to go back to the share buyback program. Maybe focused on your comments last quarter, and what's changed? I certainly hear the understanding that stock looks very cheap in your mind, and certainly it's down, I think around $4 since last earnings. But last earnings, you were mentioning that it didn't necessarily make sense relative to maybe debt-to-EBITDA and you thought that there were better source of capital; specifically your redevelopment program. So I am curious, obviously, a lot of things have changed with your share price, but how are you thinking about that relative to your debt levels and your development pipeline?","Glenn Cohen","So from the first point, the share price, look where it is. You look at our FFO yield, based on earnings today, it's almost 10%. Our dividend yield is over 8%. So that's pretty dramatic shift than where we were even three months ago. So that brings into question, should we have this program available to us. The other thing that we did was, we had ramped up the size of our disposition program. That again, is there to fund our developments and redevelopments, and then beyond that, again, we have the availability, if the price is going to be at those levels, where we could use it towards that. Keeping in mind, that our ratings is very important to us. So we are not going to allow net debt-to-EBITDA or fixed charge coverage or any other debt metric to get out of control or be above a level that would put that at risk. But we are cognizant of where the share price is, and we have opportunities available to us.","Conor Flynn","I think that's right. I think when you look at the long term prognosis of the business, we still believe in the redevelopment being really a tremendous return on our capital. And yet, we see how cheap the price is today in our stock, and where we fit, and it is a tremendous value, and that's why we have pushed the program in place. We still have the redevelopment as a priority for creating long term shareholder value. But again, we want to be opportunistic and take the advantage when we can, when it presents itself with the share price.","Rich Hill","Got it. And just one more follow-up question on that; to me it sounds like you are saying it's not necessarily -- you are not comparing where you could buy back shares relative to where you are selling assets; because we see that as modestly accretive, not super accretive. It just sounds like, relative to all of your other opportunities, this is a good use of capital, relative to three months ago, where they have been slightly less of a priority. Is that all fair?","Conor Flynn","That's how we allocate it.","Rich Hill","Okay. Great. Thanks guys. I appreciate your time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. So two questions; first, Conor, you guys had previously said you were done with a major portfolio of repositionings, and now, you are obviously embarking again. So curious what's the decision to sell mostly the Midwest? Is it the reemergence of buyers that you guys sort of talked about, or is there something different that you saw, in the growth of the IRR profile of the Midwest versus the coastal preference that the new portfolio will be?","Conor Flynn","It's a good question. I think when you look at the profile of the Midwest, it's heavily weighted towards bigger boxes, and we have just seen that the growth profile there, just doesn't measure up to what we have seen on our coastal properties. And so when we look out to buy assets, and went back through the disposition targets for this year, we really wanted to clean up the portfolio, to showcase that -- really the bedrock of the portfolio is growing and substantially higher than, let's say, the Midwest was growing at. And so when we look at that, we think that prioritizing it and pushing it out this year, is going to really set us up nicely to showcase how much embedded growth we have in the rest of the portfolio?","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And as a follow-up to that, you mentioned that you took Christiana out of the development and put it back, I think you said it was land or existing assets. Just curious how your hurdles have changed, how Christiana compared to some of the other projects that you are continuing on with? And then going forward, on new deals, let's assume that the stock doesn't recover to today, where it is essentially. How are your hurdles changing for new projects, or is your view that hey, this is sort of what Glenn was saying, if the stock is down here, better off to buy back stock versus proceed them to redevelopment for future.","Conor Flynn","Yeah. On Christiana, it's a site that we looked at and we thought that it was best to take it offroad, just because of where our cost of capital sits today. We still believe in the site longer term, it has tremendous frontage on I95, that sits right next to GGP's Christiana mall that does over $1,000 a foot in sales. But it's one, when we look at our cost of capital, we had the opportunity to say, we already have a significant development pipeline. Where the cost of capital has changed, we can then allocate that to the priorities and show that the projects that are already underway, are going to deliver significant growth, and move out on more to the land, house or development. So it's really just being a prudent capital allocator, and understanding that our cost of capital has changed significantly.","Going forward, you will see us do more of the redevelopments, that have significantly higher yields. On average, those have been between 9% and 11%. That's where we still see tremendous value to be created in the portfolio. So that's really where we prioritize it going forward.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS. Please go ahead.","Greg McGinniss","Hey good morning. This is Greg McGinniss on for Nick. Regarding the Toys\"R\"Us closure, were those in line with your expectations, and are you in further discussions with the retailer regarding that lease?","David Jamieson","Yeah, this is Dave Jamieson. It's a great question. We've been closely monitoring Toys for an extended period of time, and so when they -- coming out of their holiday season, appreciating that they had some clear challenges, we had anticipated that there would be some adjustments to our existing portfolio. We had marked down 24, we are actually down at 23 at this point on this call today. And we are in active discussions with them as well, as we worked through each of the leases, where we have had success, being able to restructure leases, reduce term, secure the right to recapture the box, and what that has enabled us to do, is to go back out to market with the other growth context as well, and identify new opportunities and be very proactive and preparing opportunities to back. So dependent on how they emerge from bankruptcy today.","Greg McGinniss","Right. And so following up on that, with these anchor givebacks and potential Sears bankruptcy, how does that fit within your redevelopment pipeline, and you mentioned tenant demand, how strong is tenant demand for these box sizes?","David Jamieson","Tenant demand for these boxes have been extraordinarily high. We have seen it from all the off-price guys, we have seen it from the grocers, the fitness users. So we are very confident in terms of our ability to backfill these boxes. As it relates to Sears comparatively as well, when we look at what's remaining in our core portfolio at Sears, and you look at where these are located. They are really on the coast, they are in South Florida, they are in California, they are in Washington. And you look at the population densities on a pro rata basis, it is about 150,000 people that excludes those that are say like Bridgehampton and the Keyes, which are extremely high barrier to entry markets with very limited supply, and there is no in which you can construct anything new.","So putting all that together, that creates tremendous opportunities for our redevelopment pipeline going forward.","Ross Cooper","I would just add that the average rent on the Toys boxes is around $11 and 15% to 20% below market, when you look at the locations we have. So we feel optimistic that if we can recapture some of these boxes, we will be able to do some higher quality tenants that will drive more traffic, that will add value to the rest of the shopping center.","Greg McGinniss","And sorry, just one quick follow-up here. After the $425 million to $525 million development spend this year, how much do you expect that outlay to fall in 2019 and 2020?","Glenn Cohen","We'd probably be around $250 million and $300 million during 2019.","Greg McGinniss","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey there, good morning. Glenn, I guess a question for you first on the FFO guidance. Curious, what's embedded in there in terms of expectations for, distributions from Albertsons? And then, could you also give us a sense of what you are perhaps expecting in terms of insurance proceeds from Puerto Rico?","Glenn Cohen","So there nothing put in numbers at all for Albertsons. Albertsons, when and if something happens there, will just be upside to us. As it relates to Puerto Rico, our guess is, we are probably around $2.5 million to $3 million less in NOI from the Puerto Rico properties versus last year, and then the insurance proceeds will probably get a couple million dollars, is our guess during the year. So that will upbridge that.","You got to realize, in Puerto Rico, most of the tenants that were there, are actually back up and running. The properties are performing. They all have power again. There is a lot of heavy traffic at the assets, and were just under -- I think we are 94.7% occupied today. So the properties are actually starting to perform well again.","Conor Flynn","We were actually seeing a boost in demand down there as well. I think being a well capitalized and efficient operator in Puerto Rico, has given us the ability to get our sites open and operating quickly, and there is a lot of retailers that are coming to us, that have not been able to rebuild or have a landlord that's not well capitalized, so we get them back open and operating. So we have actually gotten some increased demand from retailers looking to come to our centers.","Haendel St. Juste","Appreciate that. Glenn, the couple of million you mentioned there, is that embedded in the FFO guidance, the Puerto Rican proceeds?","Glenn Cohen","Yes.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. And then on the same store NOI guide, what's embedded there for bad debt and refurb [ph], and what are you assuming for expense growth? And then how should we think about potential further cost savings in the portfolio if you sell another $900 million this year? Is there anything embedded in the guide for that?","Glenn Cohen","In terms of bad debt, again, we run around 1%, as our reserve on that. What's the second part of your question, Haendel, I am sorry?","Haendel St. Juste","Thinking about the portfolio, as you sell assets here, another maybe $700 million to $900 million. Potential cost savings to the platform, as you think about rationalizing some of your costs?","Glenn Cohen","Again, part of the closing and consolidation of the Midwest region relates around selling a lot of those assets. So you will see that this is going to impact in our G&A line. I mean, if you look at our G&A, it's relatively flat, and it has been held relatively flat for several years now, with the things that we have been doing.","Haendel St. Juste","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller","Yeah hi. So going back for the $700 million to $900 million that you are selling with a cap rate of 7.5% to 8%. If we go beyond that and just think about how the balance of the portfolio is, is there another sizable chunk of assets that you would say, the cap rate is 6.5% to 7%, and we should think of it as ratably getting better or is there -- once this chunk of the portfolio is gone, a notable step-up in terms of the quality and a drop in the cap rate. I mean, how would you size it up outside of what you are selling?","Glenn Cohen","I think your latter part there is correct, is there is a sizable step-up in quality, when we move out of the Midwest. And you look at the assets that we have up and down the coast, and we think we are toe-to-toe with the best in the business. And so, we will have to prove it out, obviously, with our numbers and our execution and showing that the growth is there, and that's on us to make sure that it shines through. But we really do believe that there is going to be a significant jump in quality, once we execute on our disposition plan this year.","Michael Mueller","Okay. And then just a timing question for the dispositions; how do you see that playing out throughout the year? I know you have a decent amount under contract right now?","Ross Cooper","Yeah, we are pushing to get as much done as quickly as we can. We are confident that the first half of the year is going to be very strong, and that's definitely our game plan with continued execution through the third and fourth quarters. But we are pushing to get as much sold in the first half of the year as possible.","Michael Mueller","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay","Hey, good morning everyone. Looking at the existing pipeline in the supplement for development and redevelopment, looks like there is just a little over $500 million of total spend that can cause [indiscernible] share. So how much of the development spend and redevelopment spend that you identify for 2018 is attributable to this pipeline we see in the supplement, and how much is it for committed landlord work and tenant allowances or potential new projects later in the year?","Glenn Cohen","So the $425 million to $525 million is really split between the developments and the redevelopments. The developments are about -- it's about half of it, about $200 million, $225 million of it, and then the redevelopments are about $250 million, $275 million of it.","Ross Cooper","And I would just add, that we don't plan to add any new development projects other than the existing assets that we are working on, and you will see us continue to work on entitlements for redevelopment, as we continue to think that that's got to be the priority for the company longer term.","Conor Flynn","When you think of the redevelopments of the Highland projects, it's pretty large. It's $186 million project. It's already -- in Staten Island. The project -- groundbreaking has already been done, construction is happening, money is being spent. So with that project, it is moving along pretty quickly. The same thing with our Pentagon project. Again, you have the tower that's being built, so there is a lot of capital that's going into that project as well. So those are the two major places where the capital is coming. As you know, the developments that we have, so we are continuing to spend on Dania. Phase one should be open by the end of 2018, so there is a lot of capital that's going into that as well.","Glenn Cohen","And then Phase 2 will follow that.","Conor Flynn","Right. And we could square as well.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then with the dispositions, there would be a lot of mortgages tied to these properties, or should we expect a big cash drag? Maybe retire preferred later in the year? How are you modeling that in guidance?","Glenn Cohen","There is very-very little mortgage debt tied to any of these properties we are selling.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris Lucas","Good morning guys. I guess two quick ones; Glenn, and I recognize you have a real focus on looking to maintain and improve your credit rating? I guess one of the questions I would have is just, as it relates to the preferred stack, is there more capacity there? You had a really very solid execution in December, just curious is there more availability within your capital stack to do more preferred?","Glenn Cohen","There is more availability for sure. I think where we are, is there is a little bit over $1 billion. Again, it's somewhat pricing sensitive. The reality is, if you look at where pricing is today, it's probably starting to approach now, 6%. So at the time we issued 5 in an inning [ph], 5 in a quarter, for a long data taper that doesn't have a maturity, that works really well, as you start getting into higher coupon levels, becomes somewhat less attractive. And again, if you look at where are from a maturity profile; again, we had so little debt maturing between now and 2020, and we have really between -- with the sales, the ability to fund all of our development and redevelopment projects. And what we are counting on, is as those projects get completed and that NOI starts coming online, that you will start to see net debt-to-EBITDA drop.","Chris Lucas","Okay. And then, just on the -- Conor, on the retailer environment. I guess, I am just curious as to how maybe you would compare where we are today versus a year ago? It feels more stable, there has been some store announcements, but the environment feels better. Is that your sense?","Conor Flynn","I think that's accurate. I mean, when you look at the strength of the retailers today, it continues to be in the off-price categories and the health and wellness categories, the specialty grocers. Inflation is coming back a little bit, so that should really help grocery stores. And then you look at the fitness, and what's going on there. You continue to see huge demand for stores, and I think one of the biggest things that sometimes is missed, is retailers are starting to recognize the important of the physical store to the omnichannel network.","And I think you are going to start to see more and more retailers start to showcase sales as a combined number, rather than just an e-commerce sales number and a physical number; because, I think the race there was to show much e-commerce is growing. When in effect, it's one big network, and I think retailers are starting to recognize how important the store is to that network, and I think that's what's really going to boost this estimate going forward, is how important it all connects together.","Chris Lucas","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christian Russell of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Christian Russell","Thank you. First off, congratulations on the latest quarter. I am calling in as a shareholder and as a portfolio manager, and my main question is, basically, looking at or listening to the conference call today, two things really stuck out at me, and that was Ross' comments regarding the current environment from the physical assets, is that an all time low in cap rates, which translates to me as meaning all time highs in prices? And then the other comment is, from the guys that described the big disconnect from the public markets and the stock price, versus what's happening in the private market, and describe our share price has a tremendous value and incredibly cheap. And I am just wondering to myself, have we considered, maybe that one of the best programs we could do is, with that $900 million, using it to create a fortress like balance sheet, buyback our own stock?","Conor Flynn","I think it's a great idea. It's something that we believe in, and think that if you look at our playbook, that's exactly what we think we should be doing. So we have got a lot of execution, especially on the disposition side of it as well as on leasing. But we want to make sure our balance sheet is in the best shape possible, and buyback shares to really showcase that disconnect between public and private pricing.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Yeah, it's Michael Bilerman here, an analyst with Citi. Just question, Glenn, on the tax consideration for sales. I think back to last year, and that the acquisitions were driven in part by the tax gains that you had, that you couldn't shelter through your dividend. Obviously, $900 million is a lot more sales relative to last year. How are you managing through that for 2018 and you know, is there a special dividend, potentially in the cards, if you can't shelter, because it doesn't seem like you are buying anything this year?","Glenn Cohen","It is a good question Michael. We have done a lot of analysis about the cash position and where we are relative to the dividend. And we feel comfortable today, that we can actually absorb all the gains. Again, if you look at the composition of our dividend last year, we did a lot of 1031 exchanges. So you wound up with a component of the dividend being returned to capital, like 40%. So without having any acquisitions or very minimal level of acquisitions and no 1031s, you can see a very different composition of what the dividend would look like, being ordinary and capital gain.","Michael Bilerman","Right, --","Glenn Cohen","We don't think we would need a special dividend. We think we can absorb it.","Michael Bilerman","So you are already paying out well above the minimum relative to ordinary, so you have room effectively, to be able to cover increased capital gains without the need for a special?","Glenn Cohen","Correct. Yes.","Michael Bilerman","And then, just thinking about asset sales, and I recognize a big push here is to create a portfolio that you want going forward. Have you considered at all, sort of selling interests in some of your higher quality assets? Effectively, like the stuff you just bought in Jantzen and Whittwood or re-joint venture in Dania, once you complete the development? And I recognize you have done a lot to simplify the company, joint ventures are down to 10, 13 percentish of your company now. But I just didn't know whether that would be an avenue to sort of highlight value across the board, in terms of more representative of your portfolio, and so interest in some of those better quality assets, and also have less dilution from being able to raise capital at arguably much lower cap rates?","Glenn Cohen","Yeah Michael, I think that's a very good point. I mean, we have lifted that, and as I said before, we do have three very large partners, the Canadian Pension Plan, Prudential and New York Common, that will continue to want to do business with us. So we will look at that and see, if we can continue to -- as a way to access cheaper cost of capital, I think we could potentially look at that going forward. Again, if our cost of capital doesn't come back, we have that as an arrow in our quiver.","So it's something that we are looking at, as a potential opportunity.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Bujnicki for any closing remarks.","David Bujnicki","Thank you for participating in our call today. I am available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. I hope you enjoy the rest of the day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Bujnicki, Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.","David Bujnicki","Thanks, Chad. Good morning and thank you all for joining Kimco's second quarter 2015 earnings call. With me on the call this morning are Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, Chief Executive Officer; Conor Flynn, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Glenn Cohen, CFO. There are also other executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking and it's important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements, due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","And we have one housekeeping item to address. Kimco is hosting an Investor Day on December 10 of this year in New York City. We recently sent out invitations for this event and if you did not receive it, please contact my office and we'll make sure to get this to you. We've also provided more details on this event, with the opportunity to RSVP on our Investor Relations website and with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Henry.","Dave Henry","Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We are very pleased to report strong second quarter financial and operating results. As usual, Glenn and Conor will discuss the specific details, while Milton will provide some general thoughts.","Overall both our earnings and property fundamentals looked terrific, as we continue to upgrade our portfolio and sell lower tier retail assets. Combined with limited new supply and healthy growth of both national discounters and service-oriented retailers, our operating metrics are strong and bode well for future earnings growth.","It is particularly encouraging to note another strong quarter of US same-site NOI growth at 3.7%. Despite modest retail sales figures, national retailers continue their expansion plans, which in turn is fueling higher occupancies, redevelopment projects and some limited ground up development in certain markets.","Effective rents are moving up sharply and property values continue to increase. In fact, the only disappointing current trend is the rising disconnect between private market evaluations and the implied cap rates property values of REITs in general.","Retail properties of all quality types and an almost all markets are experiencing strong demand with cap rates continuing to drift down. Wherever possible, Kimco is continuing to take advantage of the robust sales market by selling our remaining second tier assets and redeploying the capital into redeveloping our larger properties and acquiring the equity interest of our institutional partners.","In the latter case, we have the advantage of having managed the assets for many years and have in most cases, a long term presence in these markets.","With respect to our overall strategy, we have now sold our remaining retail assets in Mexico and we've begun to sell certain Canadian properties, as we take steps to reduce our leverage levels which temporarily rose in the first quarter with our purchase of Blackstone's joint venture interest in the former UBS joint venture portfolio. We expect to continue selectively selling Canadian assets including our remaining Canadian preferred equity investments to help us achieve our year end debt target without issuing new equity.","Glenn will cover this in more detail during his presentation. Also with respect to Canada property prices remain high despite the negative impact of energy prices on the economy particularly in Alberta. Our partners in Canada are also making excellent progress replacing the 9 Target Canadian stores in our portfolio. Five of the 9 Target leases have been purchased by Lowe's and Metro Grocery Store is taking part of fixed [ph] store.","There is substantial interest from other retailers in our remaining phases including Marshalls, Bed, Bath & Beyond, H&M and Sport Chek. And I remind everybody that we have US, Targets guarantee on all 9 of the leases. Switching back to the US, I believe most participants on the call today have noted the recent public IPO filing of Safeway, Albertsons.","We are confident that the future monetization of our 9.8% investment will provide an additional source of capital to fund developments, redevelopments, acquisitions and reduced debt. During the quarter, as reported we also sold approximately 80% of our super value stock at a large deal. Our Plus business continues truly be a strong plus for us.","Overall, we feel very positive about the underlying fundamentals, about open air, retail properties and the markets we are focusing on. The eCommerce impact on essential goods and services has been modest and most national retailers have emphasized the benefits of brick and mortar store locations as an essential part of their integrated omnichannel strategy and very necessary for brand exposure.","The proof really is in the numbers. As occupancy, rents, leasing spreads and renewals are all strong across our sector. Now I'd like to turn to Glenn, Conor and Milton for their thoughts.","Glenn Cohen","Thanks, Dave and good morning. Our second quarter results were strong with solid execution at the property operating level and additional contribution from our Plus business. As we reported last night, headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.44 for the second quarter. A 29.4% increase from the $0.34 over the last quarter.","Our strong performance is attributable to NOI increase of $8 million or $0.02 per share from the shopping center portfolio and higher transactional income primarily from the $32.4 million marketable security gain on the cost of sale of our super value investment.","For the six months, headline FFO per share is $0.81 up from the $0.68 per share level for the comparable period last year, a 19.1% increase. FFO was adjusted or recurring FFO which excludes non-operating impairments and transactional income and expense was $0.37 for the second quarter up from $0.35 last year, a 5.7% increase.","It's worth noting that, this level of growth was achieved even with the impact of $900 million of US asset sold over $400 million of asset sold in Mexico, Latin America and Canada and a negative impact from currency fluctuations. This transformational activity have diluted impact of $0.06 per share. However it was more than offset with acquisitions of over $2 billion of high quality shopping centers and many from our joint venture programs and reduced debt cost from opportunistic refinancing.","For the six months, FFO is adjusted per share is $0.73 from $0.69 for the comparable period last year of 5.8% increase. Portfolio operating metrics of occupancy, leasing spreads and same-site NOI growth continue to deliver strong levels.","Our US pro rata occupancy stands at 95.7% up 70 basis points from a year ago. US leasing spreads continue to increase with new leases up 26% and renewals and options up 8.7% for combined positive leasing spreads of 11.9%.","The closely watched metric of US same-site NOI growth was 3.7% for the second quarter driven primarily by minimum rent increases and better credit loss results. Included in the US same-site NOI growth is 50 basis points from new developments. For the six months, US same-site NOI growth is 3.4% with 40 basis points coming from redevelopments.","We are maintaining our US same-site NOI guidance range of 3% to 3.5% for the full year 2015. Combined same-site NOI growth including Canada was 3.4% for the second quarter and 3.2% for the six months excluding the negative 110 basis point currency impact. We continue to make progress on our balance sheet metrics with consolidated net debt to current EBITDA dropping to 6.3 times from the 6.6 times level at the end of first quarter.","We have raised our full year disposition guidance range to $800 million to $1.1 billion representing an increase of $250 million to $350 million. Which will provide the necessary capital to bring our net debt to recurring EBITDA to six times by year end without the need for any common equity assurance?","Based on our strong first half results and expectations for the second half of the year. We are raising our headline FFO for share guidance range to $1.52 to $1.56 from the previous per share range of $1.50 to $1.55.","The headline guidance range includes an additional $1 million to $6 million net transactional income generated during the remainder of the year. We are also increasing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.43 to $1.46 from the previous per share guidance range of $4.142 or $1.45.","Again these increased per share guidance levels, do not anticipate the need for any common equity insurance and with that, I'll turn it over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Thanks, Glenn and good morning, everyone. Today I'll start by recapping our major metrics followed by our progress on our acquisitions and dispositions and finish with updates on our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline.","Overall, we continue to see the fundamentals of our business improved in this favourable supply and demand environment. Our retailers in open-air centers which include off price soft goods, specialty grocers, fitness and wellness concepts and fast casual restaurants continue with the their aggressive expansion plans.","Regardless of the interest rate noise that's creating a disconnect between public and private pricing, we are laser focused on execution. These core initiatives include the blocking and tackling of leasing. Continuous efforts to improve operations with an eye towards sustainability and finishing off our disposition by taking advantage of the healthy demand for hard assets with a strong yield.","Turning to our major metrics, the US portfolio maintained occupancy at 95.7% even with the disposition of over 1.2 million square feet of fully occupied space. Due to the disposition, the small shop occupancy took a slight dip to 88% at 20 basis point decrease in prior quarter. But we remain confident about the overall improvement in the small shop leasing environment and the ability to grow occupancy throughout the rest of the year.","Anchor absorption made up the difference as it increased to 98.4% by executing new deals with Wal-Mart, Fresh Thyme Farmers Market, Total Wine and Planet Fitness to help keep the overall US occupancy flat over prior quarter.","Our combined spreads for the second quarter were almost 12% a strong indicator that pricing power exist in our key markets, where we see demand outpacing supply. Same-site NOI and continues to trend over 3% in the US and the lease up with small shop vacancies, redevelopments and strong re-leasing spreads will continue to produce solid results.","A retailer watch list continues to be of focus, as we have seen a few dark clouds on the horizon, with the recent bankruptcy filings of RadioShack, Anna's Linens and A&P. All three combined make up less than 1% of our AVR.","Our diverse tenant base allows us to think strategically about the long-term goals of our assets, that our core performing retailers that have great underline real estate value. The average base rent of the portfolio is up 6.1% year-over-year. Our new leases are being signed in an average of over $19 significantly above our current average base rent showcasing the embedded value to the mark-to-market opportunity, we have Kimco's.","We continue to execute on our transformation and simplification strategy. With the previously announced closing of the KIF II transaction at Montgomery Square in Fort Worth. Both of these transactions further the consolidation of our joint venture properties and give us buying opportunities in a challenging acquisition environment that also acquires seven adjacent parcels to our Tier 1 portfolio, as we look to expand our footprint, where we see the opportunity for future redevelopment.","The acquisitions market remains ultra-competitive and a few recent transaction showcase, that cap rates continue to fall especially for high quality open-air centers in dense markets. while we continue to mind for opportunities, we believe the best use of our capital continues to be redevelopment and strategic development.","The disposition market continues to remain healthy with cap rates continuing to compress across quality and markets. In the second quarter, we sold 13 properties totalling 1.3 millions square feet and all were 100% occupied generating $92 million in KIM share proceeds. Buyers of these assets include public institutions, private REITs and local private buyers.","Currently, we have 28 assets under contract for $170 million, 15 accepted offers totalling $136 million and another 18 assets in the market that will complete our transformation by year end and produce another $500 million of gross proceeds.","With respect to our redevelopment and development programs. Whether it's cooling our existing portfolio looking for value add opportunities, assembling adjacent parcels to create future phases or building a new site from the ground up. Our team is working overtime to analyze the highest and best use of the real estate.","This modus operandi to evaluating real estate investments opportunities is what we call strategic development. That said, steady progress continues to be made on our redevelopment, development pipelines.","This quarter, we completed 11 redevelopments with gross cost of $34 million. The blended incremental ROI on these project is 15.5%. the projects were completed under budget and above our revenue expectations. Representing an increase in ROI of 120 basis points over pro forma.","At the same time, seven projects were promoted to the active status included in the category of promotions. Our Forest Avenue in Staten Island, where we will be redeveloping a formal national wholesale liquidators to make way for a new LA Fitness.","And at our Downtown, Farmington Center in Farmington, Michigan. We'll be redeveloping a former Office Depot in Tuesday morning for a new Fresh Thyme Farmers Market continuing our effort to add a grocery components to our centers EO redevelopment.","Notable completions this quarter include the transformation of two K marts in Florida, where we added Whole Foods, TJX and Ross among other great retailers. The redevelopment pipeline targets the highest and best use for each asset. That the focus on upgrading the quality of the tenant mix, adding a grocery component and adding density via mixed use to complement the existing retail.","The continued expansion of speciality and traditional grocery concepts in our core markets. in addition to the emergence of a number of new off price for outlet concepts bodes well, for our redevelopment and strategic development initiative. These new demand forces are allowing us to unlock below market rents with higher producing retailers, that will benefit the net asset value of the portfolio.","Currently the redevelopment pipeline has a gross value of just over $1.1 billion for the total of $268 million in active redevelopment another $756 million in designed and entitlement and $97 million in under review. For the quarter, redevelopment adds 50 basis points to our same-site NOI.","We continue to look for development opportunities that are within our core markets. Complement our long-term Tier 1 portfolio and provides compelling returns. Despite high retailer demand, sourcing new projects that will be accretive remains challenging. Due to rising cost of land associated with the boom in multifamily development.","That said, retailer demand for our select developments has been strong and we continue to work towards securing a vibrant tenant mix that will create a live, work, play atmosphere that we seek to create on all of our Tier 1 assets.","Our four development projects remain on track and will start to deliver in the second half of 2016. In closing, at the midpoint of the year. We are pleased with our progress on our strategic initiatives but understand that the execution throughout the second half of the year is key to achieving our goals.","So we've empowered our operations team to make strides to become the best in class operator of open-air shopping centers and it is nice to our efforts being recognized. Commercial property executive magazine named Kimco the number two most effective property manager. And Newsday named Kimco, one of the top three greenest REITs in the entire REIT universe and number one in all of retail.","These accomplishments could not have been achieved without the passion and effort of our deep bench of talented individuals that are pushing Kimco to become the next generation REIT and with that, I'll turn it over to Milton for his final comments.","Milton Cooper","Thanks, Conor. I would once again like to congratulate our team which is second to none on an excellent quarter. In particular, I would like to thank Ray Edwards, who continues to spearhead our Plus business activities and was instrumental in the Albertsons investment. Ray is just one example of our deep bench strength. And as I've said before, we've great people, great assets and a great future.","On another topic, the recent bankruptcy filing of A&P, as it relates to our portfolio. Got me thinking about the off and cited premise, that high rents are a proxy for value and quality. Now with respect to our A&P sites. Four leases with below market rents are being site of the grosses generating a profit to A&P, while two other stores with above market rents will be closing.","Now this admittedly is a small sample, but I think it is telling. A rent that as if, market or below is much more sustainable over the long-term as the embedded value represents an upside for both the landlord and the tenant. These win-win scenarios for the owner or the retailer are what creates long-term value. As such, I believe that low market rents and sometimes we're talking about ground rent, should be recorded lower cap rates conversely, while higher rents maybe an indicator of a quality assets.","They may also reflect more risk, if the rents aren't sustainable over the long run. When underwriting of potential acquisition determining of replacement rents for some to high paying tenants is critical to the overall valuation of that site. In short, one size does not fit all.","And now we'll be happy to take any questions.","David Bujnicki","We're ready to move the question-and-answer portion of the call, we have a very deep queue. So we request that you respect to limited one question, with an appropriate follows up to all of our callers have an opportunity to speak with management. If you have additional questions, you're welcome to rejoin the queue. Chad, you may take the first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes today from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America","Craig Schmidt","I know that Kimco is working on becoming a more urban portfolio, but outside of continuing to concentrate the portfolio around the top metro markets, what are some of the steps you're taking to become a more urban portfolio?","Conor Flynn","I think the number of different steps we're taking, we're really divesting of the asset that fall outside of our core urban markets. we're also looking to acquire adjacent parcels to our assets that are within the core urban areas. And we're looking to develop within those core markets. so combining acquisitions with development and redevelopment and disposition. We really are trying to transform the portfolio to become a more urban portfolio.","Craig Schmidt","And what are you seeing in terms of spreads of either NOI gain or leasing spreads in terms of the urban properties versus maybe some of the properties in the second tier cities?","Conor Flynn","It really is a case-by-case analysis. You've got to look at the ones that we continue to try and redevelop, even if they're in second markets because those will actually return very nice returns. But we're seeing the embedded growth whether it's a same-site NOI or the leasing spreads on the mark-to-markets within the core urban markets, definitely are growing at a higher pace.","We've seen that, the urban markets have higher embedded growth and more demand from our retailers and that's a real reason why, we're focusing on that chapter.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citigroup.","Christy McElroy","Conor, just following up on your comments around development. As you look at your portfolio and are considering more sort of larger scale projects, whether identification of existing assets or new development. And you also talked about the large redevelopment pipeline sort of a shadow pipeline looking out. How do you think about sort of annual pace of realizing some of those opportunities. So I think, you're in process pipeline is only about 2% to 3% of your growth assets value currently. Do you have a desire to growth that overtime?","Conor Flynn","It's a good question, I think breaking it down to two different buckets. Redevelopment is one that I love to do more of, we're trying to focus and see, how we can expand that $1.1 billion pipeline by adding more projects. Clearly, we're doing a good job in terms of expanding that and also delivering on it.","We saw at this quarter, we did more than last quarter and we continue to try and scale that. On the development side, we're being very selective on what we try and pick up for developments. It really has to be within our key markets. we're trying to develop these long-term Tier 1 assets because they've high growth embedded in them.","And it's very difficult to find ones that check all those boxes. So we want to try and trying to be measured in terms of what we take on in development. But we're also making sure that we try and look for those opportunities because right now, where cap rates are headed. We don't see a lot of opportunity to create a tremendous amount of value from the acquisition market. So we're looking from our own portfolio, we're looking at acquiring adjacent parcels that may land itself to larger redevelopments overtime and we're also looking at the development side of it.","So I'd like to see us grow, on all fronts. That being said, we don't have a target in place. It's really, we're trying to look at every opportunity and make sure it's the right one for Kimco.","Christy McElroy","And are there any investments that you need to make sort of internally staffing wise. You already set up for sort of growing that redevelopment pipeline.","Conor Flynn","We have already made those investments. We are already staffed up in terms of the development and redevelopment side of the business. We knew very early on, that this was going to be a growing pipeline and made sure that, within the regions that we staffed accordingly because we were very active in terms of trying to identify this early on and make sure, that we get out ahead of it before the development pipeline gets even larger.","Christy McElroy","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from George Auerbach with Credit Suisse.","George Auerbach","You took out the equity rates from guidance and replaced it with more asset sales which makes a lot of sense given the way your stock is trading. How do you think, earnings growth trajectory of the company in the near term, given the back end loading of dispositions. Do you think Kimco can be a sort of mid single-digit FFO grower next year or do you see 2016 as being maybe a bit more low growth given the dispositions?","Glenn Cohen","Hi, it's Glenn. We started off this year, thinking that this was going really be our bridge year and we're performing pretty well, where you're going to see pretty decent growth come from it. You're right, we're back ending some of the sales. But the growth in next year should still be, I would say comparable to where we're this year.","George Auerbach","Thanks, Glenn that's helpful. I guess, as a follow-up should we read into next year's disposition volume given the comments on the call about, how healthy is the transaction markets are? Do you think next year, we could see a similar level of dispositions or is this year sort of the bulk, as we think about the next 18 months?","Glenn Cohen","No, I don't think you're going to see the same level. I mean, we're talking about total dispositions at our share somewhere between $800 million and a $1 billion for this year. I don't think it will be anywhere near that next year. Certainly, we're finishing up what we've done in the US. You will still see us do some level of dispositions. I think we've - as a company have been very clear about really looking at every asset and where we see risk in that asset or a market moving away. We've been trying to be aggressive about selling those assets and really focusing on that Tier 1 portfolio.","George Auerbach","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Ki Bin Kim","So you guys made an interesting comment about the rent and how that is critical to underwriting deals. I'm just curious and maybe this is more for our anchor spaces. But for what percent of your tenants do you have occupancy cost data? And how does that look like and are there any retailers in your list, that might screen as maybe too high of an occupancy cost where it might be at risk going forward?","Conor Flynn","It's a good question; I think occupancy cost is one that we watch closely, where we have the sales data available. It's one that is difficult to track when we don't have the sales data obviously. So unfortunately our portfolio doesn't have a tremendous amount of sales data. But where we do, we feel very comfortable with where this the occupancy cost sits relative to the industry standard. So we think, that we actually have some significant embedded mark-to-market opportunities, not only from the existing operator but also just from the open market.","So we try and look, we try and track occupancy cost, where we have the sales data and we also look at the market rent replacement value, just in the open market as well.","Ki Bin Kim","So maybe just to follow-up on that. So any retailers top 20, top 40 list that you think, not in trouble today, but maybe is heading towards that direction next year.","Conor Flynn","I think in our sector, we're in the sweet spot right now in terms of the occupancy cost because many of the retailers in our Rolodex are actually producing pretty solid same-store sales and you'll see that continue I think through this next cycle. So we don't see any other dark clouds on the horizon other than the few watch list tenants that we've been watching for a long period of time.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore","Samir Khanal","Looks like you've been trending at about 3.5% on same-store NOI growth year-to-date, which is at the higher end of the range. But you kept the guidance unchanged and I'm just trying to understand if you're just being conservative, due to some of the recent store closings or is it just the fact that you're also facing some tough comps.","I know, last year in the second half you were sort of 4.5% range. So can you just provide some color around this?","Glenn Cohen","Sure. Our buyers at this point is more towards the upper end of our range, where we've been. But again, you have to look at some of the bankruptcies that have occurred. So we have to be a little cautious from that standpoint. But when our buyers is towards the upper end of the range, but we don't have enough clarity to sit there and try and raise it at this point.","Conor Flynn","And the leasing velocity continues to be strong. I think that, even though you see that our small shop occupancy decreased this quarter. It was really driven by the dispositions and we actually had more small shop leasing volume in the second quarter, that we did in the first quarter. So we feel pretty optimistic that the fundamentals are there.","Samir Khanal","Right and as a follow-up to that, just on the metrics. I mean, your spreads are on a blended basis are trending kind of in the low double digits this time and in the past, it'd been high single digits. I mean, one of your peers is been reporting new rent spreads to kind of 40% to 50% increases.","I mean, could we see a point where maybe your blended spreads moves up to maybe the mid to high-teens levels as well.","Conor Flynn","I think you've seen our spreads, continue to move up. If you look past at the last few quarters. You'll continue to see that trend. We feel pretty confident that we are continuing to push pricing where we can. So there is that opportunity to, where we're able to recapture space, leases that don't have any more options. That's where we really see a dramatic rent increases and we do have a few of those coming up, not only in this year but in the next few years.","Dave Henry","And we take some comfort that, our sector still is in a recovery mode. Rents and many markets are still climbing back to their previous highs. So that gives some tailwind to where we're going.","Samir Khanal","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason White with Green Street Advisors","Jason White","Quick question on your kind of percentage of anchor space versus small shop space. You historically been heavier on the anchor side, I think more than roughly three quarters of your spaces, anchor space. I'm curious if that's by design or if that's just what's kind of become of the portfolio overtime and how you kind of think about that going forward?","Conor Flynn","It is something, that we actually tout as a differentiator for us because we have 77% of our, income coming from our anchors. It's one that we think we can manage effectively because of the investment grade credit ratings that they receive and we are very conscious of watching how they expand or contract. We have a national relationships that we can very much take into effect when we're looking for new projects or new developments.","And we think the risk involved with the national anchors is a little bit less than, then say the small shop. So we like the way our portfolio is designed. We continue to develop asset that have a good mix in anchor tenants as well as some restaurants and some small shop tenants and you'll see that, as we continue to try and push the, the grocery initiative. We'll start to become a much more grocery anchored portfolio as we're already over 70% grocery anchor.","Jason White","Okay, so you look at that anchor space being, having a point of going forward. Is it harder kind of ex-redev to push same-store NOI given that small shops turn faster, so in an up market, you can obviously roll those leases quicker and much market faster than you can anchors, is that kind of trade off?","Conor Flynn","I think that's a fair statement. I think, the smaller shops definitely have more turnover, more mark-to-market opportunities. Being said, we saw on the last downturn that the small shops for the ones that got hit the hardest. So we feel like, we're trying to position ourselves for the ultimate cycle. We're feeling pretty confident that, where our leases are maturing, where the rents are, we feel like, we have significant mark-to-market opportunities in both small shop and anchor leases.","Jason White","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill","Alexander Goldfarb","First, nice job on getting the Jericho parcel. Question for you on Canada and harvesting the Albertsons stake. As you guys, obviously love to do that presumably you have this nice game in Albertsons. Do you think, that you can do both simultaneously from an efficiency standpoint or because of structuring things? You'd have to favor one versus the other, in terms of timing.","Dave Henry","Well let's take both sequentially. In Canada, it's going to be some time before we sell a number of assets up there. We have a number of joint ventures and just like the US, we've identified it, a Tier 1 and a Tier 2 group of assets there. The Tier 2 assets are much easier to put on the market because you generally have consensus with your operating partner. On the Tier 1 asset, it's more of a discussion and it will take more time to do because we're near the tail end of this year, what we even start today some of that's going to fall into next year.","So I guess, when we look at Canada in harvesting some of those assets in order to provide capital, to pay down debt. It's going to be spread over the next couple years as it is. When you look at Albertsons even if the IPO is successful, there will be a lockout period and Ray can go into that a little bit. So that's more of a longer term harvesting in our mind.","Ray Edwards","Yes, I mean. On Albertsons, if the IPO does happen in the fall as we hope, to be at minimum 180 day lockout to sell any of the shares on the company. I mean for us, duality with Albertsons transaction was, when we closing the deal in February nobody thought, it'll be seven months going out there as an IPO. So we're way ahead of the curve in our ability to monetize the investment whether because we're moving up the IPO timing.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, but Dave if I hear you correctly, then it sounds like the exit from Canada is going to take years whereas the Albertsons could be quicker subject obviously after the 180 days, but just subject to normal, have the stock.","Dave Henry","No, I would actually reverse that. I'm a little more confident that Canada, at least not some of those assets can be done relatively quickly over the next, let's call it 18 months. So by the end of next year, there will be a significant amount of monetization going on, which will help us achieve our targets.","The IPO and the timing of monetization that is a little more, an estimate of maybe the backend of next year, is when that could start to happen.","Ray Edwards","I mean, it could take time. Our consortium will still own 855 of the company. We have to prudently figure out how we're going to monetize investment.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank","Vincent Chao","Just sticking with some of the Albertsons side discussion here. Just on the rest of the Supervalu stake just curious what the plan is there?","Conor Flynn","We'll probably try to monetize it over the balance of the year, which is obviously our plan.","Vincent Chao","Okay and I guess, just in terms of Canada performance. Curious, can you provide some additional color on sort of what you're seeing at the ground level there, obviously the company is being impacted and you've got to deal with the target stores. But just curious, what trends you're seeing there more recently?","Dave Henry","You've got two headwinds for retailers up there. One is the energy downturn, which has impacted employment, it's impacted the whole commodity pricing sector has impacted Canada and it's led to softening in many respects in terms of consumer confidence, consumer sales and so forth.","Secondly, many retailers get their inventory of goods from the US and the strong US Dollar and the quite substantial movement in that US Dollar has really hurt retailer margins in many cases. Particularly, fashion and that has impacted retail sales, retail margins, retail profitability. So you've got a few more bankruptcies and liquidations of retailers in Canada right now then we're seeing in the US.","So the fundamentals are definitely a little softer in Canada, but we're coming off of 15 years where Canada in many respects, was stronger than the US in terms of portfolio occupancy and rents. It was very solid performer for us. So it was softened lately and the Target bankruptcy doesn't help, but there has been some pretty good demand for the space.","And you're going to see more of it, now that these leases have been rejected. It opens up a more discussion between landlords and users. As an example, many of these Target leases had food restrictions in them. So the ability for the Wal-Marts of the world and the grocery stores in Canada to bid for the leases, there just wasn't that much demand.","So it's not a coincidence that Canadian Tires and Lowe's were the two big purchasers of the Target Canada leases because they didn't have to deal with the food issue.","Vincent Chao","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Morgan with Canaccord Genuity","Paul Morgan","Just talking about the cost business. I mean you've gone through Supervalu and Albertsons, but how are you thinking about kind of the forward-looking side of things. I mean there is a lots of retailers kind of looking hard at doing something with their real estate and are you out there proactively approaching retailers or if we look at any kind of future deals, would they be more you know where you step into a club deals like you've done before?","Ray Edwards","Well it all depends. I mean club deal for Albertsons. When you're buying operating company, you really want to bring in about other people who have expertise that we might not have. On that deal, we were the experts on the real estate evaluation and help to do that. But we needed, in that case [indiscernible] to help us with the capital structure of the goal concern and bringing the right operator.","But we have done deals and we do look at opportunities to do deal directly with retailers. We've done small deals in the past, we did a deal with Winn-Dixie about a year and half ago. We got a great a little shopping center in Marathon and development, a couple years. So we look at, reaching out through retailers. We have great relation with them and most of them know, that we've been in this business. I've been here for 15 years, but Milton's been doing it for 50 years that we're someone that they can talk to and help them figure out what they can do with their real estate and help monetize it.","And really some things are win-win, we're not out there gorging these retailers because ultimately we want them to be around because we wanted to be, tenants in our shopping centers. And so very good relation for them to work with us.","Paul Morgan","We've seen the Sears REIT Darden [ph] and the other people talking about during REITs and there have been JV's on the mall side with yours in particular. I mean, what do you think about this wave of retailer REIT conversions and whether you might, play a role there somehow whether it's from a JV perspective or taking investments stake. I mean, do you have any view on that trend?","Ray Edwards","I mean part of it is, one of the issues I've always had with the, major factors. We don't want to take tenants and make them 8% or 10% of our average base rent. If you do tell me a transaction. So while these larger deals, are really not for us to work on because of that. But like I said, what we do with Winn-Dixie, where they have five properties, where they're very manageable, very good locations. We can take that.","We can help these guys, but they're doing a REIT like, here surcharge. I mean 80% of the properties are malls, that's not our business. And that's, where why they work with General Growth and Macerich and others because they really needed them to doing a redevelopment because without the mall developers, you really can't develop those sites, they're different animal.","We've bought from Sears, they had a facility one of our development deals that property that we bought from Sears that we closed on last year. So we're selectively looking for deals. I'm not sure, we're looking for that headline $100 million, $200 million, $300 million, $500 million deal. I think, we're trying to work around the edges and our main business is you know for Conor and Company to run the main business.","Dave Henry","We do want to keep the Plus business, a Plus business and we're committed to making the best modest debts and we love these one off opportunities that Ray did mention, but when Sims went into bankruptcy, we bought one of their better assets out of that. So we like the smaller opportunities to truly be plus for us and one of the keys to growing this Plus business over the years is to increase the number of relationships we have, not only with retailers which we already have, but with the private equity and the opportunity funds and the hedge funds, which have their own ways to originate opportunities here. So we want to be the first call from a private equity firm that's tied up a retailer that owns a lot of its own real estate.","Ray Edwards","We did buy a number of few food stores quietly a year or so ago, when real estate in City of New York and so we quietly do our share.","Paul Morgan","All right, thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Mueller with J.P. Morgan","Michael Mueller","I know you talked about Canada generally, but did you mentioned. How much of the 2015 increased disposition volume is tied to Canada and then, Dave I think you talked about being making substantial progress over the next 18 months or so with Canada sales. Can you put some bill rough numbers around that?","Dave Henry","I'll let Glenn.","Glenn Cohen","I mean the increase in the disposition guidance about $200 million of it, the proceeds will come from Canadian sales. So that's part of it and then, as we look at further dispositions, that will come into 2016, another $200 million.","Dave Henry","Most of our partners do know, that we would like to monetize the lower tier assets, as the first step and in some cases. We're willing to sell to them some upper tier assets as an example, you've seen us sell three properties to our partner RioCan, which had different plans for those properties then we did overtime and we were, in first instance we were actually able to trade, the interest that they have in a very nice property in Dallas, Fort Worth where we had done an original joint venture with them.","So we were effectively able to buyout their interest in Texas, while they bought our interest in three assets in Canada. So there may be more opportunities to do things like that.","Michael Mueller","Okay, do you expect the 2016 Canada disposition volume to be significantly different from the $200 million this year?","Dave Henry","I suspect it will be higher, yes.","Michael Mueller","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Jim Sullivan of Cowen","Jim Sullivan","Question on demand, kind of two part question. First of all, I think Conor you mentioned recently doing a Planet Fitness deal and as you probably know, they have their IPO queued up here and they're talking about very significant level of expansion. I wonder if you could share with us kind of a how they box might differ from an LA Fitness or 24 Hour Fitness Box and what your appetite is to do more deals with them? I think you mentioned the category, there's a growth segment.","And then secondly with regard to small shop occupancy, you've talked before about kind of your clicks to bricks initiative. One of you could just give us an update on any progress or kind of notable deals you've done there, that give you grounds for optimism?","Conor Flynn","Sure, on Planet Fitness they have been aggressive actually over the past. I would call, 2 years to 3 years. So their expansion plans continue. Their pricing point is lower than LA Fitness. So it's certain demographic, they're the perfect user. They do bring on a traffic and we've seen actually from a co-tendency side of it. A lot of our retailers who are at first against the health club have actually come around and Sprouts for example is one that actually likes the gym to come into the shopping center because it's the whole health conscious type customer, that they're looking to go after.","So you're starting to see that the health clubs become more of a, an integral part of that live, work, play environment that we're trying to create. And I think Planet Fitness has done a good job in terms of expansion and what they're looking to do going forward. That being said, they're in that size where we have so much demand right now. We're at 98.4% in our spaces over 10,000 square feet.","And Planet Fitness will be bidding against a lot of these guys that are looking to come in, for that same size box. I see that as being a headwind for their expansion plans, but they do run a great operation and we have a number of deals with them and a number other of more deals in the pipeline.","And then on the Clicks to Bricks question. This is something we've been tracking now for probably close to 5 years and it's a program we've been targeting pure online retailers to come into the physical shopping center world. The transformation of that eCommerce to the bricks and mortar space has been slow, but you're seeing and start to speed up now. Some of the pure online retailers now opening physical stores.","It haven't necessarily been in the open-air shopping center sector. It's been more in the high street retail core owners as they're looking to jump into the Soho's of the world, to showcase their brand and to have a space to show-off their goods. That being said, there is rumors of Amazon developing a store, that we're watching closely in California that actually has a drive-thru attached to it.","So if that comes to fruition, it may open a whole slew of new operators to come into our shopping center, that would create even more demand sources for us. So we're watching it closely, we're encouraging some of the modern top online players to come in our shopping centers, but it has been material of late.","Jim Sullivan","Good, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC","Rich Moore","Conor, I missed a little bit of your initial presentation, I got cut off. But did you mention. If your small shop leasing target is still 90% for next year. Is that still what you're headed toward?","Conor Flynn","That's correct.","Rich Moore","Okay and in getting to that, is it really just a matter of demand by, demand for new store opening and how hard you guys work or is it also partly getting some of these redevelopments done, maybe adding some anchors to some centers that kind of thing to, you can get that kind of push?","Conor Flynn","I think it's a combination of both. I think our leasing team is really focused on the small shops because we all know that, that's really what we have left to push in terms of our same-store NOI growth. So we have changed some incentives around to make sure that, before we might have been more heavily weighted and incentives towards leasing bigger boxes, we're now shifting that towards the smaller shops.","And we're also looking at, you know our redevelopments when we take down portions of shopping centers. Typically it's the junior anchors that are stepping up and paying the rents, to get the space. So they are, it's a combination of both and yes, we're still doing close to 150 small shop deals a quarter. We don't see that slowing down, it's about 50-50 split between regional and national small shop tenants the mom and pop tenants and it's a lot of service based users that we think are sticky the ones that will stay in our shopping centers for the long haul and that's where we see significant annual increase as well coming from the small shops.","Dave Henry","From a 50,000 foot level, Rich. We've talked about this before but the whole environment for small shops and small businesses is starting to improve. Finally, the community banks are lending again and your local jewellery store, your local dry cleaners, they're looking to expand again.","So the bigger national retailers recovered first coming out of the great recession, if you will and now small businesses beginning to find its legs and so we benefit across the sector from that as well.","Rich Moore","Okay, thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Morgan Stanley","Haendel St. Juste","Question on the JVs. Obviously you've done a lot of effort to your last 1 year or 2 year simplifying the platforms. Three big JVs last year, it looks like Prudential, Care and RioCan which maybe you're starting to address here in Canada already, but question is, what's the status of your conversations with those partners. Looks like the Pru JV had a lot of debt maturities in 2016, wondering if that could be a catalyst to buying in some of that JV?","Dave Henry","Yes, Pru has made it pretty clear that they're not interested in disposing of their interest in most of the properties we have together with them. They have a lot of money to put to work, they're not interested in monetizing at this point in time and in fact, they've been very cooperative in terms of paying off debt on some of the properties, that we have together because they'd like in act to put out more money, so some of the properties are scheduled become unencumbered.","That said, they've also agreed to our concept where we truly have secondary assets in tertiary markets that those should be put on the market and they've cooperated with us in selling those to third parties. But in terms of buying out, their interest in certain properties it's probably not going to happen in the near future.","RioCan, we have talked about and I think you'll see that joint venture be reduced over time as we began to identify certain assets that we both think should be sold, as well as certain assets, where they have plans to convert more to a mixed use or redevelop and those might be opportunities for us to reduce the size of our joint venture. That said, they've been a wonderful partner all the way long.","In terms of Care, we've had some discussions but at this point they're inconclusive and as you probably know New York Common is going through a change of leadership in real estate side, so it will be a while before they really settle out on their long-term strategy I believe.","Conor Flynn","But they've also been very cooperative and agreeable about selling assets that we don't fit in that Tier 1 category.","Haendel St. Juste","Appreciated the color, a follow-up, if I may? On redev, I think Conor you mentioned earlier, pipeline today $1.1 billion. I'm curious as to how big the correct opportunity the redev opportunity within your current portfolio is today, ball park? How large you'd be comfortable growing the redev pipeline either in total dollars or as a percentage of JV?","Conor Flynn","Well, $1.1 billion is a gross value that includes the JV properties. So we've gone pretty deep in each and every asset to see what we can do in terms of unlocking value. Our redevelopment definition is very simple. It's changing the square footage, changing the footprint of the asset. So adding density is one that where we're laser focused on trying to add more to the pipeline. We continue to try and see what we can add to it, but it really is typically based off of opportunities that come as we go through the year.","So with lease maturities, if tenants for example going after size options all of a sudden that triggers redevelopment opportunity that we didn't necessarily think was actionable. So one just recently happened and we're adding it to the redevelopment pipeline in addition to potentially looking for more of a mixed use, approach to it as well as looking at other opportunities that we have yet to really to the redevelopment pipeline. So that's how we look at it.","Haendel St. Juste","Appreciated.","Operator","The next question comes from Christopher Lucas with Capital One Securities","Christopher Lucas","Kind of follow-up on the last question. Conor, you did talk about the ways of growing the redevelopment program beyond the $1.1 billion and I guess given the success you had so far, I was just wondering if one of the ways you can grow that is to literally just change how you're thinking about the underwriting given, again the success you've had so far?","Conor Flynn","Well it's a good point, I mean rents are definitely moving up. So the returns that come along with those higher rents definitely justify more projects and we're looking at that. In addition to adding potentially some mixed use opportunities that we have yet to really add. So we're trying to dive through the portfolio and also looking at new acquisitions that have redevelopment potential.","So some of the ones we've been looking at, I think now have to have redevelopment component for us to really get excited about. So you're right on there that, as we look at returns. We might start to look at other opportunities as rents have moved up, now it start to make more sense.","Christopher Lucas","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from George Auerbach with Credit Suisse","George Auerbach","Great, thanks. Just quickly on the sales in Canada and the Albertsons stake overtime. Is there any way to shield or manage through the taxable gains in those investments? Or do you just sort of pay the taxes and move on and that's it?","Dave Henry","Well actually, we do have some room in terms of handling. In Canada, so there's two components to the tax, there is a Canadian tax that has to get paid on the gains. So you do have an actual cash tax that occurs in Canada and then there's the remaining piece that will flow back into our US entity. So it's all the matter of how we shield that, now we have done a lot of analysis about doing cost EC studies and other things like that repair regs analysis that give us a lot more depreciation expense from a tax standpoint to help manage it.","In addition, we have been doing a lot more 1031 exchanges on the assets that we sold in the US. So although, we've been reporting a lot of gains in US from a taxable standpoint, they're actually being deferred. So we have a pretty sizable bucket to be able to deal with the gains that will come.","George Auerbach","Great, thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Bujnicki for any closing remarks.","David Bujnicki","Thanks, Chad and to everybody that participated in our call today.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki. Please go ahead.","David Bujnicki","Thanks and good morning and thank you for joining Kimco's second quarter earnings call. With me on the call this morning is Conor Flynn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ross Cooper, our Chief Investment Officer, and Glenn Cohen, our CFO. In addition, other members of our executive team are also available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks; including Milton, our Executive Chairman; Dave Jamieson, our EVP of Asset Management and Operations; and Ray Edwards, our Executive Vice President of Retailer Services.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking. And it is important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors. ","During this presentation management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Thanks Dave. Good morning everyone. Today we will report on major milestones that encompass our 2020 vision. I will give a quick update on the execution of our strategic goals, quarterly metrics and development and redevelopment pipelines before turning it over to Ross to cover acquisitions and dispositions, followed by Glenn to discuss our financial results. ","We are making great strides in creating long term shareholder value as we continue to simplify and strengthen our business. With our recent Canadian dispositions, our strategic exit from Canada is over 90% complete. And we have further reduced our joint venture investment. More specifically, the number of properties in our JV portfolio now stands at 152 as compared to 551 sites in 2010, a decrease of 72%. And the overall value of the joint venture portfolio is currently $5.4 billion gross as compared to $12.3 billion gross in 2010, a decrease of 56%. ","We are further simplifying our capital structure by redeeming our Canadian bonds to coincide with our exit of Canada. We will also prepay an unsecured bond and a portion of our US mortgages that come due in 2017, to take full advantage of the all time low rate environment and further extend our maturity profile. ","We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities in the capital markets, including the use of our ATM to improve the balance sheet as we strive to achieve our publicly stated goal of achieving an A minus A3 credit rating. All of these efforts will put Kimco in a position of strength for the next cycle and move us closer to our 2020 vision. ","Internally we will be merging our primary taxable REIT subsidiary into the parent company, thus transferring long term hold assets into the REIT structure to simplify and make our holdings more efficient. Overall the strong fundamentals of high quality open air centers continue to demonstrate why we believe we are, to use Milton's words, in the sweet spot of retail. ","Supply and demand remain in check with limited new development on the horizon. Retailers with new formats in off price specialty and traditional grocers, pet stores: home improvement, fitness, wellness and beauty are all looking to grow store count. ","Our occupancy is up to 96% with our anchor boxes at 98.3% and our small shop occupancy improving to 89.2%. Achieving an eight-year high in occupancy could not have been accomplished without the incredible effort of our entire team. New deal spreads improved to 29.8% demonstrating the portfolio\u2019s mark-to-market opportunity. Renewals and options also improved 10.7% to produce an impressive combined leasing spread of 16.2%, our highest in three years. Same-site NOI increased 3.1% which included 30 basis points from redevelopment. ","Notwithstanding the success, the Sports Authority liquidation will create some near term headwinds but will result in long term positives. Our exposure to Sports Authority has been reduced with retailers acquiring two leases at auction, reducing our exposure to 1.1% of ABR. ","We also see the opportunity to buy back the lease at our Farmington, Connecticut property which has 52 years of term remaining at a $4 rent which was dramatically below market. The numerous auction delays and false starts resulted in a shallow pool of retailers that were willing to pay the unpaid pre-petition rent and live by the existing lease terms. Throughout the auction process we've been proactively marketing the 23 remaining boxes and a one fully executed lease and LOIs working on all remaining locations. We see further opportunity to add a grocery component in certain locations and the ability to mark to market undervalued leases. ","Based upon the interest we are receiving, we are optimistic the absorption of these spaces will be swift over the next six to twelve months. We are maintaining our full year guidance for same-site NOI growth and occupancy based on our re-forecasts that incorporate the impact from the Sports Authority liquidation and the demand for our high quality real estate. ","Progress continues on our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline, especially on our larger projects that we are calling the Signature Series. Whole Foods in Wynnewood, PA is now installing fixtures in their new store they set to open in September. Grand Parkway in Houston is on schedule and is now 89% pre-leased. The Target pad was turned over on June 10. And all 7 junior anchor leases are fully executed. ","Grant Parkway Phase II is also moving forward with two of the three anchor boxes fully executed with the Academy Sports and Hobby Lobby. Dania Pointe in the Fort Lauderdale MSA is also on schedule. The Costco pad is being prepped with turnover set for second quarter of 2017. Phase II of Dania has kicked off pre-leasing and we are happy to announce the fully executed anchor lease with H&M. ","Our major redevelopments are also gaining traction, highlighted by the new parking garage at Pentagon which is nearing completion. This will allow us to move forward with the Phase I densification. Our redevelopments for the quarter are projected to produce 9.9% return on invested capital and we continue to believe this growing pipeline is a major differentiator for Kimco as we are just getting started with the repositioning of our top assets. ","As you can see, our 2020 vision is coming more and more into focus as we create a portfolio of assets that is both resilient to economic downturns and at the same time able to attract the best tenants to generate quality earnings growth and expand our overall net asset value. Our portfolio is focused and concentrated in the best U.S. markets with the best demographics. ","Our shopping center strikes a wonderful balance with off-price and grocery anchors and just the right mix of small shop tenants. These are the types of centers that consumers return to again and again in good times and bad, whether they're looking to restock the refrigerator at Albertsons, treasure hunt at TJX or get a haircut or manicure. When you add our Signature Series of development and redevelopment projects to the solid defensive foundation, the portfolio\u2019s changing profile is dramatic both in quality and value. ","Ross will now walk you through our transactions for the quarter. ","Ross Cooper","Thanks, Conor. With the execution of our second quarter transaction activity completed, we took another big step towards our goals of reducing leverage, joint ventures and non-core market ownership. The largest driver of our progress was the continued and accelerated pace of our Canadian exit, highlighted by the Anthem transaction which closed last month. ","Coupled with the sale of several additional Canadian assets, we have now sold over 90% of our Canadian LOI with the remainder to be sold by year end. In the US we took advantage of the strong investor demand for shopping centers with the disposition of 12 assets for $220 million. This included the sale of our last remaining asset in Mississippi as well as other non-core assets in markets, such as Council Bluffs, Iowa and Overland Park, Kansas. ","The blended cap rate on the dispositions for the quarter was 6.6% which was in line with our expectations. We will continue to selectively prune the portfolio to enhance the overall quality on a go forward basis. ","On the acquisition side, we remain laser focused on high quality assets with both long and short term growth located within strong demographic areas. As previously announced, the acquisition of our partner share in Oakwood Plaza and Dania not only provides Kimco with 100% ownership of two of the largest and highest quality projects in the portfolio but also further achieves the goal of JV reduction. ","Additionally, we are excited to announce the planned acquisition of the Kentlands marketplace, a 250,000 square foot Whole Foods anchored center in Gaithersburg, Maryland. This metro DC asset provides a unique opportunity to own a highly coveted infill asset with excellent grocery sales of almost $1300 a square foot and also has significant near term upside and redevelopment potential. Closing is anticipated in the next couple of weeks and we look forward to sharing our plans for this asset. ","Our transactional activity for the year has been front loaded with asset sales as we have sold 821 million KIM share which bumped against the low end of our initial 2016 disposition range of 825 million to 975 million. With over 20 assets either under contract with accepted offers or in the market, we are increasing our full year 2016 disposition range to $1 billion to $1.15 billion. Our 2016 estimate for acquisitions remains intact at $450 million to $550 million as we will have purchased approximately 250 million of shopping centers, including the pending Kentlands acquisition. ","The environment for quality real estate remains hypercompetitive but we continue to evaluate unique opportunities and pick our spots. Capital is abundant with significant equity being placed by foreign investors, pension funds life companies, private equity and REITs. Debt is readily available from CMBS and life companies with historically low rates and yields are expected to stay low for the near future. ","Recent sub-5% cap rates on open air shopping center transactions have closed in New York, New Jersey Metro, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Austin, Texas, Washington D.C. and South Florida. These are all primary markets for Kimco where we have a strong established presence. ","Single tenant ground leases with strong credit are trading in the low 4% range and even sub-4% in some cases which bodes well for the value of our long term ground leases with the likes of Walmart, Costco, Home Depot and others. ","With that, I am happy to pass it over to Glenn to provide detail on the financials. ","Glenn Cohen","Thanks, Ross and good morning. We continue to execute on the key components of our 2020 vision that Conor and Ross described. Our 2020 vision is focused on both the left side of the balance sheet as well as the right side as we continue to further improve our debt metrics and balance sheet position. ","Now for some color on the quarter and further details regarding the three strategic initiatives we announced last night which we believe will further improve our capital structure as well as our recurring growth profile and tax efficiency in both the short term and long term. ","Headline FFO per share which represents the official NAREIT definition was $0.38 for the second quarter, meeting First Call consensus. As a reminder, our consensus estimate is based on NAREIT defined FFO. Included in the headline result is one penny per share attributable to profit participation from the sale of a preferred equity investment. ","Headline FFO per share for the second quarter last year was $0.44 which included $0.08 per share attributable to the gain on the sale of our marketable securities investment in SUPERVALU. FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expense and non-operating impairments was $0.37 per diluted share for the second quarter, the same level as last year. We achieved this level despite a $17 million decrease in net operating income primarily attributable to the significant Canadian and U.S. property dispositions over the past year. This was largely offset by a $15 million reduction in financing costs related to lower debt levels, lower interest rates on debt refinancing and the redemption of our 6.9% preferred stock last year. ","For the six months FFO as adjusted per share is $0.74, up from $0.73 for the comparable period last year and on target with our recurring forecast and guidance expectations. We ended the second quarter with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 5.7 times, down from 6.3 times a year ago. ","In addition, our net debt to EBITDA on a look-through basis is 6.9 times, which includes our $800 million of preferred stock which is all callable next year and our pro-rata share of joint venture debt which by the way is down to $843 million from a peak of $3 billion. The 6.9 times level is at the high end of our target range of 6.4 times to 6.9 times that we announced at our 2020 vision investor day. We improved our debt maturity profile with the addition of $150 million to our 4.25% 30-year bonds and we also issued 38.9 million of common equity through our ATM program in the early part of the quarter. ","Now for some additional color on the three strategic initiatives announced last night. Initiative one: redeeming our outstanding Canadian bonds. As Ross mentioned, with the completed sale of Canadian assets representing over 90% of our Canadian NOI, it\u2019s no longer necessary to have the Canadian denominated bonds outstanding. This is clearly an opportunity for us to further de-lever the balance sheet. As such, we will be redeeming the Canadian denominated $350 million of bonds at the end of August using the proceeds from the Canadian sales which have also produced over $111 million of non-FFO gain year to date. We expect to incur a prepayment charge of approximately $26 million or $0.06 per share which will impact net income and headline FFO in the third quarter. ","Initiative 2: The prepayment of U.S. debt that's due in 2017. As part of reaching our stated goal of increasing our unsecured credit ratings to A minus and A3 we want to further extend our debt maturity profile, further improve our fixed charge and debt service coverage ratios and increase our unencumbered asset pool. To this end we'll be redeeming our $290.9 million, 5.7% bond during 2017 and prepaying $137 million of 6.32% mortgage debt, that\u2019s due in December 2017. ","The funding of the aggregate principal amount of $427.9 million and the prepayment charge of $22 million or $0.05 per share which will impact net income and headline FFO will be made with a combination of proceeds from asset sales, availability under our revolving credit facility and depending on market conditions issuance of an unsecured bond. ","Initiative three: merging our primary taxable REIT subsidiary, Kimco Realty Services into Kimco Realty Corporation. This tax free merger will effectively transfer the ownership of our Albertsons investment in over 30 shopping center assets, many of which were developed in our former merchant building are retained and today are considered long term hold properties. This transaction will provide as greater tax efficiency as well as reduce our administrative costs. ","In conjunction with the merger which is expected to be completed in the third quarter, generally accepted accounting principles require the establishment of a valuation reserve when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. As such non-cash charge against net income of $66 million or $0.16 per share and headline FFO of $41 million or $0.10 per share respectively would be recorded. The difference between the net income charge and the FFO charge is related to the tax impact from impairments previously taken on operating properties which were excluded from FFO. ","Subsequent to the merger, a portion of this valuation reserve may no longer be required in the event certain taxable transactions related to these assets occur. This would include a monetization of our Albertsons investment. In total the three initiatives just discussed are expected to have a total impact on net income of approximately $114 million or $0.27 per share and our headline FFO of $89 million or $0.21 per share. As a result of the charges, we are revising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.34 to $1.42 with the midpoint of $1.38 from the previous headline FFO per share guidance range of $1.54 to $1.62 with the midpoint of $1.58. ","We continue to anticipate that the bulk of our transactions will occur in the fourth quarter. We are reaffirming our FFO as adjusted, recurring FFO per share guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52 with a midpoint of $1.50 which builds upon our solid first half performance and the expected benefits from the three initiatives along with the impact from the Sports Authority liquidation and our increased disposition range. ","And with that we'd be happy to take your questions. ","Conor Flynn","We're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call due to the large volume of participants in the queue. We request that you respect a one question limit with the appropriate follow up. This will provide all of our callers an opportunity to speak with management. If you have additional questions you're welcome to rejoin the queue. Kate, you can take our first caller. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. ","Christy McElroy ","Hi good morning everyone. Glenn, just on the U.S. debt paydown portion, just want to make sure that I understand the timing of the sources and uses. I realize the note paydown will be in August but, or the mortgages will be prepaid then also? And then what's the expectation for sort further asset sale timing in the second half in terms of funding it and then when would you expect to do another bond deal, if so? And then just trying to get a sense for where the line of credit stands at year end?","Glenn Cohen","So we ended really good shape \u2013 well, I\u2019ll take in pieces. The line of credit, we ended with about $100 million on, so we have plenty of capacity on a $1.75 billion credit facility. As it relates to the mortgages that we will be prepaying, that will probably happen on September 1, notices have been sent to them and then the bonds will be paid at the end of the month. So we have roughly -- it's 30 days, 35 days and we will monitor the bond market closely and probably be active sooner than later I would guess. ","As it relates to the asset sales, again there's a fair amount, I think Ross mentioned that there's twenty assets that are either under contract or that we have whoppers on. So the second part of the year you'll see another few hundred million dollars of sales that will help fund all these transactions that we're doing. As it relates to Canadian bonds, the cash -- most of the cash is already sitting on the balance sheet. ","Christy McElroy ","And then just a quick follow up on the TRS merger I think that 8 million of the 29 million annual savings, that\u2019s presumably most of that 8 million in the corporate tax provisions, and how much is the reduced administrative costs that could impact G&A within that number?","Glenn Cohen","It's a few hundred thousand dollars because you're dealing with less tax returns and there\u2019s a lot of other compliance related issues that will be able to mitigate. ","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt ","I guess for Ross, given your description of the environment, I'm wondering if you think cap rates could even go lower for a community strip shopping centers in major metro markets in the latter half of 2016?","Ross Cooper","Yeah we absolutely do. And I think nobody has been touting that for a while now and we absolutely have seen in the market on deals that we're chasing particularly those core markets that I mentioned in the scripts and they continue to go lower. Unlevered IRR expectations are in the 5s and we continue to be disciplined but we feel that there's opportunities if we pick our spots which we will continue to do similar to this Kentlands acquisitions in D.C. ","Craig Schmidt ","And has this accelerated post Brexit decision?","Ross Cooper","I think we've seen it over the course of the year. That certainly has factored into I think a renewed vigor and search for yield that you just \u2013 you can't find it anywhere else and a lot of investors have continued to focus on on the U.S. shopping center industry. ","Operator","The next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore ISI.","Samir Khanal ","Good morning guys. Just trying to get a better understanding of same store NOI growth for the second half. Are you expecting more clawbacks on sort of the reserves you took in Sports Authority previously? I mean year to date you're trending at about 2.3%. I'm just trying to get a better sense as to how you get to the midpoint of guidance, the 3%. I know you have some of the Anna's Linen and some of the A&P boxes that will start paying rent but is there anything else that we\u2019re missing to get to kind of the midpoint or the high end of guidance?","Glenn Cohen","Yeah, it\u2019s Glenn. So we looked at our forecast and it was always anticipated that the back end of it, third and the fourth quarters, had stronger same site NOI growth, because you have more assets \u2013 more leases that are actually coming online and starting to pay rent from lease up that was done previously. So we always worked at to that, the second half of the year would be stronger. ","In terms of the Sports Authority reserve, where we are is probably where it\u2019s going to end at this point because what we've reversed is what we think we're going to collect. Now that they're going to close the rest of the stores, I think the reserve is where it is. So you'll just see further growth come in the third and fourth quarters from really organic things happening at the portfolio level. ","Samir Khanal ","And then just in terms of acquisitions, I mean year to date you've done about $150 million. I think you've kept your guidance unchanged at the midpoint about 500 million, just trying to get an idea of what you're seeing in the pipeline at this time?","Ross Cooper","Sure. I mean we have obviously mentioned the Kentlands deal which is another $95 million which will get us up to the $250 million right in the middle of the range. We continue to evaluate opportunities both from third parties and continue discussions with our joint venture partners. We are fairly confident that we'll be able to assess the JV platform for some other opportunities in the second half of the year. So we're very comfortable with the range that we\u2019ve outlined. ","Operator","The next question is from Jeremy Metz of UBS. ","Jeremy Metz ","Hey guys good morning. So going into the year I think the view is really that this is going to be the end of the big transformative sales here. You're obviously largely there but you did raise your disposition expectations again which is offsetting some of the positives from the debt redemptions and the TRS merger. So I guess I'm just wondering was the decision to sell more driven by the opportunity to pull forward some of that debt prepayments or is it a result of better pricing and interest in the market for what you're selling?","Conor Flynn","Yeah, it's really the latter. We've seen extreme interests and strong pricing of what we've been selling. So we've taken that opportunity to push more out into the market than what was initially contemplated. So as long as we continue to execute and get the pricing we think it's a great opportunity to enhance the quality of the portfolio through the end of this year and then on a go forward basis starting in the beginning of 2017 we will be a much more selective and opportunistic disposition program somewhere in $150 million dollar range plus or minus. ","Jeremy Metz ","And then one for Glenn, it sounds like there's a bond deal possibly in guidance here. But in terms of ATM used earlier this year I think in the $28 to $29 range, I don't think you've used it since the last call. Your stock price is obviously higher today. So I am just wondering if you considered issuing more equity maybe as opposed to selling some of those assets or more broadly, do you have equity built into your plans for the rest of the year?","Glenn Cohen","Again we look at the entire capital plan for the full company. The ATM is an option for us and it's a balance between the amount of equity issuance and debt issuance to get us to the debt metric level that we want to be at. So we'll continue to monitor the market and where we think it's opportunistic we will take advantage of it.","Jeremy Metz ","Nothing built into guidance then?","Glenn Cohen","Nothing further, no.","Operator","The next question is from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.","Haendel St. Juste ","Hey good morning. First quick question on the OpEx, I noticed a big drop year over year. What's driving that and is it one time, is it sustainable, some color on that please?","Glenn Cohen","It\u2019s Glenn. Hi Haendel. So you have two categories that are lower. One happened to just be snow removal costs are lower. So I can't predict that for next year, so we will have to see what happens. And then we actually did spend a lot less money on parking lot patching and repairing where this year versus last year, just a sign of where the portfolio looks like and the conditions of the properties today. So I think you have a fairly good run rate where you are now. ","Haendel St. Juste ","And then just curious what does the internalization of the TRS mean for the Kimco plus business going forward?","Conor Flynn","Well when you think about what we did, it was more about bringing the properties, the shopping center assets back into the REIT structure. These are assets that were developed by us years ago, that were originally part of our merchant development business. We've leased them up, fully developed them. Most of them are long term hold assets. They really belong in the REIT structure. So it's a matter of trying to find the most tax efficient way to bring them back in their appropriate space. With that, though, the Albertsons transaction and the investment in Albertsons comes along with it because we own less than 10% of the investment there and allowed us to bring it back into the REIT. So there is some benefit potentially that could come from it from a tax structuring standpoint but as it relates to the plus business we do have -- still have a separate TRS where if there were things that were appropriate for that we would house them there. This is more about the properties though. ","Haendel St. Juste ","Got you. Since you mentioned Albertsons, any update there on potential thoughts for the IPO? ","Ray Edwards","This is Ray Edwards. While the company still is pursuing the IPO option and the S1 is kept updated and I think it will be updated again next week on that. The company is also another opportunities for us to monetize part of our best move while we\u2019re waiting for the IPO market to come around. ","Operator","The next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. ","Paul Morgan ","Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up on that. So you mentioned that the transactional income that you are expecting is still back end loaded. But I guess I understood that when you said that last quarter, that was referring to Albertsons, at least largely. Can you help me understand that since that\u2019s probably not going to happen at least the way maybe you anticipated it earlier in the year? How do I think about Albertsons and then the transactional backend loaded number? ","Conor Flynn","The transactional income is still premised on some level of monetization of our Albertsons investment, that's what\u2019s there. Ray?","Ray Edwards","Yes, I mean, in 2013 October when they tried the IPO it didn't work out. We kept \u2013 as I said before the S-1 updated on file to do that. But as markets are fickle, the partners have gotten together and looking at other opportunities as a path to monetize part of our investment and we're considering to doing that, and that might be a vehicle for us to monetize and we're optimistic it will happen this year. So we're on track for it. ","Paul Morgan ","And then just real quick, you mentioned the cap rate compression for major metro assets. How widespread do you think you might see that? Is it something that's trickling into secondary markets or B assets or is this kind of institutional quality demand that's driving it and so more kind of restrictive? ","Conor Flynn","Well certainly on the institutional assets, they continue to compress. In the secondary markets we're still seeing very strong pricing. Our dispositions in the U.S. are still in the high 6s, low 7s. Particularly with assets that have a grocer, that is a dominant grocer within that market we're still seeing very strong pricing even in the secondary and tertiary markets. Where there's a little bit of softness is more in the commodity type retail, where there's no true value add and are relatively flat asset with no grocer is starting to see a little bit of trickle upwards in cap rates but still well within the range of expectation and within pricing that we're comfortable selling. ","Operator","The next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill ","Alexander Goldfarb ","Good morning. Glenn, just to clarify, on the guidance it sounded on one hand like you were including a bond offering just because you're going to get $9.5 million of benefit this year from the TRS and the bond take outs, and yet then it sounded like you weren't including an unsecured deal in your numbers this year. So can you just clarify what's in it? And then maybe it's just that the bond deal may be so late in the year that it doesn't impact this year's numbers? ","Glenn Cohen","No, I mean the guidance does contemplate refinancing what we're calling on the USI with a bond. So that is the guidance. ","Alexander Goldfarb ","And then because you guys traditionally give you next year's guidance with the third quarter, you mentioned at the start about all the preferreds being callable next year and maybe the ones in the 5s are still attractive but certainly you've got a 6% one out there. As we think about our 2017 numbers, we are obviously adjusting for the TRS and the bond take outs. Should we also be thinking about the preferreds coming out or is that a decision that you just mentioned they\u2019re callable but we shouldn't read anything into that? ","Glenn Cohen","Again as we get \u2013 first of all, well as far as guidance we don't do guidance in the third quarter, we do it later. And second, I\u2019ve mentioned it because it is another opportunity for us to further reduce our overall cost of capital -- again but it's going to be subject to market conditions at the time and where rates are. So I throw it out because it's something that is near term. It's on our radar screen. ","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao ","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just going back to the commentary about the strong pricing environment that caused you to increase your dispo guidance for the year and then also thinking about the comment about a more normalized level in 2017, I guess if we continue to see pricing hold up and maybe even improve over the back half of this year, should we be thinking about something more than $150 million just as you look to take advantage of that pricing? ","Conor Flynn","Well we really feel like we're at the end of our transformation, so we'll continue to be opportunistic. But we're very happy with the level of the portfolio, the quality of the assets that we have once this year is completed. So we will always evaluate the quality of the properties, where the risk levels are, if markets are moving and things of that nature. But we don't anticipate any larger scale disposition program beyond this year. ","Vincent Chao ","And then just maybe the situation in Puerto Rico for a second. I'm curious if you can provide some commentary on what you're seeing there. ","Ross Cooper","Sure, the Puerto Rico portfolio is holding up nicely. The occupancy is still above 95%, same site was positive. But obviously relatively muted, so it's one that with the recent announcement of the PROMESA I think that the optimism is taking hold on the island. Clearly they have some issues to work through on the debt levels but we think from the shopping center standpoint the traffic volume is still very very high. They still are strong. So we think overall the outlook has gotten a bit brighter recently. ","Operator","The next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. ","Ki Bin Kim ","Thank you. Could you just comment on the Dania project in Pentagon? It seems like some of the numbers have changed a little bit and I'm just wondering if it's a cosmetic choice in terms of to take out a Phase 2 disclosure or is there actually a change in the scope of the project? ","Conor Flynn","Sure we actually broke out the both projects in phases. So like we talked about earlier most of our projects have what we're calling off ramps and phases that we can actually see if we want to go or no go on the projects. So on Pentagon, the Phase 1 as I mentioned is really the parking deck that's nearing completion and then the first tower that's entitled and is ready to go vertical as soon as the parking deck is complete. The second phase on Pentagon is the second tower. So again we will monitor the absorption rate and the rents and where they're coming in and then make the determination on the second tower if and when it's appropriate. ","Dania, same thing, first phase we broke out that costs. So you can see exactly what goes into the first phase, and that\u2019s the Costco portion as well as some junior anchors that we're moving along nicely. The second phase there is going to be more of a higher density play. So we broke that out as well, as I mentioned H&M lease is fully executed, so the pre-leasing is starting to move forward on that as well. So we wanted to give you a bit more granularity on the phasing opportunities we have on some of these larger scale projects. ","Ki Bin Kim ","And just a follow-up on a previous question on Albertsons, you mentioned that you might partially monetize it before IPO, if I heard that correctly. How do you think about that? Because I'm guessing there's probably a pretty decent liquidity discount that you would have to take if you wanted to monetize it before the shares are publicly traded. So what goes on behind that thought process there? ","Conor Flynn","Well I think for us and our partners, we don't think the discount would be that great, first of all. And we would be selling out large of a piece of the investment. So what we feel that will do for us is one, put up a little money in our pocket but also validate the valuation that we feel we have in Albertsons and hopefully you will add 15% to 20% to the valuation after we announced a transaction. ","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller ","Yeah, hi. You talked about for the Sports Authorities 6 to 12 months, I think, to address the remaining boxes, what time period do you see most of the boxes actually occupied and rent paying, like how far down the road? ","Conor Flynn","We have pretty clear visibility into the absorption that we think is going to occur. We have LOIs working on eighteen of the boxes right now that are pretty close to fully executed. So we actually think we have a chance to be cautiously optimistic that a lot of them will be done before the end of the year. But again we want to -- it's probably going to take six to twelve months before all of them are fully occupied and the rent starts to come in. So we do have one lease that's fully executed with a grocery store, that\u2019s 33% above prior rent and we continue to see what other opportunities exist to add grocery components going forward to the opportunities that we have. ","Michael Mueller ","So that 6 to 12 was actually occupied rent paying, not just addressed and leased? ","Conor Flynn","Correct. ","Operator","Next question is from Richard Hill of Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill ","I had a quick question about the rental rate releasing spreads. First of all, congrats on getting those to highest level in three years. I had a question, though. It looks like there were some absolute increases between new leases and renewals but maybe also an additional weighting towards new leases over renewals. Am I thinking about that correctly? And if so, is there anything there? Are you seeing more leasing velocity on this space? What drove that? ","Conor Flynn","Well clearly you\u2019re seeing that occupancy is hitting near an all time high. So when spaces come available there's usually a bidding war to get high quality real estate in this market. So that\u2019s clearly what\u2019s driving the rental spread both in the new leases and typically now when you see renewals come up it\u2019s more option notices that are coming in rather than say pure renewals because people are worried about giving up their high quality real estate because they know there is a chance that they might lose it if they don't exercise that option. ","Operator","The next question comes from Collin Mings of Raymond James.","Collin Mings ","Good morning, guys. Just going back to Alex's question, where do you think you could price preferreds today? ","Glenn Cohen","Preferreds today we are probably in the low 5s. I mean in the 5s. ","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities.","Chris Lucas ","Good morning, everyone. I guess as you guys have moved very far down the line on simplification, I was curious as to what your thoughts are on the remaining JVs and whether there has been any additional conversations with your partners in terms of how those may be either dissolved or whatever. ","Conor Flynn","We really have three large remaining JV partners left and that\u2019s really Prudential, CPP, and the New York Common Fund. So they're all great partners and they're all longstanding relationships that we've had over the years. And typically they're long term holders. So I don't see any sort of large transaction in the near term but there's always bites at the apple that we think we can get on the margin whether it's a smaller portfolio of properties or a few here and there that we can -- that we're able to acquire, similar to the Dania and Oakwood transaction that we announced this quarter. So again we will take the opportunities when they present themselves. But again we're really down to three large major partners that are all great partners and long term holders of high quality real estate. ","Glenn Cohen","Right, also two of those ventures, the common fund venture that we have, we own almost 50% of it and with CPP we own 55% of it. So we are a major stakeholder in those.","Chris Lucas ","And Glenn, just a quick follow up on the guidance adjustment as it related to the transactional income expense line. Can you just sort of walk -- prior guidance was $25 million to $42 million of gains. Now it\u2019s $40 million to $59 million of loss. You've given us the one number, the $89 million for some of these strategic investments. I guess I am curious as to what the other delta might be. ","Glenn Cohen","That's really it, it\u2019s the same as what we had before. The difference is our expectation of some monetization of Albertsons in the number. So the only change to the guidance that occurred really relates around the $89 million, it\u2019s maybe a penny difference because we actually had some transactional income that's already done, so the preferred equity investment that was sold this quarter and the one from last quarter gave us a penny of headline FFO. ","Operator","The next question is from Jason White of Green Street Advisors.","Jason White ","Hey guys, just going back to cap rates for a minute. You talked about some of the higher quality properties trading at lower cap rates. What are you seeing on the middle, the higher end like some of the properties you're selling? Are those cap rates compressing as well? ","Conor Flynn","Yes, they\u2019ve really maintained the levels that we've seen for the last nine to twelve months. So in the U.S. and some of the secondary markets we are in the high 6s into the low 7s. And if there's a grocery anchor even if it's outside of the core markets we've sold a couple of assets in the high 5s and the low 6s. So we still feel really good about where cap rates are. We have not seen them change materially and the buyer pools have been a bit shallow for the last twelve months compared to the beginning stages into the middle of 2015. But those groups are still very serious, they're able to get financing when they need it and we haven't really seen any hiccups in the deals that we've put under contract and getting it across the finish line. ","Jason White ","And then just one in your same-store NOI guidance. If you look at the top end of your range, is that still on the table? It kind of implies a pretty high growth rate in the back half of the year with the Sports Authority headwind. Is there any way of achieving that high end at this point? ","Glenn Cohen","I mean there's always a way depending on how quickly certain lease starts [ph] and then cash starts flowing. Again we've been guiding what's the middle, somewhere in the three, 3 to 3.1 range but it's a range. So we don't control everything that happens but we do feel comfortable towards that middle end of that range. ","Operator","The next question is from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Rich Moore ","Hello, guys, good morning. I'm curious, have you seen any change at Kmart recently, any difference in that retailer or maybe any difference in your discussions with them? ","Conor Flynn","We really haven't. I think there was some news stories that came out recently about some of the employee sentiment, and that I think was taken maybe out of context on certain stores. The two leases that we had actually coming due this quarter both of them exercised options. So I think that gives you some insight into it's still very much a trying to make do of what they can. But we continue to monitor it. We only have 21 sites left, a little less than 1% of ABR. We have four coming due in 2017 without any options that are all redevelopments. And so we're still continuing to monitor the situation and look to try and redevelop that real estate. ","Ray Edwards","This is Ray. I mean Kmart has a lot of flexibility because they haven't signed up lease in twenty years. So every one of the leases is probably the last five years of the main term with an option period. So they have a lot of flexibility to renew leases and we\u2019re making money like they did with a couple of hours and where they\u2019re not making money get out of them without having the big lease disposition programs. So they have a lot of flexibility on the Kmart side to wind down stores in a short period of time. ","Operator","The next question comes from R.J. Milligan of Baird.","R.J. Milligan ","Sorry about that, guys. Glenn, a question about 2017. As we look into the next year, what do you anticipate the potential impact to same-store NOI growth will be from the empty Sports Authority boxes? I know it's going to be partially offset by higher rental rates. Just curious if you could give us a range as to what you think the impact might be. ","Glenn Cohen","It\u2019s probably in the 50 to 60 basis point range. ","R.J. Milligan ","And largely depending on timing of when those leases start paying rent? ","Glenn Cohen","Yes.","End of Q&A","Operator","There are no additional questions at this time. This concludes our question and answer session.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Bujnicki, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.","David Bujnicki","Thanks so much. Good morning and thank you for joining Kimco\u2019s first quarter earnings call. With me on the call this morning is Conor Flynn, Chief Executive Officer; Ross Cooper, President and Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, CFO; Dave Jamieson, Chief Operating Officer, as well as other members of our executive team including Milton and Ray Edwards.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call maybe deemed forward-looking. It is important to note that the Company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the Company\u2019s SEC filings that address such factors.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco\u2019s operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our Web site.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Today I will provide a high level overview of our first quarter 2017 performance and current market trends. Ross will then cover our transactions this quarter and Glenn will provide details on key metrics and 2017 guidance outlook.","To paraphrase [Mark Lane] [ph], reports of the death of retail real estate have been greatly exaggerated and Kimco's strong first quarter is living proof. Five years ago we embarked upon a major program to improve the quality of our portfolio focusing on areas with significant barriers to entry, higher density in incomes, strong retailer demand emphasizing grocers and off-price retailers. Our leasing volume has validated the success of our transformation in helping to offset the challenging retail environment the industry is currently experiencing.","As an example of our strengthened portfolio, which given the size and diverse locations has always been defensive in nature, our top five markets which are entirely coastal contribute 50% of our rental revenues versus 35% when we began our transformation. Today, we are experiencing the rightsizing of the retail landscape as numerous chains announces store closures and embrace the Omni-channel experience that consumers have come to expect and demand.","While e-commerce is not nearly as profitable as the physical store, retailers understand that in an on-demand world those who offer a frictionless experience regardless of channel will thrive as consumers continue to spend at record levels. A few of our retailers are starting to effectively evolve their business models to take advantage of their brick-and-mortar retail, offering discounted services and pricing for online orders shipped to the physical store that cannot be matched by a pure online retailer. Wal-Mart and Home Depot are the perfect example of this.","As Milton is fond of saying, when it comes to retail real estate the only constant is change. And Kimco is adapting to this evolving landscape by working hard to deliver both the product and an experience to tenants and shoppers commensurate with this new world order. And that is why at many of our sites, you will see more health and wellness, more service providers, more food and restaurants, more entertainment and more experiential retailing.","Our leasing volume is the highest in ten plus years. Our team is laser focused on this most important part of our business. We are constantly challenging our entire team to do even better and they have. We backfilled five former Sports Authority boxes this quarter and continue to see demand from the remaining locations, from grocers, off-price, fitness and entertainment concepts. Despite the normal seasonal vacancies usually experienced in the post-holiday season, our gross occupancy remained flat quarter-over-quarter. More importantly, leasing spreads remain strong fueled by the significant mark-to-market opportunities embedded in our portfolio.","And while retailer weakness is dominating the media, many retailers, a majority of them our tenants, are thriving. Of our top 20 tenants, seven have recently hit all time highs in their stock price and many have large new store opening plans. For example, TJX, Ross and Burlington in aggregate have announced expansion plans in excess of 300 stores. While we are not immune from store closures, we continue to believe we are in the sweet stop of retail and will continue to generate interest from high quality tenants that will drive more traffic and more sales to the surrounding retail stores.","We have build our business plan, the 2020 vision, with a focus on balance sheet strength and the ability to deliver sustainable cash flow growth in different cycles. The good news is, the plan is working. The balance is strong and affords ample financial flexibility and we have created a portfolio and pipeline with multiple levers that would deliver both organic and value creation for the foreseeable future. Of particular note is our development and redevelopment pipeline which is starting to bear fruit, highlighted by our Grand Parkway project in Houston, which is now open for business.","Our redevelopments, a core competency of Kimco, are expected to incremental returns of 9% to 12% and we have several major redevelopment projects underway that will create additional flagship assets with high growth profiles. We believe investing in our business and growing organically is the right way to create long-term shareholder value. As I said earlier, we have a plan and the plan is working. And now I will turn the call over to Ross.","Ross Cooper","Thank you, Conor. The first question transaction activity has been a continuation of our 2020 vision goals and objectives which includes a disciplined approach towards acquisitions and dispositions. The acquisition environment remains ultra-competitive with opportunities hard to unearth as the pricing power for high quality core assets remains in favor of the seller. While this is no surprise in the major markets of Southern California, New York Metro and other coastal gateway regions, we have more recently seen bidding wars for institutional assets take place in Chicago, Minneapolis, Houston and Dallas.","We remain steadfast seeking opportunities to selectively buy assets that fit the disciplined strategy we have set forth. One such example is Plaza Del Prado in the affluent North Shore of Chicago. This unique asset provided immediate upside with the renewal of a bank outparcel at ten times the prior rent, as well as the ability to create future value through a possible early lease extension with a grocery anchor and a new outparcel.","There is also an incremental lease-up opportunity at the site with LOIs already underway just 90 days into the acquisition. Adjacent parcel acquisitions remain a focus for us as we closed on the purchase of a former Staples box at our Columbia Crossing shopping center in Columbia, Maryland. Sandwiched in between T.J.Maxx and DICK'S, we have already executed a lease with HomeGoods at an attractive return on investment.","As Conor indicated in his remarks, the retail environment is changing and it is imperative that we continue to evaluate future investments with an eye towards the evolving dynamics. We have directed our investment team to focus on those assets with a strong growth trajectory, either from below market leases or adaptable site plans with redevelopment potential, as well as considering existing and perspective tenant quality and space needs.","Regarding new development opportunities, we are taking a strict and cautious approach and believe that urban core, infill retail projects with multifamily or other vertical development opportunities are the future. The investment in Lincoln Square in Center City, Philadelphia, fits the mould. Our investment was made alongside Alterra Property Group, our partner who has significant multifamily development and management experience. We entered the project with substantial leasing interest already in place which we helped to finalize into executed deals prior to closing, including a small format Target, PetSmart and an exciting specialty grocer.","In addition, we had secured in place entitlements which enabled us to break ground the day after closing on the land. The development of 322 multifamily units above the retail provides for the urban infill, mix use environment that we believe will pay dividends into the future. On the disposition side, the first quarter sales amounted to $113.2 million of gross value with KIM's share of $65.8 million. The blended cap rate on the 8 centers sold was approximately 7.5%. Currently we have several assets on their contract in the low 6s and even sub-six cap rate in a few cases, highlighting the quality of the remaining assets for sales.","In terms of our 2017 acquisition and disposition guidance, we remain comfortable with the dollar amounts and cap rates previously established. We remain focused on continuing to further enhance and upgrade the portfolio through a disciplined capital recycling strategy. Glenn will now walk you through this quarter's financial results.","Glenn Cohen","Thanks, Ross and good morning. As we begin the second year of our 2020 vision strategy, we remain confident about achieving the objectives set out in our five year plan.","Our transform portfolio and internal growth levers remain solid and we are well positioned to deliver growth as lease-up continues and redevelopments and developments come on line. 2017 is off to an excellent start with strong first quarter operating and financial results. NAREIT FFO per share was $0.37 for the first quarter 2017 compared to NAREIT FFO per share for the first quarter 2016 of $0.38, which included $0.01 per share from our preferred equity profit participation.","FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes non-operating impairments and transactional income and expense was $155.8 million for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to $152.9 million for the same quarter last year with $0.37 per diluted share from both quarters. Our results were favorably impacted by increased base rents, improved bad debt expense totaling $7.5 million and the implementation of our strategic initiatives which lowered interest expense, G&A and tax expense by $11.1 million.","Offsetting these positive factors were lower lease termination fees, reduced below market rent amortization and lower FFO contribution from joint ventures. Our modest growth reflects last year's disposition of Canadian and U.S. properties totaling $982 million and the investment of over $390 million in our development pipeline, which will begin to generate NOI and FFO in the second half of this year as our first completed development project, Grand Parkway comes online.","Our four other active development projects, Dania, Christiana, Owings Mills and Lincoln Square will begin to come on line at various points during 2018 and 2019 and will be key contributors to our future growth. Our operating portfolio continues to perform very well. U.S. occupancy is a healthy 95.3% with anchor occupancy steady at 97.3% and small shop occupancy at 89.6%. So down 30 basis points from year-end. This modest decline is typical for the period directly after the holiday season.","U.S. occupancy is down ten basis points from year-end. First quarter occupancy was impacted by approximately 70 basis points relating to the remaining Sports Authority vacancies. We have leased a total of 14 former TSA boxes and have LOIs or active prospects on 11 of the remaining [13] [ph] TSA boxes. Leasing activity during the quarter was brisk delivering new leasing spreads of 17.9%, renewals and options exercised at 10.1% and combined leasing spreads of 10.9%.","Same-site NOI growth was positive 2.2% for the first quarter, driven by minimum rent increases of 150 basis points and improved credit loss of 130 basis points, offset by lower recoveries of 80 basis points. The comparable lower recoveries are attributable to a significant real estate tax refund received last year of one of our properties. Same-site NOI growth includes ten basis points from redevelopments. In addition, there was no impact on first quarter same-site growth from the Sport Authority bankruptcy as we had previously reserved the TSA rents in the first quarter 2016.","We continue our efforts to enhance our balance sheet. We completed a new $2.25 billion revolving credit facility with borrowings priced at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points. This new 5-year facility with a final maturity date in 2022, replaces our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility which was priced at LIBOR plus 92.5 basis points and was used to repay our maturing $250 million bank term loan which was priced at LIBOR plus 95 basis points. Also we issued a $400 million ten-year unsecured bond at a coupon of 3.8%. Proceeds from this instrument were used to repay our maturing 2017 mortgage debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.71%. Our weighted average debt maturity profile now stands at almost nine years, one of the longest in the REIT industry.","We are reaffirming our FFO per share guidance range of $1.50 to $1.54. Our guidance range does not include any transactional income or expense which we will incorporate as it occurs. As a result, our NAREIT defined FFO per share guidance range and our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range, remain the same. We are also reaffirming our full year 2017 same-site NOI growth range of 2% to 3% which includes the negative impact we expect to incur from the Sports Authority bankruptcy of approximately 225 basis points in the second quarter.","In addition, we are reaffirming our expected year-end occupancy range of 95.8% to 96.2%. And with that, we would be happy to answer your questions.","David Bujnicki","We are ready to move to the Q&A portion of the call. To make the Q&A more efficient, you may ask a question with one additional follow up. If you have additional questions, you are more than welcome to rejoin the queue. Bill, you can take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Justin] [ph] in for Craig. Could you talk about your densification efforts and maybe what we could expect in both the near and long-term.","Conor Flynn","Absolutely. I think we have been pretty consistent with our message there that our goal for our redevelopment program is to really unlock the highest and best use of the asset, and a lot of what we are working on in putting the entitlements in place to add density. So when we look at future projects, we always will have to see what was the supply and demand is in the certain area that we are developing and understand the different risks involved with the projects and ultimately the return on our investment. So for now we have identified two projects that are active, our Pentagon and our Lincoln Square projects. And we continue to look through the portfolio for future opportunities and continue to look at the highest and best use of the real estate.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. And just as a follow up to that, can you talk about, what types of qualities do you look for in a partner when you are looking at a mix use project to handle the residential component?","Conor Flynn","Absolutely. Typically what we do is we look for a partner that\u2019s a local expert, someone that has a great track record. Someone that has product in the close proximity where they can use that to their advantage and understand the market inside and out. We understand that. We are the retail experts. So what we bring to the table is really a showcase of what we are doing at Lincoln Square where we were able to use our expertise to negotiate and execute the deals with Target, PetSmart and others. And so we really want to focus the JV strategy on mixed use with partnering with the best-in-class in that local jurisdiction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [Greg] [ph] on for Nick. Just a quick question about the re-leasing spreads and TI spend. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on the difference between redevelopment versus TI and landlord cost.","Conor Flynn","Our redevelopment is very self-explanatory. We use the definition where we are changing the square footage on the site plan. We that that\u2019s the simplest definition that makes sense. So that\u2019s why redevelopment has a category unto itself regarding TI and CapEx spend. Whereas if it's a renewal or an option, that\u2019s really an in-place tenant that we are working with to keep in place and to extend term with.","Unidentified Analyst","Right. Okay. And so even though the [GLA] [ph] is changing, this is still being considered for that re-leasing spread then?","Ross Cooper","For the [GLA] [ph] is changing.","Unidentified Analyst","In terms of new rent.","Ross Cooper","The GLA is changing. It will be redevelopment and then we will account it as -- yes. And if it's a new lease then it will be a new lease. If it's a renewal, typically those are not counted in renewal spreads.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christy McElroy from Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Glenn, I just wanted to follow up on your comments on same store NOI growth and how you are thinking about the rest of the year. Specifically on Q2, how could the growth rate be impacted by some of the moving parts last year with Sports Authority and the reversal of some of the bad debt there. And then just looking into the back half of the year, you have your full year range, but just given all the uncertainty in the environment and everything we have been hearing about store closings and bankruptcies, how could that be impacted potentially by some of the stuff that you know about versus what you don\u2019t know about? And maybe as you go into further in the year and there is maybe some rent [relief] [ph] negotiations to consider there.","Glenn Cohen","Sure, Christy. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we remain confident in our guidance range of the 2% to 3% level. As we look and also as I said, as we mentioned, in the second quarter there will be an impact related to Sports Authority. The Sports Authority impact in the second quarter has a negative impact of about 225 basis points. So when you take that in over the full year, it averages around 56 basis point on a quarterly basis. That already is baked into your credit loss analysis for the full year, which is why we remain confident about where we are. As long as there is not massive bankruptcies which we don\u2019t expect, we have accounted for the store closings that we see already. So we remain confident that we will make our 2% to 3% range for the full year.","The second quarter though will be impacted. It's going to be very muted because you are starting with a negative 225 basis point decline to start with. So it's going to be lower definitely in the second quarter but as we go through the backend of the year, it definitely improves in the third quarter and fourth quarter.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then just sort of apart from, you know some of the bankruptcy stuff that we have seen. Have you seen any change in sort of the rate at which some of the larger format retailers are renewing space or exercising their options? And then on the demand side, have you seen any change in demand from retailers that are expanding and have opened to buys. Is there any slowing of that pace?","Conor Flynn","It's a good question, Christy. I think when we look at our portfolio, we have not experienced any change of demand from our retailer base. It's clearly driven by a few categories that are the shining stars in retail today. I mean off price we have talked about, TJX, Ross, Burlington, Nordstrom Rack. Those are really driving forces for us. And then you include the fitness category and the specialty grocers that are taking new deals today. We have not seen any rent relief requests of any material size throughout the portfolio, which is really a great indicator to show how strong the portfolio is operating. And one of the best things I could tell you, when we look at our five Sports Authority leases that we backfilled this quarter, there were five different tenants that took the spaces. So that just shows the diversity of the demand that we are dealing with. And when we look at our pipeline, we think that that absorption rate is just continuing to build momentum through the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Wes Golladay","When you look at what you have baked in for the tenant environment for the rest of the year, are you expecting more liquidations or just more of a Chapter 11 environment?","Conor Flynn","We anticipate that it will be more of a restructuring going on with some of the tenants that have already filed. H.H. Gregg, obviously one that we anticipated and that will probably be. We were anticipating getting all eight of those back. So we have planned accordingly for the store closures that have been announced and we continue to see strong demand. So we feel like we are in a good position.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then with H.H. Gregg, it looks like it was in Avenues Walk. Was that just a legacy project or are you still working with [tenants] [ph] that could be on the watch list for your development pipeline?","Conor Flynn","That was back in 2008, so you are spot on there. We continue to work on leases there to try and backfill that spot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Santos from Sandler O' Neill. Please go ahead.","Daniel Santos","My first question is, just generally speaking, how can we sort of reconcile your strong leasing stats with what the never ending sort of negative retail headline.","Conor Flynn","You know when you look past the retail headlines, I think you got to look at the categories of retail that are thriving. And it's really the off price segment that really has perfected the treasure hunt. When you look at TJX and their release, they talk about how their traffic is actually increasing when you look at what Home Depot and Lowe's are doing in the home improvement section, it's really impressive in how they have integrated the online channels with the physical brick and mortar. When you look at what Wal-Mart has done with taking advantage of their physical stores and announcing really pricing power that if you shift online order to the store, you actually get a further discount which is the first move I think in terms of our physical brick and mortars taking advantage of their network of stores.","So, again, it's obviously, there is a lot of headlines out there regarding certain categories. And beauty is another, just perfect example of -- just look what [Alta] [ph] and Sephora are doing, and then you layer in fitness and some of the health and wellness and medical categories. It's clear that we are shifting more towards service, restaurants, food, things that are driving traffic to the shopping center and that\u2019s where we are positioned to really take advantage of it.","Daniel Santos","That\u2019s as a sort of follow up to that. Over the last few years we have seen a lot of retailers invest in their Internet presence. Have you seen those dollars come back to the physical stores or are they still mainly focusing on the Internet?","Conor Flynn","There is still a balance right now where retailers are trying to figure out the right balance of where to invest their dollars. All the retailers acknowledge that their physical store base is where they are most profitable but they realize they need to have that offering to remove any pain points in the shopping experienced. And so when you look at Home Depot and when you look at Lowe's, they have been investing heavily yet also investing in the physical store. So there is a balance I think that a few of our retailers have found. And I think they are going to be setting the model going forward to how to really integrate and how to be able to take advantage of both channels.","Operator","Our next question comes from Collin Mings of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","First question. Glenn, can you just update us on how you are thinking about the preferreds that are callable this year?","Glenn Cohen","Sure. So we have three preferreds. One is at 6% for $400 million, one is at 5.5% for $225 million, and one is a $175 million at 5.58%. If you look at where the preferred market is today for us, we are probably, if we went to it, it's probably around 5.5%. So there is really not a whole lot of GAAP or upside in redeeming one preferred for the other. More importantly what we are focused on is, we have all this optionality and at the right time where the capital is available, we will use it to redeem those preferreds and that will help to reduce overall debt levels including preferreds over time. Which is really part of the 2020 vision, which we think will help lead towards -- being put on positive outlook and an upgrade at some point by the time we get to 2020.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then just switching gears. As far as, one of your peers earlier this week discussed opportunities rally to de-box some properties to free up some more small shop space. Just curious, as you think about your redevelopment pipeline, Conor, just how do you see opportunities there and how you are kind of positioning your redevelopment pipeline and do you kind of agree with that mindset that there could be some more opportunities to debox some properties.","Conor Flynn","It's all very, very location specific. Clearly, if there isn't a demand for a box in a certain location, you've got to look at alternatives. What we found is that we have plenty of activity in our redevelopment pipeline to show that whether it's off price, grocery, fitness, to take advantage of the space that we are creating in addition to what's existing on the property. So it's all location specific and again it's really what the highest and best return is on that location. We don\u2019t have many de-boxing activities going on today. It's something we look at constantly. But, again, when we look at our portfolio, we think that our redevelopments are well-positioned to take advantage of really the sweet spot of retail today.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Richard Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ronald Kamdem","This is Ronald Kamdem on Richard Hill's line. Was just curious, just looking for a high level commentary on cap rates on assets. Obviously you guys have a disposition guidance this year and looking for a 7% blended cap rate. Just if you can provide any color of what you are seeing specifically in secondary and tertiary markets. What's the trajectory for cap rates? Thanks.","Ross Cooper","Sure. Happy to answer that. As we look at the cap rates particularly in those markets, they have been relatively stable. I think we have mentioned over the last few quarters that they were shifting a little bit higher. We have not seen any material change at the beginning part of this year. There is still plenty of demand from private buyers and institutions that are looking to take advantage of a bit of an arbitrage opportunity. So as we mentioned, I mean in the first quarter we hit around mid-7s on our cap rates. We have several deals in the pipeline that we expect to close in the second and third quarters that are in some cases 6 and below. So there is no doubt that there is interest level even outside of the core markets. Now when you do look at the core markets, those have been extremely aggressively priced and a few examples, whether it be power or grocery, we have seen in Dallas and Chicago, power centers in the low 5 cap range. We have seen grocery in Maryland and Irving, Texas, in the 4s and 5s. Lifestyle kind of power center in Philadelphia just transacted at a flat 4 cap. So there is extreme demand and limited supply for high quality real estate and we are seeing plenty of activity on the secondary and tertiary markets as well.","Ronald Kamdem","Great. And the second one that's really quick from me is just updated thoughts on just Albertsons and what your outlook is there. Thanks.","Ray Edwards","Hi, this is Ray. With respect to Albertsons, really it's been no change. We are still focused the company on executing the IPO at the right time. Fortunately, we have very strong business at about $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion of EBITDA and about $0.5 billion of free cash flow last year. So we are very comfortable with the business. It's running very well and it's getting past the headwinds of deflation. And so we are optimistic that in the near-term we will likely be on way to monetize the investment.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Nikita Bely from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Nikita Bely","Can you talk a little bit about the pace of development in lease-up and given the environment, has it slowed at all in last couple of months in last quarter or so.","Ross Cooper","Happy to. We actually haven't seen any slowdown in our development projects. Now each of our development projects has a special case of why we think it's appropriate to take on the development process and the strength of the underlying real estate I think is why there hasn\u2019t been a slowdown. And when you look at the supply coming online, it's very very muted. I mean we are at 38 year lows in terms of new supply coming online. And so when retailers are looking to grow store count, they are still sometimes challenged to find those opportunities, especially in markets where they are trying to penetrate. So we feel very good about the pipeline. The strength of the demand and the retailer base that we are working with to continue to pre-lease projects.","Nikita Bely","And maybe a little different question, different topic. What's your view on JVs in general? How do you look at them and in your view what are the advantages and disadvantages from their perspective of simplifying the company going forward.","Conor Flynn","Well, we did take on a massive simplification effort and have reduced our JVs dramatically from the previous high. We do think it's appropriate if a partner brings us a deal that we would not normally be able to take advantage of by ourselves then that situation, like a Lincoln Square is a perfect example of that, where we do believe a partner is valid and can add value to the property longer term. We also like to think that the Lincoln Square is a perfect example of partnership that enhances each other. We are not a multifamily expert, we acknowledge that. So we want to make sure that when we partner with someone, that\u2019s the partner that enhances the project going forward. So those are the ones that we think make total sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Schweitzer of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Greg Schweitzer","I just wanted to get an update on the health of the grocery environment. Perhaps anything anecdotal from conversations you have been having and also how you are thinking about risk from the groceries? Both from moving to the mall near one of your centers with threats from the likes of Amazon.","Conor Flynn","When we look at our grocery business, obviously we are invested in Albertsons and Ray gave a quick recap there of the business and we think that they have a good business model and continue to battle through deflation but see it coming to an end in the near term. So other than that, when we look at the new deals we did for the quarter, we did a deal with Sprouts Farmers Market. We continue to see specialty grocers whether it's Trader Joe's or others, that really enhance the traffic generation at projects. And then the traditional grocers still are finding ways to create value. There has been a lot of consolidation whether it's Kroger or Albertsons and we continue to think that going forward is a great way for us to add a traffic driver to our locations that don\u2019t have a grocery component. We are watching closely and working with [Ledo] [ph] that\u2019s coming in this year. They are going to be a competitor and I think that there will be a nice new addition to some of our locations that don\u2019t currently have a grocery component. But it's very competitive. We do see the strong, continuing to thrive publics, is another great example of one that continues to dominate. And depending on the location, we think our portfolio has a lot of opportunity to continue to add grocery components.","Operator","There are no further questions.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead.","David Bujnicki","Thanks, Carrie. Good morning and thank you for joining Kimco\u2019s third quarter 2016 earnings call. With me on the call this morning is Conor Flynn, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Ross Cooper, Chief Investment Officer; and Glenn Cohen, our CFO. In addition, other members of our executive team are also available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks, including Milton Cooper, Dave Jamieson and Ray Edwards.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call maybe deemed forward-looking and it is important to note that the company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company\u2019s SEC filings that address such factors.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco\u2019s operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are also available on our website.","With that, I will turn the call over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Good morning and thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to announce another strong quarter driven by our high quality operating portfolio and the tireless efforts of our team. This quarter we made the decision to remove any contribution to our NAREIT defined FFO from an Albertsons monetization for two major reasons. First and foremost, we believe we should not succumb to the pressures of short-term and pursue the sale of a portion of our Albertsons investment in an environment that would negatively impact creating long-term value for our shareholders. Currently, grocery stores are dealing with food deflation, while the IPO market remains challenging. Despite these headwinds, Albertsons continues to increase EBITDA providing free cash flow to pay down debt and invest in the business.","Second and sometimes forgotten are the significant real estate holdings of the company. Close to half of the chain\u2019s 2,300 stores are either owned or under long-term ground leases, with concentrations in desirable markets, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Washington, DC. In fact, the recently updated S-1 noted an estimated value of $12.1 billion for its real estate holdings. We believe that over a medium-term horizon, our investment in Albertsons will provide Kimco with significant capital to reinvest in our recurring business activities and create long-term shareholder value. As a reminder, we are just shy of 2 years into the merger of Albertsons and Safeway and the company continues to reap the benefits of scale through execution on the planned synergies. The S-1 remains current and we continue to monitor the markets with our partners. To be clear, we remain focused on our core business and we will continue to fund capital requirements with free cash flow after dividends, opportunistic use of our ATM and disposition proceeds.","Our 2020 Vision outlines our plan to create long-term shareholder value by focusing on our building blocks of growth, reducing leverage and maintaining our cost efficient capital structure. The fundamentals of our open-air shopping center portfolio remained strong due to the favorable balance of supply and demand in the major metro markets. As the performance on key metrics demonstrates, our operating platform continues to deliver value to our shareholders. A wide range of open-air retailers, including our first Nike store, continue to expand and seek growth opportunities in high-quality real estate.","Supply has modestly increased recently due to bankruptcies and announced store closings and we are monitoring closely the shadow supply coming from struggling department stores at enclosed malls. Overall, however, this environment provides the ability for us to position our real estate with best-in-class retailers that drive more traffic and sales. While the Sports Authority liquidation drove the dip in anchor occupancy, we are pleased with the leasing momentum on those boxes. 7 of our 25 Sports Authority boxes are now fully committed. The deals include Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods; a Land Rover Jaguar dealership; Orchid Supply Hardware; Home Goods Ulta combo, Burlington and H Mart Grocery.","Anchor leasing volume was the strongest this quarter year-to-date, with 19 anchor deals fully executed. Small shop leasing continues to progress. Even though pro rata occupancy remained flat this quarter, this was primarily due to the dispositions of a number of fully occupied centers that had limited upside remaining and the purchase of assets, with significant redevelopment potential that included considerable small shop vacancy, which we believe offers future upsides. The strategic redevelopment and development pipeline, which we are calling our Signature Series, continues to mature and deliver results.","As an update, we moved the first phase of our flagship suburban square redevelopment to the active pipeline, where we have an executed lease to expand Trader Joe\u2019s and construction underway to build a new parking facility to provide Kimco with further densification opportunities. Separately, our Whole Foods development is now open and thriving in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania and has moved out of our development pipeline and into the operating portfolio. Our Signature Series continues to provide the company with significant internal growth opportunities and we remain laser-focused on the execution. This quarter, we delivered $65 million of redevelopment projects, producing an incremental ROI of 10%.","I will now turn the call over to Ross who will provide a deeper dive into the transaction activity this quarter.","Ross Cooper","Thank you, Conor. The third quarter was a successful continuation of our strategy and transformation of the portfolio composition resulting in a higher quality asset base, with stronger demographics and tenancy. This includes our Kentlands marketplace acquisition in Metro DC, which offers significant value creation and redevelopment opportunities for our team. In just two short months of ownership, our plans to reposition the assets are underway and the preliminary leasing interest has been very strong. We expect to begin seeking municipal input regarding our plans in the coming month.","Also, during the third quarter, we bought out a JV partner on a four-property portfolio, with assets located in our core markets of Atlanta, Houston, Washington, D.C. and Pittsburgh and acquiring additional JV asset, Gateway Center in Seattle, where we are working on a supermarket and pharmacy lease to reposition this well located asset. These acquisitions, along with the Canadian asset sales, helped further reduce our JV portfolio as we continue to simplify our ownership position while increasing the percentage of wholly owned net operating income coming from the overall portfolio. The wholly owned NOI is now 85% compared to being at a low of 60% level a few years earlier. In Q3 2015, we had 264 JV properties and at Q3 2016, we have only 135 JV properties, nearly a 50% reduction in 1 year.","The acquisitions market continues to be extremely competitive for core assets as investors of all types chase hard assets in the United States. Pension fund advisers, REITs and private operators have all narrowed the definition of core, which has further limited the available supply of institutional quality assets. This has created bidding wars for the highest quality assets in major MSAs pushing down cap rates even further, notwithstanding the potential risk of interest rate hikes in the future. While some may view the current real estate environment as expensive, on a relative basis, we continue to believe that compared to alternative investment options, our asset class remains a wonderful investment, with a healthy spread between cap rates and treasuries. Our focus remains on making investments in solid real estate with a strong business plan.","We also consider the dynamic that new shopping center development remains at all-time lows together with the living and shopping tenants of millennials to recognize that the first ring outside the urban core has become extremely desirable for investment, redevelopment and repurposing. This has created mixed use opportunities offering a live work play environment, which we believe offer attractive investment opportunities. We are constantly evaluating these types of projects while remaining disciplined in our search for quality assets.","On the disposition side, the sale of our interest in 5 Canadian assets has reduced our ownership in Canada to 1 remaining shopping center and 2 land parcels. In just 12 months, the NOI coming from Canada has gotten from approximately $19 million in the third quarter of 2015 to roughly $1 million in the third quarter of 2016. We are thrilled with our progress. In the United States, we sold 7 assets for $53.3 million, $49 million Kimco share. Execution on sales of non-core assets has become more challenging and it is critical to perform due diligence to the buyer pool before selecting the buyer. In addition, we have seen the pricing between the core trophy and the secondary market assets, particularly non-grocery, widen from 9 months to 12 months ago. Fortunately, we are at the tail end of the heavy lifting and expect to close approximately $100 million of asset sales in the fourth quarter. We will continue to review the portfolio and judiciously sell assets that do not fit within our long-term 2020 vision.","Now I would like to introduce Glenn to provide additional color and insight on our financial performance for the quarter.","Glenn Cohen","Thanks Ross and good morning. Our execution during the third quarter takes another step forward towards achieving our 2020 vision. Our operating results were solid despite the short-term headwinds of the Sports Authority store close. We also successfully completed three strategic initiatives related to our Canadian debt repayment, U.S. debt repayment and the merger of our TRS into the REIT. Headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.18 per diluted share for the third quarter. Included in the headline result is $45.7 million of early extinguishment of debt charges in connection with the prepayment of $350 million Canadian denominated bonds, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.77%. The prepayment of our 5.7% $291 million U.S. bond and the prepayment of $137 million of 6.32% mortgage debt encumbering 10 properties. Also included in the headline result is a non-cash FFO charge of $36.2 million associated with the deferred tax valuation allowance in connection with the TRS REIT merger. The one-time charges associated with the prepayments in the TRS REIT merger totaled $0.20 per share. These initiatives will enhance our future profitability and our tax efficiencies.","FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expenses and non-operating impairments, was $0.38 per diluted share for the third quarter, up 5.6% from $0.36 per diluted share last year. These solid results include the diluted impact of further transforming and simplifying the business over the past year with the sale of over $1 billion of U.S. assets and another $1.1 billion of assets in Canada and Mexico. The proceeds raised from these efforts were used to acquire $800 million of high quality, wholly owned U.S. assets in our key markets from our joint venture partners and third-parties. The net effect of this activity reduced net operating income, including our pro rata share from the joint ventures, by $23.5 million. This was largely offset by a reduction in financing costs of $18.2 million related to lower debt levels of $1 billion, lower interest rates on debt refinancings and the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% preferred stock last year. Recurring tax savings from the TRS REIT merger were an additional contributor.","Turning to our operating metrics, U.S. occupancy stands at 95.1%, down 90 basis points from last quarter and 50 basis points from a year ago. The Sports Authority\u2019s store closures account for 85 days as points of the decrease from last quarter. Positive net absorption of 35 basis points from a year ago mitigated the TSA impact. As Conor mentioned, our operating team is making great strides in releasing these boxes, with quality tenants that will drive increased traffic to the centers. Occupancy of our boxes over 10,000 square feet remain a healthy 97% than our small shop occupancy is 89.2% of 120 basis points from the year ago. Leasing spreads continue to be strong, with new leasing spreads up 26.6% and renewal on option spreads up 7.8%, for combined spreads of 12.9%. U.S. same-site NOI growth was 3.3% for the quarter, notwithstanding a 110 basis point negative impact from the Sports Authority bankruptcy. Redevelopments contributed 60 basis points this quarter. For the nine months, U.S. same-site NOI growth stands at 2.9%, including a negative 60 basis point impact from TSA. We have narrowed our U.S. same-site NOI guidance for the full year to a range of 2.7% to 3.3% from the previous range of 2.5% to 3.5%.","We remain focused on further strengthening our balance sheet metrics and debt maturity profile. Consolidated net debt to EBITDA, as adjusted is 5.8x, with a target of 5x to 5.5x. On a look through basis, including pro rata joint venture debt and perpetual preferred stock, the look through metric was 7.1x, with a goal of 6.4x to 6.9x. During the quarter, we issued a new $500 million 10-year unsecured bond at a coupon of 2.8%, the second lowest 10-year coupon ever issued by a REIT. Over the last year, we have extended our consolidated weighted average debt maturity profile to 6.7 years from 4.3 years just a year ago.","We opportunistically utilize our ATM program to issue 4.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted average sale price of $30.59 per share, raising $146.7 million of proceeds. The proceeds we used for accretive and value creating acquisitions of the four property joint venture buyouts and the Kentlands project that Ross mentioned in his remarks. Year-to-date, we have issued 9.8 million shares of common stock, raising net proceeds of $285 million.","Let me spend a moment on guidance. Based on the solid results during the first nine months, achieving $1.12 per diluted share for FFO as adjusted, we are narrowing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.49 to $1.51 from the previous per share guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52. For the nine months, we achieved NAREIT defined FFO of $0.94 per diluted share. We previously stated that our 2016 NAREIT defined FFO guidance included a partial Albertsons monetization in the fourth quarter. As Conor mentioned, we are not anticipating a monetization of our Albertsons investment this year. As such, we revised our NAREIT defined FFO guidance to a range of $1.30 to $1.32 at a midpoint of $1.31 from the previous range of $1.34 to $1.42, with a midpoint of $1.38. The reduction is solely attributable to not monetizing a portion of our Albertsons investment this year. We remain confident that we will be able to do so in accordance with our 2020 Vision.","We are currently deeply into our property by property budget process and we will provide 2017 guidance on our next earnings call. Our initial 2017 NAREIT defined guidance range will not include any transactional encumbered expense. As such, our NAREIT defined FFO per share range and our FFO as adjusted per share range will be comparable at the start of the year and will only differ upon the execution of specifically identified transactional events. We remain focused on growing our recurring earnings and cash flows. Lastly, we are pleased to announce that based on our 2016 performance and expectations for 2017, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the common stock quarterly cash dividend to $0.27 per share from $0.255, an increase of 5.9% on an annualized basis. Our FFO as adjusted payout ratio remains conservative among the lowest in the peer group.","And with that we would be happy to answer your questions.","David Bujnicki","We are ready to move to the Q&A portion of the call. Due to the large volume of participants in the queue, we request a one question limit with an appropriate follow-up. This will provide all callers an opportunity to speak with management. If you have additional questions you are more than welcome to rejoin the queue. Carrie, you may take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Hi, good morning everyone. Conor, as you think about the profitability that we are nearing the end of the cycle, there is increasing evidence of softness in retailing and you talked about, in your opening remarks about greater supplies fees, you have a lot teed up in terms of larger scale redevelopment ramification over the next several years, how might your capital allocation priority shift with the potential for a slowdown in demand from rentals?","Conor Flynn","It\u2019s a good question. I think when you look at our pipeline of opportunities over the next 5 years, a lot of the projects that we have identified have enormous amount of pre-leasing involved in those projects. And when we always look at the projects, we also look at offering, so to give us the opportunity to hit the pause button if and when our cost of capital changes or if the market changes on us. But we feel really confident in the projects we have identified. We are also making big strides on announcing pre-leasing on all those projects. So I think when you look at the risk reward, we still feel really strong about what they will deliver to our shareholders over the next 5 years. That said, going forward, we are going to be very careful on what we add to the pipeline. We want to be sure that it\u2019s something that checks all the boxes with our strategy and where we want to take the company and the portfolio. And we also want to be very careful in terms of how much more we add to the pipeline. You will probably see maybe another development deal or two, but maybe probably not much more than that over the 5 years. But you will see us ramp up redevelopment where we see the opportunity, because we continue to believe that, that\u2019s the best use of our capital risk adjusted and continue to think that there is more to come when you look at our shadow supply.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then just a follow-up for Glenn or Dave Davison, can you talk about same-store operating expenses by operating and expense, maintenance volume has shown some pretty consistent declines this year. What are the main drivers of that? How should we be thinking about the impact of margin changes on same-store NOI growth going forward?","Glenn Cohen","Again, we spent a lot of time trying to be the low cost provider. We spent a lot of time watching the maintenance things that have to happen at the projects. So, we try to keep costs down as best we can as we go along and you see that over and over again. I think the other thing you have is, some of it\u2019s also a little bit of timing just based on wet weathers and things like that, whether it be from the step side, where snow is hitting, which obviously hasn\u2019t hit yet the amount of parking lot projects that we have in any given point in time. But the main focus really is maintaining and keeping costs low and efficient at the properties.","Conor Flynn","I would just add that it might be the early signs of our clustering strategy starting to take effect, because we are a bit more efficient now that we look at our portfolio today versus 5 years ago and how tightly concentrated it is. It allows us to manage more with less.","Christy McElroy","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Thank you. Could you just help me understand the separation schedule a little bit? I mean, there is a big difference like with most REITs between the leases that are set to expire with options and without. Generally speaking, what is a good metric for that for how much you are going to actually roll and maybe you can comment on the lease credit expectations?","Conor Flynn","I am sorry, Ki Bin, we didn\u2019t understand your question. Are you asking about lease expiration schedules?","Ki Bin Kim","Yes. So, your 2017 lease expiration schedule, there is usually a very wide gap between what\u2019s set to expire with options or without options or if options were executed versus not being executed. So, I was wondering, what is a good [indiscernible], basically, what is a good amount that you actually \u2013 the actual amount that you actually roll? And if you maybe provide some commentary on some of the mark-to-market opportunity that you look into 2017?","Glenn Cohen","Right. Well, so I will start, I am sure Conor will add in. Roughly, 75% of the tenants exercise their options. So, that you see this wide gap, which is why the amount of liquidity in the leases that happens in any given year is relatively modest. In terms of upside in the below market rents, we know that over the next 3 years, we have close to 90 leases, 90 anchor leases alone where we think the upside in those leases is roughly 50% in total. So, we see a fair amount of upside as we look out the next few years.","Conor Flynn","Yes. And its part of our strategy and it has been for a long period of time to focus on huge mark-to-market opportunities and to acquire assets that have below market leases. So, when you look at those anchor maturity schedule, the ones that are below market are typically going to exercise that option unless there comes a time where they give space back to us. And we are starting to see some opportunities there come to fruition. So, when you look at our mark-to-market opportunities, what we try and do is we show you the ones where we have control over, where there is no more options left, where we think that those spreads are very much achievable and continue to try and harvest that for the portfolio.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And so if you had to latter it out, is it more coming in earlier \u2013 in the next 3 years or later in the next 3 years, just to get a better sense of that timing?","Conor Flynn","I think it\u2019s relatively equal over the last 3 years.","Glenn Cohen","Yes, it\u2019s pretty equal what\u2019s going to come year after year.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Morgan of Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Paul Morgan","Hi, good morning. You talked about a couple of different places, cap rates and narrowing definition among institutional investors in kind of what is core, what\u2019s not and how it\u2019s little bit harder to sell non-core assets. I mean, could you maybe dive in a little bit more, is there a way to kind of quantify maybe how much that spread has widened in the past 6, 9 months? And then in what ways is the definition getting there? Are we talking about secondary markets or just sort of demographics within metros or the tenancy of a center, any detail?","Conor Flynn","Sure. When we look sort of in our experience in the market today that the fully occupied stabilized assets are the ones where we are really seeing the shallower buyer pool, particularly without a grocery anchor. The grocery anchored shopping center still see a bit of a deeper bench of bidders. But by way of example, our Q3 dispositions average in the mid-7s on a cap rate range. Overall, for the year, blended, we are closer to a 7. So, that puts in a little bit into context. But that being said we are fortunate that we are in the very latter stages of our disposition process, so not every property that we put into the market is transacted. If we don\u2019t like the pricing, then we haven\u2019t sold it, but we have been pretty successful so far this year and we think that we will be for the rest of the year. In regards to the second part of the question, yes, I think that all buyer types, whether institutional or private are chasing upside value add in some form or fashion. So, it really is regardless of the location the flatter income streams without any foreseeable growth have been challenging to move. But certainly, I think the definitions of core from a market perspective continue to narrow to the major markets and it\u2019s the secondary and the tertiary markets where the institutional investors are just really not focused at all regardless of the quality of the asset within that market.","Paul Morgan","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up on Albertsons, you talked early in the year about exploring maybe a pre-IPO options for monetization. And I heard you say that, that\u2019s not going to be in your kind of initial outlook for \u201817 at least in terms of the guidance. Is that still on the table I mean or are you just kind of looking at maybe a longer term sort of situation there? You commented on the real estate value of $12 billion. Is kind of that one mechanism maybe for you to just kind of start to take some of the capital off the table?","Conor Flynn","Well, I think obviously we are monitoring the investment very closely. Again, there is a lot of headwinds at the moment just relative to the supermarket industry between the food deflation that we have talked about. And quite candidly, the IPO market is still pretty challenging. Having said that, the business is performing very well. The synergies that have been forecasted are coming to fruition and the longer we go more of those synergies come and create more EBITDA for the company. So, it\u2019s really the group itself, us and our partners, are monitoring the market closely. You see that with keeping our S-1 current. So, we are watching very closely for the right opportunity to begin to monetize the investments. You can look at who our partners are and know that at some point, where it makes sense, we are going to look to monetize the investment. That is clearly the path for all of us. But we want to do it prudently and where it makes the most sense to create the most shareholder value for us and everybody else in the group. So, we have the ability to be very, very patient with it.","Paul Morgan","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to go back to Christy\u2019s question in some of your opening remarks about seeing an increase in supply and continuing to monitor shadow pipeline and potential increase on vacant department stores. So, I am wondering based on what you are seeing today, is it making you more receptive to just getting some deals done when you can versus holding or pushing or even waiting for some sort of ideal replacement tenant?","Glenn Cohen","It\u2019s balanced. Every side is looked at, at a location basis and what\u2019s going on in that market. You have to really look at the supply side. Clearly, we are looking at supply now with malls as part of that and want to identify the highest and best use for the asset and what\u2019s the best retailer we have to replace the vacancy with? We still see strong demand. I mean, if you look at our categories, we still see strong demand from off-price, home improvement, specialty and traditional groceries, sporting goods, arts and crafts, pet supply, health and wellness, beauty, fitness. I mean these are all categories that are alive and well and looking to grow store count. And you see that coming up in our pipeline. I mean this quarter we did more anchor deals than we have done all year. And we have a healthy pipeline looking forward. So even though there has been a bit more supply added to the system, it\u2019s very much a local business. You have to look at each and every site individually and make the best decision you can, merchandising mix wise as well as for the net asset value of the property. And right now, where we sit, we still feel that we are in the sweet spot of retail.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And for my second one, just one on the Sports Authority, you mentioned having 7 of the 25 fully committed, at this point if we go back to last quarter, you had talked about hoping to have everything re-leased in 6 months to 12 months, so I m wondering, is that still the timeframe you are thinking about. And then from a rent commencement standpoint, when should we realistically be thinking about that rent coming back in your earnings?","Conor Flynn","I think that\u2019s still like our goal for the team to execute on. Clearly, we have got some work to do there, but we feel good about the momentum we have displayed this quarter and hope to continue to display each and every quarter. I think the rent commencement will coincide, depending on the box and what we have to do with it. Some of the boxes will be redevelopments, where we have to expand the box. And some of them we will be splitting like we did for Home Goods and Ulta. So those are a bit more complicated deals. And the RCDs may lag versus say, just a pure backfill. But those are ones where we believe we are adding the best-in-class retailers that help the site valuation wise as well as traffic and sales wise. So you will see us constant laddered approach to the RCDs.","Glenn Cohen","In terms of modeling, I would say the second half of \u201817, towards the back half of \u201817 is when the cash will start flowing. So if you think about the way we calculate same-site NOI growth, it will be more towards the back end of \u201817 where it will begin flowing.","Jeremy Metz","Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Jake Harlington of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jake Harlington","Hi guys. So maybe just kind of staying on the path, just given the amount of boxes that have been going off-line over the last few years from bankruptcies, is there anything different you are doing internally may be versus a couple of years ago to become more efficient turning them around, I know it\u2019s a normal part of the business, but do you need to or have you shifted or added resources to this effort to maybe mitigate some of the downtime?","Conor Flynn","It\u2019s always been part of our business. We think we are one of the best-in-class when it comes to leasing. I mean we talk about it every day-in and day-out and talk about how we can be more efficient and what we can do to drive more leasing because that\u2019s the fuel. That\u2019s what makes the business run. So we are looking at everything. I think when we try and be creative. We throw everything up the wall. And we like to come up with ideas and incentives that make us unique and make people want to do deals with Kimco, first and foremost. So we will always take that approach. And always try and make sure we are doing everything we can in our power to get the leases executed as quickly as possible, whether it\u2019s condensing the deal flow in terms of how long it takes from start to finish. And then also getting that rent commencement occurring quickly and making sure each client can test that timeframe. So we are looking at everything we can. So it\u2019s not a silver bullet type thing, every deal is different.","Glenn Cohen","Yes. I would just add also, you have to understand, we have our entire platform of operating people looking at every lease that we have, we have a watch list. So we are always analyzing and looking for who the potential might be that might go out and talking to tenants well in advance. So that when it does happen, we are not starting at ground zero. We have already had a lot of conversations because again, at the end of the day for us, the key is to get the rent flowing as quickly as we can. So we really are focused on the watch list tenants and where we can put someone back in places if someone was to go out.","Jake Harlington","Okay. And maybe as a quick follow-up to that, as you work through your budgeting process for \u201817, how are you thinking about potential bankruptcies for next year, how does that watch list look, has it been growing or is it shrinking or about the same?","Conor Flynn","Well, it\u2019s about the same. I mean when we look at budgeting for next year, we always carry a pretty sizable amount for bankruptcies. And so we feel like we have a nice cushion when you look at our portfolio of spread of risks and our number one tenant is TJX, a relatively small percentage of our NOI. And then we look and see what we can do in terms of leasing. And right now, we feel like we still have momentum moving in our favor and obviously, we have a lot of execution that needs to get done. But when you look at our pipeline of people that are expanding, we feel good about the occupancy growth that we can provide and just need to execute on that.","Jake Harlington","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning out there. Just two questions, first Glenn, just going back to your earlier response in Albertsons, I think you guys did or we are trying to pursue sort of a private stake sale, so just sort of curious if how those conversations went, was it a matter of price or the fact that the stake would also have to be offered to the other partners in the consortium, in which case, just it didn\u2019t make sense, either the buyer didn\u2019t have enough capital or wasn\u2019t worth it, so if you could just provide a little bit more color on how the private market is for private investments, like Albertsons?","Ray Edwards","Hi. It\u2019s Ray. First off Kimco, by itself never tried to sell individually part of our investment in Albertsons solo. We decided and I think that\u2019s what Conor was referring to and we elected not to pursue modernization on our own at this point. We never even tried to do that. The company did have some conversations with people, but in the end, we think the prioritization, it wasn\u2019t just the monetary portion of it, it was the structure of the deal, whether we want to be a private company with additional partners or not, that\u2019s what we really would have been. And we have elected that wasn\u2019t the right way for the company to go. So that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t pursue with the private place.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that, I think you guys did outline at the Investor Day that the Albertsons is a source of capital and right now from a GAAP perspective, I think it\u2019s not contributing at all to Kimco, but if you could just provide some color one, on if you are not able to monetize next year, how it does impact capital plan. And two, does Kimco get any cash flow or anything that may not show up in the GAAP P&L, but at least sort of compensated Kimco for having this capital tied up in Albertsons?","Glenn Cohen","No. I mean again, as I have said in many conferences, the Albertsons investment is a cost method investment for us. The company prudently is using all its free cash flow to pay down debt. So it\u2019s improving the value of the entity, but we don\u2019t get any EBITDA from it, we don\u2019t get any cash currently and we don\u2019t get any NOI or FFO contribution from it. So the way we view the investment today is it is really upside when the monetization does happen. Yes, we did \u2013 we have it as part of our capital plan through our 5-year period for our 2020 vision. But it\u2019s relatively modest amounts in any given year. So we have plenty of other levers to work through if the monetization wouldn\u2019t happen during 2017. We are very comfortable with our capital plan and our liquidity position, certainly, to deal with our redevelopments or developments and things that we are doing, because the company generates between $125 million and $150 million of free cash flow after we pay our dividends.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. Thank you, Glenn.","Glenn Cohen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Conor, I guess I was just hoping you could provide some thoughts on how you are thinking about your capital allocation more broadly today, beyond your redevelopment and development pipeline how is the recent move in rates in your stock price and changing rates impacted your investment return requirements. And as part of that, I would also appreciate some thoughts specifically on potential stock repurchases given your stock here in the mid-20s versus what you guys let nearly $31?","Conor Flynn","Well, we always look at capital allocation as our priority. And when you look at the pipeline of what we have outlined, clearly the redevelopments are the most accretive in terms of returns to the company and the shareholders. So you can\u2019t really remove that from the analysis, because we think that\u2019s number one, two and three for us going forward. And we have - as we have said a number of different times, we have all the assets internally to work over. We don\u2019t actually have to go out, trying to acquire assets in a very competitive market to try and create that internal value. So clearly for us, that\u2019s a big differentiator and we still think we are in the early innings of unlocking that value from the portfolio. Our share price has moved to \u2013 with along with the interest rates environments. And we obviously can\u2019t control that. We did take advantage of the ATM when \u2013 last quarter when we thought that it was prudent and we used it accordingly and we will continue to monitor that. But for us, when we look in the open market, we want to be extremely selective. As company of our size, we feel like we need right now to be extremely selective on third-party acquisitions and you have seen us do that and continue to finish off our disposition. So, we have a 5-year plan that\u2019s outlined. We have all the building blocks internally to really unlock tremendous amount of value for our shareholders. And for us, it\u2019s all about execution and making sure we deliver home those results.","Glenn Cohen","Yes. I would just add in terms of the buyback question, again, putting capital into our business when we think we can get higher yields, as Conor mentioned, the redevelopments give us that. So at this point, I don\u2019t see that, that\u2019s something that really is on the table when necessary at this point. Again, you do that when that\u2019s the last thing you have to create investment. We still want to invest in our product and our properties.","Conor Flynn","That\u2019s right.","Haendel St. Juste","Appreciate that. And follow-up on the Sports Authority discussion, can you guys talk a bit about the rents you are getting, I guess, rent spreads versus prior rents and how much capital you are putting into some of these boxes to get them released?","Conor Flynn","Yes, the mark-to-market on the deals that have been executed is right around 5%, 5.5%. So, we think that, that should be the case going forward on our boxes there. The TI has been somewhere between $30 and $50 a foot in TI for the back fill of the normal box, it\u2019s right around $30 if you need to split it. Obviously, it takes a little bit more cash and capital to reposition it. So, that\u2019s where it comes in at the $50 per square foot range. So, we feel pretty good about the demand sources there and continue to think that we can show measured improvement along the way.","Haendel St. Juste","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rich Hill","Hey, guys. Good morning. So, just quick question going back to Albertsons and I am sorry to continue to focus on this. But just hypothetically speaking, you had mentioned you had a lot of levers to pull if you could not monetize Albertsons in 2017. Is there any sort of guidance as to what \u2013 which of those levers you might prefer in the event that a monetization didn\u2019t occur? Is it \u2013 could you give the guidance if it\u2019s more senior unsecured debt that seems to be a really attractive option for you right now given from a financing perspective? Is it an equity capital raise? What are you guys thinking there?","Glenn Cohen","Really, all the options are there whether it be an ATM if the stock price makes sense to us where it is, the unsecured debt markets, we continue to be very successful and have continued to lengthen an important piece that is lengthen our debt maturity profile. So, I am sure you will see us continue to be in the unsecured bond market. We have sales that were still not done. We will still have some more dispositions that will be part of next year that we will have talked about. But the bank community is another very much supportive of what we do. So, if we wanted to do a term loan within the bank market, obviously, we have our line. We have $1.750 billion line that has very little drawn on it. So, we have a lot of opportunities. I would tell you the one thing we are not looking to do is to put mortgage debt on our consolidated properties. But even there, if that was the only market open, we even have that ability with close to 400 unencumbered assets.","Rich Hill","Got it. Got it. I will stop my questions there. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Mueller of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Mike Mueller","Hey, JPMorgan. Can you talk a little bit about your decision to buyout the partner stake in the four properties? I think it was in September. Was it set on wind or did you just practically go after the properties and why?","Conor Flynn","Sure. I will comment on that. I mean, we are constantly evaluating our JV program. That particular portfolio was one that we have had discussions with our partner many times over the last few years. It was a window of opportunity that fortunately opened up for us and we seized upon it. In terms of the assets themselves, they are all located within our core markets. We obviously know them very well having owned, leased and managed them for well over a decade. So, we believe that there is still opportunity. They fit the program for us really well. In fact, we have already executed a 56,000 square foot lease at our property in Atlanta. So, we are already seeing the benefits of that ownership piece. So, it\u2019s \u2013 when you look at the JV program sort of in its totality, we continue to see it as an opportunity for us to acquire interest in very high quality assets that we already have a strong familiarity with. So, we will continue to seek opportunities from the JVs when the opportunity presents themselves.","Mike Mueller","Okay, that was it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris Lucas","Hey, good morning everyone. I guess, Conor, maybe if you could give us a sense as to what the balance is between sort of the landlord versus tenant negotiation situation stands right now? In other words, has \u2013 I think over the last year or so, it\u2019s felt like landlords have had continuously better positioning for negotiating with tenants. Is that shifting at all back or is it still sort of feels like the wins at your back?","Conor Flynn","It really comes down to the asset and the location of it, if you think about it. The high quality assets still demands premium and there is still a tremendous amount of retailers that have a flexible format to get into those high quality pieces of real estate. That\u2019s where we are seeing the strongest demand. That\u2019s where we want to be long-term. That\u2019s why we have identified our target markets and we have done a lot of heavy lifting to get to those assets and to get to those target markets. So, that\u2019s where we see the demand continue to be strong. And so we feel good about the supply and demand is still in balance there clearly. The added supply does change a little bit of the environment, but again, it all drills down to the location and how strong that asset is relative to the surrounding assets. And we feel good about our positioning.","Chris Lucas","Okay. And then if I can make \u2013 ask a follow-up just on the transaction market. You talked about the quality spreads between core and sort of non-core, but I was curious as to whether or not the portfolio of discount versus one-off transactions has widened or stayed the same over the last few months?","Glenn Cohen","We have not seen too many portfolio transactions executed in the marketplace. So, like Kimco, many of the investors out there are very focused on specific markets and asset types. We haven\u2019t seen too many portfolios that have similar high-quality locations. So, the portfolios that have been on the marketplace have not achieved any sort of premium. So, as we look at our disposition program, we continue to feel that the best way to execute for us is really on a one-off basis or some very small select portfolios. But I think that the portfolio discount is certainly there and it\u2019s hard to move large portfolios in non-core assets.","Chris Lucas","Great, thank you.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session.

Please go ahead.","David Bujnicki","Good morning, and thank you for joining Kimco's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Conor Flynn, Kimco's CEO; Ross Cooper, President and Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, our CFO; Dave Jamieson, our Chief Operating Officer; as well as other members of our executive team that are present and available to answer questions during the course of this call. ","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking, and it's important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors. ","During this presentation, management may make certain reference to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Investor Relations website. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As we begin the final year of our 2020 Vision strategy, our 2019 results are particularly satisfying. These results reflect both our commitment to our plans and our determination to stay the course. We finished 2019 with strong operating metrics, an improved balance sheet, a higher quality portfolio and a development and redevelopment pipeline that continues to produce long-term growth. ","I will begin today's remarks with an overview of our operating metrics, our view of the retail landscape and an update on our Signature Series development and redevelopment projects and a view into how we think about ESG and our efforts. Ross will follow with an update on transaction activity and observations on general market conditions. And Glenn will discuss our activity in the capital markets, balance sheet metrics and our 2020 guidance. ","The repositioning of our core portfolio within top 20 markets where we see a favorable supply and demand dynamic continues to pay dividends. The team produced strong metrics across the board, with $1.44 NAREIT FFO per share and $1.47 FFO per share as adjusted for the year, a great result. We achieved 3% same-site NOI growth for the year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range for the year. Our occupancy remains at an all-time high, finishing the year at 96.4%. Anchor occupancy hit a new high at 98.9%, while small shop occupancy finished slightly down at 89.3% due to recent closings of Dress Barn Avenue and Charming Charlies. ","Activity on our small shop vacancy remains strong, and we view this as a source of FFO growth for 2020. The spread of physical economic occupancy sits at 240 basis points, which is primarily the result of anchor boxes yet to open. Typically, once the anchor becomes activated, the small shops usually follow, driving higher rents and strong annual increases. Our spreads for the quarter were healthy, with new leasing spreads at 12.5% and renewals and options at 4%. The increase in spreads for new leases represents the 24th consecutive quarter in which spreads increased over 10%. Our positive spreads for the year of 20.8% for new deals and 5.4% for renewals and options highlights the mark-to-market opportunities embedded in our portfolio. ","Our intensive asset management platform and investment in technology has enabled us to be more proactive in monitoring and quickly addressing existing and potential vacancies, reducing downtime and driving faster rent commencement fees. While our portfolio continues to perform in this era of retail Darwinism, we recognize the challenges confronting our sector and some of our legacy retailers. We see our customer continue to gravitate towards convenience, service, experience and value. Not all retailers will successfully make the pivot necessary to service the demands of today's consumer. Bankruptcies, store optimization plans, downsizing, store saturation, automated distribution facilities and e-commerce penetration are all risks we must acknowledge and face head on. ","Our 2020 Vision strategic plan was designed with these challenges in mind. Our tightly clustered portfolio in the top markets, where we have efficiencies of scale and significant barriers to entry, our mixed-use platform, our tremendous access to capital and our world-class team put us in a great position to embrace the inevitable change and create significant long-term shareholder value. ","Our Signature Series pipeline continues to produce large quality flagship assets with stronger NOI and higher growth. We believe we have elevated the Kimco brand with customers and in the communities we serve. Our focus on long-term value creation, together with our commitment to sustainability, has helped establish trust with local governments and community groups in -- which in turn, helps us with our master planning and entitlement [indiscernible] ","We now have entitlements for over 4,500 apartment units, over 800 hotel keys, over 1.2 million square feet of office space, and we are only just getting started. We believe our investment in developing a mixed-use team second to none has created a platform premium that will allow us to develop an optimal plan for every asset in our portfolio and to acquire assets with untapped redevelopment potential. Retail will always be the driving force of Kimco, but recognizing the untapped potential of our asset base is a critical and defining aspect of our strategy going forward. ","At the end of 2019, we placed Mill Station into service, and out of the gate, our anchors were exceeding pro forma sales. Dania Pointe is making enormous strides where we recently cut the ribbon for the groundbreaking of Spirit Airlines' new headquarters. Spirit will be investing over $250 million and bringing over 1,000 employees to the site where they will enjoy the campus feel of our amenities and retail offerings. ","The Boulevard is also moving closer to activation as our first tenants plan to open later this year. We will also be activating the second residential tower at our Pentagon City national landing asset later in 2020 as we look to benefit from the Amazon HQ effect in the area. The residential leasing records we set at Witmer, our first residential tower at Pentagon, highlights this one-of-a-kind asset. And with entitlements for nearly 2 million of additional square feet, Pentagon will continue to create value for years to come. ","In closing, our 2020 Vision strategy was primarily focused on our portfolio quality and balance sheet strength. As we continue to move forward in 2020 and beyond, the challenges we face are not limited to the changing nature of retail and real estate. To be the best, we need to continue to listen to all of our stakeholders and the issues that concern them. We need to be vigilant and responsive to issues impacting corporate governance practices, Board diversity and refreshment, Director skill sets, shareholder engagement and sustainability. ","While we have already made large strides in all of these areas, we can do more. Of particular note, our recent NAREIT award as Leader in the Light, given to the ESG leader in all of retail real estate is something we are proud of and don't take for granted. It shines a light on all of our efforts in making Kimco such a special place. Ross?","Ross Cooper","Thank you, Conor, and good morning. Our 2019 transaction activity, which we reported earlier this month, reflects another excellent year of execution and the redeployment of capital into our future growth opportunities. To recap, for the full year, we sold 32 properties for a gross value of $542 million with $375 million as Kimco's respective share. Factoring in the acquisition of the 3 grocery stores through a sale-leaseback transaction in January of 2019, our net shopping center dispositions were $341 million. Of note, a significant portion of the sales activity occurred in the fourth quarter as we accelerated several asset sales that were originally slated for a 2020 closing. We had a total of 12 properties on the market for sale in the second half of the year, and we closed 100% of them. Our transaction success reflects both our dedicated team and the quality of our upgraded portfolio. ","As a result of the dispositions completed in 2019, we now own a portfolio of 409 shopping centers, tightly concentrated in our top 20 markets with substantial growth potential and densification opportunities that will continue to strengthen our asset base for years to come. ","Now to our outlook for 2020. We intend to continue selling at a modest level, pruning between $200 million to $300 million of operating properties at Kimco's share. We anticipate cap rates to blend in the 7% to 7.5% range. Proceeds from the sales will help fund our Signature Series redevelopment program and potential acquisition opportunities within our targeted markets. As for the latter, we intend to go back on offense in 2020 and selectively add properties that fit our strategy. We plan to acquire between $100 million to $200 million of assets with cap rates in the 5% to 6% range. ","We have demonstrated our disciplined approach over the past several years with no new shopping center acquisitions since the summer of 2017. With our reshaped portfolio and improved cost of capital, we believe it is the appropriate time for us to selectively acquire high-quality properties, which offer future value creation potential when the opportunity presents itself. While these are hard to find, we have already identified 1 particularly exciting asset that we're currently evaluating and hope to share additional details with you in the second quarter. ","As for market activity generally, cap rates continue to be aggressive for institutional quality assets in our core markets. We saw transactions in California, Texas, Florida and Pennsylvania in the high 4s and low 5s in the fourth quarter. And with interest rates remaining at their current low levels, there is no shortage of investor capital, both debt and equity, interested in pursuing our product type. We look forward to building additional long-term value as we move through 2020. And now to Glenn for the financial results.","Glenn Cohen","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. We finished 2019 with strong fourth quarter operating results. We maintained our occupancy level at an all-time high, delivered another quarter of double-digit new leasing spreads and generated positive same-site NOI growth. In addition, we further fortified our balance sheet with the issuance of common equity utilizing our ATM program. ","As a reminder, in connection with the NAREIT FFO definition clarification, we no longer include gains and losses from land sales, marketable securities and preferred equity investments in NAREIT FFO. We are presenting prior periods to conform with this election. These transactional items were already excluded from FFO as adjusted and therefore have no impact on that calculation. Also, as previously communicated, beginning this year, we will only be reporting on NAREIT FFO, and in the event we have a unique transactional gain or charge, we will be sure to point it out. ","Now for some additional color on our fourth quarter results. NAREIT FFO was $151.9 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2019 as compared to $149.6 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the fourth quarter 2018. Net transactional charges for the fourth quarter 2019 totaled $3.4 million or $0.01 per diluted share, comprised of $7.2 million of preferred stock redemption charges, offset by $3.8 million of transactional income from Puerto Rico insurance claims and forgiveness of debt. NAREIT FFO for the fourth quarter 2018 included $2.2 million of net transactional income. ","FFO as adjusted, which excludes transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments, was $0.37 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to $0.35 per diluted share for the same period last year. The primary drivers of the increase were higher NOI of $3.1 million, lower financing costs of $2.2 million and higher management fees [indiscernible] ","Full year 2019 NAREIT FFO was $1.44 per diluted share and includes $11.7 million or $0.03 per share of net transactional expense primarily from $18.5 million of preferred stock redemption charges. Full year 2019 FFO as adjusted came in at $620.1 million or $1.47 per diluted share, which hit the upper end of our guidance range. Full year 2018 FFO as adjusted was $613 million or $1.45 per diluted share. The primary drivers of the increase were lower financing costs of $13.2 million, lower income tax expense and higher management fee income. The full year increase was further impacted by lower NOI of about $9 million attributable to the full year impact of 2018 and 2019 dispositions and higher G&A expense resulting from the lease accounting change and the effect of no longer capitalizing indirect leasing costs. ","Our high-quality property portfolio continues to produce positive results. During the fourth quarter, we signed 263 leases totaling 1.4 million square feet at a weighted average ABR of $18.63 per square foot, further improving our pro rata portfolio ABR to $17.99 per square foot. Our year-end occupancy held steady at an all-time high, up 60 basis points from the beginning of the year. This increase was driven by positive net absorption and the positive impact from dispositions. [Indiscernible] spreads for new leases, options and renewals signed were positive 6% for the fourth quarter and positive 7.9% for the full year 2019. ","Same-site NOI growth was positive 2.7% for the fourth quarter 2019 and includes 10 basis points from redevelopments. Full year 2019 same-site NOI growth was positive 3% with no impact from redevelopment activity. The primary drivers of the same-site NOI growth were increases in minimum rents from continued lease-up, contractual rent bumps and rent commencement starts. Our same-site leased occupancy stands at 96.4%, and same-site economic occupancy is 94%, which bodes well for continued same-site NOI growth. ","Turning to the balance sheet. We were active again in the capital markets. We utilized our ATM program opportunistically to issue 9.5 million shares of common stock at a weighted average net price of $21.03 per share, raising over $200 million. We used the proceeds to redeem $225 million of 5.5% preferred stock. As a result, we reduced our look-through net debt-to-EBITDA by 0.3x to a level of 7.2x and reduced our fixed charges by $12.4 million annually. We remain focused on reducing look-through net debt-to-EBITDA further over time. ","Our liquidity position is excellent with over $2 billion of immediate liquidity available. Our debt maturities for 2020 are quite manageable with only $90 million of consolidated mortgage debt due and approximately $150 million due in our joint ventures. Our weighted average debt maturity profile is 10.6 years, continuing to be one of the longest in the REIT industry. ","We successfully executed on many fronts throughout 2019, meeting or exceeding our targets. I want to thank our associates for their commitment, dedication and effort which produced these results. We are enthusiastic about the future but know full well there is more to be done in this ever-changing retail landscape. ","Moving on to 2020 guidance and the underlying assumptions. Our initial NAREIT FFO guidance range for 2020 is $1.46 to $1.50 per diluted share. This per share guidance range assumes a growth rate range for same-site NOI of 1.5% to 2%, including redevelopments, and 100 basis points for credit loss; includes incremental NOI growth of $12 million to $14 million from development projects and lowered NOI by $21 million associated with the full year impact of 2019 net dispositions. Other assumptions include: reduced financing costs of $11 million to $17 million, primarily from the redemption of $575 million of preferred stock during 2019; flat to lower G&A in 2020 as compared to 2019; and the impact of the increased share count from the equity issuance in 2019. In addition, as Ross mentioned, our disposition target ranges from $200 million to $300 million, and our acquisition target is $100 million to $200 million. Lastly, our NAREIT FFO per share guidance range assumes no transactional income or expense and no additional common equity issued. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","David Bujnicki","[Operator Instructions]. We're happy to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. First question comes from Christine McElroy from Citi.","Christine McElroy","Just wanted to follow up on your initial sort of same-store NOI guidance, 1.5% to 2%. I think everyone's sort of trying to figure out, in the context of the deceleration from last year, how -- is that sort of an initial conservative range? Or is that realistic in the context of what you're expecting for fallout? There's what you know right now, in terms of fallout, versus what you may be anticipating as far as unknown buffer or a bad debt reserve. And I think we're just trying to get our arms around, is that an initial conservative range or is it disappointing based on what you are currently expecting. And I know that there's a lot of moving parts. There are some properties that are expected to join the pool this year that are potentially accretive to that growth rate. So just wanted to get some color around that.","Conor Flynn","Christy, yes, we're very much focused on that, and it's very early in the year as you know. We're focused on outperforming. We've got 11 months to do so. And if appropriate, we'll hopefully outperform and raise it throughout the year. But we do have 100 basis points reserved for credit loss. We think it's an appropriate range to start the year. It's a very fluid environment as you know. We've made some assumptions and believe that it's a good place to start and continue to believe that the transformed portfolio will continue to shine.","Christine McElroy","And then just on the comment around the properties adding to the same-store pool like Boulevard, how much is that expected to be accretive?","Glenn Cohen","So the Boulevard would add in a range of around $3 million to $5 million as part of it, so on $900 million, it's helpful but it's modest.","Conor Flynn","Redevelopments, Christy, should be about somewhere between 20 to 40 basis points within the same-site guidance range.","Christine McElroy","Okay. And that 1.5% to 2%, that's excluding redevelopment or that's including that impact?","Conor Flynn","It's included.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Schmidt, Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","I wonder how much of the 100 bps of reserve you had last year you needed to use in 2019.","Glenn Cohen","Craig, it's Glenn. So we used a total of 44 basis points for all of 2019. So we came in ahead. And again, as part of that, we were able to continue to increase same-site NOI guidance as we went through 2019.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And then how much and how active will you be in terms of rent restructuring? And how much of that is a drag on your -- the sequential decline in NOI '19 versus '20?","David Jamieson","Craig, this is Dave Jamieson. It's not really rent restructuring so -- just want to be clear on the question. I mean what we're always doing is proactively looking ahead, identifying opportunities to upgrade the quality of the tenancy, drive market rents through new deals, renewals and discussions with tenants that have options. So something that we do day in and day out. I definitely wouldn't classify it as restructuring of rents. ","But when we look ahead to the opportunities, obviously, small shop activity is very robust. In the back half of 2019, there were some known events on bankruptcies that drove that number down. About 130 basis points of that was contributed to the bankruptcy of the tenants that Conor already mentioned. We really identified that -- as that as an opportunity to fuel future growth through the end of '20 and into '21 as well. So we're very optimistic about the environment and where we have with our quality of our portfolio and with the new anchors coming online as well. When you start to see the lease, the physical occupancy start to compress throughout the balance of the year. That will continue to drive small shop growth.","Conor Flynn","Yes. Craig, the nice part is, is where we sit at 96.4% at an all-time high occupancy is we do need a little bit of churn in order to get those mark-to-market opportunities. So we're active on being -- preleasing and looking for opportunities to improve the tenant credit of our portfolio. So we think that there's a lot of opportunity this year to become really another driver of mark-to-market opportunities for us.","Craig Schmidt","I mean just given the record high occupancy, is that limiting your ability to push rents?","David Jamieson","No. Again, it's the -- on the spread side, it's always dependent on...","Craig Schmidt","No. I just mean the fact that you're not able to add new occupancy to same-property.","David Jamieson","No. I think, again, when you look at the anchor opportunities, there are renewals that are coming due that will continue to drive that mark-to-market. As you know, we have substantially below-market anchor portfolio that we've continued to realize the benefit of. ","In addition, on the small shop side, our small shops currently are over $29 a foot in rent. And when you look at 2020, the rollover schedule is at the lowest rate current in-place rent than the next five years. So when you look at the opportunity to push rents, there is still very much room to do so.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. I guess, I mean, you sound pretty positive when we get to the details but the macro guidance is so much less. I guess I'm not really able to reconcile that.","Conor Flynn","Craig, I think if you look back the past two years, you'll see we've been consistent. It's a fluid environment, as you know. We want to be realistic, understanding that it's very early in the year. We're focused on outperforming like we have been doing, and we have 11 months to do so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Your renewal spread of 4%, we've seen it hover around the 4% mark for three consecutive quarters. Is this a -- somewhat of a newer run rate that we should expect going forward?","David Jamieson","Yes. Again, it's all dependent on the population of any given quarter. Between the renewals and options over the last 2 quarters, there were several options that were flat on some of our large ground lease anchor boxes that maintained a lower blended spread. And in addition to that, as you know, with our anchor occupancy being as it is, the small shops are slightly closer to market. So this quarter in particular, almost 90% of our new deals were small shop deals, around -- under 5,000 square feet. So that sometimes is a closer mark-to-market equation, which can have an impact on your spread. But as I mentioned in my earlier comments, when you look forward, there's opportunities to continue to push the new lease spreads on a go-forward basis.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just going back to a prior question on rent restructuring or just rent cuts. Just if you can give us a sense of how often that is actually happening at Kimco. And following up to that, is there a -- just a larger concern that even tenants that don't need a rent cut start to look more increasingly at the landscape, whether they're a tenant with you or at a different owner? And sorry to ask for something similar because if you're a strong tenant, maybe the mindset starts to shift from what paying rent based on what I could pay to what I should pay.","David Jamieson","There's so many variables that go into any discussion. Everything is a negotiation. It's a case-by-case analysis, both on the tenant side and the landlord side. The value with Kimco is that high quality of our portfolio. Someone could look for a lesser quality property and maybe pay slightly less rent. But if you want to have the full benefit of our tenancy, our location, our real estate and the markets in which we operate, then that starts to weigh into the final decision that's made. So it's always a case-by-case, and that's something that we do on an ongoing basis.","Conor Flynn","We really haven't done any restructuring. If you look through the portfolio and look at our occupancy, we'd like to get some spaces back so we get the mark-to-market opportunity. So that's what's given us the ability to have confidence in the transformed portfolio because typically, as a tenant misses an option or wants to leave, we have the opportunity to backfill at a much higher rent. So that's what's driving our 20%-plus new store leasing spreads. When we get those spaces back, it's a nice position to be in because it all comes down to the competitive set when your shopping center is placed in the corridor, and we feel like we've got below-market rents in great locations and the right balance of supply and demand.","Operator","Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb, Piper Sandler.","Alexander Goldfarb","[Technical Difficulty] Christy's questioning. If we look at your last year's, sorry, NOI guidance, you said in response to Craig that you only used about 45 basis points and yet you exceeded the top end of your NOI by 50. This year, you're talking about 100 basis points, which again, seems pretty darn conservative. So just sort of curious, as you guys look to 2020, how much is already in your same-store that's: one, based on legacy, what closed in 2019; second, like Pier 1 or what you know is going to close this year; and then three, the sort of unknown factor, your budgeting of X percent? So is the 100 basis points sort of that X percent and therefore, Pier 1 and the legacy from last year are the deltas that we're all trying to solve for as to why the same-store looks so low relative to what you produced last year?","Conor Flynn","Alex, yes. So what we do is for all known closures, we take those out of our budget. So the sites where we know tenants are going to be vacating, we take them out of the budget. And then on top of that, we put in 100 basis points of credit reserve. And so we feel that gives us the cushion to understand that it's a very fluid environment. The last few years, obviously, we've been able to raise throughout the year. It's very early in the year. We're focused on outperforming. We've got 11 months to do so and we'll continue to -- if appropriate, we will raise throughout the year.","Alexander Goldfarb","So Conor, how much is already in there? Like is there already -- so the 100 of cushion, there's already an extra 100 from closure? I'm just trying to understand what the actual closure amount that's already in there in addition to what the 100 cushion is.","Glenn Cohen","It's Glenn. There's roughly 30 basis points that we're aware of. So we're starting with that as a kind of a beginning point. And then the balance is really for what's unknown. So again, we are trying to take the approach to deal with, again, an environment that is -- sometimes it's fluid and has its challenges. And we want to just set the stage for us to be able to go through the year and hopefully outperform.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then next is just an update...","Glenn Cohen","Just the other thing to just bear in mind, we actually have a very tough comp in the first quarter. The first quarter of last year was 3.7%. So just kind of bear that in mind as we go.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then just on -- Albertsons, obviously was in the newspaper, potential IPO. Just what you can share with us as far as potential for timing, if you -- if it will go, won't go, what the latest is.","Ross Cooper","Yes. I mean with regard to the rumor on the S-1, we really can't comment on that. For us, what we do understand and know is that for the last couple of years, the management, the Board and the investors have really been focused on giving the company the tools to really succeed, and that includes reducing debt through sale-leasebacks and cash by $3 billion over the last 2 years, improving the operation of the company, bringing in a new CEO, which really invigorated the management team there. And we've kind of -- as we've said on the call last couple of times, we're really working to set the company up to execute at the right time, the right value. ","Also to understand, for Kimco, we have about 35 locations with Albertsons across the banners. We want this to be a very successful company for the long term. So we're not going to rush into anything that doesn't make sense for the long term of that business as well.","Operator","Next question is from Samir Khanal, Evercore.","Samir Khanal","Can I ask -- I guess, Glenn, can I ask you to go over the sources and uses? I'm just trying to understand, you're funding the $225 million of redevelopments. I mean you have $100 million coming from dispositions. You'll have free cash flow. But I think you'll still feel -- you'll be a bit short of the $225 million of developments. Just maybe address the capital plans, what you're assuming for guidance maybe on the debt or even the equity side?","Glenn Cohen","So in terms of the capital plan to be able to fund the balance, we actually have some contracts in place on some of our preferred equity investments and some land parcels that will also help to fund that. So that's not part of Ross' guidance in terms of disposition, and that amount can be $50 million to $75 million. So that's 1 piece to the bridge. ","The other thing is again, we're going to watch the capital markets closely. It's not baked into our numbers to be using the equity markets, but again, similar to what we did in 2019, we will always look to be opportunistic. And then the balance comes from -- we have enormous liquidity between cash and our line of credit. And if need be, the bond market is quite favorable at the moment, too. So we have a lot of different options in a lot of different places to be able to create the funding mechanism.","Samir Khanal","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, my second question is on Dania Pointe. I know you've got the Forever 21 box there. You've got the Lucky's grocer. I guess an update on those two tenants. And then, I guess, is there some cotenancy risks that can impact the income coming through that development in the event that those stores close there?","Ross Cooper","Yes. It's a good question. So starting on the Forever 21 box, it's -- to step back, this is a lease we signed almost 3 years ago. And when you look at the evolution of the project, we couldn't be happier with the opportunity to backfill this location, with the recent signings of Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie to anchor the other 2 locations on Main Street, complemented by the Tommy Bahamas. What it's going to do is create us -- create a new opportunity for us to backfill. Initially, that lease was a -- somewhat of a loss leader that's bring over into the project, and now we're able to bring that closer to market. So that's an opportunity for us, and we already have strong activity. It's one of the best locations in the center itself. ","As it relates to Lucky's, it's a Kroger-backed ground lease. So again, this is another opportunity where we had a grocery component in there on the low ground rent. We're now able to bring that closer to market. And with Kroger currently, it's currently on the lease.","Conor Flynn","We have recaptured the Forever 21 space, and we're actively marketing it right now. The ground lease that's backed by a Kroger, we have yet to recapture.","Operator","Next question is from Greg McGinniss of Scotia.","Greg McGinniss","Conor, I was just hoping to dig into the expected growth a bit more. So guidance implies 1% of earnings growth, which is similar to 2019. But in 2020, we're not expecting a drag from the lease accounting change. There's fewer prior year dispositions, and seemingly, there's a greater contribution from development. So considering these items, can you just help us bridge the gap on why growth maybe appears a bit low versus what was achieved in 2019?","Conor Flynn","Yes. I mean I think to your point, look, it's very early in the year. We feel like we've got a transformed portfolio. The developments and redevelopments are starting to come online, but it's a very fluid environment. We recognize that retail is changing daily. And we feel like we have to position ourselves to be able to recognize that if we are able to outperform, we'll be able to hopefully appropriately raise throughout the year. We feel like the 2019 accomplishments shine a light on how far we've come. ","But that being said, we've got a lot of work to do. There's a lot of projects that need to come online. There's a lot of leasing that needs to get done. And there's still some retailers out there that we have our eyes on that may not be able to pivot and meet these -- the needs of the consumer. So we have to take that into consideration. And that's what's really sort of creating this -- the range that we put out there.","Greg McGinniss","Okay. And then thinking about that drag from dispositions a bit more. Ross, can you help me with this one? So the messaging on dispositions going forward has been consistent at this $200 million to $300 million range, but we came in $75 million above the expected range in 2019. You'd still expect $200 million to $300 million in 2020. Just wondering if there is some deterioration in operating performance at certain assets, which led you to be slightly more aggressive on dispositions. And then potentially, what could lead to an increase in the disposition range for 2020?","Ross Cooper","Yes. I certainly wouldn't characterize it as a deterioration in the operations. There were a few assets that closed in the last 10 days of the year that we initially had anticipated would be 2020 dispositions, so that certainly factored into it. As it relates to the overage on the guidance in '19, that guidance was always a net transaction guidance. So when you factor in the sale-leaseback that was achieved in the early part of '19, it was really about $40 million. So it was a little bit less than the $75 million. ","But again, it was really just having a very robust demand for the assets. We typically, in years past, had about 80% to 85% success rate on the assets that we had in the market to closing. The second half of '19, every single asset that we put into the market closed, including ones that we thought would have been a few months delayed. So that elevated the range a bit for '19, but we're very comfortable that we'll be sticking within the range for 2020. And we have no desire or anticipation that we would move that range or ramp up our desire to sell more.","Operator","Next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.","Haendel St. Juste","So Glenn, maybe you can help me with the builds versus occupied. How should we be thinking about your opportunity for narrowing that? Sounds like 270 basis point gap this year.","David Jamieson","This is Dave. It's 240 basis points currently so it compressed from 270 to 240. When we look at the 2020 and the flow of that run, we expect anywhere from $10 million to $15 million to come from that 240 basis points, and it will be heavily weighted towards the back half of '20. So when we look on the outlook, whether or not it looks expand or contract, right now, I think we feel good about the range. We do know if some additional space does come back, that we start signing those new leases, it could expand a little bit. But I feel like right now, we are in the range, and we'll continue to open new stores and work on compressing it.","Haendel St. Juste","Appreciate that. And then a follow-up. I want to go back to Boulevard for a second. Glenn, I think you mentioned $3 million to $5 million of NOI coming online this year, which is -- it's pretty far below what I was thinking just going through the quick math. $214 million fixed-cap midyear convention, I guess, we're around $6 million, $6.5 million of NOI. So maybe you could walk me through what I might be missing there and some color on that number.","Glenn Cohen","Yes. I'm going to let -- Dave will take you through the timing.","David Jamieson","Sure. Right now, we're going through the process of preparing the retailers for opening, and we'll look to start opening them towards the back half of '20. There are items when you deal with borough development in the New York tristate area or the New York area related to inspection, the utility companies that you continue to manage and work through. So we're just -- as we're continuing to finalize the construction phase of this project, there will be influence on the timing of tenancy. ","So that said, when you look -- at the end of the day, project stabilization, we still very -- feel very, very confident about where this is going to end up and the quality of shop, right, et cetera, but it's really just a matter of the timing of the openings as we start to look out towards the back half of '20 into '21.","Glenn Cohen","Right. Stabilization for the assets should be towards the end of '21.","Operator","Next question is from Brian Hawthorne, RBC Capital Markets.","Brian Hawthorne","Can you talk about your expectations for the timing of dispositions in 2020?","David Jamieson","Sure. I think the first quarter will certainly be on the lighter side. As I mentioned, a few assets that we thought would close in Q1 previously ended up closing the end of the -- the end of last year. So we'll see a little bit of a ramp-up in Qs 2, 3 and 4. And at that point, it should be somewhat ratable. But Q1 will be light on the disposition side.","Brian Hawthorne","Okay. And then do you have your anchor mark-to-market for the leases expiring in 2020?","David Jamieson","Yes. With the -- currently on our list, you have 89 leases that are expiring, some of which have options, and that's currently at $11 a foot, $11.54. When you look at our current anchors to date, we're just about $14 a foot.","Operator","Next question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.","Richard Hill","A couple of clarification questions, maybe going back to the beginning. When you thought about the headwind from redevelopment to same-store NOI, was that 20 to 30 basis points? Did I hear that right?","Glenn Cohen","It's 20 to 40 basis points, not as a headwind though. It's embedded in the number that we used.","Richard Hill","No, no. I'm sorry for using the wrong term. I just wanted to make sure I understood what impact redevelopment was having on same-store NOI. And then on the loss reserve, you mentioned 100 basis points, which I completely understand. And our math as per the supplement agrees [indiscernible] 44 basis points. But when you talked about the known 30 basis points, is that included in the 100 basis points? Or should we be thinking about the loss reserve as closer to like 130 basis points versus 100?","Glenn Cohen","We take out, as Conor mentioned, we take out known tenants that are not going to be this. So those are out of it. There are other pieces that make up that -- where we see this other 30 basis points. So I would say, if no one else went out, we would expect 30 basis points of credit loss. But we know that's not going to happen. So we have this extra 70 basis point that is built into our budget process for all the other unknowns. So I would say, no, it's not 130 basis points, it's a total of 100 in our budget process.","Richard Hill","Got it. That's very helpful. And then just thinking about the -- sort of the trajectory of same-store NOI throughout the year. Obviously, 1Q '19 was a really good year with, I think, 3.7% same-store NOI. Could you maybe just revisit how you think about the trajectory of same-store NOI throughout 2020? Do you expect 1Q '20 to be maybe as strong as 1Q '19? Or was there something -- is there something specific that we should be thinking about on a year-over-year basis?","Glenn Cohen","Right. Although we don't give quarterly guidance, I will tell you that it's our expectation that the first quarter would probably be the low point in terms of what we would report for the year, and you'll see it ramp up as we go throughout 2020.","Operator","Next question is from Floris Van Dijkum from Compass Point.","Floris Van Dijkum","A quick question on -- a clarification, I guess, on Pier 1. I Think you have 30 locations, about 50 basis points of rental impact. What is your expectation if you were to get that back? I note that the average rent is around $22 a square foot, which is well in excess of your average anchor rent. Are you actively looking to market that lease or already marketing that space right now?","David Jamieson","Yes. We've been proactively looking to prelease the Pier 1 boxes for a period of time. And just to clarify, Pier 1 ranges in size, and actually, a sizable majority of them are actually below what we deem as an acreage anything over 10,000 square feet. So using the anchor average rent is not necessarily the most appropriate way to determine a mark-to-market benefit. Some will be up, some will be down, but I feel like we have a good opportunity there. ","In addition to that, we obviously will be upgrading the quality of the tenancy and bringing in thriving retailers to help occupy those spaces. So as we continue to look out into '20, we're monitoring the situation very, very closely, and we'll continue to actively prelease those boxes.","Operator","Next question, from Linda Tsai of Jefferies.","Linda Tsai","On the 2020 acquisitions, the 5% to 6% cap rate, what upside do you expect in rents? And what does the same-store growth profile look like relative to the in-place portfolio?","David Jamieson","Yes. I mean I think that they're slightly different between the 2. When we're looking at acquisition opportunities, we anticipate, given the market that -- and the locations and the quality of what we'll be buying, that the cap rates will be in the 5% to 6% range in year 1. But any opportunity that we look at would certainly have a pretty significant growth opportunity, whether it be with below-market leases, redevelopment opportunities. So we think that anything we look to acquire over time will have a growth rate that's outsized compared to the existing portfolio and would continue to be accretive to the quality and the growth of the portfolio long term. But I can't really comment on the specifics of a particular acquisition at this time.","Linda Tsai","And then it looks like straight-line rent was higher on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. Why did this go up a bit? And what's the more realistic run rate for 2020?","Glenn Cohen","So again, straight line is somewhat tied to leases that are getting signed and the leases being in -- the box being ready for opening or delivery to the tenant. It's just a matter -- that's really what's driving it. You have a lot of new leases that were signed in places like at Mill Station. You have a lot of leases that are getting signed in Dania. So there's a lot of free rent tied to those where you start straight-lining that in. The run rate is lower than what you see in the fourth quarter.","Linda Tsai","Okay. And then I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks, flat to lower G&A in 2020. What's driving that?","Glenn Cohen","More efficiency for one thing. If you look what we've done, we've reduced the size of the portfolio.","Conor Flynn","And also the leasing costs from a year-over-year perspective.","Glenn Cohen","That's really -- we do a very -- we spend a lot of time monitoring where G&A stands and try to do everything we can to keep it measured. And again, as the portfolio is reduced in size, we have reduced the size of some staff over the years.","Conor Flynn","We've updated our systems as well. We switched over to MRI and made a lot of investment there so we think there's going to be significant efficiencies and synergies coming from that investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities.","Christopher Lucas","Ross, a real quick one. Do you have anything under contract right around as far as acquisitions go?","Ross Cooper","No, nothing under contract at the moment.","Christopher Lucas","Okay. And then please be patient with me. I do need to go back to same-store on a clarification just so I fully understand, so bear with me. Last year, you did 3%, both with and without redev. The guidance of 1.5% to 2% is -- includes the redev. Do I understand to say then that without redev, the guidance would have been, what, 1.3% to 1.6% or something? Is that how I should be thinking about this?","Ross Cooper","With that -- yes, that would be correct.","Christopher Lucas","Okay. And then...","Ross Cooper","Chris, again, it's a starting point for us when we look at it, and you're baking in 100 basis points of credit loss. So a little over...","Christopher Lucas","So let me go to the next point, which is the known fallouts that you had from 2019, so Dress Barns and all that, that's 130 basis points that you know going into this year, correct?","Ross Cooper","That's already built into our...","Christopher Lucas","Right, right. So that's an initial drag, you know that going in. So that's already 130. So now we're looking at going into this year. You have 100 basis points of essentially reserve, and 30 of it, you already kind of know about. So there's 70 left of sort of whatever for the rest of the year. Is that correct?","Conor Flynn","No. Chris, I think what you're trying to get at is with the initial headwind from the lost rents of some of those retailers that went bankrupt at the end of last year. That's somewhere about 40 basis points. That is factored into the initial guidance, and that's not part of our first starting point guidance of a credit loss of 100 basis points.","Glenn Cohen","Right. So Chris, just to clarify, it's not 130 that's baked in. It's 40 basis points from Dress Barn as you...","Christopher Lucas","Okay. There we go. Okay. That's the number I was looking for.","Conor Flynn","Chris, I think it's just a headwind that we know of lost rent that's already out, credit losses for those that we anticipate going bankrupt over the course of 2020.","Glenn Cohen","Right. Said differently, if those tenants were all still there, the guidance would be 40 basis points higher. We know they're out so we started with that out of the number already.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Next, we have a follow-up from Christine McElroy of Citi.","Christine McElroy","So sorry, just to continue that conversation a little bit. So of that unknown, right, you mentioned 30 basis points and 70 basis points of the 100 basis point reserve. Is the 30 basis points all Forever 21? And where does sort of Pier 1 fall into that? That -- I assume that's in the 70. And any -- what is sort of -- what are your expectations around how models plays out? Like is that impacted in the 70? Maybe you can just give a little bit more detail on what you're expecting for the individual retailers in that?","Glenn Cohen","So we've seen the Pier 1 closing list, and we've modeled in -- again, we just got the list prior to what we were doing so we know that some of those stores we expect to close. That's part of that 30 that I was saying is known. It's not being driven by Forever 21.","Christine McElroy","Where does Forever 21 fall in? Is that in -- that's not even in the 100 because it's already in the range.","Conor Flynn","Yes. In Forever 21, we had a very small exposure. So when you're talking about Dania, it's Dania, the Phase 2 is not in our same-site pool so that would be part of it.","David Jamieson","And there's only one location.","Conor Flynn","Yes. So that's not part of the issue. I think as you mentioned, Christy, that hey, when we go through Pier 1 put out initial closing list. We know that there's some number of those stores that we have right away. That factors into the 100 basis points. And then for some of the other names that you've mentioned and some of the other ones out there, we factor in that impact. We look at the sensitivity of maybe potential timing of when during the course of the year that could happen. It's early. We'll have better visibility after maybe the first quarter, and that's what -- typically when we reevaluate everything going forward.","Christine McElroy","Okay. And then just to follow up on Linda's question around the noncash rents. Should we be aware of any sort of write-off of straight-line rent receivable related to some of the questionable uncollectibility or any sort of acceleration of FAS 141 this year based on any early space recapture that you're expecting?","Glenn Cohen","Well, okay. Last year, we had some below-market rents, which were certainly helpful within the number. There is less amount of below-market rent benefit modeled in our plan for this year than we had in 2019. As it relates to writing off of straight-line rent, again, it's going to depend on the tenants. So we run through, tenant by tenant, their credit quality, and if the tenant goes out, we immediately would write that off. But that -- there's a modest amount of that modeled in the plan this year.","Christine McElroy","Okay. And then just thinking about free cash flow after dividend, how are you thinking about -- sorry if I missed this, how are you thinking about sort of recurring CapEx spend this year relative to the last few years in terms of leasing, CapEx and landlord costs and sort of recurring maintenance CapEx as it relates to sort of growing your free cash flow?","Glenn Cohen","So I would say, in total, between Capex, leasing commissions, TIs, it's a similar range for 2020 than what we incurred in -- or spent in 2019.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Bujnicki for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.","David Bujnicki","Thank you for participating in our call today. I'm available during the course of the day, if you have any additional follow-up questions. Otherwise, I hope you have a really nice day. Thanks so much.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki, Vice President. Please go ahead.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Andrew. Thank you all for joining Kimco's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning are: Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Cohen, Chief Financial Officer; and Conor Flynn, Chief Operating Officer. There are also other key executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking, and it's important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","[Operator Instructions] And with that, I turn the call over to Dave Henry.","David B. Henry","Good morning, and thank you for calling in this morning. We are happy to report strong first quarter results. As usual, Glenn and Conor will provide the details. But overall, our operating metrics continue to be excellent, led by 153 new leases with an average positive leasing spread of 50.7% calculated on the comparable new leases. Our terrific leasing spreads, combined with another substantial jump in small shop occupancy, provides solid evidence of the continued improvement and strength embedded in our core portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers.","Looking at the U.S. shopping center industry overall, consumers are spending again with March consumer spending posting the largest gain in almost 5 years. Consumer sentiment, as recorded by University of Michigan, also rose in April to 9-month high. Combined with historically low new retail construction, U.S. population growth is now outpacing the net addition of retail space by 3.5x. And a 5-year high of new planned store openings, effective rents are increasing significantly. It is also interesting to note that services now represent slightly more than 2\/3 of all consumer spending, off from less than 50% in the 1960s and '70s.","This is significant for the neighborhood and community shopping center sector as our properties are all about essential local goods and services. Telephones, dry cleaners, restaurants, hair salons, urgent care centers, et cetera, are all resistant to the inroads of e-commerce. In addition, 94% of all retail sales still take place in the brick-and-mortar world. And there's an increasing list of online retailers beginning to establish physical stores. Even Amazon has opened short-term pop-up stores and has mentioned the possibility of opening traditional retail and showroom stores if they can be differentiated.","With respect to Kimco's key goals and objectives for the year, we continue to make excellent progress with our disposition activities in Latin America. With the Macquarie Mexican REIT closing in the first quarter, we have now received approximately $500 million in net sale of proceeds from Latin America over the past year. We continue to be on track to sell essentially all of our properties by year end with signed letters of intent or contracts on almost all assets.","In the U.S., as Conor will detail and as highlighted in our earnings release, our recycling and portfolio upgrading initiatives continue at a solid pace with Kimco acquiring high-quality retail properties from both market sellers and our existing joint venture partners. Most recently, we have reached agreement with BIG, an Israeli public company and existing joint venture partner, to essentially divide 21 mutually owned shopping centers into 3 groups, a Kimco-owned portfolio 7 shopping centers comprising 1.2 million square feet, a BIG-owned portfolio of 8 shopping centers comprising approximately the same square footage and 6 assets, which will continued to be owned jointly. This arrangement, together with the LaSalle and KIF acquisitions recently announced, continues our efforts to simplify our portfolio and reduce the absolute number of joint ventures and properties held in joint ventures.","Quarter-by-quarter, the profile of our shopping center properties is significantly improving in terms of demographics, average rents, NOI growth and primary markets. Since late 2010, we have sold over 16 million square feet of property and we continue to actively identify and market additional noncore and secondary retail properties. Coupled with our high-quality property acquisitions, such as the Boston portfolio and the 2 large properties in North Carolina purchased in the first quarter, we believe we are continuing to create a superior property portfolio with excellent NOI and redevelopment prospects.","Looking quickly at Canada. Our Canadian portfolio remains a strong and important contributor to our earnings despite the recent adverse impact of currency. Kimco's Canadian properties remain well occupied, approximately 96%, and our RioCan partners have identified several significant redevelopment opportunities, which we are evaluating together.","And now I would like to turn to Glenn to discuss the financial details of the quarter to be followed by Conor's discussion on our portfolio results. And then Milton will, as usual, provide some high-level observations.","Glenn G. Cohen","Thanks, David, and good morning. 2014 is off to an excellent start as evidenced by our solid first quarter results. We are actively executing on our themes from our December Investor Day, transforming our portfolio with high-quality acquisitions and disposing of slower-growth assets from nonstrategic markets, simplifying our business model with the reduction of joint ventures and a continued exit from Latin America while also ramping up our redevelopment pipeline. We remain focused on keeping the balance sheet strong and opportunistically accessing the capital markets and reducing our overall cost of capital.","As we reported last night, headline FFO and FFO as adjusted each came in at $0.34 per diluted share, up from $0.33 for headline FFO last year and $0.32 for FFO as adjusted last year, in line with our expectations. The increase is primarily attributable to strong NOI growth generated from the operating portfolio. Also as I've mentioned in the past, G&A is impacted in the first quarter for our annual noncash equity comp award issuances. In addition, we incurred $2 million of severance costs. The increase in G&A on a sequential basis was offset by 2 lease terminations included in income from discontinued operations.","Headline FFO includes $4.2 million of transaction income generated from a promote earned on the disposition of a preferred equity position and fees earned from the early repayment of a mortgage receivable. Headline FFO also includes $6.6 million of transaction expenses related to acquisition costs, severance related to the wind-down of our Latin America operations and a noncash equity loss from our additional Albertsons investment made last year. We remain very excited about the prospects of the Albertsons investment as the Albertsons operating team has been executing on its business plan and consistently beating revenue projections.","Our Kimco operating team kicked off the year with solid results, delivering combined same-site NOI growth of 2.5% before the negative impact of currency of 100 basis points. Same-site NOI growth for the U.S. portfolio was 2%, in line with our first quarter internal forecast. The same-site NOI growth is fueled primarily by top line revenue growth generated from increased occupancy, which stands at 94.5% for the combined portfolio, up 90 basis points from a year ago, and continued strong leasing spreads. Although occupancy for the U.S. portfolio was modestly lower by 20 basis points from year end, the result of the usual after-holiday season fallouts, U.S. occupancy now stands at 94.7%, up 100 basis points from a year ago. We continue to execute on the quality upgrade of our portfolio and are planning to accelerate the dispositions of slow-growth assets not located in our key territories.","During the first quarter, we sold interest in 11 U.S. properties and have 40 U.S. assets either under contract or under price negotiations. In addition, we are preparing another 60 assets to bring to the market. As a result, we are increasing our disposition target by $300 million to a total of $1 billion to $1.2 billion for 2014, including the Latin America dispositions. South of the border, we completed the sale of a 9-property portfolio in Mexico for a gross sales price of $222 million with net proceeds to us of $110 million after repayment of debt. We are actively negotiating agreements for the sale of substantially all the remaining assets in Latin America with the expectation to complete the sales by the end of 2014, further simplifying our business model. As Conor will elaborate on shortly, we continue to make significant progress on our efforts to unwind JVs and selectively acquire choice assets.","Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity funds. During the quarter, we renewed our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility, reducing the spread of LIBOR from 105 basis points to 92.5 basis points and reduced the facility fee from 20 basis points to 15 basis points. The new facility, which has a final maturity in March 2019, will provide immediate liquidity at a reduced cost, saving approximately $1 million annually. Also subsequent to quarter end, we issued a $500 million 7-year bond at a coupon of 3.2%, one of our lowest coupons ever. Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay $295 million of bonds that mature in June at a weighted average rate of 5.2%, $98 million of maturing mortgage debt at an average rate of 6.14% and the balance to [indiscernible] pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility. With this bond issuance, we have addressed more debt maturities since 2014. Our debt metrics remains solid with net debt to recurring EBITDA of 5.5x and fixed charge coverage of 2.9x. And our liquidity position is in excellent shape with over $1.6 billion of immediate liquidity.","We are pleased to be able to reaffirm our 2014 guidance range of FFO as adjusted per share of $1.36 to $1.40 despite the expected dilution from the anticipated acceleration of dispositions. Our guidance range also takes into account the expected savings from the refinancings previously mentioned. In addition, our previous guidance of same-site NOI growth of 2.5% to 3.5% remains unchanged. As we move later into the year, we will have a better picture of the impact of our accelerated disposition program on 2015 earnings and property metrics.","And now I'll turn it over to Conor.","Conor C. Flynn","Good morning, everyone. Today, I will begin by outlining our progress on acquisitions and dispositions, and then cover the progress on our redevelopments. Finally, I will recap the leasing and operations activity for the quarter.","We continue to simplify the business model by acquiring JV interests, and most recently announced that we acquired the remaining 60.9% interest in the high-quality KIF portfolio. These assets are predominantly grocery-anchored with strong sales located in our key markets. The 12 properties totaling 1.5 million square feet for a gross price of $408 million translates to a blended implied cap rate of 5.9%. However, when considering the KIF promote we received, the effective cap rate is 6.4%. It's also worth noting that 9 out of the 12 assets are unencumbered. 2 of the 12 assets do not meet our quality and growth criteria and will be sold individually as we continue to stick to our knitting of transforming and simplifying.","In the first quarter, we acquired 5 high-quality shopping centers totaling 900,000 square feet, amounting to a gross purchase price of $216 million, including $113 million of mortgage debt at an implied cap rate of 6.1%. These include the acquisition of 3 grocery-anchored properties from the LaSalle joint venture, where we purchased the remaining 89% interest. The 3 properties totaling 316,000 square feet are located in the Greater Baltimore area and have an occupancy level of 97.6% at an average base rent of $19.49 a foot. Included in this package is York Road Plaza, a Giant-anchored shopping center doing over $800 of per foot sales.","In one-off transactions, we acquired 2 large well-positioned properties in North Carolina. Crossroads Plaza is the dominant power center, located in the affluent and highly educated Research Triangle of Cary. The approximately 490,000 square foot site is anchored by Ross, HomeGoods, Marshalls, Stein Mart, Michaels, Best Buy, PETCO, Old Navy and ULTA. Combined with our adjacent properties, we now own over 900,000 square feet at this dominant intersection. With the acquisition of Crossroads, Kimco now has 9 shopping centers comprising 2 million square feet in the Raleigh MSA, which is ranked as 1 of the fastest-growing MSAs by Forbes. Quail Corners, located in Charlotte, is a 110,000 square foot Harris Teeter-anchored shopping center. Quail Corners' surrounding area boasts an average household income of over $100,000. And the acquisition offers an additional value creation opportunity with a fully entitled undeveloped outparcel.","Turning to dispositions. As mentioned in our recent press release, Kimco sold ownership interest in 11 U.S. properties during the first quarter, including 7 wholly-owned and 4 unconsolidated properties held in joint ventures, for a gross sales price of $63.7 million, including $14 million of mortgage debt and a blended implied cap rate of 9.1%. Our share of the proceeds was $42.1 million. Subsequently after the quarter, 4 additional assets were sold for $18.5 million with $11.3 million in Kimco proceeds. One of the properties that were sold include a few stay alive [ph] assets, the demographics and long-term growth profile were not commensurate with our future portfolio goals.","As we outlined at our Investor Day in December, a key driver of our strategy is a more aggressive approach to selling low-growth and noncore assets and reinvesting in our key territories, focusing on above-average growth and redevelopment potential. We are accelerating the company's planned level of dispositions. Currently, we are negotiating contracts for sale of 40 U.S. properties for a gross sales price of approximately $344 million and we are planning to market an additional 60 properties for sale.","Redevelopments continue to enhance the portfolio in numerous ways. And 2014 will be a big year for Kimco as we look to add projects to the pipeline in addition to completing and activating numerous projects this year. In the first quarter alone, we completed $24 million in redevelopment projects, providing an incremental yield of 10.4%. Tri-City Plaza, located in the Tampa MSA, is one of the larger redevelopment projects to become active this quarter. The $31 million redevelopment is undergoing a massive repositioning, where we will be demolishing 90% of the square footage and creating a vibrant new offering that includes new buildings for LA Fitness, Sports Authority, Ross as well as numerous restaurants. This exciting makeover will add over $2.8 million of incremental NOI. We are cautiously optimistic that the demand from best-in-class retailers will continue to fuel growth at our top performing assets and increase future redevelopment opportunities. Currently, our redevelopment pipeline totals $792 million, including $260 million of active redevelopment projects, $278 million under design review and $254 million in the evaluation phase. This report is fluid and projects take time to ramp up. Still I am encouraged by our progress over the past year and believe we can continue to deliver projects that will improve Kimco's net asset value while providing a strong incremental return to our shareholders.","Moving on to leasing metrics. U.S. same-site NOI growth of 2% was fueled primarily by rent commencements that added $5.2 million in base rent and an improved overall credit loss across the portfolio. The effective snow removal cost impacted our recoveries by a negative 40 basis points. Redevelopments contributed 5 basis points to same-site NOI. We expect same-site NOI to strengthen during the remainder of the year as numerous redevelopments come online, previously executed leases begin to start paying rent and renewals and options are executed at positive rates, a trend that's continued for 15 straight quarters.","In the U.S., we signed 153 new leases for a total of 777,000 square feet. Overall occupancy, while remaining flat in 94.5% quarter-over-quarter, reverses a 4-year trend of a postholiday dip. Drilling down, pro rata U.S. occupancy increased 100 basis points year-over-year, down 20 basis points from prior quarter due to anticipated fallout from a few anchor spaces. Anchor occupancy dipped 30 basis points pro rata versus prior quarter. Small shop occupancy increased 40 basis points to 85.6% compared to prior quarter. Year-over-year, it is up 160 basis points. This quarter, small shop occupancy increase is an encouraging sign and was primarily driven by positive net absorption.","Activity in the small shops comes predominantly from national small shop operators, regional players and franchisees. But we are starting to see numerous hair and nail salons as well as other local service units come back into our centers. An area that showed strong positive net absorption in our small shop space was medical use, such as physician offices and urgent care facilities. In total, we have 14 new medical deals, which accounted for over 46,000 square feet, paying an average base rent of $21.62 a foot. Medical service use, along with restaurants and personal care services, increase the strength of our small shop population. They're Internet-resistant and drive traffic to the center on a recurring basis. A notable new international retailer we welcomed to our portfolio this quarter in California is Aki-Home, part of the 300-store Japanese Nitori furniture group.","Our outstanding new leases of 50% was driven by across-the-board double-digit positive spreads on junior anchors, mid-sized shops and small shops. Some highlights include the recapture of an expired pad ground lease was paying less than $1 a foot and we execute a new lease with the National Optometry at nearly $30 a foot at Evergreen Square. Other highlights include new leases with TJ Maxx, HomeGoods, Sports Authority, PetSmart, CVS and Shoe Carnival, all paying significantly higher rents than the previous tenants. The average base rent of new deals was $16.50 a foot, which illustrates the mark-to-market growth we have embedded in our portfolio that will continue to create future upside for Kimco shareholders. Renewals and option leasing spreads posted a 4.6% pro rata increase. And overall leasing spread in the U.S. increased 8.8% and have now been positive for 13 straight quarters.","Overall, we continue to improve the portfolio by consistently executing on our three-pronged strategy of transformation, simplification and redevelopment. Further proof of the strengthening of the portfolio is the steady increase in average base rent per square foot. We reported a pro rata ABR this quarter of $13.18 a foot, a $0.19 increase quarter-over-quarter and a $0.52 increase year-over-year, evidence that transformation is taking shape as we work tirelessly to unlock the value for our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn it over to Milton.","Milton Cooper","So thank you, Conor. As you've heard, we are executing on our plan to transform, simplify and redevelop. First, our portfolio transformation is in full swing, most recent example is the acquisition of the Boston portfolio, which closed on April 30. The performance of this portfolio already exceeds our underwritten expectations and we will create greater value than we projected. Now let's take a look at what we achieved so far.","Since September 2010, we have acquired 123 U.S. retail properties comprising 14.4 million square feet for a gross purchase price of $2.8 billion. These properties have on a pro rata basis an average occupancy that is over 10% higher than the 158 properties we sold. The average annual base rent per square foot is over 63% higher than the ABR for our dispositions. Demographics are impressive and average household income for the acquired sites is 40% higher and the estimated population is almost 20% higher than the disposed sites.","Second, we made very meaningful progress on simplifying our business by reducing the amount of joint ventures. In the second quarter of 2011, we had 552 properties in JVs. That number is now 387, a 30% decrease. This represents a reduction of more than $3.7 billion of gross investment value in joint ventures. And when you look at the amount of real estate value we have purchased from our JVs, it's comparable to buying very large and high-quality portfolios. But we are able to buy these properties with less risk, less underwriting and lower transaction costs than any external portfolio acquisition.","Third, we are excited about redevelopment potential. The pipeline is increasing and the projects are perfectly aligned with our transformation to a higher-quality portfolio. We are stimulated by Conor's passion and zeal for value creation and we can't wait for these projects to come online. On the plus business, we're happy with the progress made at Albertsons and SUPERVALU. And we are excited to be a part of the Safeway consortium.","The transformation, simplification and redevelopment strategy is no small feat with a portfolio of our size. And I would like to express my gratitude to Dave, Glenn, Conor as well as all the Kimco associates throughout the company, who are working so hard to achieve our goals. And now we are happy to take any questions.","David F. Bujnicki","Andrew, we're ready to move to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of the BIG joint venture, what prompted the split-off of properties? And why not just dissolve the JV? Why can't you either own the 6 centers within that entity? And then can you sort of comment just on how you're actively working with other JV partners to formulate an exit?","David B. Henry","Sure. The second part is easy. Yes, we are working with other joint venture partners, the ones that would like to co-own in form or fashion. We're trying to work with them, especially the ones that have high-quality properties, we're very interested in buying those properties. Others that have secondary assets, we've convinced them to put them on the market, sell them to third parties. So we are actively, as Milton mentioned, trying to unwind a lot of these joint ventures. Not to say that these are not great partners and that we haven't built a very good business and created value with them. It's just that, at the end of the day, we had too many, too many partners, too many ventures, and we're unwinding them. And also as Milton mentioned, it's a great source of acquisitions for us. We could generally buy these at an effective cap rate higher than on the market, either using our promote as currency, or avoiding the transaction costs, assumption fees, brokerage costs and things like that. So it's very good economics. That's a good place for us to put capital. With respect to BIG, they've been a very good partner. They're building their own platform in the U.S.. They have other joint ventures. This was an opportunity to basically go through the portfolio and divide it into 3 piles. The first pile separates some of the better long-term assets into a BIG-owned portfolio and a Kimco-owned portfolio. And we negotiated the division of those assets. The 6 we're remaining together have other issues that we'll resolve together, maybe there's leasing or redevelopment to go through it or debt issues or other reasons that they're going to stay as they are for a period of time.","Christy McElroy - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Are these dispositions candidates longer-term?","David B. Henry","The 6? Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wonder, are we looking at a possible shift in the pickup in ground-up development in the strip category? And I know you're pursuing active redevelopments. But are you also thinking about ground-up developments?","David B. Henry","Overall, rents still haven't recovered to the levels necessary to justify a ground-up development. You may see occasional ground-up development in places like Texas or Florida, where you have grocers that are particularly anxious to expand their footprint and are willing to pay very high rents. But as we've mentioned before, the old days of buying 100 acres of land and going through years of entitlement projects with all the preleasing that's necessary to do that just isn't on the horizon anytime soon because the economics aren't there, developers do not want to take the small leasing risk that's involved in these transactions. And the retailers themselves don't have the patience to wait for years to get new stores. They're committed to opening up in their expansion plan in the near future. So they'd rather pay a couple of dollars more a foot to get immediate access to an existing store. All of which is good for us landlords because as we've tried to say during this call, rents are beginning to jump. They're not just going up 1% or 2%. Coming out of the recession now, rents are beginning to jump. And eventually, it will lead to new construction. But for now, we have the benefit of a very constrained supply. Retail per capita in the U.S. is going down for the first time because of population growth is exceeding the new supply of retail. So all of that bodes well for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Morgan of MLV.","Paul Morgan - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Just maybe if you could provide a little bit more color about your investment in the Safeway transaction. From Kimco's perspective, what is the opportunity there? And how would you compare or contrast that with Albertsons and SUPERVALU, not exactly the same situations, and then whether you see some of the shopping centers falling out to you from that?","Unknown Executive","Well, I would say -- I'll take the last part first regarding shopping centers falling out for us. I think what's going to happen is really when the deal does close -- we had so many shareholder approvals and antitrust approval. But the deal is closed. And day 1 is going to be an operations turnaround play to merge 2 companies with 2,300 stores [indiscernible] on that. But like the transactions that we just closed in 2013 and in 2006, where you see we have an operating team in place especially for the retail operations. And from that, add value to the real estate. Right now, the real estate is kind of being used -- not kind of being used as a financing vehicle for the acquisition. But in time, we're going to work with our partners and use real estate to add value to the transaction.","David B. Henry","If you could just please be aware, it's in an approval process now, so we're a little bit limited on how much we can say. We will tell you that the 5 brands we bought from SUPERVALU last year, the early indications are terrific. The comp sales are good and the improvements are very good. So we feel very good about what we bought and we feel very optimistic about the Safeway transaction when it closes.","Operator","The next question comes from Tammi Fique from Wells Fargo Securities.","Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could discuss the cap rate spread between expected dispositions and acquisitions for the year, and then maybe your use of proceeds from the incremental disposition capital.","Conor C. Flynn","Yes, no problem. I think the deal -- first quarter is probably a little bit of an indicator that we're going to be ramping up our dispositions, and now we think that overall throughout the year, we'll probably average out to about an 8% cap for our disposition portfolio. We do have a number of different portfolios in the market today. Some of them are in the market as a package but can also be bid on individually. The asset type ranges from, really, power center to grocery-anchored center to triple net leases. So we have been really going asset by asset and taking a deep dive throughout the portfolio to see where we can unlock value, where we can lease up vacancy and keeping that in the parent, and we think there's downside or risk or very little growth in that if we had put that on the market. So we think that overall, the cap rates will probably even out to about an 8% from year end.","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes. When you blend it with the Latin America sales that we're doing, you're probably looking at somewhere around a 225 basis point spread between acquisitions and dispositions in total when you put it together. So the more encouraging thing is the disposition activity, that the window is still wide open. If anything, cap rates are falling faster on some of the B properties and secondary assets that you would have expected. So it's encouraging to us that there's good activity and we're doing the best we can to take advantage of it, so that 200 basis point spread that Conor mentioned is probably drifting down to what's a 150 basis spread based on current indications.","Tamara J. Fique - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just the use of the proceeds from the incremental disposition capital?","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, again, in terms of our overall capital plan, again, we -- you see the amount of acquisitions that have gone on, so between acquisitions and redevelopment pipeline, that's how we're fueling our funding requirements. So that's what's going to go.","David B. Henry","For the moment, it's a form of recycling. Clearly, there's no excess either way for the moment.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason White of Green Street Advisors.","Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I was just hoping you could walk through the composition of the renewal spreads, kind of mid-4% range. If you were to understand, you're typically getting some fixed bump, sort of 10% every 10 years and obviously, a wide range. But if you can kind of walk through the composition of renewal options versus spreads on just kind of one-off renewal would be helpful.","Conor C. Flynn","Yes, the renewal spreads and the renewal as an options posted was 4.6% so it's really a combination of anchor leases, as well as midsize shops, as well as small shops so you're right that there's typically option increases of anywhere in that range, from 5% to 12% of a 10-year basis. But there are some leases that obviously move the needle each way, and we've made a combination, really, of the major renewals, that we've done it. So it was at Staples where they renewed at, almost double their rent in Garden State Pavilion, Marshalls at Torrance Promenade in California, we took them from close to $5.50 up to $14 a foot. Shoe Carnival is from $6 to $9, Home Depot exercise their options out at Town Center East in Signal Hill, which had a 5% increase. So we see it as a range where the -- still the growth driver is in our junior boxes and we think that, that's going to continue. There's just very little supply out there. So these retailers are holding on to the real estate they have because they realize how valuable it is.","Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the non-option renewals weigh on some of those fixed option spreads a little bit and that's where you get to the kind of 4% range?","Conor C. Flynn","That's correct. There's a few that were -- that sometimes are rolled down. There's a few that when you average it out, it's a 4.6% spread.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim Sullivan of Cowen & Company.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Looking at your -- the large tenant list, it is pretty interesting that the Kmart exposure has dropped so significantly year-over-year from 50 locations down to 34. I know some of that is associated with sales but obviously, some of it is also associated with recapturing space and redeveloping it. And I just wonder if we could have an update on whether you expect any major movement there or any additional material recaptured. You've done some sizable deals in the New York market, but maybe, just to give us a flavor for how those discussions are going, whether there's any accelerated pace of closings to be expected there or not.","Conor C. Flynn","We don't see any accelerated pace of closing -- closures but what we do see is they're continuing to be active on trying to sublease positions where they think there's value. And that usually sparks the conversation of lease terminations, payments from Kimco to Kmart or Sears. We see that there's future opportunities, we've been waiting patiently for these older leases for a long time. We think that's the big differentiator for us, so we continue to be in constant communication with them and continue to negotiate on a few deals beauty where we think we can create significant value here from releasing or redevelopment.","David B. Henry","And we also even bought an existing center with an existing Kmart lease that's has a short term left in Marathon, Florida, that's a wonderful redevelopment play. So we're not afraid of the exposure where we can underwrite the real estate very well.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","While we're on the topic of store closing, I was curious what your thoughts are on Office Depot and their notice that they're going to close 400 stores over the next several years, 150 this year. Have they notified you guys of any closings? And what do you have expiring, I guess, in the way of Depot and Max leases this year?","Conor C. Flynn","Yes, it's obviously been something we've been monitoring for a long period of time. When you look at the Office Depot, OfficeMax exposure, we have 67 leases, 6 that expired this year and 13 that expire 2015. But you've got to look at it proactively with the whole office supply sector because the Office Depot, OfficeMax closures will impact what Staples decides to do with their portfolio. So we've been monitoring it closely and working on understanding which assets overlap, and we do have upside in those leases that are expiring. We have 10 office supply leases expiring. In the next -- through 2017 that we believe are 69% below market. So we think there are significant upside there. We've already started the process of pre-releasing that and we think that their square footage is ideal for today's junior anchors. You can take a look at whether it's soft goods players like TJX or Ross. There's also a lot of specialty grocers in the market today that are a perfect fit for that 25,000 square foot box, It's really the sweet spot for users today. So we're cautiously optimistic that the closures, that will result in the merger. Will actually result in future outside of potential redevelopment.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And have they given you indication, Conor, of when they might notify you about this first round?","Conor C. Flynn","They have not yet. We've been in discussions and we know that we're going to meet with them shortly we've been in constant communications. So we have a good idea since we have a tracking system of which ones are doing well and which ones have year-over-year decline. So that we've circled which ones we think are keepers and which ones do we think are closures.","Glenn G. Cohen","And I think what's happening also, whether it's Staples, Office Depot, OfficeMax, and it's because they know, like we do, there's a lot of interest in their boxes, that they're going to close doors now in time for them to go out there and see how they can mitigate their liability. I imagine they're getting the calls from the same retailers, that they're calling us, saying, \"What's available?\" I think they're going to really spend the next couple of months seeing what they think will line up and then call us up and say, \"We want to close and we have XYZ for you to help reduce their cost on the long term lease. So I think it's going to be a win-win for both of us going forward.","David B. Henry","For instance, even if they closed all 6 locations in 2014 that are expiring, it's less than 1\/10 of 1% though of average base rent. It's just de minimis in the overall picture of Kimco.","Operator","The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'd like to go back to the Safeway investment once more, but maybe from a different angle. You've made a lot of progress in the simplification of your business in the last couple of years, which is what your investors were -- clearly wanted. Can you help me understand or reconcile the recent Safeway investment with the simplification theme? I'm not questioning your ability to structure a sound financial investment, especially how well you've priced Safeway investment there, but really asking how you thought about balancing the perceptual risk of these kinds of maybe non-core investment versus your simplification goals.","Milton Cooper","That's a very good question. We have always had a basic real estate business, an A+ business, and the plus business we've had for many years on our track record has been superb. So we just see this as fitting in to the plus business, and what excites us about Safeway is that it is -- it's really part of the same consortium that did so well in the other plus businesses, Albertsons, et cetera. So in this we've had, former many, many years, it's not deviation from our simplification strategy.","Glenn G. Cohen","And in terms of the level of capital invested in the business, it's very minor compared to the mother ship, if you will, in our core portfolio. So it's an adjunct, it's synergistic with what we do. It helps with relationships with retailers and there's an opportunity to make a little money on retailer-owned real estate. And it gives us a lot of edge, and it helps to differentiate the company, quite frankly.","Conor C. Flynn","And it gives us a lot of insight on the operations level. It allows us to really understand the grocery business side. This is something that they own quite a bit of real estate just like the previous transactions, and we think there's future upside there for either purchasing and redeveloping or for future developments. So we like being partners with these types of operator because it gives us a ton of information that we normally wouldn't have available to us.","Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And could you remind us again your exposure to Safeway Albertsons? What percentage of your portfolio that represents?","Milton Cooper","Yes, it's 1.1% of ABR. Again, relatively small.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Schaffer of Sandler O'Neill.","Andrew Schaffer","Now that the New England portfolio has closed, can you remind us the upside embedded within this portfolio and how you plan on unlocking it?","Conor C. Flynn","Yes, we're pretty excited about the Boston portfolio. We've obviously been going through an arduous loan assumption process, and through that process, we actually were able to take over the leasing. And the previous management team, I would say, left a lot of meat on the bone. So during that loan assumption process, we were able to actually outperform our underwriting. A lot of tenants that we had anticipated staying flat instead of exercising their option, actually, exercised their option across-the-board. We've done a lot of new leases at above rents -- that -- above rents that we thought we could achieve. And that's just on the existing portfolio. We have a potential to add 6 or more pads to the portfolio, and we're in the market now looking for pad operators to come into the site. We've also got future redevelopment potential to add significant density especially in the urban markets where these assets are located. So we think that the early indicators are very positive. The cap rate has moved even since for when we put it on a contract to when closed, so that we've actually created significant value already. And we think that's just the tip of the iceberg.","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the timing of the dispositions that you see going throughout the year. And after 2014, what's implied for what should be hitting in 2015 as well?","David B. Henry","Well, Mike, I mean, the timing is a little tricky to say the least. It's tough to predict when these things will all close. The additional amount that we've targeted to sell during the year, we expect to close more towards the latter part of the year. So it really does not have a major impact on our 2014 guidance. So we'll have to see how it plays out, kind of refers to my comments that we'll give you a better picture as we go through the year on it. But we really ramped it up. And again, same thing with the Latin America sales, we're happy that we've closed the first piece, we've had a lot of thing in play and under contracts, the timing is a little tough to predict. So it's -- the Latin America stuff is really throughout the year. Yes, Mexico in particular is very tough to predict because you have the government's involved. They have to approve all of these transactions and there's actually been a change in the antitrust commission in Mexico. And -- so just like the FTC here on bigger deals, in Mexico, even on smaller deals, the government has to finally bless it, and that timing is very uncertain. For example, we have a hard contract on 4 assets right now, it's subject only to when the government finally approves that. So that could happen next week or it could be 2 months from now. So unfortunately, it's hard on Glenn because some of this stuff is variable.","Conor C. Flynn","I would just add that on the U.S. portfolio that we have in the market, we have seen bids come in higher on individual assets or sub-portfolios, so that, again, is tough to time because it's -- the whole portfolio, it's trading out at a certain point in time. The sub-portfolios might trade at different times.","Milton Cooper","Yes. I mean, I think the key takeaway, really, is we are accelerating it. So if you go back to our Investor Day, we kind of laid out plans over a 3 to 4-year period. We're now -- we really pushed a lot of it into '14, so the amount of dispositions, as we go forward '15, '16, I think are going to become a little bit more tempered.","David B. Henry","It still remains just a wonderful opportunity. The window is open, and we hope to take advantage of that.","Operator","The next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Jeremy Metz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jeremy Metz on, with Ross. Your lease commence kept winding out to about 250 basis points in Q1. Can you just talk about where you expect this to be later in the year and therefore, the impact that it can have on your same-store growth, which at 1.5%, started off in a little bit of a tough position versus guidance?","Conor C. Flynn","Sure. Currently, the spread between executed occupancy and rent flowing occupancy is, as you mentioned, close to 250 basis points. We actually think that, that's a future upside for us, and we think that a closer to 100 basis points, it's going to start flowing in Q2 and we see that there's larger redevelopment programs coming online in the second quarter as well as the rest of the year. I mean, half that we've been talking about for a while, which has been Nordstrom and DSW. Repositioning project, that's coming online later this year. At the Greenridge Plaza, out in Staten Island, we have an LA Fitness coming on later this year. Bass Pro in Alaska is coming on later this year. So we haven't changed our guidance same side NOI. Clearly, we were impacted by it. It was almost a perfect storm of snow, currency. So we obviously know that there's future growth is going to happen in the second half of the year. And that's what our budget actually -- our internal budget shows. So we feel pretty comfortable that we can perform and have some significant growth in the second half of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","If you could just go back to Sears. I remember in your Investor Day and some other conversations that a lot of upside in your portfolio does stem from these kind of older, historic leases from Sears or Office Depot leases. Is there some kind of concern that if Sears does go this route of actively re-leasing their own space, some of this upside is inherently kind of capped by them capturing the upside? And what kind of legal or lease language protections do you have in controlling who comes into that sublease space?","Conor C. Flynn","I mean, the Kmart leases are pretty open for them to sign or sublet them. However, I think the issue for them is there aren't a lot of 100,000 square foot to 120,000 square foot users out there. So they got to subdivide the box how many times they need to work with landlords to do that. So I think that the opportunities for them to take their -- the tenants they have and work with them to do a deal that's beneficial for Kimco on that. It's not like we -- they can really do a lot of deals without reaching out to landlords. So I think we'll be involved in the process. We are better suited. They have 1,000 stores. They can subdivide all of these stores themselves. They have the manpower do that. So they'll be working with landlords like Kimco on sites they want to sublet.","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes. All of the indicators show that they're not interested in becoming landlords. They're not interested in taking the headaches of the construction risk and they -- you have either sold or look to exit their leasehold positions. So we're continuing to work with them, we think there's significant upside embedded in our portfolio and a lot of the leases that we have left that we showcased in our Investor Day do not have any remaining options left. So there's really not a whole lot of term left for them to sublease to any retailer so we have some protection there where we have to be able to recapture it. So many times, they hand us the retailer that's interested in the space and we do a deal direct and have Kmart go away.","Ki Bin Kim - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But if they do sublease it, is there a way you guys partake in the economic upside or is that...?","David B. Henry","Well, it's not -- yes, we can definitely -- could be a big part of the economical deal. But you also have to understand is that literally come into leases where they are all under option periods. So they might have 8 5-year options but relative to the process, where you're doing a deal with a tenant, they want a 10-year lease with 2 5-year options, which might not match up with their lease, so that becomes a problem for them. So that problem is an opportunity to try to get involved in the deal and make the transaction that's beneficial for us.","Operator","The next question comes from David Harris of Imperial Capital.","David Bryan Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","After your South American and Central American sales, we're left with Canada as your non-dollar investment area. It's about 10% of the company on a number of metrics. I think -- have you given any consideration to hedging yourself against the effects of volatility at the loonie?","David B. Henry","We -- well, we are hedged in terms of investments in 2 respects. We have Canadian dollar mortgages on almost all of the properties and then the equity that we've invested in Canada has basically been through a Canadian dollar denominated unsecured bond from Kimco. So the investment itself is hedged, the only part of it that's not hedged is the FFO or the income that comes off at every year and for most years, we've been on the plus. This year, for the first time, we've been on the negative side of that. But again, in terms of the total scope of Kimco, it's not much. And the portfolio itself continues to perform very well.","Operator","Did that answer your question, Mr. Harris?","David Bryan Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Not entirely but I'm not sure I want to pursue it on the conference call.","David B. Henry","We can talk anytime, David.","David Bryan Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I don't know if you looked at the forecast -- most people's forecast for the expectations of where the Canadian dollar is going to go relative to the U.S. dollar over the next couple of years. My number is you're -- about 5% of your net assets are -- so it's actually about 10%, it's meaningful. You're not going to put currency mismatch but your Canadian exposure is not misaligned with your U.S. exposures we've seen with a number of others REITs that have mismanaged their at foreign exchange exposure. But I still think it potentially is a source for NAV and earnings vulnerability as we go forward.","David B. Henry","Again, we've done the very best we can to match the total investment against Canadian dollars. The income, you are right, it is at risk. But we don't think it's that material.","David Bryan Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Well, the NAV is also at risk.","David B. Henry","But remember, if the Canadian dollar weakens more, the Canadian dollars we're paying back in U.S. dollars also weakens. So I would respectfully disagree with that. The liabilities side also is matched to the asset side because we have Canadian dollar bonds and we have Canadian dollar mortgage.","David Bryan Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Yes. But you got more net asset exposure, gross asset exposure than your liabilities, so there is the net asset exposure here to changes in the FX.","David B. Henry","That's true.","David Bryan Harris - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","And at 10%, it's meaningful. I mean, if I'm right on my numbers -- let's say, just probably a discussion offline some time.","David B. Henry","Yes. We can take that offline, David. We got a few more people in the queue that we want to get to.","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities.","Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","David, I just wanted to dig in real quick on the new lease spread. The way you describe it, it sounds like it was more than just a single lease that was responsible for the significant bump. And while I recognize that the amount of your leasing volume is relatively small compared to the overall amount of volume you guys did, I just was kind of curious as to, sort of how you're thinking about that new lease environment and specifically, whether or not we are at the beginning of seeing potentially rent spikes of consequence that are broadly based in the portfolio?","Conor C. Flynn","I'll take the first part. I think the new lease population here, it's relative to our peers. It's actually quite large. We have 153 new leases signed in the quarter. So compare this on our peers, that's actually quite a large population. So we are, I think, actively working towards new leasing and see the pop in terms of where the rents are going. We have replaced some of the lower -- what we like to call the vintage leases. One of them was a below market out plot or pad lease. Some of the other larger deals that we do with TJ Maxx, Home Goods, Sports Authority. We were replacing it all, Kmart box, so yes, we've been able to harvest the upside in these new leases that are replacing some very below market leases.","David B. Henry","And I did want to highlight it in my comments because I do think it is the beginning of a spike in the market rents. Things are popping up nicely, driven by a shortage of a space available. When you combine that 35-year low of new construction with the 5-year high of planned new store openings, good things start to happen in terms of rents. So yes, we feel good about what's happening on the new lease and market rents.","Operator","The next question comes from Nathan Isbee with Stifel.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Conor, just going back to your comment about increased leasing to nail salons and other mom-and-pop service tenants, can you talk about how you're approaching the underwriting of these non-national tenants? And is there any change in how you're approaching it or it's just a function that you're not giving them any TIs and just, taking a flyer at them. And then, I guess, as an extension, how do you think about the mix in the -- in your centers between leasing to a more service-oriented, which might get more people to come in versus the national that could pay a higher rent?","Conor C. Flynn","Sure. It's a good question. We look at every small shop lease individually, and it really comes down to the tenant's financial strength. We look at in great detail on what assets are behind them. So we underwrite them appropriately to figure out what kind of TI payment we feel comfortable giving them. Many times, if it's a mom-and-pop tenant that is a first time user, we steer them to a space that's either previously built out for the same type of use. So the risk is to manage quite a bit, because most of the fixtures and the improvements are already in the space. So the cost to have them open and do business is relatively lower. That being said, there's -- we've had a wonderful track record of a mom-and-pop, especially the nail salons, the hair salons. They are tenants in our shopping centers that have done quite well and have been a good investment for Kimco and Kimco's shareholders. And when comparing and contrasting the service for our local users versus the national, it really comes down to the composition of the asset and the demographics that's surrounding asset. You've got to really put together a nice offering that differentiates yourself. You don't want to have the same type of user lined up or next to each other all the way down to little shops because it really doesn't add to the complexity or the offering that you're trying to give to the neighborhood. So you really just have to take a step back and look at a void analysis, what's missing in the market, what's currently in the shopping center, what's doing well in the shopping center, what's complimentary to the mix that's there and what you can do to actually enhance it. So that's really what we look at. It comes down to the individual tenant, when you're looking at the financial strength and then it comes down to the individual assets, the surrounding demographics when you're deciding on what's the highest and best use.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. I mean, clearly, there's some very fine nail salons out there. The one I use is great. But I mean, you can't argue, that was -- the mom-and-ops were clearly a source of weakness in the previous downturn, so?","Conor C. Flynn","That's true, that's true. And the dollars invested in the pure, local mom-and-pops are significantly lower than the national. So we do have a discount rate appropriate to the risk-taking on that small shop tenant. And most of the small shops that are hurt the hardest in the last downturn, wasn't really the nail salons or the hair salons. It was more of the specialty users that were offering something that couldn't compete with the online world and the big-box retailers that just got demolished when the downturn occurred.","David B. Henry","And I would add one comment. The community banking system is coming back and that's the source of capital for most of these small tenants. So you are the jewelry store looking for a second location, the dry cleaner looking for a second location, so that bodes well for us as well.","David F. Bujnicki","Andrew, we have time for one final question.","Operator","The last question will come from Linda Tsai, Barclays.","Linda Yu Tsai - Barclays Capital, Research Division","What percentage of your leases constitute vintage leases? And over the next few years, how much of an impact do you think this can have on the blended rent spread?","David F. Bujnicki","Linda, most of that was covered in our Investor Day, I do have that information, I'll be more than happy to share with you. At my fingertips, we don't have that right now but that's more than something I can give you immediately after the call.","Operator","Please go ahead.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Andrew. Thanks to everybody that participated on our call today. If you have some additional questions that you weren't able to get to on the call, I'll be more than happy to take them all day today.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Bujnicki, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead, sir.","David Bujnicki","Good morning and thank you for joining Kimco\u2019s Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call are Conor Flynn, Chief Executive Officer; Ross Cooper, President and Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, CFO; and Dave Jamieson, our Chief Operating Officer, as well as other members of our executive team, including Milton Cooper and Ray Edwards.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking. It is important to note that the Company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the Company\u2019s SEC filings that address such factors.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco\u2019s operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are also available on our website.","Before transitioning the call to Conor, I want to make you aware of an important upcoming change regarding the timing of our future earnings reporting. Beginning with our fourth quarter earnings, which will take place in February of next year, we plan to announce our results in the morning, a few hours ahead of the conference call. We believe that having the benefit of management\u2019s comments taken together with the reported results will provide a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of the Company\u2019s performance and enables us to mitigate any potential Reg FD risk.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone.","Today, I will provide an overview of our strong third quarter performance, update you on our progress for achieving our 2020 Vision strategy, and give additional color on our portfolio including an update on our assets in Puerto Rico. Ross will review our quarterly transaction activity and the general market environment. Finally, Glenn will provide details on key metrics and updates to our 2017 guidance.","In terms of key highlights. We singed 343 new leases, renewals and options this quarter, totaling 1.8 million square feet. Occupancy increased 30 basis points sequentially and the blended spread on new leases and renewals was a positive 16%. These results validate our ongoing thesis that open-air centers that focus on grocers, off-price, fitness, everyday goods and services continue to be solid investments and remain the backbone of our strategy to create the optimal portfolio and drive shareholder value.","But the retail landscaping is changing should not be a surprise to anyone. The history of retail from small vendors to specialty stores to department stores to big boxes is a history of winners and losers and the fight to win the consumer\u2019s solid. What is surprising today, however, is the speed in which these changes are occurring. Today, it\u2019s about millennials and their taste for experiential retail, services and convenience. They research with their smartphone, which has become the retailer\u2019s front door. Today, it\u2019s also about omnichannel environment which requires retailers and landlords to work together to combine e-commerce, and brick and mortar to attract shoppers and to keep up with their changing tastes. And that is why in this ever-evolving retail landscape our core principles of quality, growth and a strong balance sheet are more important now than ever.","Quality locations are where the retailers will always want to be, and the quality of our portfolio continues to improve. Since 2010, we have sold over $6 billion of real estate, recycling the proceeds into higher quality assets and reduce the size of our portfolio from over 900 to 508 assets. The result is a higher quality portfolio concentrated in the best markets in the United States. By focusing on high barrier to entry markets and executing on our unique customer strategy, we have become more efficient and are able to drive greater value-creation.","Quality drives growth, which is our second core principle. Creating multiple drivers of NOI growth from leasing, redevelopment and development has been at the heart of our operating strategy. The leasing results this quarter once again demonstrated that when all is said and done, the key to our business is leasing. Our pro rata occupancy now stands at 95.8%, making it one of the highest levels in our sector, and we continue to see opportunities to grow this metric.","Leasing is the most direct and important creator of value, whether it comes from filling vacancies, renewing existing tenants, preleasing our redevelopment and development projects or realizing our mark-to-market opportunities. One example of this is our ability to transform and reposition specific assets. Specifically, we signed new leases at strong leasing spread that included the recapture of three former Kmart boxes just this quarter alone.","Redevelopment and development continue to be a part of our long-term growth strategy. And this quarter, we achieved several critical milestones that will pave the way for our future success. On the redevelopment side, we have secured all approvals and cleared all contingencies for our Signature Series, Staten Island project, renamed, The Boulevard. A 460,000 center fostering a Towne Square environment, which we believe is emblematic of the future of retail real estate. Construction started recently at the Boulevard, which is already 71% preleased, anchored by a shop rent [ph] grocer, Marshalls [ph] and many other great national and regional and local retailers.","The tenant lineup, not only demonstrates the vibrancy of the market but also it significantly reduces the risk associated with major construction. And keep in mind, redevelopments like The Boulevard necessitate the demolition of existing stores and cause short-term impact to same-site NOI. Ultimately, however, the revitalization of irreplaceable assets like The Boulevard will create significant net asset value.","Separately, phase 1 of Grand Parkway in Houston is just about complete and the final anchor box in Phase 2 is now leased. The Boulevard and Grand Parkway represent just two examples of our robust pipeline of development and redevelopment opportunities.","Our third core principle is to maintain a well-positioned balance sheet that enables us to support our growth initiatives and let our shareholders sleep comfortably at night. Glenn and his team continuously seek opportunities to improve our already solid capital structure and healthy liquidity position. Specifically, they have successfully extended our debt maturity profile, judiciously tapped the preferred equity market, and refinanced existing mortgage debt at favorable terms. Furthermore, as our NOI growth accelerates, we expect our debt metrics will continue to improve.","Finally, let me take a moment to update you on our Puerto Rico portfolio. First and foremost, our employees on the island are safe and have performed herculean efforts in helping other team members, some of who have lost homes and in spearheading our cleanup and restoration efforts.","In particular, I would like to thank Victor Aguilar [ph] for leading our team in the face of enormous logistical, physical and emotional challenges. Conditions on the island are now improving. Fuel shortages are easing and grid power is gradually being restored. Fortunately, none of our seven assets sustained major structural damage. And comprehensive restoration plans are being implemented at each of our sites. Tenants continue to reopen, and many of our anchor tenants are now open for business.","In closing, our leasing volume continues at a record pace. Our occupancy is pushing toward all-time high and continues to validate the quality of our portfolio. Our pipeline of development and redevelopment projects is now starting to deliver. And our balance sheet remains the source of strength. Our team is determined to make our 2020 Vision a reality. I firmly believe that for Kimco, the best is yet to come.","And now, I will turn the call over to Ross.","Ross Cooper","Thank you, Conor. While the acquisition environment remains uber-competitive for infill shopping centers with upside and value-creation potential, we continue to pick our spots recycling the disposition proceeds from non-core properties into irreplaceable, Signature Series assets with the long-term redevelopment opportunities.","The third quarter was quite active as we enhanced the quality of our portfolio and strengthened the concentration of assets in our primary markets. During last quarter\u2019s call we announced the Jantzen Beach acquisition in Portland, Oregon, a dominant 67-acre center with substantially below market leases and both near and long-term prospects for value-creation and redevelopment.","We continue to mine our assets for growth and expansion opportunities and added adjacent parcels to several assets in the third quarter. We accretively acquired an unowned parcel Jantzen Beach in addition to boxes that are Webster Square asset in Nashua New Hampshire and Gateway Station in Burleson, Texas.","Subsequent to the end of Q3, we purchased Whittwood Town Center, a dominant West Coast asset. Whittwood is a 787,000 square foot grocery anchored property located on 54 acres in Whittier, California, a densely populated suburb of Los Angeles. It is anchored by Target, Vons Supermarket, Sears, J.C. Penney, Kohl\u2019s, 24 Hour Fitness and others. Our traction to the site includes irreplaceable real estate and impressive demographics. The substantial upside is what we envision for the future.","Collectively, the below market leases of Kohl\u2019s, J.C. Penney\u2019s and Sears have an aggregate mark-to-market spread of 560%. The anchor leases including Target average $3.01 per square foot versus a market rent in excess of $10 per square foot. The $123 million purchase price was funded with 1031 exchange proceeds and $43 million loan assumption of in place debt. With the addition of Whittwood, Kimco now owns 25 assets in Los Angeles, adding to the significant scale we have in this market and further leveraging our Southern California regional offices.","In terms of disposition activity, we remain on track, selling five non-core assets for $62 million at a mid-7% cap rate. This brings our sales total for the first nine months of 2017 to 21 shopping centers and three land parcels for a gross price of $331 million. We have another 19 assets, either under contract or with price agreement for a total of approximately $185 million, much of which we expect to close by year-end.","The market remains strong for our products, especially those properties with value-add components. This quarter, we sold an asset in Joplin, Missouri with a strong junior anchor line up and one box vacancy to a local buyer. We had seven offers for that center. We also now have price agreement for a power center in the secondary market of North Carolina with 14 offers for that asset. Bidders in the secondary markets have generally consisted of local buyers with private equity backing, private REITs and opportunity funds. Debt is still readily available for reputable sponsors at extremely attractive rates.","We remain confident in our ability to execute on our strategy of pruning the non-core asset from the portfolio. And given the current cost of capital, our expectation is that we will sell substantially more than we will acquire in 2018.","Glenn will now walk you through the financial results.","Glenn Cohen","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. We are happy to report positive third quarter results from our open-air shopping center portfolio as we continue to execute on all operating fronts. Leasing was strong, leading to increased occupancy, development and redevelopment projects continue to progress, and our balance sheet and liquidity position improved as a result of our capital markets activity.","For the third quarter, we reported NAREIT-defined FFO per diluted share of $0.39, which includes $0.03 per share of foreign currency gain on the substantial liquidation of our Canadian investments. Also included is a $0.02 per share charge attributable to the preferred stock redemption, prepayment of bonds, and some land impairments.","NAREIT-defined FFO per share for the third quarter last year was $0.18 per diluted share and included transactional expenses totaling $0.20 per share from the early repayment of debt and the deferred tax valuation resulting from the merger of our taxable REIT subsidiary into the REIT.","FFO as adjusted which excludes transactional increment expense and non-operating impairments was $161.3 million with $0.38, the same per share level as last year\u2019s third quarter. Our NOI increased $7.4 million compared to the same quarter last year and was offset primarily by lower tax benefit from our TRS merger last year.","During the quarter, we moved Phase 1 of our Grand Parkway development project into the operating real estate line as occupancy is approaching 90%. Grand Parkway provided $1.6 million of NOI during the third quarter.","It\u2019s important to keep in mind that we have over $360 million invested in development projects which are not earning today, thus impacting our FFO growth in the short-term. These development projects will begin slowing in stages in the latter half of 2018 and into 2019.","Our operating portfolio continues to deliver positive results. Same-site NOI growth was 3.1% for the third quarter and includes negative 20 basis points impact from redevelopments. For the nine months, same-site NOI growth was 1.7%. With no incremental contribution from redevelopments as we have started a similar number of new redevelopment projects to those that have been completed. The Boulevard redevelopment project, Conor mentioned, is an example of this.","Taking into account our year-to-date same-site NOI performance, we are revising our full year same-site NOI growth assumption to 1.5% to 2% from the previous 2% to 3% range. This is primarily due to the timing of contributions from redevelopment projects, the 320 basis-point spread between leases executed versus rent commencement, and the expected business interruption in the fourth quarter at our seven Puerto Rico assets due to Hurricane Maria. Although our insurance will cover the substantial portion of lost rent [ph] and physical damage, the timing of payment covering business interruption is not expected to be received in the fourth quarter.","It was a very active quarter on the balance sheet front. We issues $850 million in unsecured bonds, $500 million at 3.3% and $350 million at 4.45% with a weighted average life of 16.7 years. We completed the $206 million refinancing of the mortgage at our Tustin property with a new 13-year mortgage at a reduced rate of 4.15% versus 6.9% previously and issued $225 million of perpetual preferred stock at a coupon of 5 and 8. [Ph]","Proceeds from the bond and preferred offerings we used to redeem $225 million of 6% preferred, $211 million of our 4.3% bonds due in 2018 and to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. As a result of these transactions, our weighted average debt maturity now stands at 10.8 years, one of the longest in the REET industry. We have over $2 billion of immediate liquidity with less than $100 million of debt maturing in 2018. Our balance sheet and liquidity position are in excellent shape.","Let me spend a moment on 2017 guidance. Based on our nine-month results of NAREIT-defined FFO per diluted share of $1.17 and our FFO as adjusted per diluted share of $1.13, we are narrowing our guidance range for NAREIT-defined FFO to $1.55 to $1.56 per diluted share from the previous range of $1.53 to $1.57 per share. Similarly, we are narrowing our FFO as adjusted per diluted share guidance range to $1.51 to $1.52 from the previous range of $1.50 to $1.54.","We are pleased to announce that based on our 2017 performance and expectations for 2018, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the common stock quarterly cash dividend to $0.28 per share from $0.27, an increase of 3.7%. The increased dividend level represents a conservative and safe dividend payout ratio in the low 70s area and based on the current share price, the dividend yield of 6%.","We will provide 2018 guidance on our next earnings call. As a reminder, our initial 2018 NAREIT-defined guidance will not include any transactional income or expenses. Our NAREIT-defined FFO per share range and our FFO as adjusted per share range will be the same at the start of the year and will only differ upon completion of specifically identified transactional events.","And with that, we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions.","David Bujnicki","We are ready to move to the Q&A portion of the call. To make the Q&A more efficient, you may ask a question with one additional follow-up. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to rejoin the queue. Francesca, you can take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt","I was wondering, when I look at the total -- the GLA size of both Whittwood and the Jantzen Beach, I just wondered if there is a different way of underwriting these very large centers. Are there different opportunities you see here and what are the risks you consider when you make these purchases?","Ross Cooper","Yes. No, absolutely. We\u2019re underwriting several opportunities at both properties. And we really believe that the size of these assets gives us the ability to create substantial value. When you look at Jantzen, you have several undeveloped outparcels that are immediate near-term upside opportunities and then you have the below market leases there that give you the opportunity longer term. Both assets we think have very similar attributes and that longer term, we think that there is additional density that can be added.","At the Whittwood shopping center, we\u2019ve already started the process with the municipality of master planning the entire asset, and we began that process while we were going to the loan assumption process. So, given the size of the 54 acres in Los Angeles, the surrounding density and the initial positive reception that we\u2019ve had from the city, we think that that\u2019s a very viable strategy.","When you look at the anchors that we have at Whittwood, while we do have several large tenants there that will have to be moved around or replaced in time once we have that liquidity and the site, we think that it\u2019s prude in advance to really start that process, the master planning. And when you look at specifically Sears and J.C. Penny, those are opportunities that we think at the appropriate time that we can move forward with a negotiation and recapture of those spaces. So, we think that the size and the below-market leases and the tenants that we\u2019re dealing with, give a lot of upside opportunity.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And are you seeing the appetite increase from the big box junior anchor category or is it pretty much been where it\u2019s been from the past year?","Conor Flynn","On the big box demand side, it\u2019s definitely -- it\u2019s probably pretty consistent across the board. It\u2019s really the junior boxes with the off-price that are continuing to really thrive and want to expand the store count aggressively. That\u2019s where we see the most demand.","Operator","The next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Just in Puerto Rico, what percentage of your rents and recoveries are you not actually collecting today, and when would you expect business interruption proceeds to start to kick in? And then, just bigger picture, what\u2019s your view of the longer term impact of this event on sort of the retailing business in Puerto Rico and thinking about kind of the longer term viability of these centers as well as on the value of commercial property on the island?","Glenn Cohen","So, in terms of the rents, so [indiscernible] from Puerto Rico makes up about 3% of rents. So, it\u2019s about $32 million a year, $8 million for the fourth quarter. Our guess is, you might have 25% of that that might be at risk for collection as we still evaluate what\u2019s happening on the island. As Conor mentioned, tenants are opening, but again, small shop tenants are still evaluating and we\u2019ll have to see how and when that rent starts flowing again. So, we think there is a risk of couple of million dollars there. And that represents roughly a 100 basis points of same-site NOI for the fourth quarter, which would equate to about 25 basis points of same-site impact for the full year. We are still evaluating what\u2019s going to happen. In terms of the proceeds, you have to first put your claim in. Claims would probably start getting paid 60 days after those claims are in. But, we haven\u2019t filed any business interruption claims yet because we are still evaluating it. You need to get the full picture before you start putting the claims in. So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, I don\u2019t expect that will have claims paid to us really in the fourth quarter, will start recouping the business interruption part of it in 2018.","Christy McElroy","And then, just your longer term view on Puerto Rico and business there and real estate value?","Conor Flynn","I think Puerto Rico, longer term, they have a very manageable retail per capita when you look at the island. So, when you look at the rebound of hopefully the island\u2019s recovery, it really will tie back to how quickly they can get the grid back up and running, how quickly they can get services and really power to the entire island. Clearly, everybody has been seeing in the news and we have been working hard in getting our grocery stores and our home improvement anchors open as quickly as possible. But longer term, you are going to have to wait and see in terms of really what kind of impact it has on the population and really how many people move back after the island gets stabilized.","Ross Cooper","Again, keep in mind who the tenants are in our centers, which is important. It\u2019s really everyday goods and services, it\u2019s discounters, some Home Depots, some Kmarts. It\u2019s really everyday goods and services, which is what really drives the island.","Christy McElroy","Right. And then, just second question, Ross. You mentioned about selling substantially more in 2018 than you are buying. How do you think about executing on that from a tax efficiency perspective and would proceeds go more toward paying down debt or supplementing sort of free cash flow in funding the redevelopment expense?","Ross Cooper","Yes. I think it will be a combination of both. We haven\u2019t definitively finalized the exact capital plan, but the expectation is that we would probably look to acquire no more than $200 million next year and then sell certainly in excess of that. So, it will depend on which assets ultimately get solved in the basis for each one, but we are working very closely with our tax group to make sure that we manage that efficiently. But the expectation would certainly be to use that -- to delever as well as fund the rest of the business.","Conor Flynn","We have full ability to shelter the gains within our whole framework. So, it\u2019s not -- we\u2019re not required necessarily, have to do 1031 exchanges and buy more assets. We can absorb a pretty substantial amount of gains as we go through the year. That would change the composition of what our dividend will look like. You have probably a lot less return of capital and more capital gain component to it, but there is plenty of capacity for us to absorb gains.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeremy Metz of BMO. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","In terms of the reduced same-store NOI guidance, lease [ph] economic occupancy gap is one of items that seems to miss expectations here in state [ph] wider than you had anticipated. I am just wondering what your timing expectations are now as we hear today for this narrowing? And as we look at the 3Q number, obviously you seem to get a benefit on the expense side, I assume this is maybe a tax reversal. Was this anticipated when you held the range last quarter?","Glenn Cohen","Yes. I mean, we have some tax refunds that came through that were specific to us that helped drive that. And you also have -- you do have an increase in the NOI line in total from it, so revenue increase as well, so yes. But, when you look forward, again, we do expect as we go into 2018 that that 320 basis-point gap between economy and lease occupancy will start to shrink, and that is part of the driver. We have been doing a lot of leasing but we have also -- they have been matching up. So, we haven\u2019t shrunk that number. That number is growing; it was 200 basis points to spread this time last year, now it\u2019s 320.","Conor Flynn","The other piece to it, just to keep in mind, is obviously the hurricane had a pretty big impact on our Puerto Rico portfolio, which had a negative impact on our same-site NOI. So that\u2019s something that unforeseen and we continue to try and manage that.","Glenn Cohen","Yes. And then, when you think about also the guidance that 2% to 3% range that we had, if you break it down, redevelopments in the high end of the number and that 3% had 40 basis points in it. So, as we reported, right now redevelopments have had zero impact. We haven\u2019t earned anything from that. So that\u2019s at the high end, down by 40 basis points. You have as I mentioned, 25 basis points reduction from Puerto Rico that was not anticipated. There is about another 15 to 20 basis points that relates to the timing of the rent commencements. And then, on the high end, if you recall, our credit loss was 75 to 100 basis points. So, on the high end at the 3% level, we only had 75 basis points of credit loss in that number, and we are running closer to the 100 basis points. So, if you take a look at those components, you are going to reconcile down to how we got down to 2% for the year.","Conor Flynn","And just to add on The Boulevard and Staten Island, those entitlements that we secured had a bigger negative impact on pulling down the same-site NOI because we got it earlier than anticipated. So longer term, it\u2019s a big benefit but shorter term, clearly, the same site NOI is reduced a little bit.","Jeremy Metz","And then, switching gears to my second question here. The question for you, Conor, I don\u2019t if Ray is on the line with us, but can you talk about Albertsons a little bit, the recent filings for a sale leaseback, which I think was for about 70 properties and a little over $700 million? What this means in terms of your ability to monetize your position, could we see additional sales leasebacks going forward as the venture looks to take some chips off the table? Any color here would be great.","Ray Edwards","Sure. Hi. This is Ray. The sale leaseback was announced $720 million, which is supposed to close at the beginning of next week, the intention there is to delever the company. The company is looking at potential other smaller sale leasebacks, some other assets that they have -- some distribution centers that as they merge the company, they are becoming available as way to generate some proceeds, to pay down debt and help by delevering the company to make it more marketable company as we keep [indiscernible] and hope that markets change to have a public offering. So it\u2019s all focused on improving the balance sheet of the Company and so maybe focus on that as we drive the business.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ronald Kamdem","Hey, guys. This is Ronald Kamdem on for Richard Hill. I just had two quick questions. The first is just going back, can you just walk us through what drives the variability in lease compressions? Presumably, our understanding is that the contracts have a fixed start date. So, if you can just maybe just help us understand what instances can drive that variability that would be pretty helpful.","Dave Jamieson","Sure. Yes. This is Dave Jamieson. With anchored tenants and junior anchor boxes as they are going through the permitting process, there are tender dates and where we complete our work and we tender it over to this tenant. There is a permitting window that the tenants go through as well for their right to complete their box. Sometimes depending on the use and depending on what you are doing specifically to that box may add some additional time to that permitting process, which may delay their variability to open and impact the RCD [ph]. That said, it doesn\u2019t necessarily increase the cost on our side of the equation. But, those are some of the variables that set in. Sometimes, for example, you may have to go for a parking variance in which this city then you have work through that entitlement. So, those are couple of the components that can drive an impact the open date itself.","Ronald Kamdem","And then, my second question was, just so we understand the impact on Puerto Rico correctly. So, am I thinking about it right that presumably this should be a boost same-site as we are thinking about 2018 when you do get the business interruptions? Thank you.","Dave Jamieson","Yes. Short and sweet, yes. I mean, as soon as the business interruption claims commence, it\u2019s rent that\u2019s collected that we are not collecting now.","Glenn Cohen","Right. Remember, same-site NOI is on a cash basis.","Operator","The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","So, on Puerto Rico, the 25% of rent at risk, given that your properties are mostly up and running, at least that\u2019s what it sounds like. [Technical Difficulty] What was the cause of that? Is that tenants just decided to stop paying rent, is it damage, or is it the fact that maybe these smaller tenants, they don\u2019t have their own insurance, which is causing some of this?","Glenn Cohen","Well, you have few things. The larger anchored tenants have generators that are up and running, so that\u2019s how they are able to run their stores. The smaller shops, which is about half the rent that comes from all the tenants at the seven properties, a lot of them don\u2019t have generators, a lot of them are smaller -- small store businesses where quite candidly some of them lost their homes. So, we are still evaluating just how much of that is missing. So, we are trying to be realistic about what we have. We know half of our rents is coming from small shops base. So, we are making an estimate that some portion of that, as much as 50% of that could be potentially at risk during the fourth quarter. Now, again, most of it will be covered by business interruption insurance. But more importantly, we\u2019d like to get the tenants back open and running so that they can provide their goods and services to the communities.","Conor Flynn","Yes. And just to add some color to that, on the anchor boxes, they are all -- our largest boxes are open and operating. We have two Kmarts that are fully functioning, Sam\u2019s Clubs; we have two Home Depot, we have two Costco [ph] amongst our seven properties. The big guys are opening and they are obviously providing very necessary services during this restoration process. As it relates to the small shops, it does vary site-by-site. Three of our centers which have a substantial majority of those small shops already open and operating, but to Glenn\u2019s point, power itself is intermittent because it\u2019s based on generators and\/or if there is some restoration power to the grid, it does vary time-to-time as we know the conditions in Puerto Rico still remain very difficult. So, we will continue to see that improved, but for now, we want to take more cautious approach.","Ki Bin Kim","And a quick one here. Business insurance -- interruption insurance, does that cover for one year or is that for duration of the lease?","Glenn Cohen","Well, we have a blanketed policy. So, in total, we have coverage upto $39 million of business interruption. So, in theory, in Puerto Rico, you could lose every single tenant for the entire year and we would be covered.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just last question here on your same-store NOI guidance. If I look back at what it was originally and what it is today, for the fourth quarter with adjusted guidance it\u2019s probably about 1% you are saying maybe 50 a 100 basis points came from Puerto Rico. So maybe at the high end 2% but still feels like versus original guidance, which was probably the mid 3s or higher, feels like a pretty material drop off. I know you\u2019ve talked about couple of different items, I might have swung it. But, just curious, what was maybe unexpected change in leasing or timing of occupancy that led to the guidance decrease?","Glenn Cohen","Well, just go back a minute. The estimate that we have for Puerto Rico is that in the fourth quarter, it impacts you by about 100 basis points. Based on our forecast, we still have at the midpoint of our range that the fourth quarter would be 1.75% of same-site NOI growth. If you added Puerto Rico back, you\u2019d be at 2.75. And again, as I mentioned, you do have some impact from the timing of the rent commencement. So, if you put all that back to get it to a more original guidance, you\u2019d be in that 3% range, similar to where we were in the third quarter.","Conor Flynn","And the other piece of it is the island development, redevelopment that we announced that again, we secure entitlements that we could start the project, which has again a little bit of hit on the same-site NOI in the short term but longer term, it\u2019s a Signature Series asset that we are excited to get going on.","Operator","Next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O\u2019 Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Good morning. Two questions. First, obviously we\u2019ve been in a period of time for depressed cost capital, depressed stock prices. I understand that Whittier was a 1031 exchange, don\u2019t know if your dynamics would have changed, if you were to undertake that underwriting today versus when you originally did. But, as you guys talk about mixed use projects and different external investments, even if you are sourcing it from dispositions, where your stock is trading or now year decline in the stock prices? Does that at all affect how you guys think about the external side or is it independent because as long as you can fund it from dispositions you\u2019re agnostic?","Conor Flynn","Yeah. The short answer is yes. The cost of capital is definitely -- has an impact on our evaluation of future investment opportunities. When we look at Whittwood and Jantzen, those were deals that were both put under contracts early in the year, March and April. So, obviously, we had hoped that by this point of the year, cost of capital to be different than where it is today. So that being said, we are very excited about those two assets and we did utilize the dispositions to fund those. But on a go forward basis, the expectation is that without a substantial change in that cost of capital, our external investment will be significantly lower.","Alexander Goldfarb","And then, the second question is just again the classic -- I know, you guys aren\u2019t giving 2018 but still given the questions around same-store NOI, as we think about the next round of store closings, toys [ph] or pick your favorite one. How should we be thinking about 2018 as far as, because the re-leasing spread seems fine. So, it seems more like the risk is on store closings and timing to backfill. So, as you guys think about the same-store NOI construct, how much of it do you think is in that cushion part that would be affected by store closings? Is 100 basis points, is it more than that 150 for next year? What are your initial thoughts as you speak to the tenants today?","Glenn Cohen","First of all, we are still going through our own budget process and we are still evaluating where we think real potential risk is of store closures. We have been running this 75 to 100 basis-point look in terms of credit loss. So that\u2019s in those areas that we are evaluating. But I think overall when we look at the portfolio and where we are at the occupancy level and things that we see online, we do expect that same-site NOI growth will be higher next year than where we are today.","Conor Flynn","Yes, I think that\u2019s right. I mean, if you look at our portfolio, if you look at really the targets for next year and we do still have a very large spread between physical and economic occupancy. We do anticipate that the credit loss will be similar to this year. So, that is something that we will probably keep consistent next year.","Operator","The next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore ISI.","Samir Khanal","Dissimilar to what Jeremy had asked before on the lease which is occupied, but I know we have the rent commencements to the prior -- the Sports Authority box is to be a tailwind to growth next year. But just -- when you look at those rent commencements, I mean, when do the majority of those roll through? I know you had 20 boxes that have been leased up. At this point, are we talking -- is this more of a second half event for next year?","Dave Jamieson","For the one that we leased in the beginning of this year and towards the end of 2016 itself, you will start to see them flowing at the very end of this year and into the beginning part of 2018 as well. And so, from there, it will just gradually build and progress throughout the course of 2018.","Samir Khanal","And then, I guess, the next question for me is on the acquisition that you did with Whittwood. I know, there is some opportunity to release some of the department store boxes. But, I guess at this point, is this for a short-term event or is it more of a -- when do you expect to get those boxes back, how much term is left on those leases?","Ross Cooper","Yes. One of the anchor leases is within our 10-year hold that they expire with no further options. The other large anchors o have a little bit of further term anywhere from 16 to 20 years, in total. But I would assume that those tenants would be in place through the end of all their option periods. We have had some success with recapturing Sears, Kmart boxes in advance and they are typically pretty opportunistic about that, if they get economic deal that makes sense. So, our expectation is that by the time we really go through the master plan process and deal with the entitlements with the city that we will be in a position to approach those tenants if they\u2019re active at t he site in order to recapture sooner. So, we think it\u2019s a nice opportunity that gives us the occupancy and the income in the short-term, but when we are ready we\u2019ll approach them and we think there will be some respectability to that on the tenants\u2019 part.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao","I just want to go back to Puerto Rico here on the $32 million of NOI annually that\u2019s at risk. Does that include all income including ancillary income and any percentage rents you might be getting and are those two categories also covered by business interruption?","Glenn Cohen","Yes. So, it does include ancillary income; it does not include percentage rent. Percentage rent is just an additive component of that. As it relates to business interruption insurance, it would include that. If you have historic performance that identifies the type of income you would have received otherwise prior to an event, then you have a case in which you can claim business interruption insurance.","Vincent Chao","Okay. And then, just in terms of the small shop tenants that are struggling little bit more obviously, do you have sense at this point of how many of them might just simply close shop as opposed to trying to reopen? I mean, obviously, if they choose to leave, then obviously, I would assume that there is no business interruption in that case.","Conor Flynn","It\u2019s still too early to tell. I think that most of the small shops that\u2019s their livelihood and they are racing to try and to keep those stores back open as quickly as possible, and that\u2019s the response we\u2019ve heard from our team on the ground there that everybody is working as hard as possible to get their stores back open.","Vincent Chao","Okay. And maybe just one last one if I might, just on the Whittwood. Just looking at some disclosures from DDR there, it seems like this is sort of a low four cap going in. Is that more or less correct?","Conor Flynn","It\u2019s in the low 5s.","Vincent Chao","Low 5s?.","Conor Flynn","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Ryan Olsen [ph] of RBC. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Just one question now. What the same-store NOI with redevelopments that was lower than -- lower than what the [technical difficulty] developments. When do you expect that to reverse?","Conor Flynn","We should start to see some benefit during 2018. That\u2019s when -- we will put full guidance together and report on that in February with our call. But, I would expect that you are going to start seeing some benefit in 2018.","Unidentified Analyst","And it sounds like earlier first half, second half?","Conor Flynn","It\u2019s probably more towards the second half and then into 2019.","Glenn Cohen","We will know better once we finish up our budgeting process and we can report to you in February.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Mueller of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller","Just wanted to try to get a little more color on the term substantial that you used to talk about asset sales. And I understand that you don\u2019t want to put numbers around, it\u2019s still early, you\u2019re going through budgeting. But, I mean, you are a big company. And can you give us some sort of sense, is substantial, is it a couple of hundred million you are thinking, north of what you could acquire, is it a 1 billion, just how substantial are you thinking this could be for 2018?","Ross Cooper","Yes. It\u2019s still a little bit up in the air in terms of our definitive strategy. It does go in tandem with our budgeting process. So, we evaluate each asset in the portfolio and look at where the growth is coming from, where the risks are. So, it would be a little premature to give you definitive number. But, as I mentioned, if the expectation is that we will probably be targeting around 200 million of acquisitions, we think that it will be certainly in excess of that. At what magnitude, we\u2019re really not certain yet.","Operator","The next question is from Vince Tibone of Green Street. Please go ahead.","Vince Tibone","Hey, guys. You mentioned you captured a few Kmart boxes this quarter. Can you talk about your philosophy of paying to get boxes back early versus just waiting for the tenant to close? And then, also, is the cost of recapturing that box included in the TIs or landlord work on the re-leasing spread page of your supplemental?","Glenn Cohen","Sure. Just to clarify, the two that we have recaptured this quarter, those are natural lease expirations, no options expiring. So, we didn\u2019t pay anything to get those back. And within both of those, one was in actually in our island projects, so that\u2019s part of major redevelopment; the other one was in Los Angeles where we are currently splitting the box and adding in [indiscernible] as well for our Fairmont site, and then itself on the value creation component of splitting that box is part of our leasing cost number.","Vince Tibone","Okay, great. Thanks. And then, one more, can you quantify the exact drag on same-site from The Boulevard going forward for the next few quarters? And also, what incremental yield are you expecting to get on that project over your current in-place rent?","Glenn Cohen","So, in terms of the incremental yield for that, we are targeting anywhere from a 6% to 8% incremental yield on that and we are adding 100,000 square feet of retail as well. In terms of the same-site drag, have to report back to you on that one and we\u2019ll make sure to follow up with you.","Operator","The next question is from Linda Tsai of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Linda Tsai","Hi. In terms of the $62.5 million in dispositions, could you just give us more details about the four centers and then the mid 7 cap rate, is that reasonable level you expect going forward?","Conor Flynn","Yes. It is a combination when we look at our blend of 7.5. It\u2019s probably on average, somewhere in the low to mid 7s as we see the rest of the assets that we have currently under contract. It\u2019s really geographically the diverse. We sold one asset in Georgia, one asset in California. Several have grocery components; others are true power like the one in Joplin, Missouri. So, there really isn\u2019t a trend. It\u2019s just constantly evaluating the portfolio and pruning where we see risk or markets that we don\u2019t anticipate continuing to operate in long term.","Linda Tsai","Thanks. And then, just on Albertsons, for the 71 stores. Do you have any sense of what the cap rate was for those?","Ray Edwards","It was somewhere in the mid 6s. It\u2019s a broad spectrum of properties from California to Wyoming and Chicago.","Linda Tsai","And do you see that as representative of the overall portfolio?","Ray Edwards","Actually, it\u2019s on the cap rate wise, probably a high cap rate, because they really kept out most of the most valuable properties from the sale leaseback, the middle of the road properties and sale leaseback.","Operator","The next question is from Nick Yulico of UBS. Please go ahead.","Greg McGinniss","This is Greg McGinniss on for Nick. Just thinking about closing that occupancy gap you have, the redevelopment redelivering, no Puerto Rico impact, could we potentially be seeing same-store NOI in the 4% range next year?","Glenn Cohen","We are still running through our full budgets, but we\u2019re fairly comfortable that it will be higher than the current year.","Greg McGinniss","And then, with the dispositions, I know you\u2019ve commented a little bit on it but is there any thought as to how much FFO dilution you\u2019re willing to absorb?","Ross Cooper","Yes, it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s all part of our budgeting process and our capital planning. But, we will certainly take that into consideration when we finalize the number and put out our guidance in February.","Operator","The next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Michael Bilerman","Hey. It\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Christy. I was wondering if you can talk about sort of capital allocation in the sense match funding and whether you are going to have a different cadence going forward? And clearly, you have talked about going into contract on Jantzen and Whittwood early in the year. And given that assuming your deposits that you had and the relationship on the seller side, you didn\u2019t feel something you wanted to back away from or get out of. But, at the same time, it\u2019s hurting [ph] your balance sheet, while I know have done a great job of pushing that term and lowering the cost. Your debt to EBITDA has eased up half a turn over the last year. So, would you think about if -- putting your stock price aside, trying to make sure that maybe you fund potential acquisitions early so that you are not in this quandary of having to close on transactions when your cost of capital -- you wouldn\u2019t be doing these deals today, if they were presented to you, given where it is or you would see probably joint venture capital to do them? Can you talk a little bit sort of has this experience changed how you are going to approach external growth from a match funding perspective at the time you enter and go hard on the deal?","Conor Flynn","Yes. Absolutely, Michael, I think you raised good point that Ross has analyzed pretty deeply in his remarks. I think with our current cost of capital, we see ourselves being really -- the signal is clear that we should be a net seller next year and that\u2019s what we anticipate to do. Because of the loan assumption process on Whittwood, we obviously felt that when we put the project under contract versus where we are today, it was a different situation. Going forward, we do see that we want to make sure that we prioritize our balance sheet, prioritize our net debt EBITDA going forward. And that\u2019s why we will continue to probably sell more and really just focus on adjacent parcels in the next year that will probably lend itself to future redevelopment projects. But going forward, we do see ourselves being a net seller for next year where our current cost of capital sits.","Michael Bilerman","Can you help me understand a little bit, why you wouldn\u2019t have brought in institutional capital into the types of deals? [Technical Difficulty] willing pay these of cap rates for large power centers, especially given Glenn\u2019s comment about next year sales. Glenn said that there was plenty of room to absorb any gains without the need to do 1031 and just absorb it within the common dividend. So, I sort of struggle a little bit that one of the reasons here you\u2019ve been giving for these two big deals as well they were 1031s while you could have pushed more of your common dividend to capital gain [Technical Difficulty] and brought in a large institution to co-invest with you in these assets?","Conor Flynn","Yes, it\u2019s a good point. I mean, we look at our JV platform as one that we can tap into, when appropriate, and it maybe that time again in the near future. We looked at these assets as ones that again we thought were perfect fit for the quality of and upgrading the portfolio and continue to see that as these assets we think are really gems longer term as they lend themselves to West Lakes, we\u2019ve created a lot of NAV. But going forward to your point, I mean there is that opportunity; we really do respect and admire our JV partners and know that they want to do more with us. So, we do have that card to play and we will look at that going forward?","Michael Bilerman","Would cap rates be different, if you were too get on these assets today, they\u2019ve expanded 50 basis points since March and April?","Ross Cooper","I really don\u2019t believe so. Especially when you look at Whittwood, I mean the process that is being run by the sellers was one where we have a fantastic relationship with them, given our prior joint venture partnership and it was really a negotiated deal. And we think that it\u2019s one that was well negotiated on our part, clearly made sense for the seller as well but we think it was a good deal for both sides. And I think that had a mass market, a very similar price if not a more aggressive price could have been found in the marketplace.","Conor Flynn","We haven\u2019t really seen cap rates move at all for the really high-quality assets like Jantzen and Whittwood, it\u2019s a very competitive market for those types of deals with significant value creation opportunities in the best markets and that\u2019s really where we\u2019ve been focusing and picking our spots.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris Lucas","Glenn, a quick one for you. You took out more than half of the 6% preferred and there is still remaining. What\u2019s your plans for the remainder of that and why didn\u2019t you fully redeem out that $400 million preferred?","Glenn Cohen","At the right time, we\u2019ll redeem the balance of those 6% preferred. Again, we are trying to balance total look through of consolidated net-debt-to-EBITDA including it with preferreds. And when we went to the market, we went with a very aggressive rate, 5 and 8 [ph] rate was a pretty aggressive. So, we took out what we could get done at that point. I mean, we clearly got to the debt market and replace it at a lower rate but that\u2019s just going to put more pressure on consolidated net-debt-to-EBITDA. So, we will take it out at an opportunistic point.","Chris Lucas","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, just going back to the prior comments, as it relates to the disposition environment, I guess one question would be, what are the characteristics of the stuff that you are looking to put on the market for sale for next year and how is the market receptivity for those kinds of assets? You talked about high-quality assets still getting a pretty competitive bid but what about more middling or lower quality assets and what should be expecting in terms of the quality of the portfolio of properties that you are looking to dispose of next year?","Ross Cooper","Yes. As we have continued to call the portfolio, even the tier 2 asset that we look to dispose of are of a higher quality, generally speaking than previously. So, it will be a combination of assets where we continue to see longer term risk in the asset, even if there is stability today, trying to take a longer term approach on our portfolio management and seeing which assets we believe have a longer term opportunity to redevelop or create value or if the highest and best use is a stable retail center, then it may be the time to capitalize on the fact that there still is a viable market to exit these assets. So, the reception to these assets we have been marketing generally has been strong. I mentioned the two examples in Missouri and in North Carolina where we had 7 and 14 bids, respectively. So, I think for higher quality assets, particularly if there is some vacancy or perceived upside to the buyer, there is plenty of capital that\u2019s still excited about investing in that. And then, we will take a look at some of the higher quality assets that are flat longer term and see if it makes sense to monetize today.","Operator","Our final question is from Tammi Fique of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Tammi Fique","Hi. Now that a little time is left, have you had any new discussions with Whole Foods and has Amazon\u2019s involvement changed, their appetite for new stores or the redevelopment of existing stores?","Conor Flynn","Yes. We have been actively engaged in Whole Foods, obviously prior to the acquisition, we had all noticed I think it stalled a little bit, but they are very much on the expansion, looking for new opportunities to expand. In terms of how they utilize, Amazon will utilize the Whole Foods locations, they still keep things very close with us. So, it\u2019s yet to be seen. I think we all have opinions and there is a number of opportunities in which they could do it in the four walls. But, to our benefit, they are absolutely actively looking to expand in the market.","Tammi Fique","Okay, great. And then, my follow-up question is, understanding that you are sensitive to leverage level, but with additional asset sales expected next year, where do share repurchases rank versus sort of other uses of that capital.","Glenn Cohen","Well, again, share repurchases put pressure on leverage metric and debt to EBITDA. So first and foremost, we want to bring our leverage levels down to the targets that we planned for before you\u2019d start getting to share repurchases. Don\u2019t forget also, we still have a fairly significant redevelopment pipeline that has pretty significant yields to it, even where the implied price of the stock is today. So, we have uses of capital, but first and foremost is to bring leverage levels to the point where we want that.","Conor Flynn","I think the share buyback is constantly being discussed and at these levels, we need to make sure that our debt levels don\u2019t come under pressure, but we do see it as something we\u2019ll continue to monitor.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki, Vice President. Please go ahead.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Sue. Thank you, all, for joining Kimco's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning are Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Pappagallo, Chief Operating Officer; Glenn Cohen, Chief Financial Officer; as well as other key executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking statements. It is important to note that the company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","Finally, during the Q&A portion of the call, we request that you respect the limit of one question so that all of our callers have an opportunity to speak with management. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Henry.","David B. Henry","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report very solid first quarter results as well as continued progress on our key goals and objectives. As usual, Glenn and Mike will provide details and color and Milton will close with some general observations.","Perhaps due to the recovering housing market and record stock market highs and fund inflows, the consumer continues to spend despite the sequester and the ongoing fiscal stalemate in Washington. Retailer store opening plans have reached the 5-year high and, when coupled with virtually no new supply of retail space, effective rents are beginning to escalate in many geographic regions. Most industry analysts believe that retail development will remain limited for several more years, which bodes well for continued improvement in shopping center metrics including occupancy, same-site NOI and leasing spreads.","Looking at first quarter results. We are particularly happy with the same-site NOI growth of 4%, a 5-year high and our 12th straight quarter of positive same-site NOI growth. Leasing activity was also strong, with close to 700 new leases, renewals and exercise options and leasing spreads of 13.5% for new leases and 2.7% for renewals and options. Small store occupancy also continues to recover, with certain regions like the Northeast especially strong.","With respect to some of our key goals for 2013, the InTown sale remains on track for a late May, early June closing, following a lengthy loan assumption process. Yesterday, we also sold the New York City nonretail property for $7.3 million. And we have another New York nonretail property under firm contract for $38.5 million, which should close in June. In addition, we anticipate selling in the second quarter several of our large remaining nonretail properties in other geographic areas.","In Mexico, one of our joint ventures has executed a firm contract with closing subject only to Mexican government antitrust approval to sell 9 of our existing shopping centers for a gross price of approximately $271 million, representing a substantial gain to Kimco.","As mentioned on our last earnings call, the real estate capital markets in Mexico have surged and we are taking advantage of sharply higher prices to sell some of our assets. We anticipate additional sales if the markets remain strong.","In South America, regarding our portfolio of 15 properties, we have reached either a tentative agreement to sell our equity interest to local operating partners or we have retained third-party sales agents to market the properties. We expect disposition activities will be completed by year end with a modest aggregate gain. Our reasons for selling remain as discussed last quarter: lack of scale and expensive tax structures limiting our economic returns.","In the U.S., our joint venture with Blackstone to acquire the UBS Wealth Management - North American fund position in 39 high-quality shopping centers is scheduled to close over the next 30 to 60 days. We are also very pleased with the closing of the Cerberus-led SUPERVALU transaction, which reunited the Albertsons stores our venture already owns with the Albertsons stores formerly operated by SUPERVALU, while also purchasing 4 other supermarket branch: Acme, Jewel, Shaw's and Star Market. And making a direct investment in SUPERVALU in its post-closing operations including Save-A-Lot stores. We are pleased to note that our SUPERVALU shares have materially appreciated since the closing.","Other U.S. investment activities since the beginning of the year primarily involved opportunistic purchases of joint venture equity interest from 5 different institutional partners, totaling $53 million. As Milton has mentioned, our third-party asset management portfolio, totaling roughly $10 billion, remains an excellent reservoir of off-market opportunities to acquire full interest and control of high-quality retail properties.","During the quarter, we also acquired the second phase of our large grocery Anchorage shopping center complex in the high income community of Wilton, Connecticut. Owning both bases of the property provides us with maximum flexibility to renovate and expand the property. We also remain committed to upgrading our property portfolio and transitioning towards larger properties in more densely-populated Kimco core markets, where we expect superior job growth and higher retailer productivity and rent.","Our scorecard, since the fall of 2010, consists of the disposition of 112 properties totaling $854 million and the acquisition of 64 properties totaling roughly $1.5 billion. The market continues to improve for B properties and secondary markets and we expect to close numerous additional sales over the balance of the year.","Finally, and given its importance to our tenants in the shopping center industry, I would like to comment on the Main Street Fairness legislation. After passing 2 test votes, the Senate has scheduled a final vote on the legislation for Monday at 5:30 p.m. Unlike the cloture vote, which required 60 votes to advance the Main Street Fairness bill, Monday's vote requires 51 votes to pass the Senate and move on to the house. We are cautiously optimistic but, again, respectfully request the kind word of support from anyone who has a direct relationship with a U.S. Senator. Putting our retail tenants on an equal footing with e-commerce retailers is simply long overdue.","Now I would like to turn to Glenn to discuss the financial results to be followed by Mike and Milton.","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, thanks, Dave, and good morning. We are very pleased to have 2013 start off the same way 2012 ended, on very positive footing. Our first quarter results are a clear product of the execution of our business strategy, focused on improving metrics at the property operating level, further recycling of capital to acquire up quality assets and maintaining a strong balance sheet with plenty of immediate liquidity.","Let me provide some color on the first quarter results. As we reported last night, FFO as adjusted per share came in at $0.32 as compared to $0.31 for the same quarter last year, in line with our expectations. FFO as adjusted excludes $5.2 million of transaction income, primarily from a disposition of a nonretail preferred equity position and $2.5 million of transaction costs primarily related to the acquisition activity. As a result, our headline FFO per share came in at $0.33 per share versus $0.31 per share last year. The operating team kicked off the year with above-plan results. We delivered combined same-property, net operating income growth of 4%, including a positive 20 basis point impact from currency. Our U.S. same-property NOI growth was 3.7%. This is our highest quarterly increase in same-site NOI in over 5 years, fueled by an improving economic environment and the upgrading of the portfolio.","In addition, we continue to see positive results on the leasing front, evidenced by the strong leasing spreads delivered. Although U.S. occupancy was modestly lower by 20 basis points from year end, the result of the typical flow out of the holiday season, occupancy remained at a solid level of 93.7%, 90 basis points higher than a year-ago.","We spent a good portion of the first quarter teeing up transactions as we continue to pursue capital recycling. We expect to conclude the InTown Suites sales during the second quarter, netting proceeds to us of approximately $90 million. The impact of this anticipated sale has already been incorporated into our guidance range. We have other nonretail dispositions in the works and expect that by the end of 2013, the nonretail asset discussion should be a thing of the past.","We have continued to work the retail shopping center portfolio as well, signing contracts for the sale of 14 properties for an aggregate sale price of, approximately, $111 million. And as Dave mentioned, our contract for the sale of our interest in 9 assets in Mexico, which is expected to yield proceeds of $94 million in the substantial non-FFO gain. Proceeds from these sales, totaling close to $300 million, are anticipated to be used to reduce debt and acquire assets in our key target markets.","As you know, another of our stated objectives has been to further simplify the business model. To that end, we have acquired the remaining interest in 4 more properties in our key target markets from our various joint venture partners and increased our ownership percentage in another JV program. We expect to continue to explore opportunities to acquire properties from the joint venture programs over time.","On the capital front, we have made a significant progress on the refinancing of maturing debt both on the consolidated balance sheet and in the joint venture programs. We refinanced our 8.58% $1 billion peso facility to approximately USD 80 million, with a new 5-year floating rate peso facility at a spread of 135 basis points over the Mexican 28-day rate, which today equates to an annual rate of, approximately, 5.7%. This loan is prepayable without penalty at any time, giving us plenty of flexibility.","In addition, we paid off a $100 million 6.125% bond, leaving us with just $175 million of U.S. bonds maturing this year and a CAD 200 million bond which matures in August, which we expect to refinance in the Canadian bond market later this year.","On the nonrequest mortgage front, we have closed 6 transactions and have executed term sheets on 9 more deals, totaling over $513 million. The weighted average interest rate savings is approximately 170 basis points compared to the debt being replaced. Our liquidity position is strong, with over $1.2 billion of immediate availability.","As a result of the positive operating performance delivered for the first quarter, we are increasing our same-site NOI growth expectations by 25 basis points, bringing it to a growth range of 2.75% to 3.75%. In addition, we are increasing the lower end of the 2013 guidance to $1.29, bringing the FFO per share as adjusted guidance range to $1.29 to $1.33. At the midpoint of the $1.31 per share, this represents a 4% growth rate compared to 2012 and, as I mentioned, incorporates the sale and impact of InTown.","Please keep in mind that our guidance range does not include transaction income or expenses.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for a more in-depth look at the shopping center portfolio.","Michael V. Pappagallo","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning. The first quarter portfolio performance reflects the combination of solid market fundamentals in our sector but also the specific actions we've taken over the past couple of years through recycling of the portfolio and investments made to create value in our core asset base.","The U.S. same-site gross number of 3.7% was driven essentially by growth in minimum rents as leases signed over the past year began to hit the books as our tenants opened for business, as well as improved overall credit loss across the portfolio. The occupancy levels, in total, were 70 basis points higher than a year ago and 90 basis points in the U.S. That movement reflects the combination of positive absorption, the aggressive disposition of underperforming assets and selected acquisition activity. On a U.S. same-site basis, the occupancy rose 30 basis points with the balance being the effect of the acquisition and disposition activity.","As Glenn stated, we saw a marginal decline in the leased occupancy since December of 20 basis points, a similar first quarter pattern over the past few years. I would note that, for the space under 10,000 square feet, half of the fallout was due, not from mom and pops, but the closure of 9 Fashion Bug stores as a consequence of Ascena Group's acquisition of their parent company and decision to shut down that chain.","Overall, small shop trends continue to improve, albeit slowly. We're encouraged that the new deal spread, even for the smallest spaces between 0 to 5,000 square feet, has turned positive this past quarter. Overall, the new leasing spread again posted double digits and renewals and options also remained sturdy with the overall 3.8% increase. With overall leasing spreads positive for 7 straight quarters, it's apparent that we're in a self-sustaining recovery in rental rates.","All of these metrics reinforce a much more favorable leasing and operating environment. That isn't new news for the best properties and best markets, yet where I'm more encouraged is the pickup in action for assets that have had little since the slower emergence from the days of the financial crisis. And one example is our center in Anchorage, Alaska, one of the last developments from our former merchant building program. We secured a Bass Pro Shops lease for a new 75,000 square-foot store that will scrape and replace over 58,000 square feet of existing vacancies.","Retailer demand continues to be strong and is now advancing for opportunities to come out of the ground with new projects. While Dave points out that new retails development will remain limited by historical standards, we do have a couple of opportunities that seem to be coming together. One a Phase 2 land of a property we built in Boise, Idaho years ago; and another at a prime location in Christiana, Delaware near the mall. Things aren't fully baked but are getting there. And I offer this examples simply to indicate that well-positioned real estate in established retail corridors is getting the attention of retailers as in-place inventory is filling up.","That said, the focus continues to be what we can do at existing properties in terms of redevelopment and expansions and investments there still yield the highest relative return. One other type of investment we're making is strengthening the operational backbone of the business and thinking creatively about the future. Some of the initiatives are described on our website, including the energy management and sustainably programs and leasing programs, such as the KEYS and a fast-track finance program, as well as social media outreach. But we've drilled it down even further. And we're thinking how we approach the management of properties and tenants with new standards for property visits and capital planning, tenant communication practices and better internal coordination. We're also piloting a Wi-Fi deployment and data analytics that will support tenant strategies and enhance our prospecting tactics at certain of our larger centers.","Lastly, as Dave reported, much of acquisition activity in the first quarter involved either partner buyouts or the purchase of adjacent GLA of existing shopping centers. In effect, investing with a much lower degree of risk due to our knowledge -- in-place knowledge of the asset. And while it may appear that we took a breather on the disposition side, we have closed 2 property sales since the end of March. And between the 14 others under contract and 4 accepted offers, we also have an additional 22 in the market today.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton.","Milton Cooper","Well, thanks, Mike. I would like to comment on several distinguishing Kimco attributes to wit: size, tenant mix and geographic diversity. These attributes provide downside protection and upside opportunities. We are a national company with a national platform. We are the largest landlord to Home Depot, Target, Costco, Walgreens, TJX Companies, just to name a few. With such a large number of leases, retailers are inclined to review our portfolio to possible expansion opportunities and work closely with us. Through our geographic diversity, the bulk of our revenues come from locations at the top 30 MSAs in the country which have strong demographics. Our national platform also helps us underwrite transactions in any part of the nation. As a result, we are a valued real estate partner in the SUPERVALU transactions and other ventures because of our ability to evaluate assets quickly throughout the country.","I continue to be optimistic for our SUPERVALU investment and feel confident that the management team can replicate the remarkable success of our original Albertsons investments.","And now I'd like to comment on cap rates. There's a wonderful blog entitled, \"Look Ma, No Inflation\" by that REIT seer, Ralph Block. Ralph postulates that gold, silver, oil and other commodities are selling far below the February 2012 peak. Future inflation is likely to be in the 1% to 2% range rather than 2% to 3%. And if inflation declines by 1%, cap rates should similarly decline by 1%. And the softening in prices should help the consumer and certainly help retail real estate. Now what defines quality real estate? My definition of quality real estate is real estate that has a safe, sustainable, growing cash flow over an extended period of time in good markets. With the 12 straight quarters of positive same-store NOI growth, improving leasing spreads and occupancy levels, our portfolio has outstanding quality and should warrant low cap rates.","As I've said before, I believe the REIT is nothing more than a common stock that must comply with certain tax requirements. And in evaluating common stock, the most important metric is management, management, management. And management must understand the importance of maintaining a balance sheet that always has access to capital. And through our improved fixed charge coverage, net debt-to-EBITDA level, strong liquidity position, we have accessed debt and preferred stock at reduced costs. Secondly, we have to be fast on our feet-work to seize opportunities. And this has always been part of our DNA. And third, to continue to strive to be a low-cost provider. We treat the shareholders' money as though it were our own. And I believe our culture continues to meet all of these fundamental tenets. We're gratified by the first quarter results and feel confident that we can continue to create value for our shareholders. And my thanks go to a superb team of associates.","And with that, we welcome any questions.","David F. Bujnicki","Sue, we're ready to move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy of UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the comments about the more frequent buying in of joint venture interest in properties. Is this an active strategy where you're sort of approaching your partners to communicate that you're a willing buyer for the right properties and the right price? Or will we just continue to see someone one-off occasional, opportunistic purchases? I'm just kind of looking for some color on how aggressively you're pursuing these purchases.","David B. Henry","Christy, we are trying to be proactive. And as we've noted before, over time, management changes, strategies change of our institutional partners and many have expressed their willingness to reduce their investment in some of these joint ventures. For us, it's an off-market, opportunistic opportunity for us and there's a win-win in many of these transactions. We manage these portfolios now, so we know them very well. And an opportunity to do a purchase on a negotiated basis is a wonderful thing for us and it simplifies our platform.","Operator","Our next question comes from Quentin Velleley of the Citi.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just on your relationship with Blackstone, they purchased Valad and you had advised them on the Centro deal and, obviously, they had just recently purchased the UBS stake. There's been media speculations on discussions that you had for purchase of the Brixmor portfolio earlier this year. Can you maybe comment on that speculation?","David B. Henry","Well, I loved Milton's response to the Wall Street Journal reporter, where he said we talk to lots of people. And, in fact, there are not many retail REITs we haven't talked to over the years. And that's about all we want to say right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","With SUPERVALU done, could you talk a little bit more about the transaction and kind of how you expect your role to play out near term? And kind of whether maybe contrast it with the Albertsons experience? And kind of maybe what your role near-term versus kind of a longer-term perspective will be?","Milton Cooper","Well, the SUPERVALU transaction is very exciting to me. I'll just take a moment, Paul. There are 2 pieces of real estate, just as an example, that SUPERVALU has. One is a Star Market in Boston on Boston Street. By the way, that Star Market stayed open all night to serve food and refreshments to those injured in the Boston Marathon. That site in Boston, a successful store, but there were offers in excess of $25 million by people who want to build a high-rise apartment house. A second illustration is a Jewel store in Chicago in the Gulf Coast. And there is a huge multi-use retail office and apartment complex planned. So there is a business that's turning around that has been more abundant and some of the results were very encouraging with, I think, increases in the meat department, Ray is with me...","Michael V. Pappagallo","Yes, 18% in certain stores just by improving the meat department and bringing people in.","Milton Cooper","So that I feel very excited about what the ultimate result is. And as I said, I feel we can replicate the fantastic result we had in monetizing Albertsons.","David B. Henry","And I would just point out. That of the 900 stores that we acquired under these 5 banners, 45% are either owned or long-term ground leases. So it is real estate rich from an owner's perspective.","Michael V. Pappagallo","I mean, I just -- also, one thing I'd point out is we have 26 locations: 19 under the Albertsons, Jewel banner and then 7 or 8 of that are SUPERVALU. That we think are going to directly benefit from the new ownership and the operations. So our 26 shopping centers directly will benefit in our -- and have a better credit and the tenants do better in those locations.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you monetize the real estate, while at the same time trying to optimize the recovery in the brand? I imagine a lot of those stores are also some of the most productive. To what extent can you be aggressive on the real estate at the same time as...","David B. Henry","Well, I think what happened in '06's acquisition was it wasn't until '09 and 2010 that we monetized it. And the reasoning was we wanted to prove the case out in how we are going to increase the value of the stores. Because as the operations improve, the ability to monetize that real estate increases dramatically. So at this point, they're just focused from the company to improve the operations right now.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess this is a question for Mike. The leasing activity and the spreads at Kimco seem to be peaking at a time that's later than a lot of your peers. Is there any thought on why that is?","Michael V. Pappagallo","Craig, it's tough for me to marry it up against other -- our peers in trying to do a relative analysis. But from our perspective, we -- our spreads are very often driven by the larger locations or available spaces that are substantial REIT below market. And what we are finding is that in the natural rolled -- rollover of leases that we are -- seem to be finding an increasing number of opportunities where we are capturing below-market rents in our process. So I don't know if it's necessarily peaking, but we are continuing to see, to some degree, an acceleration of these recaptures of below-market rents. And that, I think, in turn, reflects that fact that the retailer demand is increasing. There is more opportunity for us to rollover very positive rates.","David B. Henry","And Craig, one other point. We have over 1,000 leases, where the contract rents were entered into over 20 years ago. That's a built-in natural base to increases over time.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","There's something to be said for age?","David B. Henry","Not much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","This is a question for Dave. Dave, you've been pretty vocal for quite some time on the Internet sales tax. And while it certainly make sense for large retailers, the Amazons of the world and folks like that, when you think about it, whether the future of retail is incubating new concepts, whether they open up as a temp tenant or perhaps start online and then grow and then, hopefully, take space in one of your centers. Why would the bar be set so low, at $1 million, versus a $10 million threshold just given the complexity of dealing with -- complying with all the various tax jurisdictions across the country, whereas a local operator in one of your centers doesn't need to compete for that. Wouldn't you guys want to promote more incubation of more retailers that, ultimately, do cross the threshold, have to pay tax and move into one of your centers?","David B. Henry","Let me challenge the assumption that the benefit of this would be mainly the national retailers. The small mom and pops have been absolutely devastated by competition from e-commerce. You'll see it in the occupancy statistics of all of us public retailers REITs, our vacancy factors are much higher in small stores. And that's directly the result of e-commerce competition. As an example, for instance, if you are a small jewelry store and somebody comes in and prices an engagement ring and you have to charge the sales tax and, meanwhile, they get the color, the carat, all of the quality stuff and go dial up Blue Nile and they can save literally hundreds of dollars. And it's another cut to that local jewelry store. I can't tell you how many local small businesses have been impacted by both this concept of showrooming, where people come in, for instance, a children's footwear store, where mothers will ask the clerks to measure the shoe sizes of their children and then look at the merchandise and write down serial numbers. And then leave and go order it from Groupon or one of these other e-commerce things to avoid paying the tax. ICSC has statistics about shoppers, when they go online, if that Internet retailer is beginning to charge sales tax for whatever reason, they will shift to another. And so it is very important to the local stores. The startups will do just fine. And the -- our local tenants would love to have $1 million exemption on the first million dollars they sell. I think it's, quite frankly, too high, but it's a compromise in terms of the legislation to get it done.","Alexander David Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. But the -- I mean, the Groupons the Zappos, those guys are already big enough that they would have to pay the sales tax. I'm thinking about a small start-up selling whatever wears. For them, it is costly. That's why the millions seems very low, $10 million seems a bit more appropriate, so...","David B. Henry","It's not that costly. As part of the legislation, software will be made available for these people to very easily do it. Amazon already offers a service to collect the sales tax for Internet e-commerce guys. So it's just making a level playing field. Why should an Internet seller located in some other place that's selling to a state that collects sales tax not have to pay that sales tax on the residents who purchase it? Remember, this isn't a new tax. They are already obligated to pay a use tax, the purchaser. So it's just that nobody pays it. So there's an obvious advantage. So yes, we feel very strongly about it. All of us, retail landlords, feel very strongly. And if you think I feel strongly about it, call up Mr. Simon. It's just long overdue.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question on the development commentary about the supply thing. Well -- but also trying to tie that back to sort of the comments about the retailers opening stores at a faster pace than in quite a while. And also the improving B market. I mean, from all those comments, can we just reasonably assume that retailers would prefer to move into a B quality asset or a secondary market at this point versus paying up for development in maybe a better market?","David B. Henry","I'd still -- I personally believe that is the case. Because many retailers were hurt with these development projects in the last recession, that were partially built, bankruptcies, foreclosures, that they weren't able to deliver the projects on time. And this time around, retailers simply don't want to wait several years while these projects get entitled, arrange for construction financing, do preleasing. And rents have not returned to the previous levels necessary to make the economics work that well. So I still believe it's going to be quite a few years before you will see any kind of significant ramp up of activity. And the retailers are looking for space that either retailers are struggling with and are willing to give back or, perhaps, a secondary location just to get open right away and meet their store count right way.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like it's more of a speed kind of issue. And, obviously, they had some history with the development projects, but speed-wise, that's just meeting their needs more. I mean, because, obviously, you have another set of risks associated with secondary and B class properties, different from development risk. But so it sounds like they're still preferring that. Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from Samit Parikh of ISI.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to reference back to something you said earlier, the 1,000 leases that are very low rents with upside. Can you quantify sort of what percentage of your ABR those 1,000 leases represent?","Glenn G. Cohen","Don't have the answer at our fingertips, Samit, but we can certainly get back to you with that.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can I get one more in, then?","Glenn G. Cohen","Absolutely.","David B. Henry","Yes. I think we already get granular on these calls, right? Go ahead.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Glenn, just a question for you on the financing. What's your -- how are you -- are you leaning towards, at all, sort of calling some of your bonds that are maturing later this year and early next year that -- where you can probably issue a new tenure at -- on a low mid-3s? And looks like you guys don't really have any maturities in the corporate bond area beyond 2019.","Glenn G. Cohen","I don't see us calling our bonds. I mean, again, the make holds and yield maintenance that go with them, it's very, very expensive. It's real cash that's got to come out of our pockets. And if you look at our overall coupons, outside of the bond that we issued in 2010, we don't have a coupon that's got more than a 4 or 5 handle on it. So I think we're going to take it out as they come. As I mentioned, we have $175 million of bonds that mature this year. We have a lot of activities that we've all talked about in the pipeline in terms of disposition. We want to let the capital plan come together a little bit more of a -- have a better feel over the next 90 days or so. And then we'll make determinations about when and if to tap into the U.S. bond market.","Operator","The next question comes from Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","I'll try a multi-part question on Mexico. In regards to your disposition that you just completed, could you share with us if you explore or if you have explored a public exit over all Mexico? What was the cap rate on this transaction that you just completed and -- I'll start with these 2.","David B. Henry","Yes, a multiple-part question. Well, let me take the second one first. The cap rate was a 7%, 9% on actual 2012 NOI. So that's one aspect. As we looked at what's going on in Mexico and as we mentioned on the last quarter, the surge of capital market activity and the increasing value of our real estate has generated a number of discussions here. We did look at maybe joining the crowd in terms of taking our platform public. But as you know, we are not an operator in Mexico. We are an investor, if you will. We have multiple operating partners. And so we feel the best execution, to the extent that prices stay this high, is to sell into these public companies or people that want to become public. So it's just an excellent window of opportunity for us if the markets continue this strong.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And are your partners potential buyers of your assets?","David B. Henry","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just to follow up for a second on Mexico. You've obviously chosen the course for how you want to monetize these assets. Does this particular buyer that you are selling the 9 assets to, is that buyer a potential buyer for more assets? Or was that sort of a group in the portfolio that was picked maybe out of the total of 52 by these guys?","David B. Henry","They are an active opportunity for other purchases.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, Dave, does it -- one of the things I'm curious about. Does it make it hard to get rid of the entire Mexican investment if you piecemeal it sort of, I mean, this guy picked 9 interesting projects, but that leaves you with maybe 43, I think, if my memory serves me. And then maybe somebody else picks some others. I mean, does it make it hard to get out of everything if you don't just do this sort of maybe more all at once?","David B. Henry","No. It's working just fine. And the level of interest is quite amazing. And once this deal closes, we can give you more color on who the buyer is and who our operating partners are that joined us in the sale here. So but the answer to your question is no. We have an opportunity to sell in whole or in part to multiple interested buyers.","I'd like to -- if I could just interject a previous question about how many leases, the 1,000 leases over 20 years in age. It's about 14% of the gross annualized base rents that we disclosed.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christy McElroy of UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Ross Nussbaum here with Christy. Dave, a question on the Latin America asset sales. You referenced the lack of scale and the expensive tax structure as some of the reasons why you're looking to dispose. And, I guess, the question I have is, weren't the tax structures known going in? So, I guess, what changed with respect to your understanding of the tax structures that would have motivated the sale? And the second part is, how did the tax structures that you had in Latin America differ from what you have up in Canada? And why isn't that an issue up in Canada?","David B. Henry","Okay. First of all, Latin America is 2 parts. South America is what we've referenced in terms of the reason we're going home as we don't have scale and the taxes are tricky and expensive. And quite frankly, the development returns are not as high as originally projected. So the rents have come down a bit. The costs to develop have not. And the taxes are quite significant. If you take a country like Peru, it's about 29% on the actual gross revenues after expenses. So it makes your return. So if you thought you were developing towards 13, you're really developing to a 10 or a 9. And then you take the country risk on top of that and the currency risk and so forth. So it's just, we couldn't ramp up because the risk reward wasn't there. And we don't have scale. And so we decided to really focus on other aspects. Mexico does not have that same level of tax issues. And it's much more comparable to Canada, where we pay very little in terms of tax on current income. There is a capital gains tax on the way out that's quite substantial in Canada, a little less so in Mexico. But, again, the returns in Mexico have certainly justified that -- or the after-tax returns have justified the investment in Mexico, whereas South America, they did not.","Operator","The next question comes from Quentin Velleley of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, it's Michael Bilerman. Mike, so that 15% of those leases 20 years and older, what's sort of the mark-to-market, then, if we were to look at that 15% of NOI and you were to mark them to market, how much upside, or how much NOI upside would there be?","Michael V. Pappagallo","The -- it's a pretty wide range. But what I'd suggest is if recent history is a guide and I recognize it's 40% of rents and there is going to be -- there are generally renewal options in many of these longer-term leases. But we would suspect that these larger longer-term deals have anywhere from, say, 10% to 30% uplift on the existing load and maturing base rent. That's what we've been experiencing in the last 2 or 3 years as these older lease rates roll off and we put new tenants in there. So the question for us, or the challenge for us, isn't so much the uplift. It's regaining, recapturing the space and gaining liquidity. Sometimes bankruptcies and early terminations, paying off the existing tenant to get the new tenant in is one strategy. Other times, it's sitting and waiting. Other times, it's of a particular tenant [indiscernible] wants to downsize because of a strategic change in their business has also an opportunity. So these are the -- those are the primary drivers or primary things that cause us to capture these below-market rents earlier than their contractual maturity.","David B. Henry","Michael, just as one small illustration. We have 100,000-foot lease at probably $2 of rent in Staten Island, expires in 2017. We will get probably $2 million a year on that instead of a couple of hundred thousand. And there are other illustrations. And it's with a more dynamic tenant.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Quentin and I will make sure we have that in the model.","David B. Henry","Put it in. Put it in. Count on it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Since there are no further questions, this concludes our Q&A session.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki. Please go ahead.","David Bujnicki","Thanks Dan. Thank you all for joining Kimco's fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call. With me on the call this morning are Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, CEO; Conor Flynn, President and Chief Operating Officer; Glenn Cohen, our CFO as well as other key executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking, and it's important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors that may differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our Web site.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Henry.","Dave Henry","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We are very happy to top-off a great year with solid fourth quarter financial results and operating metrics. Our strong portfolio of fundamentals were led by same-site NOI growth exceeding 4% for the second straight quarter and reaching our highest portfolio occupancies since early 2008.","Small shop occupancy also showed a sharp increase as local stores and small national retailers recover from the recession and proceed with their expansion plans. While retailers in general achieved mixed results in 2014, discounters and service-oriented tenants such as health clubs and restaurants continue their aggressive growth in the phase of a shrinking inventory of retail space.","As a result, effective rents are climbing in our portfolio and across the entire open air shopping center sector. Lower gas prices, accelerating household formation and continued limited development activity all bode well for the shopping center industry fundamentals in 2015.","The omni-channel sales approach is increasingly being embraced by national retailers with e-commerce success depending on brick and mortar stores providing market presence, product showrooms and fulfillment capabilities. Amazon and many other Internet retailers will indeed be leasing retail space in the coming years.","Glenn and Conor will cover many of the financial and operating specifics in their comments today. But, I would like to highlight several prominent successes. First, we have now essentially completed our exit from Latin America with favorable cap rates somewhat offset by declining currency exchange rates. Second, after lengthy negotiations we reached agreement and on Monday closed and acquired the remaining 2\/3rds ownership of the Kimco Blackstone portfolio of 39 high-quality retail properties.","And finally, early last week Kimco together with its consortium partners led by Cerberus completed the acquisition and merger and of Safeway with Albertsons and various other prominent grocers including Shaw's, Jewel, ACME and United Supermarkets comprising more than 2,200 stores. Kimco will hold slightly less than 10% of the merged operating companies and related real estate approximately 50% of which is owned real-estate.","As outlined in our earnings release, we have also substantially upgraded our U.S. portfolio with disposition of 91 shopping centers in 2014, while also acquiring 60 high-quality properties during the same period. While our recycling and upgrading strategy is not unique the scale of our actions in 2014 exceeded our peers and the resulting improved demographics and rent metrics of our portfolio are substantial noteworthy and promised to deliver excellent future growth.","Looking at our Canadian operations and responding to related inquiries, our occupancy remains very strong at 96% and we are fortunate to have the full guarantee of Targets U.S. parent for all nine of our Targets stores in Canada. Canadian Tire, Cosco, Wal-mart, Home Depot and Metro Grocery stores have all expressed interest in some of our target locations. And it is quite possible that we will end up with stronger tenants and a significant financial settlement from Target USA. Separately, while the lower Canadian dollar does impact property level NOI, we estimate $0.02 for 2015 at current levels.","Our initial investment in Canada remains hedged through Canadian dollar mortgages on the individual properties and our Canadian dollar denominated bonds. In addition, our local operating partners continue to do an excellent job leasing and managing the properties. Property values and prices also remain at historic high levels in Canada due to strong demand from pension funds and other institutional investors.","During the quarter as Glenn will note we monetized one more Canadian preferred equity investment at a substantial gain. Overall and moving forward across our entire portfolio, it is clear that our emphasis will be on investing capital in our own properties through redevelopment and expansions complemented with several selective new ground-up projects.","Conor will discuss in detail these plans, but we are pleased with our progress in growing this pipeline and the associated accretive economics.","The third-party acquisition market for high-quality properties is heated and very competitive. As a result wherever possible we continue to purchase the equity interest of our institutional partners when they choose to monetize their investments. In these situations, we have a distinct advantage due to our knowledge and long-term management of the assets coupled with a potential savings in terms of transfer taxes, brokerage fees and mortgage assumption costs.","Given the portfolio upgrade, we have completed to-date an improving industry fundamentals. We feel very positive about 2015.","Now, I would like to turn to Glenn and Conor with Milton batting clean-up as usual.","Glenn Cohen","Thanks Dave and good morning.","Our theme from our December 2013 Investor Day was TSR Plus, transformation, simplification, redevelopment and activities from our Plus business. We have successfully executed all these initiatives throughout the year and we are proud that our TSR Plus strategy delivered a TSR, total shareholder return of 32.4% for 2014.","Now some to details on our fourth quarter and full year results and some additional color on our 2015 guidance range. As we reported last night, headline FFO per diluted share, which represents the official NAREIT definition was $0.38 in the fourth quarter which includes the $0.03 per share of transactional income related to the monetization of several preferred equity interest in the U.S. and Canada.","For the full year headline FFO per diluted share was $1.45, a 7.4% increase as compared to a $1.35 per share for 2013. Our FFO was adjusted, our recurring FFO which excludes non-operating impairment and transactional income and expense was $0.35 per diluted share for the fourth quarter a 6.1% increase compared to last year and brings a full year to $1.40 per share a 5.3% increase over the 2013 level of $1.33 per share and achieving the high-end of our guidance range.","It's important to note that we accomplished this despite the $0.05 per share dilutive impact of disposing of higher cap rate assets including a substantial portion of our assets in Mexico and many non-strategic U.S. assets.","Our strong performance is the direct result of the significant portfolio transformation, which is delivering solid operating metrics including fourth quarter U.S. same-site NOI growth of 4.3% bringing the full year U.S. same-site NOI growth of 3.3%. Over 70% of the NOI growth is attributable to minimum rent increases.","Our combined same-site NOI growth which includes our Canadian operations was 4% for the fourth quarter and 3.3% as well for the full year excluding the negative impact of currency of 90 basis points and 80 basis points respectively.","Occupancy is approaching 96% and our leasing spreads were strong with full year leasing spreads of 19.5% and 6.3% for renewals and options bringing combined leasing spreads to 8.8% for 2014.","We continued to execute on the simplification part of our strategy. During the fourth quarter we acquired seven assets from joint venture with Dick and sold eight other properties from this joint venture. We also sold 23 assets in Mexico and two assets in Peru for total proceeds of $161 million and have now substantially liquidated our investment in both countries.","As previously mentioned upon substantial liquidation of an investment in a foreign country, the impact of foreign currency translation is recognized in earnings. As such we recognized a non-FFO charge of $134.3 million which was applied against the respective gains and losses on the assets sold. This is substantially offset with non-FFO gains net impairments of $107.8 million recognized during the quarter from the sale of 66 operating properties sold, generating total proceeds of approximately $420 million. In addition, as Dave mentioned we closed this week on the previously announced $925 million transaction to acquire the remaining 2\/3rds interest of our joint venture with Blackstone. The 39 properties in the venture are wholly-owned.","With regard to our balance sheet, we finished the year with solid debt metrics with net debt to recurring EBITDA of 5.5x and fixed charge coverage of 3.2x, the strong levels coupled with over $1.7 billion of the immediate liquidity from the availability on our revolving credit facility and cash on hand provided us the capacity to fund the Blackstone JV buyout. Subsequent to year end we refinanced our $400 million term-loan with a new $650 million term-loan priced at LIBOR plus 95 basis points among the lowest borrowing spread in the REIT industry. This term-loan has initial term of 2 years and 3 one-year extension options at our option with a final maturity date in 2020 providing us maximum flexibility.","Our debt maturities for 2015 are very manageable with less than $500 million of maturities and a significant portion not doing for the latter part of 2015 with an average rate of 5.2% on the maturing debt, we view this as an excellent opportunity to reduce our cost of capital.","Now to some more color on the guidance for 2015. As we discussed on our last earnings call NAREIT has been strongly advocating that all reporting companies provide guidance in accordance with the official NAREIT FFO definition as part of an effort to have an industry-wide consistency. As such, we are introducing an initial 2015 FFO per diluted share guidance range of $1.45 to $1.53 in accordance with NAREIT request.","Our initial 2015 FFO was adjusted per share guidance range is $1.42 to $1.44. The level of growth takes into account the dilutive impact of $0.12 associated with the significant capital recycling and joint venture buyout executed during 2014.","We view 2015 as a bridge year where we absorb the impact of our transformation program in order to position the company for superior long-term earnings growth in 2016 and beyond. In addition, the guidance consists the investments made in land parcels for future development totaling over $100 million and our Plus business investments in our Supervalu and Safeway acquisitions, which are currently non-earning, which should provide excellent growth potential in the future.","Several of the underlying assumptions used to develop the guidance range include an overall increase in U.S. occupancy of 25 to 50 basis points; U.S. same property NOI growth of 3% to 3.5%; acquisitions of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes the $925 million from the recently closed buyout of Blackstone; and dispositions of $550 million to $750 million.","In addition, the guidance range includes a $0.02 per share negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on our Canadian denominated flows. The headline guidance ranging includes net transactional income of $20 million to $38 million, which is excluded from our FFO as adjusted. The net transactional income includes acquisition cost of $6 million.","The guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments coming online and lease-up and financing initiatives. Our 2015 plan strongly supports our recently increased common dividend level of $0.24 per quarter, which equates to an FFO pay-out ratio in the mid-60s percent range one of the lowest in the industry.","Now, I will turn it over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Thanks, Glenn, and good morning everyone.","Today I will give a brief summary of our portfolio metrics, a quick update on acquisitions and dispositions followed by an update on redevelopments.","The fourth quarter and full year results reflect our best efforts to reposition the portfolio to a vibrant collection of high-quality, high-growth assets located in dense key metro markets that have the highest growth in population, wages and employment. We are positioned to give our shareholders unmatched safety in terms of tenant and geographic diversity along side stable and recurring growth.","The U.S. portfolio achieved an increase in occupancy of 80 basis points pro rata for the year to end at 95.7%. The occupancy gains were primarily driven by the increase in small shop demand as the U.S. small shop occupancy rose 280 basis points from the beginning of the year to finish at 88% pro rata an increase of 100 basis points of our prior quarter.","Resurgence in small shop leasing continues as this quarter we completed 66% of our small shop deals with local operators. The three major categories that make up the bulk of our small shop leasing include personal care services, restaurants and medical offices. Anchor occupancy also gained 10 basis points pro rata over prior quarter to finish at 98.3%. Leasing spreads continued to show the strong demand per space resulting in combined leasing spreads of 9.4% for the quarter. The U.S. same-site NOI of 4.3% for the quarter is a strong result driven by significant rent commences, contractual rent increases and redevelopment is coming online.","Competition in our key markets for acquisitions continues to escalate with no end of capital chasing high-quality real estate. Acquisitions for the fourth quarter were geared towards off-market, value-added projects where we are able to leverage our strength. Braelinn Village, a Kroger anchored center in Alpharetta, Atlanta suburb has expiring below-market Kmart lease that we believe as a significant redevelopment potential.","In addition, we have acquired four development parcels where we plan to build and hold these long-term strong assets to create shareholder value. One is the Whole Foods development in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania that is now under construction and located on the Main Line where we continue to expand our presence along side our flagship Suburban Square asset.","The Christiana, Delaware site was purchased from Sears and sits adjacent to GGPs Christiana Mall where retailers can take advantage of a tax-free environment and the site will take advantage of the significant frontage along I-95. In Florida, the Dania Beach development site sits adjacent to our dominant Oakwood Plaza. Nearly 3 miles of frontage along I-95 that comprise these two properties will create a dynamic and signature asset.","Finally, we have acquired a development parcel in Houston, Texas near the Woodlands and the new Exxon-Mobil campus that fronts the new Grand Parkway. The location of this asset is what we call a hole in the donut for retailers, as they are eager to capture this new positive growth in this affluent and highly educated market.","Notwithstanding the current oil price volatility, our project has generated significant retailer interest at an early stage and we expect to execute leases with anchorage tenant throughout 2015. These four projects amount to projected gross costs of $469 million, where targeted returns between 7% and 8%, a measured development approach where we can take advantage of our local expertise will enable us to build upon our growing redevelopment pipeline.","For 2015, we plan to leverage our industry-leading relationships to continue to source off-market transactions. A good example is the recently announced consolidation of the Blackstone JV in line with our stated strategy to simplify the business and further transform our portfolio; this transaction will significantly improve the wholly-owned asset base of Kimco and add a few notable redevelopment projects.","Turning to dispositions, in the fourth quarter we sold 41 properties, 29 wholly-owned and 12 in joint ventures for a pro rata share from these sales of $325 million. Pricing for these Tier-2 assets continue to show improved strength as public and private capital chase deals to the very low interest environment.","For the year, we completed the sales of 91 U.S. shopping centers for a gross sales price of $1 billion including $249 million of mortgage debt. The company's pro rata share from these sales was $710 million and the blended cap rate on our dispositions for the year was 7.5%.","We believe we are in the sweet spot for dispositions and are targeting another $600 million for dispositions in 2015 to effectively complete the transformation of the portfolio by exiting our low growth assets in secondary markets.","Our redevelopment program continues to produce significant results. Every asset we own goes through a methodical review process that takes into account all opportunities including current and future, retail and non-retail, so we leave no stone unturned to help create long-term shareholder value.","Our real estate is in demand not only from our normal role at expanding retailers, but also new sources including specialty grocers, outlet concepts, European retailers and developers of apartments, medical offices and hotels.","For the year, we completed 34 projects with the total gross cost of $68 million with a ROI of 13.9%. These projects continued to improve net asset value and contributed 90 basis points to our same-site NOI this year. As you look to 2015, we target gross projects of $200 million with a ROI of 8% to 10%. We have made significant progress this year. But, there is still work to be done as we continue to evolve and position ourselves as the best in class capital allocator and redevelopment operation.","In this next cycle, it will be imperative for us to focus on the capacity to sustain significant income growth when the interest rate environment shifts. As we near our all time high in occupancy, we will look to our redevelopment and development pipeline to generate significant recurring income growth.","The demand for space continues to outpace supply as we enter into 2015; we are cautiously optimistic due to the fundamental drivers of our industry. Employment growth, cheap gas prices and consumer confidence all combined to form a powerful shopping base in the U.S. that is ready to ramp-up consumption especially for off-price and essential goods.","Our retailer services group continues to provide us with invaluable information and recently found that this dramatic fall in gas prices has been a boon for our grocery concepts. We completed our strategic initiative of increasing our percentage of ABR from grocery-anchorage properties from 58% to over 65% and we will continue to push this initiative in 2015.","Our asset class is now competing at a higher level. As we have noticed many of our retailers that straddle the line between open-air shopping centers and the enclosed mall world have been outperforming in the open-air environment. Combining the favorable supply and demand balance, in addition to the safety to U.S. investments provide a nice runway of growth that had for owning well-located open-air centers.","As we look to 2015, our strategic goals remain focused on completing our transformation, simplification and expanding our redevelopment efforts to include strategic ground-up developments.","And now, I will turn it over to Milton for his closing remarks.","Milton Cooper","Well, thank you, Conor. I believe that our retail estate portfolio is in a particularly sweet spot. The decline in gasoline prices is much, much more important on a relative basis to our retail tenants, the super mall, the drug store, the off-price retailers and many other retailers that sell essential goods and service. It's much more important to them than it is to high-end luxury retailers.","I would also note that the major department stores are opening up more off-price units than ever before. There are 35 Nordstrom Rack stores planned over the next two years. Hudson Bay has stated they believe the value concepts will capture much of the growth in retail over the next five years and they are accelerating their expansion of their Saks Off Fifth brand. Even Macy's announced, they will explore in off-price business in addition to their existing Bloomingdale's outlet concept.","I also believe that cap rates will continue to decline. The spread between the 10-year treasury rate and cap rate should be narrower. The U.S. has the best legal system in the world for property rights. Global investors and pension funds are increasing their allocation to U.S. real estate, which should create further demand and the dollar is getting much more respect.","At Kimco over the past year, we have invested in the future growth of the company. These investments include the Blackstone purchase, a myriad of redevelopment projects and the development sites in Florida, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Texas. But for me personally, the most stimulating part is the bench strength of the Kimco team. I see passion and creative ability and a fierce energy to create value. Our team has dozens of new initiatives and programs to increase our operating income and NAV.","And with that, we are happy to take any questions.","David Bujnicki","We are ready to move to the Q&A portion of the call. We request that you respect the limit of one question so that all of our callers have an opportunity to speak with management. If you have additional questions you are welcome to rejoin the queue. Dan, you may take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi.","Christy McElroy","Hi. Good morning, everyone. As the largest shopping center REIT by market cap and coming into 2015 as a net acquirer and a potential equity issuer, this sort of feels like an appropriate question for you guys. Dave as you mentioned the private market for acquisitions is competitive. You had a lot of success buying out JV partners in terms in the last couple of years. But, historically you have been a willing public REIT acquirer even though you haven't in recent years. So I'm wondering what's your view on where the public REITs are trading versus private market values and is there a scenario where you would consider leveraging your equities to buy another couple of REITs?","Dave Henry","Well, there is certainly a scenario we would consider it. And we do think there continues to be a difference between properties on the private market and how us as a public company are valuing. We think the implied cap rate of our stock is much too high compared to the high-quality properties that are being traded out there on the private markets. So there certainly is an arbitrage that exits out there.","But as you know, M&A in our sector is difficult basically there is a process, you end up paying their bankers, your bankers, their accounts, your accounts. These deals are fully shopped. And yes, we have experienced doing it. We have done five over the last I think 15 years and we are proud of those. And we certainly continue to look at opportunities. We are focused however on if we do M&A on portfolios that will enhance the quality of our own portfolio. So the inventory of public portfolios out there that we attract our interest is narrower than perhaps it would have been in the past when we looked at all kinds of the yield.","So we will see what happens over time and if things become imply we certainly look. I think it's known that we together with others looked at AmREIT which met that high-quality profile about it. It is noteworthy that a private buyer bought it.","Christy McElroy","Acknowledging the quality bias, would you have a bias towards larger format centers or smaller neighborhood centers if you were to buy a large portfolio today?","Dave Henry","Yes, sure.","ConorFlynn","We prefer the larger formats. I think it gives us a little it more redevelopment potential. That being said we know that if we want to become a more urban portfolio that we may have to acquire some smaller parcels and then look to try and enhance that by acquiring adjacent sites around those parcels.","Christy McElroy","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. Regarding the guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, how much of that do you think will be acquisitions from JV partners?","GlennCohen","Well, again, you have $925 million that we closed on already this week. So you have the bulk of it that's done that way. We will continue to look for some work. But, I would say that balance of its really going to be one-off transactions that we find probably on an off market basis that might be an asset or two that we can buy out. But, we have done the bulk of that heavy lifting I think go in our \u2013 buying out large joint venture partners that are willing to part with their assets that's the norm.","Dave Henry","We continue to have some discussions with some that are interested. So I wouldn't say it's \u2013 that we are completely finished. But the bigger ones as we have talked \u2013 as we mentioned in the past have told us they like to hold for the long-term. But we are talking to some of the others.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Samir Khanal","Good morning, guys. Just looking at kind of your international market today, I mean you have exited pretty much all of Latin America, I think most of the bulk \u2013 to dispose and that was kind of in the U.S. of $600 million in 2015. But, with the soft Canadian currency and can that \u2013 is that a market that you kind of think about for the long-term, as you kind of balance the currency risk there and possibly kind of a better opportunity to invest elsewhere?","Dave Henry","We certainly take a look at what we have in Canada and what we should do with what we have in Canada. One of the problems we have had as we have mentioned on these calls over the years is growing what we have had properties prices up there are exceptionally high. And we have taken advantage of it in modest ways. We have continued to monetize our preferred equity investments while we have sold quite a few properties in Canada. But, together with some of our partners we have put properties on the market up there.","So I think it's more likely than not that you will see our exposure and our investment platform in Canada to go down over time rather than stay the same.","Samir Khanal","Okay, great. Thanks.","Dave Henry","Thanks Samir.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Morgan of MLV. Please go ahead.","Paul Morgan","Hi. Good morning. Just and thinking in about the consolidation in office supply space where you have got more than 100 staples and office depots and as you look at that real estate, I know retailers have been circling a lot of those stores for a long time. I mean how do you think about the mark-to-market within in your portfolio? And then broadly how consolidation of that REIT might play out in terms of \u2013 is there enough term left that will be a lot of sub-lease activity or would you be able to recapture and could be a catalyst for redevelopment et cetera?","Glenn Cohen","Yes. It's a good question. The first thing to note is that the two companies will operate business as usual as they go through the FTC process. So as we look out the next three years we have clearly 42 sites that are just coming due. The good thing is that the boxes that these office supply users occupy are in the highest demand in terms of our shopping center space. So 98.3% occupancy in our boxes over 10,000 square feet. And these boxes have come up in the next three years. They are about 10% to 15% below market.","So we do believe that they are going to analyze a strategy if they are approved by the FTC that will then clarify what their needs are going forward. But, we believe this is a nice opportunity for us to continue to add specialty grocers to our shopping centers where we can increase our percentage of ABRs from a grocery component.","And there is plenty of demand for all the TJX concepts, Ross, Bed Bath & Beyond concepts. If you think about these are boxes that once you add up a dynamic retailer that will cause more traffic it should have a trickle down effect that will impact and enhance the residual shopping center.","So we look at it as a net positive, but at the end of the day, as a landlord you are always sad to see another retailer combine because it's one left that it's going to be bidding on that space when it comes available.","So even though it's probably necessary for that sector, we do like to think the more retailers is better for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Auerbach of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","George Auerbach","Thanks. Good morning. For the fourth quarter in 2014, it looks like TIs and LCs were about 18% or so the value of your new leases in the U.S. up from about 15% in 2013. I guess how should we expect capital cost to trend in 2015 and 2016 on new leases. And how do you think that impacts the cash rent spreads on your new leases relative to the call 20% spreads on new and 9% overall, that you achieved in 2014.","Glenn Cohen","I think that's probably a common range in terms of going forward, you will still see the tenant improvement allowance and landlord work range from third quarter to fourth quarter and that is going forward for 2015. That being said, we are getting close to our stabilization point of occupancy, so when new leases come in unless it's a transformative used where we are going from a soft good player to a grocery box or a say a bank branch to a restaurant that's where you really see the up tick in the cost that you need to reposition those boxes and that's probably what's driving that up tick in the fourth quarter because we did execute a number of grocery deals as well as restaurant deals.","George Auerbach","Still going forward is 15% a better number?","Glenn Cohen","I think the 10% to 15% is a good range to think about.","George Auerbach","Thank you.","Glenn Cohen","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason White of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jason White","Good morning. I was just wondering why 2015 is the right time to be a net acquire and what factors will lead to materially depart from your initial guidance this year?","Glenn Cohen","Well, what I would say is, we had this big opportunity to buy out our Blackstone joint venture which is over $900 million that is the bulk of it. If you look at the balance of what we are doing, we are talking about selling at a mid-point roughly $650 million of assets and acquiring on the other side of that somewhere around another $300 million to $400 million of assets.","So again, as Dave mentioned you have a pretty heated market. We are trying to find really good opportunities. But being very disciplined about what we are acquiring. I mean the Blackstone joint venture is the driver.","Dave Henry","Definitely the driver and if you think about it, it was a wonderful opportunity for us because there was no broker involved. We could assume the mortgages without any additional costs. We minimized the transfer taxes and we were able to do a negotiated transaction with Blackstone. And so that those opportunities don't come along a lot and $900 million certainly drive us being a net acquirer in the face of very high third-party acquisition prices. So you are right in general but it's just that the Blackstone deal fell right into this year.","Glenn Cohen","I would also just add that our disposition is a lot smaller this year. So when you think of it, we are coming off of a very large disposition year and that tails off because we are nearing the completion of the repositioning.","Jason White","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please go ahead.","JeremyMetz","Yes. Good morning. It's Jeremy here with Ross. I was just wondering if you can give us a little more color on the components of your same-store growth expectations for 2015, what kind of leasing spreads are you baking in and what about expense growth and then just also how much should the development benefit 2015 results?","Conor Flynn","Yes. In our plan we anticipate redevelopments to have 25 to 40 basis point impact on our same-site NOI growth.","GlennCohen","And on the leasing spread side, we baked in high-single digits. So pretty similar to what we saw for this year.","Jeremy Metz","And on the expense side another year of 3-ish percent?","Glenn Cohen","Yes. It should be pretty similar. I mean again, as Conor mentioned we were trying to get close to our stabilized level of occupancy so those costs should maintain themselves. We'll have to see a little bit what happens with snow removal. But, outside of that it should be pretty consistent.","Conor Flynn","Right.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Peterson of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Ryan Peterson","Yes. Hi. Thank you. This quarter your same-site NOI redevelopment added 1.4% but you spoken of that being a lower number next year. Is that related to lower yields on upcoming redevelopment or is that just purely timing?","Conor Flynn","No. It's not lower yield. It's actually timing because we are talking as the redevelopment can't mature actually you take off sites that you are taking down because you have to take that income off. So we actually have a number of assets that I talked about $200 million or so coming on line.","But then, as you look at our pipeline, we actually are taking off quite a bit as well. So if you add that to the benefits, it averages out to about 25 to 40 bps of improvement on same-site NOI.","Ryan Peterson","Okay, great. That's it from me. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Isbee of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Nathan Isbee","Hi. Good morning. Can you please talk about the land purchases without the pre-leasing and how you make that decision weighing the next got to have development versus recent history of music stopping with a lot of land on the books et cetera?","Conor Flynn","No problem. Let me walk you through them. The first one Wynnewood, Pennsylvania that was a forward commitment where we actually purchased the property with an executed Whole Foods lease. So it was in essence a ground-up development where we had the Whole Foods lease in place before closing on the land. And it's again in an area where we want to continue to control on the main line.","Christina, Delaware that site was actually a six-year labor of love where we were actually working with Sears originally to entitle the project as a JV partner. And then co-develop it going forward. Well \u2013 and the entitlements obviously came to a fruition, Sears did no longer wanted participate in the ground-up development process because of the cash involved. So we were able to execute a purchase option for us and take them out of it, so now we are going to be owning that 100% in developing it going forward. We have been working in that project for a number of years as I said. And we are very confident in the rental \u2013 the retailer interest going forward.","Grand Parkway that site again is a long \u2013 the Grand Parkway site in Houston, it's in a perfect location where if you look at the spacing from all of our retailers, its' really positioned nicely to take advantage of not only the new Parkway that's going to be completed but it also has the new Exxon-Mobil campus coming out of the ground and Woodland is a very affluent, very highly educated pocket of population in Houston. And I think we will really drive significant retailer interest and we have already been seeing more demand even from retailers that have been dormant for a number of years are looking at this site as a real opportunity to get a piece of this new development.","And then Dania is an adjacent site next to our 100% leased Oakwood Plaza. This is a Fort Lauderdale Airport really a site that will own from Fort Lauderdale Airport all the way down to Highwood, Florida. So I-95 will be controlled by us really for 3 miles. And we think we have significant synergies by controlling the adjacent parcel. And looking at doing complementary uses that we believe will really enhance our existing position and be a signature asset for us going forward.","So each of those ground up development have a very specific story and that's why we believe it's a prudent time to step back into the ground of development process because we have been very reluctant at paying sub-5 caps for signature assets. And if we can develop to a 7% or 8% in a key market where we know we are going to own long-term. We think that we can control the process and feel very comfortable with \u2013 in 2017 and 2018 bringing these projects on.","Nathan Isbee","All right. That's helpful.","Dave Henry","I will just \u2013","Nathan Isbee","I'm sorry.","Dave Henry","Let me just add one thing. Although we \u2013 there is not a lot of actual sign pre-leases in some of these occasions before we went ahead we knew we had the tenant interest. So we talked to tenants. We knew exactly who wanted to go where before we went ahead with these deals. So yes, technically there is not a basket full of signed leases, but we had the indications from the tenants that they wanted to be in these locations especially Houston and Dania.","Nathan Isbee","All right. That's helpful. I'm going to miss the roller-coaster there on the 95. How much land are you willing \u2013 no matter how good these deals are, how much land are you going to put on your books at this point?","ConorFlynn","I think it's a very measured approach. I think it has to be a very compelling case like the ones we talked about. I feel very comfortable on the staffing levels that we have. We look to really add one signature development project per region and feel very comfortable that we are capable of creating value doing that.","So I feel, we will take a very measured approach and look for compelling cases only going forward.","Nathan Isbee","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vincent Chao","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to go back to the first question. You talked about a preference for urban areas and large formats. But, just curious geographically you are looking at potentials, would you stick within the current footprint or are you willing to go outside of that and if you are, how are you really thinking about qualities at more demographics? Is it \u2013 what is the criteria that you are looking at there?","And then I guess between grocer versus power, obviously, you have both, any specific preference would you really mostly focus on grocery-anchor at this point which seems to be an increasing focus for you?","Conor Flynn","Let me take the first one on the markets. We very strategically identified our key markets and we want to stay to that map. We always analyzed demographics to see if there is an additional key market that we should be interested in going forward. But for the time being, we feel very dedicated to our map and our key markets and that's where we have been focusing on both for acquisitions, redevelopment and ground-up development.","And the question on the grocery versus power center, we like both, we actually think there is a little bit of misprice on the power center right now because of the opportunity to add a grocery component to a power center. So if that opportunity presents itself, we usually jump at it and try and work with adding a grocery component and get that cap rate compression.","DaveHenry","I think you mentioned all the screens we would go through everything from the average rents to the particular geographic markets to the types and the size of the assets and whether there is upside in terms of redevelopment. We have not been afraid to buy a large portfolio and then put in the two buckets, a whole bucker if you will. And a sell bucket. So we would continue to look at mixed assortment of assets and then try to tailor to what we want long-term. But, we have spent the last couple of years deciding which markets to focus on long-term and trying to become a little more urban focused and a little more larger asset focused.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thanks for that. And just one question on the dispositions which you guys talked about cap rates compressing across the board and obviously now it will be more U.S. focus in terms of assets sales maybe Canada as well. Curious, this year I think the guidance was for 8% cap rates under dispositions, how are you thinking about 2015's dispositions should be \u2013 if you are thinking about 7 or less than that?","GlennCohen","I think you probably still have it on the low to mid 7s because some of its going to be the \u2013 we have a couple of assets that are still remaining in Mexico when you blended all together, so a combined probably 7.5-ish range.","Conor Flynn","As long as the interest environment stays relatively stable, I think we will continue to see the demand there. So we feel pretty comfortable with that assumption.","Vincent Chao","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan of The Cowen Group. Please go ahead.","Jim Sullivan","Good morning. Thank you. Question for Conor regarding the footprints for the off-priced concepts and the off-priced demand that you are seeing generally. This is really kind of a segue from Milton's comment about expanding demand from the likes of Nordstrom rack and commentary from some of the department store groups that are looking to want to take on more off-priced square feet themselves. And also given what Neiman Marcus just agreed with Sears, I just want to \u2013 Conor, when you look at your Kmart boxes and the possibility for redevelopment, re-tenanting. Are you seeing off-priced because of this competitive pressure off-priced footprints expanding or not. And as you think about the redevelopment let's say a theoretical redevelopment of Kmart box, would it be your preference to do a multi-tenant approach in that box or would you be more \u2013 would you be just as happy to replace them with a single tenant?","Conor Flynn","Sure. The first one on the square footage, it really depends on the discounter that you are talking about Saks Off Fifth for example is going a little bit larger than say your prototypical TJX or Ross. They are looking for closer to 30,000 to 40,000 square feet. Now, that being said because the competition is so significant to get into certain assets they are willing to go down to 20,000 to 25,000 square feet.","So we still continue to see that range of 20,000 to 30,000 square feet as being the sweet spot for the op price discounter. TJX has gone a little bit smaller from 25,000 to 22,000. Ross continues to be right about the same square footage. But, we think that that's really the sweet spot for the discounter today as they try and figure out how to get the most sales out of their box and continue to refine their business model.","And as for Kmart redevelopments, it really depends on the assets where its located, what's the best use for the surrounding community. And what's really going to drive the most sales for that shopping center.","If you got a single box Kmart that you are redeveloping, my preference is typically to probably chop it up and do a number of different retailers because then you can really enhance the surrounding retailer. The retailer that \u2013 so if you can add a grocery concept to it your small shop will then pick-up on that significant traffic increase.","And again, the junior acre space today is probably the most active in terms of our industry and when we look at Kmart boxes the demand for the juniors are really what's driving the rents and really what's driving the growth there. So for us it's been a mix but I would say that going forward it will still be drawn a lot of junior box interests.","Jim Sullivan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Rich Moore","Yes. Hi. Good morning guys. I realized that the developments that you are currently undertaking are specific in nature and each as a story. But I'm wondering, do you think there is an industry shift that's sort of being signaled here in terms of the amount of developments that's going to happen in the shopping center sector. And should we think in terms of maybe annual starts for you guys as we look at our models and our thought process for Kimco should we think in terms of $200 million starts a year going forward. Does that make sense?","Dave Henry","I think \u2013 certainly think it's fair to say that after six years of virtually no development that there are the green shots out there and especially led by the specialty grocers like Whole Foods, you are beginning to see more development. But these are generally a smaller projects and still just a fraction of the number shopping centers that we have developed, at the peak we were developing 2000 shopping centers a year in the United States and so may be it's gone from 100 to a 200 or 300 now, but it still a small fraction. And nobody to my knowledge is doing these million square foot lifestyle all spec centers that take years to get the entitlements.","So I think the inventory is going to be limited, but certainly there has been a turning point and the economics are now justifying new construction in selective markets.","GlennCohen","But, I think Richard in terms of modeling again; we are being very, very disciplined and careful about where we are acquiring that. To think that we are going to put on $300 million, $400 million a year, I don't think that's the case. The projects there is not that many of them that come along. I mean as Conor mentioned Christina property we have been working on for 6 years. And so this is an example. So I think it's going to be more limited than that.","Conor Flynn","Yes. I would agree with Glenn and I would just add to that that the apartment developers are driving land prices up so significantly that that retail is still probably going to be muted in terms of ground-up development going forward. It's going to have to be a very selective cases for what make sense going forward.","Rich Moore","Okay, very good. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Tsai of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Linda Tsai","Hi. Following up on the off-priced topic, when you look at this off-priced space that's expanding Nordstrom Rack, Macy's, is your sense that these retailers actively prefer a shopping center location over a traditional outlet location all else equal.","Conor Flynn","It's really case-by-case on which retailer you are talking about, if it's a pure outlet player that's still loves to be in the outlet center then I think that's still their preference. We are starting to see the bleed happen where typically you would use to see Saks Off Fifth only going in an outlet concept where now they were really active in terms of going to our open air shopping centers. The theme I would say for the Bloomingdale's outlet concept and the Neiman Marcus last call.","So Nordstrom Rack has always been a player in our space, so that one is not new. But, I do see that those others are now becoming very, very interested in it, in addition to the Nike outlet and a few others. So that I would say is the starting point, I'm not sure if it's going to fall, it would be a continuous trend and have all the outlets look to it to relocate. But, at pricing where significant \u2013 the operating cost in an outlet center today are significant, we can offer a pretty big discount to that.","Linda Tsai","Thanks. And then in light of the RadioShack declaring bankruptcy, I know this was largely anticipated. Any color on how many stores are in your portfolio, are they in the higher quality centers like the office supply stores?","Glenn Cohen","We have 68 RadioShack properties. I can tell you this, last month in January; RadioShack only paid rent on some of the stores. And those are the ones that they thought they want to keep going forward. I think all but two of our stores we got the rent paid. We have been talking with them for the past year as I said we are going to close 200 stores and then we are going to close 1500 stores and most of our stores are not on that list to close. So we are pretty confident that the bulk of that 15 and 2000 stores will be in the open air centers. And a lot of them will be ours.","So I think for me \u2013 I'm excited that new opportunities are going to come in bring Sprint in there and do a lot of good things in the stores. But, and it looks like as Conor said early on we have had an increase in our small shop based about 280 basis points. So there is a lot of demand, they have good locations, so the ones we get back; I think we will do pretty well with.","Dave Henry","And just to put in perspective though because of our large scale all those stores they amount to a total of 170,000 square feet, I know it's a really tiny piece to a puzzle.","Conor Flynn","And only 0.3%, I think they are so.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Rosivach of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi. Good morning. This is Caitlin Burrows. On the similar topic of bankruptcy, some of the mall REITs have reported so far have indicated potential loss of rents this year. From those bankruptcies as you talk about selling small shop space for local businesses, do you think you will face the same risk or it seems your tenants different right now?","GlennCohen","We have been monitoring for the past couple of years. We heard during the fall of last year a lot of the mall retailers were having issues, especially the ones that are dealing with the teams, they are not going to the malls any more. So they are getting hurt. And so [indiscernible] and folks like that are being struggling. I'm not seeing that with our shop space tenants at all, it's been very strong on that so we are pretty comfortable on our end that we are not going to see a fall like that.","Conor Flynn","I would agree our watch list is continuing to shrink I think RadioShack and the office supply sector has been on everybody's radar for a long, long time. And we feel very comfortable with the lease roll over and the opportunity to backfill those spaces that significantly improved rents.","Caitlin Burrows","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris Lucas","Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been already asked and answered. But, just on the development pipeline nationally David, are we basically in the clear 2015, 2016 and then 2017 is when you start to think that there is a little bit of a tick up in deliveries and new inventory coming online or is it further out?","Dave Henry","I think your term a little bit of pick up is the right term. We just don't see any V-shape to the recovery of development. There was so many difficulties with so many large projects that got caught and talked on the financial prices that going into large scale development much of which is spec is exceptionally hard. And the economics still aren't there. In many markets rents still aren't back to the levels they were six, seven years ago.","So it's very hard to make the numbers work and construction financing is very limited. It's just much tougher in our sector to get going again in major developments. So I think you will see a little bit of a U-turn here with development in our sector and you are beginning to see some of it.","But again, we are a long way off, years off from major, major addition to supply. It's interesting that retail per capita in the U.S. has actually come down. I mean that's the first time it's happened in a long, long time.","Conor Flynn","I would just add that the super anchors are really the driver behind a lot of the development in the last cycle. And when you look at the super anchors today Wal-mart is expanding their smaller footprint with their neighborhood concept. If you look at Target, they are expanding their express concept to smaller footprint. Home Depot is not really doing anything new.","So a lot of the guys that were out there that were really buying either a piece of land or ground leasing a big portion of a slide to make it feasible are no longer in the game. So if you take them out of the playing field, it's really going to be muted for the next few years. And then we will start to see a tick back up.","Chris Lucas","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Christy McElroy. Please go ahead.","MichaelBilerman","Yes. It's Michael Bilerman with Christy. Either Dave or Glenn, I'm just thinking about sort of capital financing alternatives and Glenn, I think you talked a little bit about in guidance that there is a variety of different financing assumptions in your guidance. I think if you back into the weighted average share count, that's embedded in your guidance it's about an extra 10 million shares, so it would appear as though there is some level of equity issuance either off the ATM or direct issuances in the guidance.","So I'm wondering as you think about the big Blackstone deal that you did with negotiated transaction, taking on leverage, being a net acquirer, why not have issued the equity earlier or at least timed it better and not take sort of market risk and maybe just help us understand how you are thinking about equity as part of that funding source both within guidance but more strategically about when to rise it.","DaveHenry","Sure, Michael. So we have a very strong balance sheet and we have a plenty of liquidity and plenty of levers to pull in terms of our access to capital. And again, we remain very committed to maintaining our BBB+ BAA one ratings. Now, as you know, we haven't issued common equity since 2009 although we continually evaluated our capital needs in connection with our operating strategy, our debt metrics or capital plan and where we believe are any of these.","But in terms of being able to have more tools, we are going to establish an ATM program and watch how the rest of our capital plan runs throughout the year. But, starting with a net debt to EBITDA of 5.5x, it gives us the capacity to watch and figure where we are best positioned to \u2013 if need to issue equity do it.","I mean there are other things that are out there, we have our Supervalu position, which potentially could be monetized and add capital to us. So we really want to see all the pieces come together.","MichaelBilerman","But, I guess that's what embedded in there some level embedded in guidance and if you don't do that \u2013 you don't do an equity raise, there is upside to numbers that effectively you dampened FFO per share growth a little bit by embedding some level of equity issuance?","Dave Henry","Yes. Again, well, guidance is a range, right? We have run various scenarios some with, some without equity. But, yes, I mean if we don't issue equity you will definitely have upside in those numbers. But, again, we have to balance that with our debt metrics and our desire to maintain our credit ratings where they are.","MichaelBilerman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Jim Sullivan of Cowen Group. Please go ahead.","Jim Sullivan","Sure. Yes, I just thinking of the comments \u2013 Conor's comment earlier in the prepared remarks about sustaining growth going forward after this so called bridge year. And then with what David had to say about the likely pace of development returning in the upside and the value creation that provides. I'm just curious Conor when we go back into your presentation the company did at the end of 2013, the internal growth rate talking about 3% plus and a range of 2.5% to 3.5%.","And as we are approaching this kind of peak occupancy rate that the company has been able to achieve historically 96 and change. Are you expecting that the redevelopment contribution which of course you will include in the same-store NOI combined with higher spread, do you expect that's going to be able to replace the inability to push occupancy any further and sustain same-store NOI 3% plus? What do you think that we have to assume the same-store is just going to have to come down?","Conor Flynn","No. We do agree with that assumption that that's really what's going to drive it to 3% plus. And this year as the bridge year, we are focused on delivering 3% to 3.5% of same-site NOI and then 2016 and 2017 is actually when a lot of our leases mature that are significantly below market. So we think that's going to be a nice mark-to-market opportunity just to continue our growth either occupancy hits stabilization. You couple that with our redevelopment program and that's really what we are excited about a lot in the potential. Because our low ABR has grown significantly and we continue to think that that's a nice upside for us going forward.","Jim Sullivan","And if I can just add to that the redevelopment contribution therefore should continue to be running at a level substantially above what the development contribution would likely be?","Conor Flynn","That's correct.","Jim Sullivan","Okay.","Dave Henry","And remember market rents are moving for us as occupancies get to these peak level for everybody market rents are jumping a bit. So that will continue to help as well.","Jim Sullivan","Sure. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Rich Moore","Yes, again guys. I got kind of a mundane question to ask you. With the commentary you made about the two numbers you want to show now the two sets of guidance you want to show one for NAREIT and one for adjusted. How do you \u2013 since you got us on the phone, how do you want us to show this to FirstCall, I mean should we switch now to a NAREIT definition in what we report to FirstCall or do you want us to stay with the adjusted?","Glenn Cohen","No. I think we run our business based on our recurring flows. I mean NAREIT is very focused on headline that's their desire. We run our business and we determine our dividend based on our recurring flows. So we have provided both because we were request to, but we run our business on a recurring.","Dave Henry","I would just add maybe Michael Bilerman who certainly has been one of the stronger proponents of making sure there is a consistent measurement for non-dedicated REIT investors to look at. So that's why NAREIT has been so adamant. That if you are going to give guidance on something make sure you also give guidance on the official. Yes, there is only one official SEC approved definition of FFO. And so that's why we have started to give guidance as well as the recurring guidance. If you listen to David Simmons call, he was particularly adamant about it.","We want to attract non-dedicated REIT investors to our space. So if we can do our part with giving guidance on the official definition we are going to do that.","Rich Moore","Okay. To do that I think Dave, we got to show that way too though and \u2013","Conor Flynn","We would agree. We would agree.","Milton Cooper","We agree.","Conor Flynn","We would agree.","Rich Moore","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Mike Mueller","Yes. Hi. I was wondering, can you talk about what you are seeing on the ground in Houston and then Florida?","DaveHenry","On the ground in Houston was the question \u2013","Mike Mueller","And Florida.","DaveHenry","I will just take it, Conor knows much more specifics than I do. But, in talking to some of our favorite partners and clients and relationships in Houston, they all start-off by saying we want to remind you that this is not the first time we have been to the rodeo. In other words they have been through ups and downs in energy prices and they feel very good about the long-term prospects of Texas and Houston in particular. The economy has diversified. And a lot of the energy projects are very long-tailed projects. These things take 10 years to put an offshore drilling rig actually in there and producing. So there is a lot of capital. It continues to flow into approved projects.","Secondly, they remind us, there is a lot of capital waiting to come back in and take advantage of any distress that's there. And we have been particularly pleasantly surprised by the level of tenant interest in our new site in Houston notwithstanding the recent fall in prices. They like that site. They like Houston long-term. And these retailers are going to be there. So with that Conor?","Conor Flynn","I think that Houston has done a pretty good job in diversifying their economy. So clearly it's still tied closely to the \u2013 with oil prices. But the Exxon-Mobil campus is fully funded. It's consolidating all their offices. They are going to have over 12,000 employees there. These are all highly educated affluent workers. Woodland is the hardest area in terms of Texas and housing prices maybe average house stays on the market there about for a week before it's gobbled up. And we continue to see occupancy hit all time high in Houston. Our retail occupancy in Houston is higher than our portfolio average and we think that there is huge demand for retailers to continue to expand there.","And the Grand Parkway is a new outer loop of Houston, so if you think of where the growth has gone Woodland is actually outside of the Grand Parkway. So the Grand Parkway is almost like in-field location that has the highest income in dense area of Woodlands outside of it. So it's actually starting to fill-in nicely. So with that, we feel very comfortable with the investment in the spacing of the retailers.","Mike Mueller","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our final question comes from Jason White of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Jason White","Just a quick follow-up as you buy these larger portfolios out of your JVs, just curious how many of those properties is going to fall on the top tier of your portfolio versus maybe some just to have to kind of take with the portfolio and are you intending on selling any of those assets that may not fall within your top tier?","Conor Flynn","Yes. Just as a note, our JV platform was originally developed so that we could access cheaper cost of capital, so we can go after the higher quality assets. So in general as a footnote the JV properties were and have historically a higher quality property than our core portfolio. But, as we consolidated it, many of those properties are in our Tier-1 portfolio now. And as we analyze the JV buyouts, we continue to run our filters through to see which one has fall into our Tier-1 bucket and which one has fall into our Tier-2 bucket, which would then be sold-off.","So it's really a fine approach to analyzing not only the asset that we can potentially acquire. But the good thing is as we continue to manage all these assets we know them inside now have a very good idea what we want to do it as soon as we get the opportunity to control it.","Jason White","So that largely immaterial amount of the JV acquisition properties that you would see selling over the next couple of years?","Conor Flynn","That's correct. That's a good assumption.","Jason White","Great. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","David Bujnicki","Thanks Dan.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki. Please go ahead.","David Bujnicki","Good morning, and thank you for joining Kimco's second quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining me on the call are Conor Flynn, our Chief Executive Officer; Ross Cooper, the President and Chief Investment Officer; Glenn Cohen, Kimco's CFO; David Jamieson, our Chief Operating Officer, as well as other members of our executive team that are present and available to answer questions during the call.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of the call may be deemed forward-looking, and it is important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the Investor Relations area of our Web site.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Conor.","Conor Flynn","Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Today I'll provide an overview of our strong second quarter performance and an update on a great progress we have made on the execution of our strategy. Ross will then report on our quarterly transaction activity and describe the overall transactional environment. Finally, Glenn will provide details on key metrics and our updated 2018 guidance.","Execution continues to be our number one priority as we reposition our portfolio for the long-term growth and value creation. Our team continues to work tirelessly as we seek to improve in all aspects of our business. And our results for the quarter continue to demonstrate that our portfolio quality and value creation initiatives are working.","Now, for some details; we are now over halfway through the year and the taste and strong pricing of our dispositions give us confidence that we will meet our full-year disposition range of 7 to 900 million. The vibrant private market evaluations coupled with widely-available debt financing and strong pricing for our Midwest assets continue to demonstrate the disconnect between public and private pricing. Ross will go into detail on the encouraging pricing, execution, and capital formations we have experienced recently.","More importantly, as we achieve our targeted dispositions for the current year, it positions us to restart our growth as we enter 2019 with a superior portfolio, concentrated in coastal markets where we see the best opportunity for growth and redevelopment potential. And as I mentioned, our reposition portfolio is producing solid results. Leasing volume continues to be near all-time highs for the company, as our team is working diligently to create vibrant campus life settings where our shoppers want to stay for extended periods of time.","Our same-site NOI outperformed this quarter due to a strong leasing volume, a slowing of new vacancies and the additional rent collected from our Toys \"R\" U boxes. The Toys liquidation process had been drawing out, which has given us a running start on our re-leasing efforts. These efforts have produced significant interest for major retailers and off-priced furniture, fitness, specialty grocery, and arts and crafts.","To recap, we had a total of 22 Toys \"R\" Us leases that fall into two categories; OpCo leases and PropCo leases. Fifteen of our leases are in the OpCo entity of Toys \"R\" Us, and we have already resolved seven of those location with retailers taking the entire Toys \"R\" Us box. Our remaining eight locations at OpCo have significant tenant interests, and we are working to convert this demand into leases as quickly as possible.","The second category of our Toys boxes are leases in the PropCo entity. We have seven leases in PropCo which have not yet been rejected, and the date of the auction has not yet been set. Rent continues to slow on those assets. We anticipate Q3 resolution of the PropCo entity, and have been proactive in marketing these locations.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate that the Toys liquidation will have a maximum impact of 70 to 80 basis points on our occupancy and same-site NOI, as we anticipate recapturing the majority of the boxes that have not yet gone to auction. Notwithstanding the impact, given a strong re-leasing to-date and the demand for the remaining Toys boxes we feel confident in raising our same-site NOI guidance for the year to 2% to 2.5%. Overall, we have seen demand match or exceed supply for high quality locations with retailers focusing on store growth in the top 20 markets, where populations are growing, wages are rising, and employment is increasing.","Our overall strategy is focused on repositioning our portfolio to be tightly concentrated in these top 20 markets, where we believe demand will continue to be strong over the long run and provide unique opportunities for our mixed use platform. Keep in mind we are also at a 40-year low for new supply, which we don't see reversing anytime soon as land costs continue to escalate along with increases in labor and construction costs. We see the economy continuing to grow, demand from our retailers continuing to increase and the millenial generation coming into its peak spending years. These factors have generated outside demand for many of our assets, driving our occupancy level on our small shops to the highest level in the company's history at over 90%.","Demand for small shops is being driven by multiple retailers expanding in the restaurant, service, health and wellness, medical and fitness categories. While our focus continues to be on execution and portfolio improvement, it is worth mentioning the two major events that occurred this year that have boosted the retail outlook for the year, and as retailers focusing on investment, both in existing store remodels and the rollout of new stores.","First, tax reform has dramatically lowered the effect of tax rate for our retailers, which were paying some of the highest corporate tax rates in the country. In numerous meetings with our retail partners, they have consistently totted tax reform as a major factor in the real estate expansion plans. Second, the Supreme Court ruling in the [indiscernible] positions of sales tax on e-commerce will likely level the playing field for all retailers, regardless of channel. This ruling has effectively closed the loophole that allows pure e-commerce players to skirt state sales tax and offer the cheapest price possible on a wide assortment of goods. We believe the ruling can potentially accelerate the trend of omnichannel retailing.","Turning to our signature series developments and redevelopments, they continue to mature and move closer to producing meaningful growth for the company as we approach 2019. As I mentioned, the lack of new supply, whenever a high quality project is brought to market by respected and low-capitalized developer, retailers are ready to jump at the opportunity. Our sites are substantially pre-leased creating positive leasing momentum for these rare high-quality opportunities, which are poised to deliver on time.","Our Lincoln Square mixed use project in Center City Philadelphia is starting to pre-lease apartments with demand exceeding our budget. The first Sprouts Farmers Market in Philadelphia is set to open at Lincoln Square this August. And Target will soon follow. Our Pentagon Center mixed use tower called the Witmer is now topped off and will begin pre-leasing apartments in 2019. Dania Phase I is now 93% pre-leased, and it's set to open later this summer and stabilize in 2019. Our Mill Station development is now 79% pre-leased with Costco set to open in September. These signature series projects are large in scale and will deliver meaningful growth in 2019 and beyond as we unlock the embedded value of our real estate.","In closing, we are pleased with the pace of our dispositions and pricing. We have taken advantage of this public, private disconnect by buying back our shares at a discount on a leveraged neutral basis. We are witnessing solid demand for our available spaces, and have made meaningful progress on a signature series development and redevelopments that will start to deliver later this year. We continue to focus on what we can control, execute on our strategy to position the portfolio to generate consistent growth supported by a strong balance sheet that will create long-term shareholder value.","Ross?","Ross Cooper","Thank you, Conor. It has certainly been a busy first-half of the year on the transaction side with our team firing on all cylinders. Second quarter sales volume continued a significant pace with the sale of 17 shopping centers for 320 million at Kim share putting us well on our way to hitting on our 2018 disposition goals of 700 million to 900 million. In fact, with 530 million Kim share of sales for the first-half of the year, we are two-thirds of the way there, and we continue to execute.","Subsequent to quarter-end, we sold an additional two shopping centers for a combined 49 million at Kimco share, and currently have another 200 million plus at Kimco share either under contract or within accepted offer. We maintain our full-year guidance range for both net sales volume and cap rates.","As we communicated previously, in conjunction with the initial disposition targets for the year, it was always our goal to maximize proceeds in the first-half of the year to minimize dilution in 2019. As Conor indicated, our team is dedicated to ensuring recurring FFO growth in 2019 and we fully understand how the timing of our 2018 sales impact that goal.","Given the timing and pace of our sales volume in 2018, we are comfortable indicating that next year's sales will be meaningfully less than this year. Also another benefit for expediting our 2018 sales volume is that it continues to strengthen the remaining core portfolio as evidenced by our operating fundamentals.","As we move through the remainder of 2018, given our continued emphasis on owning properties in dynamic growth markets, we remain focused on reducing the asset count in the Midwest, while also selectively pruning flat or low growth assets from other parts of the country. We sold our last remaining shopping center in Alabama this quarter, removing another non-core estate from our ownership map. The blended cap rate through the first half of the year was at the lower end of our expected range reflecting positively on both the quality of the centers being sold and the investor demand.","Through the first half of the year, we continue to be impressed by the level of activity and the profile of those bidding on our properties. Demand for our sites remains strong with readily available debt capital at continued low interest rates.","With the tenure settling around 3%, borrowing remains an attractive opportunity to maximize yield on investment for buyers. Highlighted during the recent recon in Las Vegas and continuing through today, new bidders have emerged as well as some renewed interest from previously inactive investors. And while we have seen more sincere interest from potential portfolio buyers, we continue to see the greatest execution via one-off sales, which we will remain focused on through the back half of the year. There has been no material change in valuations or investor appetite for high quality core major markets. We have seen continued strong demand for institutional quality assets with recent transaction at five caps or below in South Florida, New Jersey, Atlanta, Southern California, Washington, D.C. and elsewhere.","Glenn will now provide additional detail on our financial performance for the quarter.","Glenn Cohen","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. Following our solid first half results, we remain confident and energized that we will meet our objectives for 2018 and position our company for growth in 2019. We are starting to realize the benefits of a high quality portfolio comprised of a strong and diverse tenant roster located primarily in the top MSAs where we see the best opportunity for growth.","Occupancy is near all-time highs and new leases continue to deliver positive, double-digit spreads. Our development projects are progressing and are expected to begin contributing to our growth in 2019 and beyond.","Now for some details on our second quarter results; NAREIT FFO was $0.39 per diluted share for the second quarter 2018, which includes $9.5 million or $0.02 per share net transactional income comprised primarily of $5.6 million from preferred equity profit participations and $3.6 million from an equity method distribution above our basis. NAREIT FFO per share for the second quarter last year was $0.41 and includes $0.03 per share of net transactional income mostly from the $23.7 million distribution received from our Albertsons investment.","FFO is adjusted or recurring FFO which excludes transactional income and expense and non-operating impairments with a $155.7 million or $0.37 per share for the second quarter 2018 compared to a $160.7 million or $0.38 per share for the second quarter last year and reflects the impact of our successful disposition program.","Our operating portfolio continues to improve and deliver positive results. During the quarter, the operating team executed 369 leases totaling 2 million square feet and an average rent per square foot of just over $18.","Our average base rent for the entire portfolio has increased 4.6% over the past year and 5.2% when you exclude our ground leases. Total occupancy is at 96%, up 50 basis points from the year ago and our anchor occupancy is at 98.1%, up 60 basis points from a year ago.","Same-site, NOI growth was 3.9% for the second quarter, including 10 basis points from redevelopment. Of particular note is the fact that 80% of the same site growth came from increased minimum rent and percentage rent. For the six-month same-site NOI growth was 3.2%. In terms of the second half same site NOI growth for 2018, as Conor indicated we will be impacted by the Toys \"R\" Us liquidation as well as the tough year-over-year comp for the third quarter.","Mitigating this impact is the widespread of 310 basis points that remains between our least and economic occupancy levels. After factoring in these items and based on our year-to-date performance, we are raising our same site NOI guidance range from 1.5% to 2% to a new range of 2% to 2.5% and believe the upper end of the increased range is achievable.","Our balance sheet and liquidity position are in excellent shape. We ended the second quarter with over $300 million in cash, zero outstanding on our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and no debt maturing for the balance of the year. We also opportunistically utilized our common share repurchase program to buy back 3.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $14.53 per share, totaling $50.8 million, representing a 10% FFO yield and a 7.7% dividend yield. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.1 million common shares at weighted average price of $14.73, totaling $75.1 million.","Our consolidated net debt or recurring EBITDA remained at 5.7x same as the first quarter. And when you include the transactional EBITDA the metric improves to 5.5x.","In addition, as a result of the progress made on the disposition program, we have elected to exercise the make-hold provision and repay early our $300 million 6.875% bond due in October 2019. This bond is our most expensive unsecured debt instrument and will be repaid in late August. We will incur a charge of approximately $13 million or $0.03 per share in the third quarter that will be included in our NAREIT FFO. With the repayment of this bond, we will have no debt maturing until 2020 and our weighted average debt maturity will be over 11 years.","We remain focused on reducing net debt to EBITDA. A key driver will be the EBITDA contribution that will flow once the development projects with $530 million invested today start to come online in late 2018 and into 2019.","Based on our first half performance and expectations for the balance of the year we are raising the bottom end of our NAREIT FFO per share and FFO as adjusted per share guidance range from $1.42 to $1.46 to a new range of $1.43 to $1.46. The NAREIT FFO per share range includes the net transactional income to date and the anticipated early debt prepayment charge of $0.03 in the third quarter that I previously mentioned.","And with that we'd be happy to answer your questions.","David Bujnicki","We're ready to move to the Q and A portion of the call. To make the Q and A more efficient, you may ask a question with an additional follow-up. If you have additional questions, you're more than welcome to rejoin the queue.","You may take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the Q&A session [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Samir Khan of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Samir Khan","Good morning, guys. So Conor, you mentioned the same-store NOI guidance and when you look at your same store guide, it implies a deceleration of -- to about 1.3% for the second half. I mean, Toys is certainly having an impact of 70 to 80 bips which you mentioned. So you know, what are sort of the other headwinds that kind of get you to the 1.3 in the second half here?","Conor Flynn","Well, you're right, I did go into detail about the impact of the Toys. We'll have to see how that PropCo auction plays out still. But we feel actually very comfortable in the high end of our 2% to 2.5% range. As you've seen in our operating fundamentals that the leasing volume continues to be near all-time highs, but that is the real focus of us is continuing to look at the back half of the year and continuing to push that.","Ross Cooper","Yes, it's quiet. The other thing I'd offer is that during the third quarter of last year, we received a pretty substantial tax refund of about $1.5 million that is not there this year, on one of our sites. So that just adds to the tougher comp comparison.","Samir Khan","Okay. And I guess as a follow-up, I know you don't have an estimate or a guide for '19 yet, but it feels like with Toys paying rent a bit longer in '18, the setup going into '19 doesn't seem to be that great, so it'll be more of a headwind. So what are the things we need to think about from a tailwind perspective as we formulate our thesis for '19 here from a same-store perspective?","Glenn Cohen","Well, again, we're not going to give guidance yet. We're only halfway through 2018. But there are some positives if you look at it. We have a least-to-economic occupancy gap of 310 basis points today. And quite candidly that gap is probably going to widen a little bit as we start re-leasing some of these Toys boxes, so you're going to wind up with more leasing done there and widen that gap a little bit until it starts narrowing when those flows start coming online. Remember same site is in our case cash-base.","Conor Flynn","Yes, I would just add that of the 15 OpCo leases that we have control over, almost half of them are already PropCo [ph], so we feel really good about the momentum we have going there.","Samir Khanal","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Go ahead, sir.","Craig Schmidt","I guess just on the follow-up, if you had to speculate will Toys\"R\"Us be a bigger impact in 2018 or 2019?","Glenn Cohen","I would say probably have a little bit more impact potentially in '19. Because, again, where we sit today, we still have a lot of rent that's still flowing, right. I mean, really through the first six months of the year, except for four of the boxes, everything has been paid so far. And with the seven PropCo leases, those are still paying as well, so. I mean, it's going to come down to the timing of when from a same-site perspective when those flows start happening. But I think Dave maybe will add here, the prospects on leasing strong. We feel good about being able to get them leased up pretty quickly.","David Jamieson","Yes, and thanks, Glenn. As we have reiterated on past calls, the demand side for the Toys\"R\"Us boxes continue to be very, very strong. And as Conor referenced, we have almost half of those resolved in the OpCo entity. And we continue to pre-lease the PropCos in the case we do actually recapture some of those boxes. And we've seen excellent activity on those that we just recaptured this quarter as well. So we feel very comfortable with where we stand today in terms of the demand side of this, and see it as a positive outcome longer-term.","Glenn Cohen","Yes, don't lose sight of the fact of just how diverse our portfolio is. Although the Toys thing is clearly a headline item, again it makes up -- we're talking about 70-80 basis points of total ABR where we've already re-leased and have a sign for the boxes now the lease is coming online. So headline issue more than anything else I think.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. And then just on the non same-store sales -- I mean, sorry, non same-store NOI, even if we exclude Puerto Rico it's down significantly. I just wonder what's in that bucket.","Conor Flynn","In terms of the same-site NOI, that's -- rather the NOI coming from non same-site locations, Craig?","Craig Schmidt","Yes, the non same-store NOI, and then given your footnote I subtract that out. I'm coming down with a decrease of about 41%.","Conor Flynn","Those are primarily properties that we acquired during last year, Craig. That's pretty much outside of Puerto Rico. That's really what it is driving that.","Craig Schmidt","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Metz","Hey guys, good morning. As I look at the same-store detail on page nine, your recoveries have been trending higher than your actual increase in expenses. Is this simply a reflection of the higher occupancy leading to greater recoveries? And then in terms of the tenant improvement dollars it looked this is the highest it's been on a quarterly basis in a few years. So just wondering, are you having to get more today to drive leasing or this more reflective of some of the box leasing you're doing and higher overall churn you're replacing? Just some color on those trends would be great.","David Jamieson","This is Dave. So I'll take the first one and the second. So with the first one we have year-over-year the economic occupancy is higher, so you're spot-on on that, it's helped with the recovery income. We'll continue to see that trend on a go-forward basis. As it relates to the TI dollars and the contributions, in general, we haven't seen a change in deal costs. It's not as if the tenants themselves are demanding more to induce them to come into our centers. It's really driven by the population of the tenancy at any give point in time. So when you look at our operating real estate lease summary sheet, on the new lease side you'll see on this quarter it's actually around $13.10, while the trailing four quarters was about $15. So we're right in line there, actually a little bit less.","On the non-Comp side it is elevated a little bit this quarter, really driven by two specific deals that were value-creation deals. If you less those out we'd be at $21 a foot, which falls below our trailing four quarters, so we're still pretty much in line with where we'd expect to be.","Jeremy Metz","Okay. And then maybe a question for Conor or Ray if he's on the line here, but it looks like Glass Lewis recently recommended against the Albertsons Rite Aid deal. I know it's a little early. But assuming the transaction doesn't come to fruition, how do you think about monetizing that investment going forward as it seems like that's seemingly going to -- or it was going to unlock some needed capital starting in 2019. And I guess if it doesn't happen could we maybe see you needed to ramp this position again to fund that gap?","Raymond Edwards","Hi. This is Ray. With respect to the Albertsons and Rite Aid transaction, for us, at least on the Albertsons side they are really performing really well. The last two -- they've got two straight quarters of same-store comp growth. This last quarter they beat the EBITDA with $44 million above last year's. And they're really trending very well. So to the extent that if Rite Aid shareholders don't approve the transaction, I think we're very well suited for the company going forward to take other opportunities. You saw today the transaction with SUPERVALU. There's been a lot of consolidation in the grocery business on the wholesale side. But I think there's a lot of opportunities going forward for Albertsons, and we'll just keep our head down and keep making money on that end and work it out as you go forward. But I think Glenn also wants to talk about the capital part.","Glenn Cohen","Yes, from the capital standpoint again, as I've mentioned several times already, there's nothing in our numbers for '18 or '19 as it relates to Albertsons. We remain completely focused on execution around the portfolio, our dispositions, the balance sheet management, our developments, our redevelopments. When and if Albertsons happens it'll be a positive for us, but there's nothing baked into our numbers for it. And as I mentioned, we have no debt maturities and enormous amounts of liquidity at this standpoint. So we are very comfortable with our capital position.","Raymond Edwards","And our disposition plan for '19 will not be impacted one way or the other, so that wouldn't impact our desire or need to ramp up dispos in '19.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Mr. Brian Hawthorne of RBC. Please go ahead.","Brian Hawthorne","Hi. My first question is, so conceptually when you look at the increase in shop occupancy, can you kind of frame it up for us as what's really driven that. Is that from increased leasing or more is that just from dispositions?","David Jamieson","No, I'd say -- this is Dave. The higher quality portfolio is clearly starting to showcase its benefits. The higher occupancy it's driven by accelerated lease up of the vacancies. Those vacancies are typically vacant less time as opposed to those sites that we've sold in the past. In addition, our retention rates are higher as well, so that's obviously a big contributor to maintaining an increase in your occupancy quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So that's where we see a massive improvement in terms of our occupancy rates.","Ross Cooper","Yes, in fact the dispositions through the first-half of the year averaged 96% occupancy. So the assets that we're selling are actually primarily stabilized.","David Jamieson","You really see the boost coming from the growing economy. And the small shops are really driven by either local entrepreneurs, franchisees. And that's really where the -- and then also we've seen a big boost from medical, from fitness, from health and wellness, from service, and from restaurants. And so those areas of the economy are booming and they continue to really drive the occupancy growth in our small shops.","Brian Hawthorne","Okay. And then the other one, when you look at your watch list have you seen the shift mix from -- in terms of like the anchor versus shop split?","Ross Cooper","I don't think the mix [technical difficulty] all that much. The mix has always been a focus on retailers that have gotten themselves in a bit of trouble, whether it's through over-leveraged or a distressed business plan. So that really hasn't changed the shift or the mix of the watch list.","Q \u2013 Brian Hawthorne","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning out there. Just few questions, first, just going back to the Albertsons, on last call you guys said that you expected to vote in July, now the vote is in August, Glenn, you'd been pretty clear that there's a lot of capital that's going to come out of monetizing Albertsons that's non-dilutive because you're not booking any income against it. So it does seem like monetizing Albertsons is critical to you guys de-leveraging and getting on your run rate especially when we look at dividend coverage which is pretty tight and the sales this year mean that you're going to have to increase it despite the very tight coverage.","So if you could just walk through, it just seem to Jeremy's question, it wasn't maybe I suppose would have liked but just if Albertsons doesn't happen, how do you plan to de-lever in a non-dilutive way or should we assume that in our modeling that if this doesn't happen that there will be dilution and just a little bit more from Ray on why the vote was pushed from July to August sounds like Albertsons doesn't have the votes to win.","Glenn Cohen","Okay, so couple of things. First, as it relates to leverage, again there's nothing in our numbers for 2019 and our leverage is going to naturally come down because we have all these developments and redevelopments that are going to start flowing and producing further EBITDA. Now the reality is if Albertsons doesn't happen, it does happen and it monetizes, the leverage comes down that much quicker. To your point, we're not booking any income and we would have this inflow of cash but we have not based our forecasts on that happening. So we're not really concerned about it, leverage will naturally come down over time. It accelerates in the event that monetization happens.","Conor Flynn","Alex, we feel very comfortable with our capital plan to fund everything we're looking to do in 2019 with the plan we have in place with no Albertsons monetization whatsoever because the EBITDA will come online, it will improve the dividend coverage not the way we're running the business. We're focused on running the business not having a investment that we don't control the monetization of impacting that.","Alexander Goldfarb","Is the read on the vote has not changed?","Raymond Edwards","Yes, I mean -- this is Ray, I mean the reason for the timing of doing perspective, it isn't really procedurally, they have to get your approval on the final okay from the SEC of what they will file the S-4, they had to negotiate that. It took a couple of weeks long than they thought and they felt instead of giving 30 days get like 40 odd days for the vote to happen. It's just the decision they made, they really think middle July or early August kind of rounding and timing, it was nothing else than that.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then just as a second question, everyone's favorite topic FASB accounting, Glenn have you guys have an estimate for what the change in internal lease accounting is going to impact your 2019 numbers?","Glenn Cohen","We do, I mean our initial estimate based on what we've done is it will impact it by about $0.02 to $0.03 somewhere between $8 million and $11 million. So that will be -- that's got to be taken into account as you're doing guidance numbers for 2019.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.","Christy McElroy","Hey, good morning everyone. Just a follow-up on the discussion around the second half, same-store trajectory there was a lot of talk about the Toys impact but just as it relates to the leases that have been executed but yet to commence, I think you had previously talked about $15 million of rent commencing in second half, can you maybe provide an update on that number and in terms of like timing, is that weighted more to Q4 as we think about the same-store trajectory going from Q3 which sounds like there's going to be a more significant deceleration to Q4 which is maybe more muted?","Glenn Cohen","Yes, I would say that the third quarter would be our low point in terms of quarterly same-site NOI growth and you'll see start picking up again in the fourth quarter and again we raised our guidance. So we're comfortable at that 2% to 2.5% range and that we are comfortable that we will get towards the upper end of that range as well.","Christy McElroy","Great, so just an update on the $15 million; is that still generally within the range or is it higher?","Conor Flynn","Yes, Christy, that's still\u2026","Glenn Cohen","It's still within the range but it will be more weighted towards the fourth quarter.","Christy McElroy","Okay, okay, perfect. And then, Ross, just how should we think about that accelerated pace of disposition and what sounds like, what you talked about a decent transaction market conditions in terms of where you expect to fall on the full year range, which it remains pretty wide at this point recognizing your comments that 2019 volume will fall off but obviously the difference between an incremental $150 million from here versus $350 million in second half has pretty meaningful implications for how we're thinking about further dilution in 2019.","Maybe you could give us a little bit more of a precise, more precision in terms of where you expect to fall in the range?","Ross Cooper","Sure. It was always the team's goal to push as much of the dispositions to the first half of the year as possible. So we're very pleased with that, I think you will see a little bit of a slowdown in Q3 in terms of total volume certainly compared to Q2 but to your point given where we are and that the pace and the execution, we would expect that at a minimum will be at the midpoint and probably towards the upper end of that range by the end of the year.","Christy McElroy","Okay, that's helpful, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Vince Tibone of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.","Vince Tibone","Good morning. For the seven Toys boxes that have been resolved, when do you expect those leases to commence and do you expect the time to backfill Toys or how will the time to backfill Toys compare to the time it took to backfill Sports Authority in your mind?","Glenn Cohen","Sure. With the first, the first question as it relates to the seven, we had four that were signed this last quarter so there's obviously no doubt having rent there, resumed immediately and so that resolves, as it relates to two that release, we'd expect to start flowing towards the back half of end of 2018 into 2019 and we did sell one within the quarter as well. So that was, that totals up to your seven, as it relates to the balance, we've always stated, we expect them all get resolved within the next 18 to 24 months.","Vince Tibone","Okay, that's helpful. The four that were assumed, how does that number maybe compared to what you were expecting at the beginning of liquidation process, I know some are still outstanding or still in the process but I'm just curious compared to your expectations?","Glenn Cohen","That results a better than our original assumption expectations.","Vince Tibone","Okay, great. And then one more for me, can you quantify how much the switch from variable to fix cam this year has impacted the same-store in the first half and I think you have said it was an incremental boost in the first quarter, so that is the same in the second quarter and this is going to be kind of a headwind slightly in the second half, just given the comps?","Glenn Cohen","It probably helps us 20, 30 basis points at the beginning part of the year but I think it's going to all balance out when we're all set and done. So again we remain comfortable with the guidance range that we've put out.","Vince Tibone","Okay, thank you, that' all I have.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Mueller","Yes, hi. Just a quick one here, how much of the 50 basis points same-store NOI increase is coming from the slower unwind of Toys?","Conor Flynn","I have to break it out.","Glenn Cohen","It's probably not a lot Mike. To be honest, I mean it really was happening as rent commencements are a key driver for us in the same-site growth because again like cash bit. So the rents are really starting to flow and you see that of the 3.8% same-site growth for the quarter, 3% of it or 80% of the number is really coming from the minimum rent law. So that's more of the driver, I mean the Toys \"R\" Us has modest impact at this point, it's more of the back half that's in there.","Michael Mueller","Okay, that was it, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Rich Hill","Hey, good morning guys. Just want to spend a little bit of time on CapEx and get your opinion from how we're supposed to be thinking about it, it looks like quarter-over-quarter had increased and I recognized that can be pretty noisy, it doesn't look like it's that far off from where it was the year-end 12\/31\/17 but you've also sort of obviously you had done a good job in reducing the size of your portfolio, so I'm curious how we should be thinking about CapEx going forward and if you're seeing any changes in sort of your mix of CapEx spend between end line and Big Box or there have your CapEx spend per square foot increasing, anything that you can give us color on that, that would be really helpful?","Conor Flynn","Sure. Similar I referenced earlier is that on our page in terms of new lease fields and cost associated with those is really inductive of what's in the population on a quarter-over-quarter basis, so it will vary as a result of that in this quarter for example we executed more anchor releases them prior quarter, so you'll see an elevation in terms of number of deals and GLA executed compared to Q1 which will have an impact on the numbers as well but as I reference in the non-comp new leases it is elevated at $36 this quarter driven by specific deals, you strip those out and you back to $21 which is in line with trailing four, actually slightly below that. So on a go forward basis, we continue to see our deal cost remaining pretty much where they been historically.","Glenn Cohen","I would just add that. The demand for the Toy boxes we've been pleasantly surprised that they're being back filled by a single user, so when you look at the CapEx net effective rents it does benefit and accelerate the RCBs the recommends the days when you have a single user battling that box and so for the first round of leases that we've done they've single users coming out of those boxes which is a nice benefit to see.","Rich Hill","Got it. Okay, that's it for me. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Stephen Kim of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ki Bin Kim","Hey, thanks. This is Ki Bin. Going back to these accounting questions, I thought I was in under the impression that you guys might change the way you comment faith your leasing agents in order to not be really impacted by this ASU for two. And so it sounds like there was a change?","Conor Flynn","No, we have modified it somewhat that will be able to continue to capitalize some of those costs but they're other cost that are much part of the capital is a lot of legal costs that we're able to capitalists is that you won't be able to under the lease accounting and you can have less all of the costs that we have today so in total I mean again we're primarily a very internal leasing organization again as I mentioned I think there is an $8 million to $11 million impact in total for the year.","Glenn Cohen","We did try to get out of it and change our compensation plan to address it but there're obviously things that going to pointed out that it doesn't capture just the leasing side of it.","Ki Bin Kim","Right, so it didn't change the compensation plan. It would have been maybe like $5 million higher is that was the delta?","Conor Flynn","Yes, I mean he would have been much higher followed by another $0.02 or $0.03.","Ki Bin Kim","Okay. And just going back to your asset sales, obviously have made some pretty good progress the first half, can you give us a sense about the occupancy rates ABR and the account overall quality of what you sold so far and they cap rates as well?","Conor Flynn","Sure. Yes, the occupancy was average out right at 96%, so they're primarily stabilized assets as it was previously mentioned I mean there's good quality assets there outside of markets that we view as long-term growth markets for us and may not have the redevelopment or value add potential that our coastal portfolio, our portfolio in Texas and a couple of other select markets have which is why we've ultimately decided to exit those but that the quality is fine and tenancy is stable in many cases good credit, so the demand has been there.","The better pools have been relatively deep more so than we saw in 2017 AV is sort of right around or slightly below the average of the remainder of the portfolio so you're seeing a slight uptick based upon the dispositions in the go forward portfolio but overall within the portfolio there were there's no real distress remaining even the disposition that we're selling are well stabilized solid assets.","Ki Bin Kim","And the cap rate was?","Conor Flynn","Yes, so the cap rate to the first half we're is still on the low end of that 7.5% to 8% range and we continue to see that at the low to mid point of cap rate range going forward.","Ki Bin Kim","Right, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, good morning. Glenn, I guess a couple for you. One I guess you heard to the gap between the lease and occupied space looks like about 310 basis points which is very similar to what it was at this point last year, so I'm curious how much of the closing of that gap is implied in your outlook for same side of NOI the back half of the year and how would you describe your overall leasing conversation the process and finding that the tends occupied diminishing and asked especially because last year at this time again we're expecting that gap between the physical and the least a tailwind to materialize but it took a bit longer?","Glenn Cohen","Well, again the gap is widening primarily because the toys are up liquidation, so you have the good news is that we've least the boxes. The bad news at the moment is that with the rents not flowing for same site purposes, so you have is winding that's occurred. The gap will probably stay this wide during the second half of the year because as we go into the third quarter, you're going to have more leases that move more toys boxes that came back us in the third quarter and then it's a matter of the lease up that's going to go with it, so the more leasing that actually gets done but why do that gap is going to be until we test thoughts flowing.","Conor Flynn","Which set this up for 2019 to have to be a strong.","Glenn Cohen","Correct. And then on your second part I'm going to turn it over to David terms of the timing on the leases getting done with the tenants.","David Jamieson","Yes, in terms of the choice, we're going to see and generally I think that timely leases has maintain itself historically as what we've seen with choice 18 to 24 months as it relates to the other anchor leases, we continue to see between a leasing an executed an opening on the sat around 10 months.","Haendel St. Juste","Got it. Okay. And then, Glenn, and just follow up on one more the -- curious on your appetite for stock buyback here given your recent run the stock here over 2017 you're buying your David Price below 15 assuming the stock price holds here curious how you thinking about allocating those incremental business and proceed beyond your normal reed of?","Glenn Cohen","Again the primary focus for us is to continue to improve overall net debt to EBITDA. We were very opportunistic buying the stock back at under $15 a share as I mentioned 10% FFO yields, 77 dividend yields, so we'll watch what cost of the capital is. Again, we also just announced that we're going to pay off our $300 million dollars bond, so we're going to use cash to help bring those debt levels down, so it's really washing with quite a bit of capital is to where that stock prices and then trying to do best capital allocation as we see fit.","Conor Flynn","There were still trading at a sizeable discount to net asset value, so it obviously still is a piece of the capital allocation plan that we have, now we have plenty of opportunity to utilize that.","Haendel St. Juste","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Linda Tsai of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Linda Tsai","Hi, the 115 credit losses you forecasted for 2019 how much of you you've used on a year-to-date basis?","Glenn Cohen","We've used probably that half of it so far then in the balance of the probably good use we go to the rest of the toy boxes, so we still feel comfortable that we are credible levels off of the year are really the appropriate level.","Linda Tsai","And then in the centers where Toys went dark, did it create any potency issues in terms of other retailers leaving?","Glenn Cohen","Not really, no.","Linda Tsai","Okay. And then just any update on Puerto Rico, I think Puerto Rico is in the same property numbers right now and is going to have a beneficial impact when it reenters the pool in 2019?","Glenn Cohen","Well, it's not actually going to reenter the pool in 2019 we removed it, so we can keep focused on the continental U.S. is the same site pool and if you look at our same site pool is probably the largest most complete fool of pretty much anyone there's only an asset in total that are not in the same cycle today several of those are Puerto Rico assets but in terms of operations Puerto Rico has performed pretty well.","Our occupancy level is back to where it was prior to the hurricane. The guys and our team have done a tremendous job getting the properties back in shape and we've actually benefited from the fact that we actually had capital and people on the ground to repair those properties quickly where some of the other retail property owners really just didn't have the access to the capital or the really the product kind of fits their properties up, so we've really been able to benefit from some further lease up.","Linda Tsai","Thanks.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Bujnicki for any closing remarks.","David Bujnicki","Thank you for participating on our call today. I'm available to answer any follow-up questions you may have, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki. Please go ahead.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Laura. Thank you, all, for joining Kimco's fourth quarter 2012 earnings call. With me on the call this morning is Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Pappagallo, Chief Operating Officer; Glenn Cohen, Chief Financial Officer; as well as other key executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking statements. It is important to note that the company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","Finally, during the Q&A portion of the call, we request that you respect the limit of 1 question so that all of our callers have an opportunity to speak with management. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave Henry.","David B. Henry","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We are happy to report strong fourth quarter and full year financial results as well as continued progress on our key goals and objectives. As customary, Glenn and Mike will provide details and color and Milton will close with some general observations.","Overall, the shopping center industry in our portfolio in particular continues to demonstrate steady and sustained improvement across the board, benefiting from population growth and very little new development. Effective rents and occupancy rates are increasing at an accelerating rate.","Our key metrics or vital signs, as we like to say, are very strong with 11 straight quarters of positive same-store NOI growth and an occupancy rate just under 94%, representing our highest level since the start of the recession and very high leasing spreads.","Store opening counts continues to hit multiyear highs and small store vacancy levels are improving, while the economy continues to be fragile with uncertain fiscal policies. We are optimistic about the 2013 financial performance of our portfolio and the shopping center industry.","During the quarter, we made good progress on several of our key objectives. Our sales contract with Starwood Capital on the InTown portfolio is now firm with no due diligence contingencies, and the sale is expected to close in the second quarter when the complicated loan assumption process is completed. The InTown properties themselves continue to perform well.","During the quarter, Blackstone signed a definitive agreement with UBS Wealth Management-North American Property Fund, to purchase their equity interest in 2 large Kimco-managed UBS retail joint ventures, encompassing 40 high-quality shopping centers containing approximately 5.6 million square feet. The total transaction value is approximately $1.1 billion. And Kimco is the current operating partner and presently owns approximately 18% of the combined ventures. We have reached preliminary agreement with Blackstone to increase our ownership interest from 18% to 33% and to continue to provide management and leasing services to the new joint venture.","Also, as previously announced, we are very pleased to continue our participation in a 6-year-old service-led consortium, which is now acquiring just under 900 grocery stores across 5 established and distinguished grocery brands. The transaction will reunite the Albertsons stores the consortium already owns, approximately 200, with the Albertsons currently operated by SUPERVALU, approximately 400. In addition to the obvious synergies, all of the brands should benefit from the proven operating management team led by Bob Miller.","I would also like to again note our progress in recycling the Kimco shopping center portfolio. During 2012, we sold 68 shopping center properties in the U.S., which in general read or not in our key long-term markets, were represented lower quality assets. At the same time, during 2012, we acquired 24 additional shopping centers with generally excellent demographics, strong tenants and long-term growth. We are committed to continuing quarter-by-quarter to upgrade our portfolio, focusing on larger properties within our key markets. The sale of the remaining non-strategic and non-retail investments will provide the capital to acquire additional high-quality retail assets.","On the international front, Canada continues to perform very well with high occupancies and growing retailer demand. We are particularly proud that Target has selected one of the RioKim joint venture properties, Danforth, to open their very first Canadian Target store. This will be the first of 25 Target store openings per quarter in Canada, which should be transformational in the Canadian retail industry. With 9 new scheduled Targets in our Canadian joint ventures, we are confident of both income and occupancy growth.","In our Latin American portfolio, we are encouraged by the continued lease up progress in our Mexican properties, coupled with a suddenly very vibrant real estate capital market. Four recent Mexican IPOs and several follow-on equity offerings of the fertile Mexican REIT, Fibra Uno are driving property values higher as the existing REITs, perspective REITs and Mexican insurance companies and pension funds are all looking for quality real estate properties. The Mexican economy is also performing well with a GDP growth rate of approximately 4%, unemployment at 5% and a very strong manufacturing sector. Mexico is now the fourth largest car manufacturer in the world.","With respect to South America, where we own a small property portfolio consisting of 2 projects in Brazil, 2 in Peru and 11 in Chile, we have decided to monetize over time our investments. Notwithstanding impressive projected GDP growth rates, we simply do not have the scale or an efficient tax structure to meaningfully grow the South American portfolio. We do expect to sell our South American properties at a gain, given the robust real estate market in South America. However, capital gain taxes will be significant in several of the countries.","In the future, we expect to focus our energies on North America and as mentioned before, concentrate on certain key primary core markets which in general are highlighted by strong demographics, limited retail per capita, barriers to entry, larger sized properties and higher population densities. We are determined to achieve over time a consensus among our shareholders and analysts that Kimco truly owns and operates great products.","And now, I would like to turn to Glenn to discuss the financial details of the quarter, to be followed by Mike and Milton.","Glenn G. Cohen","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. We finished 2012 with a strong fourth quarter and delivered full year FFO as adjusted per share growth of 5% over 2011. It was very encouraging as we were able to accomplish this during a period of meaningful asset recycling, which will continue during 2013. Our operating metrics of sustained side NOI growth occupancy and leasing spreads continue to deliver increasing positive levels. We have accelerated our shopping center recycling program and we're in the final stage of monetizing our non-retail assets. In addition, we have been opportunistic in the capital markets, which further strengthened our balance sheet metrics and liquidity position.","As we reported last night, FFO as adjusted came in at $0.33 per share, up 10% from the $0.30 level last year. This brings full year 2012 FFO as adjusted to $1.26 per share, reaching the top end of our guidance range. Headline FFO for the fourth quarter was $0.31 per share, which includes a $0.04 per share charge related to the noncash expense associated with the redemption of our $460 million, 7.75% preferred stock and net transaction income of $0.02 per share, primarily from promotes earned on several preferred equity investments.","We experienced very solid operating metrics during the fourth quarter. Combined same-site NOI growth was 3.4% including the positive impact of currency of 20 basis points. This is the highest level in the past 5 years. U.S. same-site NOI was the primary driver, delivering 3.1% growth. For the full year, combined same-site NOI growth reached 2.9%, excluding the negative currency impact of 60 basis points. Occupancy climbed to 94% on a gross basis and 92.8% on a pro-rata basis, up 30 basis points and 40 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points from the year ago.","Leasing spreads were strong at 11.8% with new leases up 25.5% and renewals and options up 6.1%. We continue to be very active on the recycling front. We sold 34 shopping center assets during the quarter, providing $180 million in proceeds and quickly redeployed the capital by purchasing 9 properties in our key territories, further evidencing our execution of the up quality trade. We expect to pursue this objective through 2013 and beyond.","The non-retail assets are down to $398 million and we have contracts or offers on over $130 million, including InTown Suites and certain of our urban assets. We expect to monetize over $200 million during 2013, bringing the non-retail exposure to a nominal amount of our $10 billion balance sheet.","In November, we took another trip to the perpetual preferred market, issuing $175 million at a coupon of 5 and 5\/8%, using the proceeds toward the repayment of a 6%, $199 million maturing bond.","In 2012, we issued a total of $800 million of perpetual preferred stock at a blended coupon of 5.78% and redeemed $635 million of perpetual preferred with a blended coupon of 7.45%. Although we reported one-time noncash charges of approximately $22 million or $0.05 per share impacting LOI and FFO for 2012, we will benefit by over $13 million a year or $0.03 per share in real cash savings and reduced fixed charges going forward.","We've improved our net debt to recurring EBITDA to 5.7x, a level better than the 6X we committed to at our 2010 Investor Day. We remain focused on the importance of balance sheet strength with a target range of net debt to recurring EBITDA of 5.5X to 6X and a fixed charge coverage of at least 2.5X.","Our liquidity position's in excellent shape with over $1.4 billion of immediate liquidity. We are pleased with our execution and results for 2012, delivering a total return to our shareholders of almost 24%. There is more to be done. Let me comment on our 2013 outlook.","We have completed our detailed property by property budget analysis and recognized that we will continue a very active shopping center portfolio recycling program further operating an overall portfolio of quality. That being said, properties we are disposing of typically have higher cap rates than properties we are acquiring. As a result, this upgrade of the portfolio might impact our near-term growth rate, but the improvement in portfolio quality should lead to increased earnings growth and higher net asset value for the long-term.","In addition, the disposition of InTown Suites expected during the second quarter has a $0.03 to $0.04 per share impact versus 2012. We will benefit from the positive capital markets activities we concluded during 2012 and expect further positive results in 2013 by reducing our overall debt costs.","We are affirming our 2013 FFO as adjusted per share guidance range of $1.28 to $1.33 with a midpoint of $1.31. At the midpoint range, the FFO per share growth is a solid 4%. This guidance is based solely on recurring flows and does not include any transaction in commerged [ph] sense, including results from our recently announced participation in the SUPERVALU transaction.","Assumptions used to determining the guidance range included increase in occupancy of 50 to 75 basis points, combined positive same-site NOI growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, a significant acquisition and disposition activity. The guidance range is dependent on timing of this activity. In addition, it is worth reminding everyone that there is some seasonality in our quarterly earnings. For example, the timing of our annual equity compensation awards, which occurs in the first quarter and the timing of refinancing of our maturing debt. Our capital plan once again does not assume any new equity requirements and supports our recently increased dividend level of $0.21 per quarter, which equates to an FFO payout ratio of 64%, one of the lowest in the industry.","Now I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael V. Pappagallo","Thanks, Glenn. Good morning. We were very pleased with the fourth quarter performance metrics for occupancy spreads and organic growth, but more importantly, the overall shape and direction the portfolio is taking for the long-term.","In reflecting on the portfolio trends over the past year, I'd offer that a couple of metrics underscore what is happening in the U.S. portfolio. As reported, overall U.S. occupancy increased by 80 basis points over the course of the year to 93.9%. First, the occupancy attributable to what we delineate as anchor space over 10,000 square feet increased 50 basis points this year to 96.9%. Meanwhile, the smaller shops spaces increased 170 basis points to 84.2%. Those numbers not only point to the ongoing demand for real estate by larger national or regional chains, but also showed a steady -- slow and steady improvement in the economic climate, as evidenced by the increasing absorption of space by the smaller users.","However, peeling back the onion a bit more, the bulk of the increase in the anchor space was the consequence of our disposition activity, and absorption was about flat, a concern you might think initially, but I view it as the opposite. The available space from bankruptcy such as RoomStore and Syms or the end of term vacancies from Kmart and various supermarkets were absorbed very quickly, a very different world than a few years ago. And the value of those spaces was evident by the new leasing spreads of almost 28% for the full year. As mentioned in the last call, in between the singles and doubles of leasing deals, the occasional home run is hit with the recapture of older boxes with below-market rent entered decades ago, and we certainly gained that benefit this past year. With over 1,000 leases that were originally signed more than 20 years ago in the portfolio, I feel there is still a bit more harvesting to be done with future lease rollover.","The second observation is an offshoot of the previous point regarding the turnover of the box space. While the rapid absorption underscores the demand, retenanting always comes with some downtime. And that inevitably causes a slight drag on same-site NOI metrics, which on a full-year basis was 2.5% for the U.S. However, the commencement of brands for these newer leases should result in improvement of the same-store metric for 2013, particularly as we move through the year. Of course if we have a similar level of rollover, we may have a similar level of drag, but the overall signals in growth appetite across the board remains very positive.","So with all these positive vibes, there are still no shortage of concerns, most notably what will or will not happen in Washington this year that impacts the economy and consumer confidence, not to mention how the business and general media will overdramatize anything that happens, be it good or bad.","And despite the encouraging advances of many brick-and-mortar retailers to integrate e-commerce into their business models, online retail's impact on shopping centers cannot be ignored. In response, we are focusing our energy on positioning the portfolio for long-term sustainable cash flow and growth. In that vein, we've been very pleased with the acceleration of the asset recycling.","In the fourth quarter, we sold over 3.9 million square feet of properties, generating $180 million in proceeds for reinvestment. We've brought the full-year tally to 68 properties covering 7.7 million square feet and $385 million of cash to Kimco. Those sales were doubled to 200 -- to 2011 pace, and our target is another 60 to 75 properties in 2013. The dispositions are an important part of an ongoing push to focus our resources and invest capital in what we consider the company's key territories. We remain convinced that a national platform that covers most all of the largest MSAs in the country, a property-base that allows us to serve as one of the top landlords to most national retailers, and that our base is broad enough to maintain a spread of financial risk, it has enough depth in major markets to capture new opportunities is our core investment proposition.","While this model doesn't give you necessarily the highest comparable demographics or average rents, but what it does do from the recycling efforts, the particular metrics will improve. And most importantly is to focus and maintain that reservoir of assets to generate stable and consistent NOI growth.","Our program is simple, exit properties in our key territories where we perceive risk, where that maximum potential has been reached, and also exit properties in other smaller markets that have no particular economies of scale over the limited opportunity set to grow.","Much of the capital generated from the dispositions have been pushed back into existing properties in 2 ways; first, the reinvestment through leasing with incremental returns, redevelopment and overall upgrade of the property base; and second, by increasing our ownership stakes in properties through a buyout of some or all of the interest in joint venture partners. I'd like to point out that in no case were these buyouts forced or the result of a dispute. It was generally the consequence of the partner wanting to monetize the position and Kimco determining that the property fit well into its longer term objectives in our key markets and territory. We expect this trend to continue into the next few years.","In our portfolio outside the U.S., prior contests mentioned of differentiation and focus on key markets and territories also comes to bear. We remain committed to our Canadian portfolio exposure as a linchpin of the overall quality foundation of the company's assets and cash flows. And even if we're not increasing that exposure in the current high-priced, limited opportunity environment in Canada, things run in cycles. And we want to hang around the hoop for the long-term.","In Latin America, Dave provided you with our strategic thinking. But what I can add is that the Mexico portfolio has built positive momentum and is reflective of some of the good fundamentals in direct Mexican economy. This portfolio contributed over $57 million to net operating income this year, an increase of 16% before currency impacts. With that, I'll turn it over to Milton.","Milton Cooper","Well, thanks, Mike. The environment for our type of retail property continues to improve. Absorptions are forecasted to outpace completions for the foreseeable future. Retail store opening plans are at a multiyear high. So while consumers will feel the impact of the end of the payroll tax holiday, some major economic indicators are pointing in the right direction. Above all, labor market is slowly improving and home prices continue to recover.","Now as you've heard from my partners, we feel pretty good about our business. A business plan is on our track. And since our Investor Day on September 23, 2010, we acquired properties of total cost of $1.3 billion and disposed of sites at a gross price of $800 million, a total transaction volume of over $2 billion. And this illustrates that there has been a meaningful transformation of the portfolio.","Please rest assured that we disposed of properties that we felt did not meet our criteria for future growth and acquired properties that we want to own long-term. The upgrade of our portfolio will greatly improve our long-term growth prospects and the property metrics and related demographics.","Well, there are 3 aspects of Kimco's business that distinguish us. First, a national platform that enables us to service the needs of retailers in any part of the United States. Two, we have joint ventures which own approximately $10 billion of real estate that have and will continue to serve as an attractive source of acquisitions over time. And three, a long-term track record of retail-related opportunities that includes profitable transactions with Venture Stores, Gold Circle, Hechinger's, Montgomery Ward, Service Merchandise, Kmart, Ames, Albertsons, Woolworths, Frank's Nursery, Strawbridge & Clothier, Sprouts, [indiscernible], I could go on and on. Now we are confident that the SUPERVALU investment will also prove rewarding over time. We continue to have the same management team headed by the legendary Bob Miller that created extraordinary value for our Albertsons investment. And I'd like to conclude by thanking our associates for the wonderful job they are doing executing on our plan. I'm excited by the future and opportunities I see ahead. Now with this, I'm very happy to take any questions.","David B. Henry","Laura, we are ready to move the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from R.J. Milligan of Raymond James.","R.J. Milligan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about specifically the SUPERVALU investment, whether or not that's purely a return expectation or whether you think it could have other positive effects on that core portfolio? And I guess whether or not you see this? And from Milton's comments, it sounds like you don't see this as a one-off opportunity, but you will continue to look at opportunistic -- opportunities and investments as they come along?","Milton Cooper","Absolutely right. The -- a, our role in the SUPERVALU transaction is as a real estate partner. We have been retained and have a fee arrangement, but our principal job is to help in the monetization of surplus real estate aspects of the transactions that require real estate expertise. And I suspect that out of that activity, there will be opportunities for acquisitions, and it should be accretive. An example, we own 50% of a wonderful property in Chicago. And who owns the other 50%? Jewel. For years, we were trying to buy Jewel from the then SUPERVALU management. Never got any place. New management sees it. They want to monetize their half. We will wind up buying a property that we wanted to buy for years. And other illustrations, we had a wonderful Shaw's Supermarket in New England. The volume, the period before SUPERVALU bought it, was $36 million, and we were thinking of expanding it. [indiscernible], the SUPERVALU management came in, the plans to expand and drop. That volume today,  led from $36 million down to $19 million. So you could see the kind of upside in the profitability and also what extra volume does to the value of the real estate. Well, basically, we're excited about a profit participation but most important, what it can lead to in real estate opportunities and enhancing our portfolio. Now this is not going to detract from what we've always wanted, being fast in our footwork to seize opportunities [indiscernible].","Operator","And our next question is from Christy McElroy of UBS.","Christy McElroy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Mike, I just wanted to follow up on your comments on occupancy. You talked about anchor space, but did your acquisitions and dispositions last year have any impact on your small-shop occupancies? So what would've been the year-over-year change on a same-space basis? And I guess, a similar question for 2013. Your occupancy guidance is up 50 to 75 basis points. How much of that is a result of capital recycling?","Mike Melson","Yes. In looking at the overall growth in 2012, the occupancy increased. About 2\/3 of it was due to disposition, 1\/3 of it was due to net absorption, in terms of the increase in the overall occupancy. And when you break down the increase in net absorption, it was clearly driven by small shop. So volume was driven by small shop in terms of the occupancy increase, but rate, that is the leasing spreads, was driven more by the anchor because we had that significant rollover positive leasing spreads, of older leases that came due. So that's 2012. As we look to 2013, while we haven't refined it down to the exact percentage, our occupancy projections are probably -- about half or more is focused on absorption and less than half is due to the recycling energy. And I think that's just the consequence of having moved out of a lot of very low occupancy difficult properties. The next round of asset, so to speak, in the 60 to 75 that I talked about, is less about poor quality and poor occupancy and more about markets, where we don't have a significant presence, reasonably good properties, but are just not a market where we have a lot of heft. And as a result, the occupancy in those properties is more to the Kimco averages.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Quentin Velleley of Citigroup.","Quentin Velleley - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just in terms of Blackstone buying UBS' joint venture assets and you increasing your stake, I think you said it was about $1.1 billion, which would imply about a 7 cap rate. I'm not sure if that math is correct. And then, just also I recall that you'd advised Blackstone on when they took the U.S. assets of Centro. Are you sort of viewing this joint venture as a long-term joint venture that could possibly grow or is it something more opportunistic?","David B. Henry","Well, first of all, the parties have asked us not to comment on the specific cap rate, and so for -- so, I'll leave you to your math on that part. But we do value our relationship with Blackstone very much. We have a great working relationship with them. As you may remember, they purchased our Valad note and we did work with them on the original Centro transaction. So we have a good working relationship with them. And we're very pleased to be able to come to terms with Blackstone to increase our stake in this wonderful portfolio. It's very high quality assets. And so, we're very happy to be going from 18% to 33%. And we're very happy to continue our role as the operating partner and continue to be paid for that. So we value them and we hope to do other things in the future with them.","Operator","And the next question is from Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Going to the asset recycling, so you said 60 to 75 properties this year, but that the composition may be a little bit higher quality. I mean, so you were around that range in 2012 and it was $600 million or so. In terms of a dollar volume, should we assume more? And then most of those proceeds were used to -- for higher quality acquisitions. Is that the way we should think of it this year? And then, kind of what will be the -- is the cap rate spread narrowing relative to last year because of the improvement quality of the asset sale?","David B. Henry","I would say, Paul, that yes, that will be 60 to 75, that it is slightly higher quality than what we've been selling the past couple of years. It's also a mix between assets that are held by the REIT as well as in joint venture assets. And not only institutional joint ventures but the array of smaller joint venture relationships that we've had, many legacy deals that we've had for years and years. So to try and put a circle around it, we've just thought about it in terms of net cash to Kimco, what it might generate in 2013. And based on some estimates, the targeted properties we are probably figuring somewhere between to $350 million to $430-some-odd million debt cash to Kimco. And that represents the purchase price minus any debt, particularly in joint ventures and in our pro-rata share.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Is the -- you've mentioned this, is the spread, cap rate spread narrowing, then we should think of that?","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes. I mean, the cap rate is most likely going be a lower cap rate than what we've experienced in the past couple of years, which is to trend -- tended to be around the 9 cap rate level.","David B. Henry","The market for, let's call it, the assets or secondary cities has definitely improved. We're seeing increasing demand, and cap rates are drifting lower. So we're encouraged by that.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Nathan Isbee of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","With this sale to Blackstone from UBS, was there any management contract change at all?","David B. Henry","No. It's important to note that basically, Blackstone is stepping into UBS' Shoes, and all of the fees and different services that we provide will stay as originally negotiated with UBS.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So there's nothing to say that Briggsmore [ph] is going to take it over at any point?","David B. Henry","No.","Operator","The next question is from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs.","Caitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","We noticed that your 2013 guidance range for FFO per share didn't change between what was given in the third quarter earnings but -- between now, but that the components of it did change. Can you go over what made the midpoint of the 2013 forecast for recurring retail go from $955.5 million to $943.5 million, non-retail go from $15 million to $18 million, corporate financing declined from 9 -- or $290.5 million to $280.5 million and G&A go down from $127 million to $124 million?","Glenn G. Cohen","Sure, but that's definitely more than 1 question. But I'd be happy to take you through that. Obviously, when we put out our preliminary guidance back in October, again, based on best estimates, we actually have more information today. Some of the changes are, you saw during the fourth quarter just some of the aggressive selling that we've begun. And Mike's also talked about a more aggressive shopping center disposition program than what we originally had. So that's driving some of the retail change. And in conjunction with that, because the capital plan has more capital proceeds in it from these transactions, our requirements for an external debt or other capital needs are lower as well. And that's kind of brought down -- that brought down the financing cost that we've now projected in the current guidance. There's a small change in the non-retail. That's really just looking at the impact of InTown. InTown, we've had, beginning of the -- beginning to the middle of the second quarter. Now we think it might be more towards the latter end of the second quarter. So not a real big change there. And on the G&A line, it's really just a bunch of small things that have changed there from lower expectation of consulting and professional cost and lower expectation need for some temporary labor.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm wrestling a bit with where you are with Mexico at this point. I mean, it seems like before maybe Mexico was something to monetize, but now the economy seems to be doing very well down there. Asset prices are climbing. Maybe it's a place to invest more in. So I guess, what are your current thoughts on your Mexican investment strategy?","David B. Henry","Well, first of all, let's go through the list. We are very pleased that there's been a pickup of momentum in terms of leasing activities. So we're seeing it on the ground. The rents are going the right way. The occupancy is going the right way. We're also absolutely fascinated how quickly the capital markets have changed down there. The new public REITs and the demand for product of all types in Mexico is really quite amazing for somebody that's been following Mexico for a long time. Investors are literally pouring into the country looking for real estate. And it's a thin market in terms of quality real estate. So what we have, we think is much more valuable. And to be honest with you, we are looking at different things we can do. The IPO market is robust. We'd be foolish not to look at the IPO market. We have been approached by a number of existing REITs, perspective REITs and funds to acquire some of our high-quality properties. We, as you know, we have different operating partners and we have an institutional partner, capital partner, GE, all of whom have different long-term objectives in Mexico. So we will be going basically property-by-property and partner-by-partner in deciding what to do long-term. Now the other side of the coin is because cap rates have plummeted, it's not very attractive for us to buy properties. These cap rates are very low. So just like Canada, it's unlikely that we're going to increase our stake down there. But we have decided, as I mentioned, in South America to exit. We're just not big enough. Taxes are tough down there and notwithstanding the prognosis for the South American countries down there in terms of the economy, it's just not a good game for us and somewhat of a diversion.","Operator","And the next question is from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, looking at the new leasing spreads, they've been pretty strong in the 20s the last 2 quarters. And when you look out to 2013, do you expect it to be at comparable level? And when do you think you start to hit up against tougher comps? Is it '13? Is it '14? Do you have a few more years of visibility?","Glenn G. Cohen","As a general statement, Mike, I'd say that in looking at '13, the comps will be lower. And the primary reason is when thinking about our core leasing plan having the anchors at 97% occupied, most of the absorption is going to come and the leasing spreads are going to come from smaller spaces. And the smaller space is a little bit more of a mixed bag. We've got some great upside in certain markets and other markets are pretty tough. We've talked ad nauseam in the past about some of the markets in Vegas and Reno and Central Valley in California, et cetera that seem to temper the leasing spreads. That said, you can expect the unexpected. And what we've seen over the past couple of years, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, hit that home run or 2 on a big anchor deal that may turn over that gives you some extra juice. On balance, it's going to be positive. I'm not going to predict these big double-digit numbers that we had this year, but more directionally just map this out for the last 3 or 4 years in where we're heading, it's all heading in the right direction and the arrow keeps moving up. That's the best I can offer and I can't think about '14, '15, '16 because there are just too many variables that would affect a leasing spread.","David B. Henry","But Mike did hit on a strong asset of Kimco. We've got lots and lots of older leasing. When people look at our average rent, it has upside. So in general, we think we are going to outperform in terms of these leasing spreads. It's just difficult to project these very high double digits to continue.","Operator","And the next question is from Andrew Schaffer of Sandler O'Neill.","Andrew Schaffer","Just wondering, given the recent growth in private REITs, are you finding that they are the primary buyers of the dispositions or you're kind of finding them flocked more to the core product?","David B. Henry","We find them A buyer. They're certainly looking for yield and they can find the yield in some of these secondary markets and B assets. But interestingly, we actually find local buyers being particularly aggressive on one-off transactions. They think they can do a little better job in their own market than we can. They're buying some vacancy and that's just fine with us.","Operator","And next, there is a question from Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just looking at CapEx for a second, when I look at, on Page 29, your new leases and the TIs that you provided on the fourth quarter leases were roughly 20% of NOI, is there anything that happened at a few of the leases that you had? Or is there a trend to providing a little more TIs in CapEx nowadays?","Glenn G. Cohen","Essentially, the TIs and the CapEx that are provided are reflective of the market, the ability to attract the rent in a given market and who's paying the rent. So in our case, the TIs have gone up and as a direct consequence of where the leases are being signed and who's signing them. The big drivers this quarter are Nordstrom Rack in Colombia, replacing a RoomStore, a DSW in Manhasset, New York and Long Island. So we actually recycled an old, underperforming supermarket with an LA Fitness. All of these are relatively high rents because of the market -- that last, LA Fitness was in Staten Island. High-rent markets, drivers with tenants who can't pay the capital, there has to be a capital contribution. And when you look at the net effect of rent, it's still increasing. When you look at the capital cost and proportion to the rent, you're still recovering about 86%, 87% of the gross rent. And that's been the trend over the past couple of years. So on balance looking at dealmaking, not CapEx as a percentage of a static NOI, which could reflect a lot of under-market rents, we feel we're at market. We've not overcharging, so to speak, or we're not buying up rents that sometimes they have that concept that's thrown out there, just reflective of better markets, better tenants, good leases.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just staying on the topic and I'll squeeze in a second question on that. Do you think that as you lease some perhaps of the tougher space that you have that you will continue to have CapEx of this nature, roughly 20% of NOI or do you think you can reduce that?","Glenn G. Cohen","It comes down to the composition of the leases -- the spaces, the sizes. You've seen a growth in capital tenant improvement dollars generally associated with large boxes, larger tenants and better markets. My earlier point that proportionally, more of the leases -- the lease volume in 2013 and probably beyond will be in smaller tenants. I don't think the average ticket price, capital, will probably be lower. But there's still a little bit more runway in some anchor deals that we have on the table. But I can't say we're maybe hitting a high point in '12 and '13 in terms of average TA dollars per square foot. But it clearly is reflective of what -- of the benefit of some of these anchor leases and better markets.","David B. Henry","And when you look at the total package, which is the rent we are able to achieve, the free rent provisions, the TI and so forth, as a total effective rent, effective rents are moving up for us. So we suspect that it is not quite a landlord's market, but it's moving a little bit away from the strength that the tenants had to demand huge TI packages and so forth.","Operator","And our next question is from Michael Gorman of the Cowen Group.","Michael Gorman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A quick question for Glenn. You talked about some of the improvements on the balance sheet side and some of the progress you've made there on the debt-to-EBITDA on the fixed charge. And I was just wondering if you could talk about the weighted average maturity for the consolidated debt? It's down around 3 years now, down from over 5, and I'm just kind of wondering how you're thinking about that going forward and where you'd like that to be over the long-term?","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes. I think you'll see it get extended out a little further. Again, we haven't issued a new bond since August of 2010. But when you see a new bond come, that will be a 10-year deal. So that will certainly extend it out further. We've also paid off some debt with perpetual preferred stock. So you're seeing debt get removed from the balance sheet when you're looking at it and you have no maturity. But in general, we are going to continue to extend out the duration and obviously keep the debt maturity staggered, as we always have.","Operator","And the next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question's on the 9 new Targets in Canada, you said resulting in incoming occupancy gains. Is that because there were greater vacancies surrounding Zellers' entrances or just a general lift to the shopping center where you can get more in lease spreads going forward?","David B. Henry","Generally more of a lift. You've got a lot of tenants that want to be located next to new Targets. So if they're local stores and those are shorter term leases, we expect them to roll to higher rents than they would have if the Zellers was still there. Target is expected to drive a lot of traffic to these centers. And as you know, Target had spent a lot of money fixing up these stores. So it's exciting, it's brand new for Canada. The average Canadian's very excited about Target entering. So we suspect an uplift. And if you talk to RioCan, I think they can give you some more specifics because they're seeing it.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so, it could happen relatively quickly, at least for you?","David B. Henry","Yes, starting -- again, starting in March, you'll have 25 a quarter coming on stream up there.","Operator","And the next question is from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.","Vincent Chao - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry if I missed this from earlier, but just going back to the FCU, I think you said the guidance, recurring guidance are -- doesn't include any impacts from that investment. But I guess are you saying that the accounting treatment is such that you're owing to make booking transactional type of income from that or are you just choosing to exclude that impact?","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, there's a couple of things, Vincent. First of all, the transaction is really in 2 parts. Part of it is going to be in marketable securities, so that will just show up on the balance sheet in that line. Unless there's dividends, there's no real change that would occur. So the mark-to-market just runs through the other comprehensive income line. The other portion, which is the investment in the stores, the accounting isn't resolved yet. We're not sure if we're going to be on the equity method or the cost method. But in general, we're going to treat this as part of our transactional income, right. So we're going to keep the recurring the way we've been showing it all along. And anything that happens relative to this will show up in that transactional income or in the headline number.","Operator","And our next question is from Samit Parikh of ISI.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I'm sure you've gotten this call -- this question before from investors. But just curious, can you talk about your outlook on your business sort of over the next year or 2? And how you think about that correlating with the recovery in the housing market?","Milton Cooper","Well, the housing market is such a vital part of the retail market. When you have new homes built, people need furniture, appliances, there's job growth. So I would say that the new rooftops, new construction, new occupancy is one of the most important parts of increase in activity for retailers. So it's a very important part.","Operator","Our next question is from Mary Gilbert of Imperial Capital.","Mary Ross Gilbert - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the SUPERVALU transaction, mainly with the investment in the stores that I think you were talking about in the examples that you cited for potential realization opportunities. And so with the example that you've cited let's say, for example, with Shaw's, it sounded like the strategy there would be to improve the operations first before recognizing value. Is that how should we look at it because I wondered if you saw opportunities let's say very soon to maybe sell off some of the non-strategic operations there, being the Jewel stores [ph] the Shaw's and the ACME to focus on the core Albertsons. Do you think that...","Milton Cooper","It's a pertinent question because we had dinner last night with Bob Miller. And he has said the most important thing in this turnaround is to get the customer back, that to have fresh produce, to have the kind of an excitement in a store where customers can come back. And that will be the first objective turnaround of inception [ph]. Shaw's was once a marvelous place to shop. Anyone who's in New England knows what has happened. Similarly, Jewel had a fantastic share of market. But the objectives are to first get the customer back, get the customer into the store. And that will -- is the #1 priority. There will be -- there is surplus property that's separate and apart from the turnaround of the store level. And that, Ray Edwards, of our company is working on and involved and there will be monetization on there of that.","Mary Ross Gilbert - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Can I follow up with that? How soon do you think you would be getting dividend from this as you should with Albertsons, LLC?","Milton Cooper","We don't know. I mean, Albertsons, we've got 5X money back pretty quickly. And it's going to be hard to say. I happen -- I -- generally I am a pessimist. But with this management team and the skill of the letting the partners that are in the transaction, I think it's going to happen relatively quickly.","Operator","And our next question is from -- is a follow-up from Samit Parikh of ISI.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on Mexico real quick. You talked a lot about cap rates coming down in Mexico. Can you tell me where you think you could transact both the industrial and retail today? And also just quickly on that as well on listing, do you think you need to bulk up the portfolio more to have a successful listing?","David B. Henry","I think both in industrial and retail, good properties are going to trade in the 8s now, whereas a year ago it was 9. It's quite amazing and may be headed towards the low 8s, very high quality properties. As you know, the industrial is U.S. dollar rents, whereas the retailer is peso rent. In terms of the size of an offering, no, you could be relatively small. That doesn't seem to be an issue. What was intriguing to us particularly is the new Macquarie REIT because instead of an operating company going public, it's just an asset manager. All of the property management leasing is done by the sellers of those assets into the Macquarie REIT. Macquarie is just an asset manager collecting fees and so forth. So it makes what we have even more viable as a public vehicle, because we're not an operator in Mexico, but -- So it's just amazing what's going on down there.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session.

A near 40-year low in new construction and healthy interest from a diverse group of retail and service oriented users. As for our own portfolio, demand continues to be robust. Occupancy for the third quarter finished at 96.4%, which is a new all-time high for Kimco.","Anchor occupancy also reached a new record high at 98.7%. The demand for space for well located shopping centers is being led by off-price, exemplified by Old Navy announcing aggressive store openings once they become a stand-alone company. Beyond the off-price category increasing demand from health, wellness and medical products and services continues to be a growing category, both in our sector and our portfolio.","Our anchor tenants, including those that CNBC anchored Jim Cramer favorably refers to by the acronym watch, Walmart, Amazon, Target, Costco, and Home Depot continue to post positive same-store sales as they seamlessly integrate the online and offline shopping experience. With supply constrained for the foreseeable future, we believe that the tenants in our Rolodex will thoughtfully expand their footprints in portfolios like ours to better deliver instant gratification in the forms of Click-and-Collect, home delivery and convenient in-store experience.","Turning to our Signature Series. These needle moving projects are enhancing the quality and growth profile of our portfolio. This quarter, we continue to enjoy strong leasing demand ahead of our pro forma at two of our flagship mixed used assets. Lincoln Square in Center City, Philadelphia and The Witmer in Pentagon City.","At Lincoln residential lease-up has now reached 90% and at the Witmer we are already over 75% leased within the first 100 days of opening. At Mill Station in Baltimore County, we now achieved stabilization with the successful openings of a Giant Food, two TJX concepts and a Burlington store, anchored by a Grocer, Costco and Lowe\u2019s and located at the intersection of two major highways and the subway stop, this center will draw from a wide trade area.","Our Boulevard project in Staten Island continues to progress, and with ShopRite moving in shortly, we will be gaining control of their existing box which will expand the scope of our project. The existing ShopRite box represents a significantly below market rent opportunity to create value on another New York Metro asset.","At Dania Pointe, our large mixed-use project adjacent to Fort Lauderdale airport and fronting I-95, we've welcomed a major new anchor to our lineup. Spirit Airlines has committed to acquire and build a state-of-the-art corporate headquarters with office towers and a crew training facility with flight simulators. Dania Pointe will be a flagship. Live, work, play environment and adding spirit to the project will drive significant traffic to the site at all hours of the day to enjoy all the amenities, restaurants, retail and services that Dania has to offer.","Our current focus is to complete the projects in progress and entitle select assets for additional density, where we see significant value creation through redevelopment. Today we have over 4,500 apartments entitled on only eight sites, as we design customized master plans for each asset in our portfolio, it's clear that the runway for value creation is long and varied, as we anticipate and embrace the retail evolution and the growth of our mixed use development.","As I mentioned at the outset, it is clear our team has been busy and we remain committed to creating a great portfolio that is resilient, grows earnings and creates value. Ross?","Ross Cooper","Thank you, Conor, and good morning. We continued our modest level of transactions in the third quarter, selling eight shopping centers for a total gross price of $166.7 million with $70.9 million of Kimco share. Of the eight properties sold, three of them were held in joint ventures as we improve the quality of both the wholly owned and joint venture portfolios.","Given the level of dispositions completed so far this year as well as the anticipated closings in the fourth quarter, we are comfortable with the high end of the dispositions range of $200 million to $300 million.","Demand for product in the open-air sector continues to be healthy. Over 85% of assets we have brought to market have priced at or above our initial expectations. This has allowed us to be strategic with our asset pruning and to achieve cap rates within our budgeted 7.25% to 7.75% range.","Our buyers continue to seek opportunities as the debt markets help generate attractive returns to the private levered buyer. Beyond the single property transaction market, we anticipate seeing a few smaller portfolio transactions announced in the coming months.","For core market institutional quality assets, demand continues to be robust. We have seen institutions commenting on the need to rebalance their portfolio allocations with more grocery-anchored in neighborhood centers after increasing exposure to multifamily and industrial properties in recent years. This quarter we saw a transactions in the five cap and even sub five cap range in markets such as Dallas, Washington DC, South Florida and California.","On the capital recycling front, the proceeds from our asset pruning activity remain earmarked for finishing the development and redevelopment projects in the active pipeline. That being said, we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that fit the geographic and high quality profile that we have created. While still aggressively priced, we will be strategic and opportunistic for the right deals. We believe we have the right portfolio, the right reinvestment opportunities and the right team as we finish 2019 and head into 2020 .","I will now pass it off to Glenn.","Glenn Gary Cohen","Thanks, Ross, and good morning. Our strong third quarter results represent a further continuation of our focused execution. We delivered all-time high occupancy, another quarter of double-digit in leasing spreads and positive same-site NOI growth. In addition, we reduced our financing costs with the redemption of preferred stock.","Now for some additional color on the third quarter results. As a reminder, in connection with the NAREIT FFO definition clarification, we no longer include gains and losses from land sales, marketable securities and preferred equity investments in NAREIT FFO. We are presenting prior periods to conform to the selection. These transactional items were already excluded from FFO as adjusted, and therefore have no impact on that calculation.","NAREIT FFO grew 6% to $0.35 per diluted share for the third quarter 2019 as compared to $0.33 per diluted share in the third quarter last year. Included in the third quarter 2019 NAREIT FFO, but excluded from FFO as adjusted is $11.4 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to the preferred stock redemption charge and $1 million of property insurance proceeds associated with claims from our Puerto Rico portfolio during Hurricane Maria.","By comparison, included in third quarter 2018 NAREIT FFO, but excluded from FFO as adjusted is a $12.8 million charge or $0.03 per diluted share, attributable to the early extinguishment of debt and $1.5 million of Hurricane Maria property insurance proceeds received.","FFO as adjusted was up $0.01 to $0.37 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to $0.36 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. The primary contributor of the growth were $4.5 million of same-site NOI growth, $4 million of incremental NOI from developments, $1.6 million of higher lease termination fees and $1.9 million of lower financing costs.","These increases were offset by the impact of the significant disposition program in 2018, and a more modest level of dispositions in 2019, which reduced NOI by $9.1 million in the third quarter 2019 as compared to the third quarter last year.","For the 2019, nine month period NAREIT FFO was $1.08 per diluted share and includes $8.4 million of net transactional expense items not included in FFO as adjusted. This compares to $1.09 per diluted share for the same period last year, which includes $5.5 million of net transactional expense items not included in FFO as adjusted.","FFO as adjusted for the 2019 nine-month period was $1.10 per diluted share the same amount as the 2018 nine month period. Our nine-month results include a $12.4 million reduction in NOI. This reflects dispositions which reduced NOI by $45.8 million, partially offset by $16.9 million of same-site NOI growth, $10.9 million of incremental NOI from our developments and $5.9 million of higher lease termination fees.","FFO was also impacted by the adoption of the new lease accounting standards, which requires the expensing of internal leasing and legal cost previously capitalized. Included in G&A for the 2019 nine month period is $9.6 million of previously capitalized costs compared to the same period last year. FFO as adjusted for the 2019 nine month period benefited from $9.8 million of lower financing costs as compared to the same period last year.","Our high-quality property portfolio continues to produce strong operating metrics. During the third quarter, we signed 308 leases totaling 1.7 million feet at a weighted average rate of $19.73 per square foot. As Conor stated, we achieved all-time highs for total occupancy and anchor occupancy. Small shop occupancy stands at 89.9%. Small shop occupancy was impacted by the bankruptcies in store closings of Payless, Avenues and Charming Charlie which combined for a reduction of 55 basis points in small shop occupancy. Our team is actively working to re-tenant these boxes.","For the third quarter, our new leasing spreads were positive 27.2% and renewals and options were up 4.6% for combined leasing spreads of positive 8.1%. Same-site NOI growth was positive 2.2% for the third quarter, bringing year-to-date same-site NOI growth to 2.7% overall and 2.8% excluding redevelopments. Minimum rent increases were the primary driver of the positive growth. Our spread between same-site leased occupancy and economic occupancy stands at 270 basis points at the end of the third quarter, the same spread as at the end of the second quarter.","We were active in the capital markets during the quarter issuing a new $350 million 30-year unsecured bond and a 3.7% coupon and using the proceeds to redeem 350 million of preferred stock with a weighted average coupon of 5.81%. As a result, we recognized $11.4 million redemption charge.","Our weighted average debt maturity profile is now 10.8 years and continues to be one of the longest in the REIT industry. We have minimal debt maturing in 2020 and have over $2 billion of immediate liquidity available. We've also reestablished a $500 million at the market common equity program, which we can use opportunistically.","Turning to 2019 guidance. Based on our year-to-date same-site NOI results, we are raising our guidance for full year 2019 same-site NOI growth to a range of 2.5% to 2.8% from the previous range of 2% to 2.7%. We are refining our NAREIT FFO per diluted share guidance range to $1.44 to $1.46,which takes into account the $0.03 per share charge for the redemption of the preferred stock.","We are also updating our FFO as adjusted per diluted share guidance range to $1.46 to about $1.47. The prior range for each was $1.44 $1.48 per diluted share. We expect to provide 2020 guidance on our next earnings call.","We thank all of our associates who have been working tirelessly on all fronts with a common goal of creating value for the long-term.","And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","David Bujnicki","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to offer a reminder that you may ask a question with an additional follow-up. If you have further questions, you are more than welcome to rejoin the queue. Sherry, you could take our first caller.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. So, the first question is from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Caitlin Burrows","Hi, good morning. I guess I was wondering when you look at occupancy and it has been creeping higher, but the leasing spreads overall have come in a little bit. How are you thinking about occupancy versus price at this point and are you able to really push price much further?","David Bujnicki","Yes, this is Dave. Good question. On the new lease spreads as you can see, we maintain very strong double-digit spread comps on new deals for the last 22 quarters. And so that continues to be a very positive trend. As it relates to the renewals and options this quarter was consistent with prior quarter.","This was driven primarily by a few options that were exercised, that were that were low ranked ground leases, and as a result, they exercise flat with the Costcos and the Publix of the world. So you strip those out and you get to a more normalized rate of the trailing four. So when you look at the activity of where we are today in the demand drivers and the quality of our portfolio we still see room to run in terms of growth.","Conor Flynn","And we also see pretty good demand from the small shop tenants when you look at the velocity of the quarter. We did a huge amount of small shop leasing, obviously we are impacted with some store closures there, but we feel really good about the trajectory of that small shop occupancy as we continue to focus on leasing those up as our anchor boxes are reaching all-time highs that -- when those anchors open for business that usually stimulate some small shop residual leasing as well.","Caitlin Burrows","That makes sense. And then, Glenn, I think you mentioned on the new ATM program that that's now established. Could you just go through how you could use this going forward. Would it be to delever, make acquisitions, maybe nothing or just kind of the plans for that going forward?","Glenn Gary Cohen","I mean it's like anything else, it's any and all of the above, we view it as a tool that should be in our box, just the way we put it in a buyback program when it made sense. So it's a tool, we should have available to us and we'll use it opportunistically where it makes sense, whether it be to fund development and redevelopments, to further de-lever, we still have $225 million of callable preferred, so we have lots of options to be opportunistic with it.","Caitlin Burrows","All right. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead","Rich Hill","Hey, good morning guys. One of the things we were looking at was your credit charges and it looks like you're running below I think it was the 100 basis points guidance that you've given on prior calls. So I was wondering how you're thinking about that going forward and maybe in the context of the store closures that you may or may not think it's coming?","Conor Flynn","I think we really have to monitor the environment. We've been using 100 basis points as a reserve as you mentioned, which historically has been I think appropriate, and we want to continue to be mindful that retail is evolving and changing rapidly.","Now the lion's share of our retailers have been able to adapt and are delivering what the consumer is looking for today. But there are some that are struggling a little bit and looking to change and some new leadership hopefully is in place at some of our retailers now that we are going to change that going forward, but again the 100 basis points seems to be appropriate.","And we're going to continue to monitor that. But you're right. To-date, we've been running below that, because the occupancy has been higher than we anticipated.","Rich Hill","Got it. And then maybe just a related question to that, on Dania and I know you can't talk about Forever 21, but maybe there were some discussion about co-tenancy clauses at Dania. I view that as a pretty strong property and certainly as evidenced by Spirit. How should we -- how should we think about that property going forward, again recognizing you probably can't talk about Forever 21?","Ross Cooper","Yes. The activity at Dania has been exceptional. Specific to your question about Forever 21, we can say that that lease itself has not been rejected. They are currently going through a bankruptcy proceedings and we are in a wait and see mode to see the outcome of that.","As it relates to co-tenancy, no single tenant is tied to specific co-tenancies, it's typically part of a larger equation, and in light of the recent Spirit announcement bringing 1,000 employees, $250 million of their own investment into Dania it is truly a city on to itself, and the demand has only increased and accelerated as a result of these near-term catalysts.","So we feel very, very good long-term about the project. And then referring to Forever 21 as a specifically was one of the first leases signed at Dania nearly three years ago, located in the heart of Main Street, so its location is ideal, and there is upside.","Rich Hill","Got it. Thanks for the transparency on both of those guys.","Operator","The next question is from Christy McElroy of Citi.","Christy McElroy","Hey, good morning everyone. Just to follow-up on Caitlin's question on equity issuance in ATM, understanding that it's a tool in your chest to use opportunistically but given the outperformance this year, you're trading at a premium to consensus NAV, you don't appear to assume any equity issuance in guidance, but we are getting towards the end of the year, maybe can you just sort of discuss your desire to issue given where the stock is today in sort of the context of how you think about your cost of capital?","Conor Flynn","Hi, Christy, it's Conor and as Glenn mentioned, we do believe it's a good tool to have for us going forward just like our buyback program. And we continue to think that we're somewhat undervalued when you look at the opportunity set that we have embedded in the portfolio and all the Signature Series development and redevelopment that's coming online.","We're going to be looking at it opportunistically to see if we should match fund or use it appropriately to maybe de-lever. But again it's one that we look at constantly to see what's the best use of our capital, how do we invest accretively.","You've seen us to be extremely disciplined in terms of capital allocation over the past few years, as we've transformed the portfolio, we've reinvested in our properties and we continue to think we're on the right track and we'll use it appropriately when we see fit.","Christy McElroy","Okay. And then same-store growth has clearly come in ahead of your own expectations from the beginning of the year. Some of that's been -- that lower pace of tenant fallout in 2019 and that inherent buffer, which you mentioned that you had for bad debt.","As we look into 2020 do you see a scenario where same-store growth could potentially accelerate from the 2019 case, given that you still have this potential tailwind in the lease to commence spread and sort of how should we be thinking about your expectations for that credit loss buffer into next year?","Glenn Gary Cohen","Again, Christy, we're at a point now where we obviously have raised these same-site NOI guidance consistently through the year as the portfolio has produced stronger results than we originally anticipated. As we look forward, we're going to continue to monitor the retail environment.","You can see the transformation of the portfolio has been remarkable. It really has shined in terms of the performance. And we continue to think that we have a very strong portfolio but that retail is still rapidly evolving. So we still believe that 100 basis points is probably consistent with how we are going to be thinking about the year ahead.","Christy McElroy","So in that context does same-store NOI potentially accelerate into next year?","Glenn Gary Cohen","Again, it is determined on the retail environment. We feel like our portfolio is well positioned, but we'll have to monitor the situation with the retailers that we're watching.","Christy McElroy","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank.","Derek Johnston","Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Just a quick one on development yield expectations and how they've changed given tariffs and some rising labor costs. And I was really just wondering is the low-end expected yield still 6%. And can you see this slipping a bit lower and still making sense or will lower development yields, delay future project phases such as Pentagon?","David Jamieson","It's really a project by project assessment. I mean the reality is, and it's no secret that construction costs have risen over the course of the last several years and we don't see that pace flowing anytime soon. That said, the locations of a lot of our projects themselves are in high demand areas that are very difficult to seek entitlements and to develop.","So it's really a case by case assessment. There are different yields, expectations too between retail and residential. Residential historically, as you know, is a little bit lower than the retail yield at times. But it's something that we manage we look at each opportunity on its own and whether or not it's the best use of our capital that given point in time and in all other factors considered.","Ross Cooper","I think we'll continue to look at the opportunity set of future projects, understanding where our costs have gone on the construction side and see have been able to keep pace or outpaced them. We have been pleasantly surprised at the Witmer in Pentagon City. We've raised rents 4 times. Our original pro forma had close to 22 leases a month, we've been experiencing over 100 leases a month. So there are cases where the yields have actually improved over our pro forma.","Derek Johnston","Okay, great. And then just -- maybe have a further update on Dania Pointe the master plan there. I have seen some discussions from the municipality over potentially some design changes, and I just don't understand how -- if at all that would affect you guys and kind of what's going on there?","Conor Flynn","No from a master plan perspective the Dania Pointe project has not changed. We always allocated a certain portion of our entitlements to an office complex, which we always intended to sell. And so that was not something we felt comfortable self developing due to the size and scale of the projects.","What we've tried to do is de-risk the project by selling off the office component, which we were very fortunate to have Spirit commit to as a corporate headquarters. And then ground lease the residential components, which for the first tower is topped off, the second tower is in for permit and we're working on design for the third tower.","We also ground leased the two hotels components. Those are Marriott AC by Marriott, again derisking it by having someone come in and take on the construction and development risk. The design of the retail has not changed, the Main Street is up and going up right now releasing that as you see in the supplemental and we feel very good about the momentum now at Spirit has announced and we continue to look at the project as a flagship for us long term.","Derek Johnston","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.","Alexander Goldfarb","Hey, good morning. Just going back to Christy's question on the ATM. I mean clearly you guys have had incredible year-to-date performance trading. I mean, there are number of slight premium to NAV but call just add NAV.","And one hand the economy seems spine, concern maybe there is, you have some softening in the future, but still be a shame to obviously look a gift horse in the mouth. So there seems to be support for you guys to issue equity to de-lever, obviously we've heard your judicious comments on the balance sheet and trying to be prudent with how you manage your capital position.","But what's the reason or what's the hesitancy given how much progress you've made sort of repositioning the portfolio and also -- and waiting prudently for your stock to appreciate to match NAV before issuing. So what sort of a hold up as far as pulling the trigger?","Conor Flynn","Alex so we continue to monitor the situation. Obviously, we're pleased with the path that we're on, and the execution that with the team has been making. We like the opportunity set that we have in front of us in terms of development and redevelopment. Our capital plan, does match funding that this year with dispositions and you continue to see us price those aggressively in the market today. We have the ATM up so that we can use it opportunistically and we plan to do exactly that.","Glenn Gary Cohen","You also have a benefit. We do expect EBITDA to continue to grow. So although we are watching closely. net debt to EBITDA on a look through basis, we do expect it to continue to come down as EBITDA grows from the developments that are coming online and other things that we have in the hopper that we feel very optimistic about.","Alexander Goldfarb","Okay. And then the second is, obviously a big win with Spirit done at Dania Pointe, you've had good leasing progress on your residential projects. So Conor, big picture, the big developments, you're -- the big developments that you guys have, do you still view these as sort of specific developments that you'll do a few of?","Or are you seeing success in returns that makes you feel like you could have a broader set of these redevelopments and grow more redevelopments through the portfolio?","Conor Flynn","Yeah. When I look at the portfolio as a whole, I feel like we're just getting started in terms of our Signature Series redevelopment program. A lot of what we have seen is our assets have a higher and better use and we can entitle that accordingly with our team. And then we have a methodical approach and how to unlock that value.","I don't see putting a huge amount of projects in the pipeline all at the same time. I see a more measured approach where we'll take them one by one, do some deep due diligence on the projects, making sure we understand the supply and demand. The lion's share of what we're looking at going forward is more mixed use. There is no doubt about it.","There is a lot of mixed use entitlements that we already have and we continue to see that being a significant piece of the puzzle to us going forward. But I don't see us adding a huge amount all at once. I think that $200 million to $250 million of redevelopment investment per year is appropriate that we can take on and continue to create value with.","Alexander Goldfarb","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.","Steve Sakwa","Thanks, good morning. I know you guys have talked historically about maybe $15 million of redevelopment income coming in. And I'm just curious as you sit here today, how you sort of feel about that number. What kind of risks there might be either to the upside or the downside on that number?","Conor Flynn","That continues to be in the range of what we're anticipating Steve. I mean, when you look at the projects and how they have performed and how they're moving forward. We continue to see that that is an achievable number. And we're monitoring, obviously the lease up closely. We're monitoring the projections closely. But so far to-date, the momentum has been there in terms of the mixed use as well as the retail absorption.","Glenn Gary Cohen","And Steve, just to clarify that $15 million is on the development NOI.","Steve Sakwa","Right, okay. Yeah, I guess, I mean, I realize you haven't given sort of a number for next year, but just given what you sort of got in the hopper today is that -- does that sort of seem like a number that is repeatable sort of on an annual basis or do you see that number sort of changing dramatically as you move forward?","Conor Flynn","We're going to look at 2020 next quarter and see how it rolls up. I mean we obviously have to look through the budgets and make sure everything is tied together. But again we'll be giving 2020 guidance on the next call.","Steve Sakwa","Okay and then just lastly on sort of the tenant watchlist, I realize things have come in a bit better this year on closures and your use of the bad debt. But when do you sort of look at your tenant watchlist today versus say a year ago. How does it sort of stack up as we look forward?","Conor Flynn","has, come down, I mean, when you look at what we've been able to accomplish, we have been selling assets with some at risk tenancy, we've been reducing our exposure to some tenants that have yet been able to pivot and embrace the omnichannel approach, but we're continuing to be mindful that there are retailers that are winning and there are some that are losing, and we're actively pre-leasing a lot of boxes.","If you look at our portfolio, you can see where the acre occupancy is now over 98% leased and we feel like we have a good opportunity now to pre-lease a lot of these spaces that we feel we might have the opportunity to recapture. So it's a good place to be as the anchor occupancy sits at that level, and we continue to think that the demand sources are far outweighing the supply side.","Operator","The next question is from Jeremy Metz of BMO Capital Markets. Mr. Metz, your line is open.","Jeremy Metz","Can you guys hear me?","Conor Flynn","Yes.","Jeremy Metz","Hey, sorry, I was hoping we could go back to some of the same-store NOI question. If I look at it obviously you're up nearly 100 basis points from where we started the year when you gave initial guidance. Your net disposition activity is still at the low end at this point.","So, Ross, I know you mentioned having some further stuff in the pipeline, but that's really not going to have much drag, but if I look at your overall earnings expectations for the year, it's more or less unchanged, really. So I'm just wondering what sort of has been the drag that's really offset the positive momentum, you've had on the core here as we look at this year?","Ross Cooper","Again we've had a guidance plan, we have a guidance range that we put out for the $1.44 to $1.48 that took in the low end of the guidance and the high end of the guidance when we started. We are heading towards the higher end of the guidance. You saw us now tighten up an increase at the midpoint of the guidance range.","So we're towards the upper end of that range to begin with. So things are going pretty well. From our standpoint, we've done some refinancings that out occupancy is at all time highs. So we are reaching the upper end of that range to begin with. So I think we're pretty much on track with what we've laid out.","Jeremy Metz","Yeah, I guess, I think the assumption was when you laid out a 1.5% to 2% to start the year at the high end of that same-store range correlated to the high end of the $1.48, $1.47 over the midpoint is roughly getting to now. So just feels like there is some carry through that maybe isn't happening and I was just curious if there's anything else that maybe we're missing out there, it doesn't really sound like there is based on what you just said. So that's fair?","Ross Cooper","Yeah, I would say we're really on track with what we laid out as we head towards the upper end of the range. Jeremy the same-site NOI just talks about the performance of the current properties we have when you're looking through the FFO.","It also contemplates as Glenn laid out earlier about the dispositions that we had in the NOI we lost from there as well as the new lease accounting that we had to deal with for capitalized costs. So that factors into it on a year-over-year basis.","Jeremy Metz","All right. And second from me, you mentioned, Glenn in your opening remarks, some of the closings impacted of the shop occupancy this quarter. Did you receive any cure payments related to any of those was at in earnings at all?","Glenn Gary Cohen","No, we haven't received any of those payments yet. No. I mean we'll file for claims as it comes, but nothing, you won't see that number in quite a while.","Jeremy Metz","All right, thanks guys.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Hawthorne of RBC Capital Markets.","Brian Hawthorne","Hi. Can you talk about what is changing with separates plans at the Boulevard and been kind of go into more detail about what caused the scope of that project to change so much?","Conor Flynn","Sure. The existing shop rate is coming into the center from down the street and we were able to capture them to come into a more prototypical box for our redevelopment, as part of that we've been able to recapture their existing location. We feel like that's a real nice upside because their rents are significantly below market as I mentioned in my script.","So they're going to be a more prototypical box size and they have big expectations for the sales of that box. And so we believe that recapturing their existing location is actually a future upside in terms of another New York metro -- New York Metro asset where we can create value.","Operator","The next question is from RJ Milligan of Baird. Please go ahead.","RJ Milligan","Hey, good morning. Obviously your stock has done well this year and as Christy and Alex commented you're now trading at a premium to consensus NAV. I think just now one of two shopping center REITs trading at a premium to NAV with other quality portfolio is trading at double-digit discounts to NAV. Can you talk about your appetite for larger public to public M&A?","Conor Flynn","I'm happy to talk about that. I mean, when we look at our portfolio, we feel like we're on the right track. We've been able to execute our game plan, create value on the asset level through our mixed use redevelopment program and lease up a lot of our remaining vacancies.","We feel like we have a long way to go to really be rewarded for some of the other things we have in the hopper. We continue to always look at opportunities in the open market whether at these small portfolios one-off transactions are large portfolios, and we'll always be looking to improve the portfolio and improve the growth profile of the company.","But that being said, we feel like we're just starting to get rewarded for all the hard work that we've been putting into the portfolio.","RJ Milligan","Probably a little early to be looking at that?","Conor Flynn","Again, we're always monitoring it. But we're just going to continue to focus and execute.","RJ Milligan","I appreciate that. That's it from me. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question is from Hong Zhang of JPMorgan.","Michael Mueller","Hey, it's actually Mike, I think I'm on Hong's line here. So two questions. First, the Series J rate is similar to the case, why didn't you take the J out as well?","Glenn Gary Cohen","Well, again, we did $350 million, again we are cognizant, consolidated net debt to EBITDA as well as the look through number. So when you replace debt. And again, we used 30-year paper not short-term debt. 30-year paper to replace the debt, again, you see that the net debt to EBITDA on a consolidated basis did tick up about 0.4 times. So we didn't want to bring that number, so higher to start having any issues.","The rating agencies we spent a lot of time with them on the logic of why taking out 6% and 5.58% preferred with a basically a 3.7% 30-year piece of paper made all the sense in the world and they were fine with it is still very supportive of our -- one of our ratings and our outlook, but we don't want to really push the envelope too much with that. And it gives us another opportunity of other ways to take that paper out, maybe even further more opportunistically.","Conor Flynn","It's a nice levered if further delever. I mean there is -- that's the one piece that we still have that's callable. So that's one thing that we've been looking at.","Michael Mueller","Got it, okay. And then the 4,500 resi units that are entitled at eight sites, are those sites at existing centers or are they all new locations?","Conor Flynn","Those sites are at existing centers.","Michael Mueller","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Vince Tibone of Green Street Advisors.","Vince Tibone","Good morning. During the third and fourth quarter, how much occupancy uplift, do you get from seasonal tenants such as Spirit Halloween stores. I mean, I'm just curious if you're doing any more or less of these deals than in the past?","Conor Flynn","We don't report as ancillary income occupancy. So those Spirit Halloween deals are temp deals. We don't actually report them as occupied. So those spaces are short-term deals that we continue to show as vacant. So we don't get any lift at whatsoever from those tenants.","Ross Cooper","But to put it in perspective, as our occupancy has risen and the anchor boxes are up at 98.7% you have less available boxes for those types of deals.","Vince Tibone","Right it makes sense. Are you able to quantify at all, like, is it, let's say, if you did include the Halloween stores in occupancies is that like 50 bps positive to occupancy or is that not nearly that much. I'm just trying to frame how big of a...","Conor Flynn","It is small. It will be smaller than that. We can give that for you the detail of it, but it's small.","Vince Tibone","And then just any economics you could share on those deals like I'm assuming you provide no leasing capital but like is this a fraction of market rent in your mind that they're paying or is in such a short lease they do pay a real rent?","Glenn Gary Cohen","No, I mean they work from a capital standpoint. There's no real capital contribution from our end. And from our perspective, we don't disclose economics of deals, but it's a fair deal relative to what they sell for that 60-day period.","Vince Tibone","Okay, fair enough. Thank you. That's all I have.","Operator","The next question is from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank.","Greg McGinniss","Hey, good morning, Ross, you mentioned low cap rates in certain markets, but we've also heard from conversation with brokers, private landlords that there may be some more interesting assets entering the market as private landlord shy away from increasingly intensive shopping center business?","Are you seeing this side of the market as well. I'm just curious if Kimco might become an acquirer in the near future, especially considering the available of -- the availability of ATM funding now?","Ross Cooper","Yeah, we certainly do see opportunities, I would say that for, as I mentioned, the core institutional kind of down the fairway asset. There is no shortage of capital and cap rates continue to be as aggressive as they've ever been. We do think that there is a niche that we can provide in terms of some more value-add opportunities where we can utilize our platform that maybe some of the institutions are shying away from somewhat.","That being said, the financing availability for those types of assets is still very robust. So, we are competing with private buyers that are able to take advantage of very attractive financing opportunities.","So it's certainly competitive out there. But when we look at what we've been able to accomplish and where we've been heading. We think that it becomes a bit more attractive for us with our cost of capital to hopefully go back a little bit on offense as we get into 2020.","Greg McGinniss","Okay and then Conor and Glenn also mentioned utilizing the ATM to match fund development, does this potentially mean that we'll see fewer dispositions, which were maybe previously expected to fund redevelopment? Or are those assets non-core and they're going to be slated for disposition either way?","Ross Cooper","Yeah, I think we'll continue to selectively prune the portfolio. We believe that that $200 million -- $250 million that Conor mentioned in terms of spend, makes a lot of sense to continue as the run rate on our dispositions. If we have the opportunity and decide to accretively tap into the ATM or other sources to fund it will just be that much to the positive and the capital is fungible.","So, there is other opportunities to also look at delevering potential acquisition. So we have a lot of opportunity to invest capital, but on the dispositions front, we think the pruning continues to be appropriate at that level.","Greg McGinniss","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.","Haendel St. Juste","Hey, there. So Ross I want to follow up on the transactions if we could. So maybe you could talk a bit about the pricing achieved on the asset sold the third quarter versus your expectations. And given the fairly strong demand environment that you characterize, could you potentially sell a bit more than currently outlined. And then also as part of that can you talk about the growth profile of the assets sold relative to your same-store pool?","Ross Cooper","Sure. The third quarter dispositions were right in the middle of our range. It's been consistent through the first three quarters. So really no meaningful change, obviously somewhat is dependent upon the population of assets in that particular quarter. But it's been fairly consistent right in those mid 7% range. We absolutely could do more.","The market is certainly receptive to it. We don't intend to do more. As I mentioned, we believe that it's the appropriate level, given the size of our company and the uses that we have for those funds. The assets are all generally mixed. Some of them are grocery, some of them are power centers with various opportunities for growth for the next buyer.","So I would just say that we've continued to evaluate where there is risk in the portfolio. We've looked geographically at what markets we believe have long-term growth opportunities and where we think there is more stagnant growth. And we've also been evaluating with our JV partners where we see those portfolio is going into the future. So, it's a selective process that we're constantly monitoring, but we think that we have a pretty good handle on that process.","Haendel St. Juste","Got it, got it. Thanks. Conor one to you. I know you're not ready with regards to 2020 guidance. But from where we sit 2020 looks to be less of a transition year than this year and last year given the reduced disposition activity. Although tenant disruptions likely continue in some form.","And I think it was last year in the third quarter call that you talked about we're getting to a mid single-digit 4% to 5% FFO growth profile once your portfolio -- once this period of transition settles down what the heightened sales activity and repositioning activities down here.","So I guess I'm curious on any updated view here on when do you think you'll be able to get to that to a mid-single digit FFO growth profile, could 2020 be the year or is 2020 looking to be another transition year absorbed, albeit with a few headwinds in this year? Thanks.","Conor Flynn","As I mentioned before, we're not giving 2020 guidance on this call, it will be next call. But we do feel like we're making significant progress in terms of the portfolio transformation. You saw the results we've just reported.","You saw the ability that we've been able to raise guidance on the same-site NOI pool through the year. We feel like the developments and redevelopments are all now starting to deliver what we anticipated. So, we're on the right path. We feel like we've still got a lot of work to do, but we're starting to get rewarded for all that work that we've been putting into the portfolio.","Haendel St. Juste","I appreciate that's. But certainly it appears that in prior comments you've made the point that FFO growth is a priority. So should we at least expect that FFO growth is the expectation at minimum, the next year?","Conor Flynn","We will be focused on growing earnings next year. Yes, that is something that you can take of the bank.","Haendel St. Juste","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.","Ki Bin Kim","Thanks. How are you doing out there. So...","Conor Flynn","Very good.","Ki Bin Kim","I just want to talk about the small shop leasing. I mean the leasing seems to be pretty stable. I'm just curious about where the demand is coming from and how much of it is net expansion demand versus just kind of shuffling of fees and moving into better centers?","Ross Cooper","Sure. Yeah, no, I mean for us these are net new leases. The demand drivers historically had been F&B has been strong health and wellness, fitness and this quarter for example CosmoProf at 45 fitness and training Foot Locker has been rapidly expanding more into the open-air world as well. Pacific Dental, the Joint Chiropractic shade-store, just to name a few of the of the small shop tenants that we're seeing in terms of new occupancy.","And then as it relates to just the overall activity that we're seeing this quarter really represented one of the highest rates of new deals for shops space under 5,000 sqaure feet. So despite the bankruptcy is in the vacate that were expected with Payless, Avenues Charming Charlie's, the demand drivers were still very, very strong going into the balance of the year.","Ki Bin Kim","And then as it -- in terms of underwriting for the type of tenants or the merchandise mix when you think about those things. Has there been any kind of change in the way you think about what type of tenants bring in maybe they're good for now or tomorrow, but how much do you think about just the viability of that tenant and what they offer customers just longer term?","Ross Cooper","No, it absolutely, that's top of mind always I mean, at the end of the day, what we've really tried to focus on is expanding the utility of our shopping centers, almost more of like an 18 hour workday. So you have yet your coffee shop in the morning, then followed by services and fitness through the duration of the day with some apparel, then complemented by restaurants in the evening.","So, the longer you can extend the utility of your shopping center the better and that really is only achieved by great tenant mix and merchandising mix. So it's something we always think about.","Ki Bin Kim","All right, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.","Craig Schmidt","Thank you. I wondered what the -- looking at the net debt to EBITDA, which is higher than last year, what is the near-term movement expected and what can we expect for the next couple of quarters in terms of your net debt to EBITDA number?","Glenn Gary Cohen","Craig its Glenn. I would guess that we'll end the year probably right around where we are. And then you'll start to see decline as we go through 2020 and into 2021. Again, we as you know, we have no debt maturities. Our funding is really been coming from the dispose for a lot of what we've done and we have a lot of other opportunities that are really in the hopper that we think can help grow EBITDA as we go into 2020-2021. So I think you're looking at kind of the peak level right now. And then it really should start declining as we go through 2021.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, good. And then if you guys could give an update on Albertsons and if there is any thought to an alternative way of realizing value outside of an IPO.","Raymond Edwards","Hi, good morning, it's Ray. With respect to Albertsons they reported their second quarter earnings last week and again really good performance same-site, same-store sales were up 2.4% that seven quarters in row. So Vivek, who is the new CEO is doing a great job. If you had a chance to listen to the call, I think you'll be really impressed with him as well.","I think the company has done everything over the last nine months to get themselves in position to monetize the investment and subject to market conditions, we're hoping something happens sooner rather than later, either through an IPO, or otherwise. We're feeling comfortable.","Craig Schmidt","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is Alan on for Caitlin. Just a quick follow-up. For [Indecipherable] in particular, is the expectation that those stores will close at the year-end with no termination fee and that's it. Has that been finalized yet. Do you know if they're doing the same with other landlords?","Raymond Edwards","Hi this is Ray, again. Yes. So the transaction we work out with them, which is what a lot of other landlords did was we negotiated lease termination effective as of the end of the year on all the locations. There is no additional termination fee to us.","I mean, most of the lease we've had a, maybe another year or two after that, it wasn't like there were long-term leases. But one thing here, the benefit we got was the discussion started in May. So it wasn't like a bankruptcy where they file and then a day later you find out you got two months to find a tenant. We have eight or nine month to head start and working on that.","So with best of 13 leases normally 20 bps of ABR. So it's a very small position for us. But again we've had a lead time of six, seven months and a leasing team working on getting the backfills. So we should be able to fill them up quicker with the least information, we got a head start.","Ross Cooper","Right. And they continue paying the rent that's right with the cycle. So...","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bujnicki for any closing remarks.","David Bujnicki","Thank you for participating in our call today. I'm available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. And I hope you enjoy the day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to David Bujnicki, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Laura. Thank you, all for joining Kimco's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. With me on the call this morning are Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Glenn Cohen, Chief Financial Officer; Conor Flynn, Chief Operating Officer; as well as other key executives who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking and it's important to note that the company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, risks and other uncertainties. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that, we believe, help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website.","Finally, during the Q&A portion of the call, we request that you respect the limit of one question, so all of our callers have an opportunity to speak with management. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue.","With that, I turn the call over to Dave Henry.","David B. Henry","Good morning and thanks for calling in this morning. We are happy to report another strong quarter of financial results and progress on our key goals and objectives. Glenn and Conor will provide the details but, in general, our operating metrics are excellent and reflect the continued strength of the neighborhood and community shopping center industry. Leasing activity continues to be robust with increasing rent and excellent leasing spreads. National retailers remain committed to significant expansion plans and almost all geographic areas are reporting improving trends and very little new construction activity.","Coupled with population increases and positive, if not, strong GDP growth, we expect our key metrics and recurring rental revenues to remain solid as we enter 2014.","As an interesting and encouraging data point, shopping center industry NOI growth has reached a post recession high, according to a database maintained by the NCREIF, the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries. It is clear that the fundamentals of our business continue to look very positive.","With respect to our results for the quarter, we are making great progress on our major objectives. In Latin America, we have now sold, over the past 2 quarters, 24 shopping centers and 84 industrial buildings, aggregating a gross sales price of well over $1.06 billion. We also expect to sell our remaining 7 properties in South America by year-end and we're actively negotiating the sale of 27 additional shopping centers in Mexico.","While many of these sales involve multiple joint venture arrangements, we believe, we will have largely completed the sale of most of our remaining Mexico assets by early next year.","Our Canadian portfolio remains a strong and important contributor to our earnings. Portfolio occupancy continues to be very high and many U.S.-based retailers are continuing to expand into Canada with Target and Marshalls leading the charge. Property prices are at exceedingly high levels with pension funds and REITs both chasing a limited supply of high quality properties.","In the U.S., with our nonretail portfolio at $120 million today, and on track to be both less than $100 million and less than 1% of our total assets by year-end, please permit us to turn the page and concentrate on our recycling efforts, which entail investing in our retail redevelopment pipeline and selective acquisitions of high-quality retail properties in the U.S. and Canada. This has become our top priority now and we are pleased with our success on both fronts.","Looking at our U.S. shopping center portfolio. Conor has done an outstanding job, together with our regional presidents, of identifying and growing our portfolio of redevelopment projects. And this activity will be a very important contributor to our earnings in future years. As Conor will detail, in most cases, we can achieve double-digit returns on the incremental capital invested while also creating a higher quality, more valuable property overall. Retailers are increasingly willing to pay higher rents as part of a property redevelopment and renovation plan, and this both increases our projected returns and also makes more redevelopment projects financially viable.","In general, we believe that both our redevelopment projects and our joint venture partner buyout activities such as the recent UBS and KIF acquisitions represent the most attractive and accretive use of capital for us.","On the acquisition front, purchases of high quality shopping centers in primary markets are becoming more difficult as cap rates continue to decline for the best properties. That said, we are very excited about winning the recently announced large Boston portfolio due to its growth and redevelopment potential and its large presence in the supply-constrained New England market. Conor will provide more details on this portfolio and why we are so pleased to be adding these properties to our Northeastern region.","As a final comment, we're continuing to sell our nonstrategic U.S. retail properties in a disciplined and methodical process. Conor and the regional presidents screen each of our properties for long-term risks such as tenant sales, demographic trends, tenant credit, et cetera, as well as markets with lower long-term growth prospects. We have now sold 133 retail properties since late 2010 comprising almost 14 million square feet. This represents a major change in the profile of our portfolio in terms of both quality and markets. Over time, we are determined to continue to enhance our truly great national portfolio of high-quality retail assets in key markets with terrific long-term growth prospects.","Now I would like to turn to Conor and Glenn to be followed by Milton with his general observations and strengths.","Glenn G. Cohen","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Our solid third quarter results are highlighted by the excellent performance of our core operating portfolio delivering positive same-site NOI growth for the 14th consecutive quarter, positive leasing spreads and increased occupancy levels. In addition, we have been very active on the capital recycling front with the accelerated monetization of our Latin America assets and redeploying the proceeds to acquire high-quality U.S. shopping center assets in our key markets, with demographics and household income levels greater than the national average.","Now to some specifics about the quarterly results. As we reported last night, FFO is adjusted, which represents our recurring FFO and excludes transactional income and expense in nonoperating impairments was $0.33 for the quarter as compared to $0.31 last year, a 6.5% increase. The key drivers of the growth rate, $10 million increase in NOI produced by the operating portfolio and reduced preferred stock cost of $7 million, offset by the lower nonretail income of $10 million primarily attributable to the sale of In Town Suites and other non-retail investments during that period.","FFO is adjusted for the 9-months is $1 per diluted share. And based on our year-to-date results, we are tightening our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.32 to $1.33 from the previous range of $1.31 to $1.33. Headline FFO, which represents the official [indiscernible] definition, came in at $0.34 per diluted share as compared to $0.29 last year. Current quarter headline FFO includes transaction income of $15 million from the profit participation on the disposition of a portfolio of nonretail preferred equity investments, offset by a $7 million net of tax non-cash equity loss recognized from the additional Albertsons investment made earlier this year. We remain positive on the initial trends and future potential upside from the Albertsons transaction.","The Shopping Center portfolio metrics of occupancy, leasing spreads and same-site NOI growth continue to produce positive results. Total occupancy has increased to 94% up 60 basis points from the year-ago and 20 basis points from the beginning of the year. Separately, U.S. occupancy has increased to 94.4%, up 50 basis points from the beginning of the year. U.S. leasing spreads are up 7.3%, with new leases at 13.7% and renewals and options at 8.4%. Our combined same-site NOI growth was 2.3% for the quarter, including the negative impact from currency of 20 basis points and a negative impact of 20 basis points from adding a large development property in Mexico. Combined same-site NOI growth for the 9 months is 3.4% and we maintain our combined same-site NOI guidance range of 3% to 4%. In addition, we have added a new page in our supplemental package, providing further detail about the makeup of same-site NOI, we hope you find it helpful.","With regard to capital recycling, we had a very active quarter selling 8 U.S. properties, providing $53.3 million in proceeds, and the sale of 5 retail assets in Mexico, 9 retail assets in Chile and an 84-property industrial portfolio in Mexico, providing aggregate additional proceeds of approximately $260 million. We recorded non-FFO after-tax gains of $81.6 million and impairments of $14.3 million from all these sales and additional U.S. assets under contract. Also, we recorded non-FFO impairment charges of $76.7 million related to 14 Mexican shopping centers, which are part of a pool of 27 assets we are negotiating to sell. We expect significant gains on the other 13 properties, which will be recognized upon close. The gains and impairments from our Latin America transactions are all before the impact of currency, which has been influenced by the current strength of the U.S. dollar. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, not until a company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign country can the impact of foreign currency translation be recorded in earnings. As of September 30, the unrealized loss due to currency associated with our Mexico and South America assets was $113 million and remains in the balance sheet account of accumulated other comprehensive income. The final impact of currency will apply to the respective gains and losses on the sale of these operated properties and, thus, will not impact FFO at the time it is recognized.","Proceeds from the sale transactions were used to acquire 4 shopping center properties in our key markets for $67 million with a balance earmarked to the Boston portfolio and other U.S. assets already under contract totaling over $575 million. We continue to maintain our focus on the right side of the balance sheet as well, taking advantage of the continuing low interest rate environment to lower our own cost of capital.","To that end, we issued a $200 million Canadian-denominated, 7-year unsecured bond and a coupon of 3.855% and we paid a maturing 5.18% bond of the same amount, providing an annual savings of $2.6 million.","Our liquidity position is in excellent shape with over $1.6 billion available on our revolving credit facility and our net debt to recurring EBITDA is now at 5.4x, which is just under our target range of 5.5x to 6x.","As we look forward to 2014, our debt maturities are very manageable. Our next bond maturities don't occur until June of 2014 and we have already repaid $50 million of mortgage maturities due in 2014, subsequent to quarter end.","As we look forward to 2014, we're introducing an initial 2014 FFO as adjusted guidance range of $1.36 to $1.40 per share. Please keep in mind that we have not completed our full property-by-property forecast process. The guidance range is based solely on recurring flows and does not include transaction income or expenses, which will be included in NOI FFO. As such, we will provide more specific guidance assumptions on our next call, including same-site NOI growth expectations and occupancy targets, which we expect will continue to be positive. Our forecast includes recurring retail flows reaching close to $1 billion and de minimus recurring nonretail flows of $2 million.","In addition, the guidance range takes into account the dilutive effect of the Latin America and nonstrategic dispositions as well as the reduced nonretail flows. Using the midpoint of the 2014 guidance range of $1.38, we yield an increase in recurring FFO per share of about 4%. The ranges depend upon timing of our continued capital recycling activities including the monetization of our Latin America assets, asset acquisitions lease up and redevelopments coming online. Lastly, but of most importance, we are pleased to announce that based on our 2013 performance and expectations for 2014, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend of 0.015 per common share to $0.225 an increase of 7.1% on an annualized basis. Our FFO as adjusted payout ratio remain conservative at about 65%, among the lowest in our peer group. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on December 12 in New York.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Conor.","Conor C. Flynn","Thanks, very much, Glenn. Our third quarter performance continues to evidence the consistent strength of the battle-tested Kimco portfolio, even during unsettling economic times, and highlights the safety of our recurring FFO due to our industry-leading tenant and geographic diversity. Our goal is to make Kimco a pure play North American retail real estate investment company that can provide best-in-class margin of safety and produce consistent and increasing dividends with above-average same-site NOI growth through leasing, redevelopment and accretive acquisitions.","I wanted to provide updates on the 3 major strategic initiatives I mentioned on our last call. All of which are aimed at upgrading our core U.S. portfolio. First, we continue to actively scour the portfolio for sale opportunities. Since June 30, we have completed the sale of 12 U.S. centers for an aggregate gross sales price of $205.9 million at an average implied cap rate of 7.6%. Year-to-date, we have executed on the sale of 25 properties for an aggregate gross sales price of $287.9 million with an average implied cap rate of 7.9%. We have an additional 14 properties currently under contract.","We believe that the extended low interest rate environment and the strong demand for cash flowing assets makes for an optimal time to pare down our portfolio in a meaningful way. We have identified an additional 60 assets that we are now moving to our disposition list and targeting for sale in 2014. We have identified these assets as low growth or average properties and are below Kimco's average demographics and major metrics. We see opportunity to continue to reshape, redevelop and rethink the future of Kimco.","The second update relates to our $800 million redevelopment initiative. Reinvesting in our high quality assets through redevelopment is critical to our future growth in achieving a higher net asset value. This quarter, the Cupertino, California redevelopment passed the last appeal hearing and is now active in garnering significant leasing activity. The existing 114,000 square foot grocery-anchored center will be getting a full makeover and will be adding 25,000 square feet of new retail, a parking garage and a phase 2 pad site, which is being held for future upsides with interests from hotel operators, pharmacies and financial users. The newly remodeled asset will share a new signalized intersection with the future 2.8 million square foot Apple 2 headquarters that will house 12,000 employees. In addition, the anchor redevelopment of our Richmond Avenue site on Staten Island is now complete. And Target, who was on a ground lease, opened their door this month to significant fan fair. The grand opening was a big success and video of the event could be found on our award-winning website and blog at kimcoreality.com.","The Richmond Avenue redevelopment still has 2 outparcels under construction for Bank of America and Miller's Ale House and we'll complete the redevelopment and produce incremental NOI totaling close to $2 million for an ROI of 42%. If we ascribe a cap rate of 6%, this project will create over $28 million of additional net asset value. The Richmond Avenue project is just 1 of 5 former Kmart locations that are now in different stages of redevelopment. New anchors for these projects include Target, Whole Foods, TJX, Ross, Burlington Coat and Sports Authority. We currently have 41 active leases with Kmart and Sears, and 2 that expire in 2017 with no remaining options, located in Los Angeles and Staten Island, creating a nice reservoir of future redevelopment opportunities.","Since last quarter, we have moved $42 million of redevelopment projects from the planning stage into the active category. The active redevelopment pipeline currently consists of gross cost of $214 million, incremental NOI projected at $21.1 million, with a blended ROI of 10.2%. The $800 million redevelopment pipeline includes $320 million of projects in the planning stage and an additional $275 million of products under evaluation.","The third update relates to our initiative to focus new investments in our core markets that are significant barriers to entry with above average growth. This quarter, 3 out of 4 acquisitions were made through off-market transactions, taking advantage of our deep relationships with owners, brokers and retailers to source accretive deals in this highly competitive environment. I would also like to mention the recent Boston portfolio that is now under contract. We believe this portfolio has significant upside with below-market leases, redevelopment potential and includes a few urban locations surrounded by the campuses of Harvard, MIT, and Boston College that could potentially add significant density. Our leasing and development team are clearly energized by the unique opportunity.","As for our metrics, I am happy to report the following results. Our U.S. same-site NOI growth was 2.7%, about 80% of that growth was driven by new releases with rent commencement dates that occurred over the prior quarter. Also contributing to the growth were healthy contractual rent increases, the 2.7% same-site NOI growth is the 14th consecutive quarter of positive same-site growth and, excluding redevelopment, our U.S. same-site NOI will be 3.1%. As Glenn mentioned, we have added a detailed breakdown of our same-site NOI to give a clear picture of our portfolio.","Leasing volume continues to be strong and we have signed 183 new leases in the U.S. for a total of over 900,000 gross square feet driving our overall occupancy levels of 40 basis points growth and 60 basis points pro rata over occupancy in Q3 2012. U.S. occupancy alone increased 100 basis points pro rata over the same quarter last year. On the U.S. same-site basis, occupancy grew 70 basis points pro rata year-over-year, mainly due to positive net absorption.","Quarter over last quarter, overall occupancy was up 30 basis points pro rata and 20 basis points gross. Anchor occupancy increased 40 basis points to 97.4%, small shop occupancy was up 40 basis points to 84.7%, an 80 basis points increase from third quarter of 2012. The increase in small shop occupancy continues to be driven by positive net absorption from the disposition of riskier assets. Our small shop space percentage of total GLA at 24% is amongst the lowest in the industry.","Given that demand for large boxes is very strong, and occupancies are high for this space across our sector, Kimco is benefiting from this trend through higher rents for a larger portion of our portfolio. Our combined leasing spreads have now been positive for 9 consecutive quarters. Third quarter leasing spreads were at healthy 13.7%, mainly driven by our junior anchor deals, however, both midsize shops, or those between 5,000 and 10,000 square feet; and small shops, those under 5,000 square feet, reported positive pro rata spreads as well. Additionally, we continue to see the advantage of old leases in our portfolio coming to the end of their term. A former Firestone Tires lease from 1973 paying only $3.21 in Savannah, Georgia was replaced with a Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry at a rent of $25 a foot.","Renewals and options additionally posted a positive spread of 4.8%, driven mainly by an old under-market write-in [ph] lease from 1983, paying $30 a foot in Bridge Hampton, New York and renewing at $47 a foot with no tenant improvement allowance or landlord work.","This past quarter, we have spent a large amount of time in the field touring over 100 assets and I am excited by the creative and collaborative approach of our team, which is what makes Kimco so special. It's proven that our recycling efforts have driven -- have been meaningful to date and the improved quality of the portfolio has reinforced the pride and ownership among all of our employees. We are now close to 50% of our NOI coming from the following 10 metro areas: 12%, from the New York-New Jersey-Long Island area; 5% each from Los Angeles, Miami and Philadelphia; 4% each from DC and Baltimore; 3% each from San Francisco, Phoenix, San Juan and Chicago; and our average base rent is now $12.92, up 11.2% from our last Investor Day in 2010.","While we are pleased with our overall progress, we still have work to do and we will continue to reshape Kimco portfolio and constantly work towards becoming the best in our industry.","And now I'll turn it over to Milton for his final remarks.","Milton Cooper","Well, thanks, Conor. Conor's passion and enthusiasm for our business is contagious to all of us. I'm pleased with our overall progress. Our focus continues to be on quality, core markets and simplification. We're trading from Mexico to Massachusetts. The upgrading of our portfolio is in full swing. We have sold over $1 billion of shopping centers since our last Investor Day in 2010. Our investments in SUPERVALU and Albertsons continue to proceed according to plan and we expect that there will be very substantial creation of value. And we also continue to execute on our plan to simplify since the beginning of 2012. The number of properties held by joint ventures has been decreased by 133. The GLA in the joint venture decreased by 19.5 million square feet and our gross investment value in real estate joint ventures has decreased by $1.7 billion.","Finally, I can never say enough about the quality and depth of our team. I believe, it's a key differentiator for us. Our 4 U.S. regional presidents manage portfolios so large they can each be independent REITS. Their industry reach and experience is second to none. Collectively, they have 111 years of experience in the industry and 47 years with Kimco. They are working on our portfolio, increasing value and delivering results. It's a very, very exciting time for Kimco.","And now we'd be delighted to take any questions.","David F. Bujnicki","Laura, we're ready to move on to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from Michael Bilerman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, can you just go through some strategic rationale in terms of, I can understand Latin America in terms of exiting and simplifying as investors can have their own choice to invest in that market through listed players. As much I love Canada, being a Canadian, couldn't you make the same argument about Canada and just becoming a U.S. pure play and sort of how you think about that dynamic?","David B. Henry","You could certainly make that case, Michael. But we have such a wonderful portfolio up there that's driven very strong earnings and, we believe, there's upside in the portfolio as it stands today, that the market up there is so strong and the rents are going to grow even further than they are today. I mean, our occupancy there, I think, has never been lower than 96%, and it's been a very strong contributor of earnings. And quite frankly, the sale in Canada would trigger taxes that are much more meaningful than the taxes we have in Latin America. So there is a tax consideration, long-term. We also have wonderful public company operating partners up there, such as Riocan and Plazacorp, and both of them are wonderful partners and have created enormous value, over time, above what we've bought. So we consider Canada, those assets, very high quality. Most analysts give us very high marks for our Canadian portfolio. We see continued upside up there. And many of our U.S. tenants are also there. So whether it's Target and Walmart and Home Depot and others, we share a common platform with them for Canada. So you're right in terms of your thesis but, I think, for now we consider it part of our very high-quality international portfolio.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then this decision to completely exit Mexico, because we've heard, over the years, Dave, the same thing about, look, there's U.S. tenants and it's U.S.-based leases with U.S. dollar-denominated leases for a lot of the anchors. I guess, why then, now, completely, deciding to exit Latin America then?","David B. Henry","I would say, twofold. One is despite our passion for the long-term prognosis of Mexico, and what's going to happen there, we were really never able to convince the investor and analyst community of that. And our assets there were valued at a discount. And our multiple, I think, suffered a bit in terms of our -- in Mexico. And then we got hit with everything from drug violence to the Great Recession, which took some of the big loss off of Mexico. Secondly, it's a wonderful time to exit. The capital markets, after many years of being very silent in Mexico, have exploded. And in terms of the valuation of assets, and we have great assets down there, in terms of the number of companies that are either public or want to go public, they're trying to aggregate assets. So we think the timing is good in terms of selling and disposing of the assets. And since we were able never to make a compelling and convincing case, even though we still are strong believers, long-term, in the prospects for Mexico. I don't want anybody to think that this means that we don't think Mexico is a wonderful country with wonderful, long-term growth prospects. It's just that, for us, as a public company, we never really got credit for being there. And it's a good time to go home.","Operator","And the next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up to that. Can you talk about the net proceeds you expect to realize in total from the executed as well as pending sales in Latin America, and what assumptions you've made in your guidance for next year for the timing and, maybe, yield on reinvestment of those proceeds beyond just the New England purchase you've announced?","Glenn G. Cohen","Sure, Jeff. In total, you'll probably see around $900 million, in total. You've seen what we've already produced so far. And proceeds will be used to really buy U.S. shopping center assets. So you have things like the Boston portfolio plus many other assets that are currently under contract that total about $575 million.","Conor C. Flynn","And redevelopment, I think, the redevelopment pipeline is a target for us to really reinvest and it's a great use of our capital at this point.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to clarify. Were those net proceeds you're saying or is that the -- that's the gross figure you expect to realize in the...","Glenn G. Cohen","Those will be our net proceeds.","David B. Henry","That would be our share.","Glenn G. Cohen","Our share.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's right. And then those reinvestment opportunities, do you think they're are more front-ended in 2014?","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, I think, you have about $260 million that will close in the fourth quarter of this year and then probably about another $300 million -- $350 million that will close in the beginning first quarter of next year.","Operator","And our next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.","Craig R. Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Because my question is on the Boston portfolio, I wonder if, Conor, you could characterize when you can start to capture some of those below market rents when they rollover and then how soon you can start pursuing redevelopment projects on that portfolio as well?","Conor C. Flynn","Yes. No problem. We actually are pretty excited about the lease rollover in that portfolio. It's got above average growth. When we were underwriting the portfolio and touring the properties, we were pretty excited about the repositioning opportunities. There's a few significantly below-market grocery stores as well as office-supply users that are coming up to the end of their lease term and we believe that we can either reposition the asset with a best-in-class grocer at a significant market rent increases. In addition, we see that the small shops have been relatively flat versus markets. So we think that there's upside in the small shops as well. It's a highly occupied portfolio, so it is going to be over the next 5 to 10 years when leases mature that we'll see that growth. But it's a play for us to really see long-term value creation. And that goes for the redevelopments as well. There's a few larger projects that we think are achievable because of significant density that could be added to our urban properties in that portfolio. But then, there's also smaller redevelopment potential that outparcels to a number of properties. So it's a little bit of everything in the property portfolio that we're excited and can't wait to dive into.","Operator","And the next question is from Andrew Schaffer of Sandler O'Neill.","Andrew Schaffer","It's good to see the continued progress in selling out of Mexico and Latin America. But looking at the $190 million of combined losses, potentially taken, I was wondering what controls have been put in place for you to kind of avoid future non-core investments as you put the $400 million of cash towards -- that's currently on the balance sheet.","David B. Henry","Well, you have our commitment to maintain the strategy we have in terms of focusing on core retail in the U.S. and in Canada. Honestly, we actually made a lot of money in the nonretail assets as well. I mean, it is not all a bad news story there. But we recognize that, as a company with a 50-year history and expertise in retail, that's where we want to be going forward. And over time, we want to emphasize our key markets in the U.S. where we have scale and relationships, long standing. We want to emphasize larger scale properties, which can unlock opportunities to redevelop and expand those properties. We're going to become a little more urban than suburban, because that's where the jobs are going, the population growth, that's where the retailers are more productive and that's where they want to pay higher rents. So we do have a strategy that we're committed to long term. And that's where we're going.","Glenn G. Cohen","And the other thing that I would add is when you look at what will remain subject to currency translation, it's really all -- would all be in Canada. And in Canada, we are naturally hedged because we have issued all Canadian-denominated bonds that match our equity portion. So that risk is gone. And we did that somewhat in Mexico. We have MXN 1 billion unsecured facility that is a minor hedge of what's there, but that's what was used.","Operator","And the next question is from Jason White of Green Street Advisors.","Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Just wondering when you look at your U.S. portfolio of 700 and some odd assets and you look at your activity over the last few years of -- from a disposition front, how much of the portfolio do you consider kind of non-core? If you could snap your fingers today and sell a portion, what percentage of the portfolio would that entail?","Conor C. Flynn","Today, it's less than 10%. And we're really focused on growing into the larger assets, the core markets, so we have broken up our portfolio to see where the juice is, where the growth is. And we have over 550 assets that we deem as really strong, long-term core assets with above-average growth. So the lion share the portfolio is, of today, is what we determine as core. That said, we did add another 60 assets that I mentioned to our disposition pipeline. And we're going to continue to be an active portfolio manager. I think, that's now become really, going forward, a big change for Kimco. And once we move through this next 60, it will probably be less transactional volume. But still -- we'll still be actively managing the portfolio looking to see where the retail nodes have shifted, where the demographics have shifted and where we perceive a risk and can exit out of properties that we think may have negative growth.","Jason White - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","Are there any themes sort of vintage of the properties you've been selling or are they just kind of property that have been acquired throughout time and there's no real rhyme or reason to any chunk of those?","Conor C. Flynn","It's been a very detailed process. We've gone back through each region and talked about tertiary markets, where we have to either don't have scale in a certain market, where we only may have 1 asset or 2 assets in a certain market, and we see that the growth isn't up to Kimco's standards. Again, if the retailers that are anchoring that property are not producing high sales, we consider that a risk and think that it's time, potentially, to exit those properties. We also look at the trade areas. We want to see where the growth is coming from in demographics. So it's been a very detailed approach. And so, each time we go through the disposition pipeline, we also take a look at the existing portfolio to see, should we consider adding more or should be consider taking away more.","Operator","And our next question is from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm curious, on the Boston portfolio, it sounded like you're saying you had some street retail in there to in addition to what you characterize as urban. And I'm just curious whether you do or you don't, I would, of course, like to hear that, but what do think of the street retail concept. It's obviously gotten very hot here recently and is that something you guys are looking at or would consider looking at going forward?","Conor C. Flynn","It is hard to describe if it's street retail, because it's -- it is urban because it's located in the Boston metro area, but it does has have its own parking fields. Really, the 2 most urban properties would be the Trader Joe's that's really has its own parking field as well as the Whole Foods next to Boston College, which also have its own parking field. So we typically like to have control over the parking fields, so it enables us to create larger redevelopment potential. Street retail, I think, is very limited in terms of your opportunities to create value, long-term. It's really more of just a releasing effort on street retail. So we enjoy having urban properties but that have critical mass that'll allow us to create value over time.","Operator","And the next question is from David Wigginton of DISCERN.","David L. Wigginton - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","Just following up on the earlier Canada question. I wanted to get a sense of how you view the high and continually, I guess, rising Canadian household debt levels in the context of your strategy for the market. And I guess, do you think the embedded growth you mentioned is potentially at risk as a result of that?","David B. Henry","Well, the Canadian economy is actually holding up quite well. And does not have some of the long-term issues that the U.S. has, particularly in the real estate area. It's under retailed by metrics that you would look at for the U.S. that has about half the retail per capita that the U.S. has. It's very difficult to build in Canada at the end of the day. And so for the future, we see continued demand exceeding supply up there. And we continue to see Canada as an attractive expansion market for U.S. retailers. You're seeing a whole slew of retailers go to Canada and have a wonderful expansion opportunity Nordstrom, among others, going up there recently. So we're excited about where Canada is going. We're excited about our own portfolio, which is very high quality and if you're ever in the area, we'd be happy to take you for a tour. They're good long-term properties. There've been great performers. We were very fortunate to buy them at a time when cap rates were very high and the currency was weak. So we have some very large embedded gains in our Canadian portfolio and it's producing very strong earnings, very strong FFO for us. And that growth should continue.","David L. Wigginton - DISCERN Investment Analytics, Inc","How does the tenant base there compare to sort of your U.S. tenant base?","David B. Henry","They're similar properties. These are largely open-air properties. We do have some enclosed properties, but they're largely open-air, both grocery-anchored and big-box centers spread across, as you know, Canada has 6 major cities and they're primarily located in these 6 areas. But it is a national portfolio. And as I mentioned, we've got some very wonderful operating partners that are very good at what they do.","Operator","And our next question is from Brandon Cheatham of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Brandon Cheatham - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","On the capital recycling plans, for the net proceeds you expect to get from Mexican assets. Just on the acquisition front, given where cap rates have come over the last 3 or 4 months, are there any markets where you're hesitant to enter into and kind of how do you expect to add value with those proceeds?","David B. Henry","We look very hard at acquisition opportunities. And I think, Conor hit it on the head when he said our first preference is off market and negotiated opportunities that had come from long-standing relationships and the size of our company, we do have -- we do look at an awful lot of things. And then, we screen these opportunities on a couple of factors: One, whether these are markets that we're already in and we like the long-term demographics and trends of those markets. And then, we look at the properties themselves, whether we believe that there's great embedded growth of the NOI. And whether there's redevelopment possibilities and other things that can really drive some earnings for those properties. So we know, it's a good time to be careful. And we are trying to be careful in underwriting in depth these opportunities. But we do see a lot, and we're fairly confident that we can redeploy that capital into high quality properties with some upside.","Glenn G. Cohen","The other advantage we do have is the regional framework that we've set up. So we have all these people on the ground in their particular regions, who are scouring and talking to brokers, private property owners, and the like and that's when we've been able to source many of the deals both on a -- whether it be broker or a private negotiated stand [ph].","Brandon Cheatham - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So I guess, overall, uses of those proceeds -- expectations haven't changed.","David B. Henry","Right. We do believe we can redeploy this capital at good long-term NOI growth patterns.","Glenn G. Cohen","Plus the redevelopment pipeline.","Operator","And next we have question from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think you touched on this a little bit earlier with specific transactions slated to close later this year. But if we're thinking about 2014 as a whole and thinking in terms of your pro rata share of, say, acquisitions and dispositions, do you think you're a net acquirer in 2014 or do you think it's a wash or do you think you're still a net seller?","Glenn G. Cohen","Michael, I think you're going to see us be a net acquirer by somewhere in the $150 million range, when we put it all together.","Conor C. Flynn","Net acquirer in the U.S.","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes, net acquirer in the U.S. Yes.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In the U.S. -- what about overall though, if we're thinking about that?","Glenn G. Cohen","Overall as well. We're going to take the proceeds from the Latin America sales, as well as the sales from the U.S. assets we're selling and redeploy them, primarily, into the U.S. assets that we've already earmarked.","David B. Henry","And free cash flow.","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes.","Operator","And next we have a question from Ross Nussbaum of UBS.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can we talk a little more philosophically about your investment management program and I'm wondering if you think just as though the market never really gave you full credit for the Latin America investment, do think that the market doesn't fully recognize the benefits of the investment management program? And I know you've already been reducing some of that exposure. But is it reasonable to assume that over the next couple of years, particularly as you have -- a number of those relationships, where the debt is maturing, that you're going to step into 100% ownership and continue to take full ownership and simplify from that perspective?","David B. Henry","Yes. I'll take them one at a time. Yes, I do believe the market doesn't give you full credit and does give you a bit of a discount, depending on the amount and the magnitude of the joint venture. I think, you've got some of the highest quality companies in the REIT world that do have specific joint ventures. In our case, we have awful lot of them. We have over 2 dozen institutional partners in various forms and we have all sorts of programmatic joint ventures and commingled funds and we recognize that, perhaps, we have much too many of them and you have seen us reduce that number and you will continue to see us reduce the number of joint ventures and partners over time and we think that's a good thing. That doesn't mean we think joint ventures are bad, joint ventures can lead to opportunities and, certainly, has helped us in terms of incremental earnings from fees and from notes and things like that. Secondly, there is that intangible that we have found and discovered, that certain partners want out at certain times. And we are able to take advantage of that and get, what we believe is, a discount with them owning a partial interest and saving on brokerage fees and assumption costs and things like that. So we're able to take advantage of that. And UBS is an excellent example. Because our cost to buy back a bigger share of that portfolio, cap rate was over 7%. And those assets would trade we think as 100% owned assets, a 6% or even lower than a 6%, so there was value created through the acquisition of that portfolio. So those opportunities, we continue to look for and we're proactive about finding those. And we've done a good job, I think, finding those opportunities. So over time, philosophically, you'll see us have less joint ventures and we believe that will help in terms of the multiple and so forth.","Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And in terms of dollars, I mean, we're talking here, I mean, there's over $10 billion of assets at play of which you've got, in some cases, 15% stakes in or 33% staked in. I mean, are we going to be talking over the next couple of years here of $5 billion plus of what would effectively be acquisitions from that built-in pipeline?","David B. Henry","No. No. In the first place, out of that 10, Kimco probably owns more than 40% of that 10 to start with, on average. And you have the debt, obviously, to boot. So to start with our average ownership being 40%, you take out the debt and so forth. And we do have partners that we value very highly, such as GE Pension and Prudential, which have made it clear that they are long-term holders, they're not interested in buying out. And some of the larger ones that have expressed an interest, such as UBS and, several years ago, DRA, we have consummated those transactions. So the future opportunities, I think, are going to be smaller but we're working at that. And again, I think one of the goals is to take those 2 dozen institutional investors down to perhaps 5 or 6 for a longer time period.","Operator","And the next question is from Samit Parikh of ISI.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Hate to keep asking about the transactional activity next year and how it relates to your guidance. But just to clarify, so if you said $900 million of net proceeds and $150 million of a net acquire, you're probably acquiring a little bit of $1 billion here. But given the lower cap rates on the acquisitions, it's probably a net push on the transactional activity, relating to NOI. Can you sort of go over the other drivers that get you to the guidance range to next year. Internally, what you're thinking, since you have to deal with dilution of the hotel portfolio completely coming off and other dispositions earlier this year?","Glenn G. Cohen","Right. So, Samit, we're going through our final review of all of our properties. But embedded in there will be redevelopments that come online, contractual rent funds [ph]. Interest cost savings from the refinancing that we've done as well as bringing these acquisitions on at a particular time. So we think when we put it all together, we're comfortable with this initial guidance range that we put out. But as I mentioned, we will give you more detail on our next call, when we have finalized the review of our 800 properties.","David B. Henry","And I would just add, historically, we haven't had the large dilution you might have expected when you take into account that we have sold nonretail assets that were not producing income such as our large urban portfolio in Philadelphia and others. So as we sold those assets, we got cash in that wasn't earning for us. Secondly, as we've wound down our preferred equity portfolio, we've been fortunate, including this quarter, to get large profit participations, which is real cash, which can be used to buy new properties and offsets that dilution. And then, the third, over the last couple of years, the home run investment in Albertsons produced quite a bit of distributions to us that was real cash. And that goes into the kitty as well. And then we have our free cash flow of $100 million or so a year. So you put all that in the blender and you don't quite have the dilution you might think about on paper when you're selling at 8-ish and buying at 6-ish.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So just to clarify the last question, that the 136 to 140 range next year, that include probably some promotional income activity from some of these sales?","Glenn G. Cohen","No. There's no transaction income or expense in those numbers. This is purely coming from the operating portfolio and the management of G&A costs and interest costs.","David B. Henry","My point was we've gotten cash that we have now used to invest [indiscernible] income producing assets.","Operator","And our next question is from Nate Isbee of Stifel.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Dave, just going back to that discussion about unwinding some of your joint ventures. You are marketing a small portfolio here in the mid-Atlantic that seems to be, what I would call, real high-quality core assets, they are joint ventures. And is that property-specific issues? Are -- is that the pricing disagreement with the seller and are -- as much as it's been an opportunity for you in past, is it getting harder to come to an agreement with some of your joint venture partners?","David B. Henry","No. I think -- the specific ones, you were right. You're referring to our -- is a situation where we've agreed with a partner. It's probably best just to put them on the market. There was a bid asked on several of them and there was an asset that we didn't want to buy. So it's -- we agreed to put those on the market.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I mean, it's not like you did the DRA, you did the UBS and as you get farther in this process, you're trying to get more detail?","David B. Henry","No. In some cases, you have a partner that does want to go home, but you can't quite agree on price. And so, those properties are market. But at the end of the day, you have one less venture and one less institutional partner. And I think, part of it is you'll get some nice price discoveries out of this too. And you'll see that these things are going to trade at a very low cap rate.","Operator","And our next question is from Chris Lucas of Capital One.","Christopher R. Lucas - Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division","David, just a basic question about the transaction environment, which is, could you just give us some color as to how cap rates have trended over the last 6 months and what the opportunity set has looked like in terms of the change in volume of deals available?","David B. Henry","I would make 3 points in general and then open it up to others. The very high quality properties continue to be very competitive. If anything, cap rates continue to go down notwithstanding the [indiscernible] rise in interest rates. Ever since May, there's been no fall off [indiscernible] Competitive nature for [indiscernible] quality properties. Secondly, in terms of the B properties within [indiscernible] perhaps markets, there has been pick up in [indiscernible] unable to buy the A properties and the yields are a little higher [indiscernible] very positive leverage available. And as more debt [indiscernible] for B properties, so see the assets that we've been selling good assets, call it 8.5 average down to 7.5 average or so cap rate [indiscernible] down on the B assets [indiscernible] Third point, I wanted to make is, I think, beginning in May, with a prospect [indiscernible] sellers think, maybe the train's starting to leave the station, though I think a few more properties are coming to market [indiscernible] in the market as people try to make sure that they catch these high prices. But I think, they'll see the number of assets in the market continue to go up [indiscernible] that lead for [indiscernible] opportunities, that said, the demand side remains high, the pension funds [indiscernible] life insurance companies, sovereigns, the REITs and so forth, real estate is back in favor. [indiscernible] assets, whether it's cash yield [indiscernible] costs, still at historic lows. The NOI is down. Cap [indiscernible] still seems reasonable compared to [indiscernible]. I think you're going to see a good dynamic [indiscernible] in both for buyer or seller.","Operator","We have our next question from Luke McCarthy of Deutsche Bank.","Luke McCarthy","I know you just talked a little bit about in your early comments that, I guess, in general, across the board, at least domestically, things are very strong geographically. Can you just talk about where you're seeing relative softness and is that where we should expect you to focus your dispositions. And then, secondly, given what you just said about cap rates and that potentially making things, I guess, a little bit more challenging on a deal-by-deal basis as an acquirer, can you talk a little bit about the sustainable level of redevelopment we should expect from you guys as you kind of recycle that capital moving forward?","Conor C. Flynn","Sure. Why don't I start with the first part? We see the highest growth recently in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic from a same-site NOI growth perspective, and that's really why we're so excited about the recent Boston portfolio. It's because we've got a track record. We've got boots on the ground. We've got a Boston office and we've always wanted to expand that portfolio. It's just been very hard to find accretive acquisitions in that territory. So that area, I think, is one for us that we've earmarked as a very high growth potential and we see it consistently, quarter over quarter, producing significant results. The next portion of the question, on where we're targeting dispositions? It's really going through each and every region. The regions are very large. So it's hard to give you a specific territory that we're exiting. But in general, what we're doing is we're focusing on the core MSAs that are healthy, that are growing and we're looking to see, okay, where are those assets located better? No longer in the growing markets that we see as potential downside risk and then exiting those markets. So you'll see us exit out of areas where we think there's a tertiary market or if our retail sales have started to either flatten out or go negative and we'll continue to prune the portfolio in that regard.","David B. Henry","I would just add one comment on the redevelopment side. As we've mentioned earlier, as rents start to jump, and they are jumping. They're not going up 2% or 3%, they're going up $1, $2, $3, more redevelopments become financially feasible or viable. And that's what's triggering a lot of this. Redevelopments that didn't make sense 2 or 3 years ago now makes sense because the retailers are hungrier, they're willing to pay higher rents. And so we are optimistic if that trend line continues, you will unlock other redevelopment in our portfolio with 900 properties. We have a lot of inventory and when rents get to the right level and the demands gets there, it triggers even more redevelopment opportunities for us.","Operator","And the next question is from Michael Bilerman of Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Glenn, yes, there's been a lot of numbers thrown out, on all the transaction activity. I'm just wondering if you can just be a little bit specific in what you disclosed in the press release in terms of what's been sort of announced the $230 million of sales, the $270 million that's under contract in Boston, call it, $400 million of Mexico and Lat Am. Conor talked about 60 assets that are part of the disposition plan. You also talked about $610 million of acquisitions, of which I assume $270 million is Boston. Maybe, you can just be very specific in terms of what is your net share of acquisitions and dispositions in the fourth quarter, and how much is embedded for next year? Because obviously, that plays into sort of where numbers will shake out. And then just secondarily, what top down assumption have you used for same-store in coming up with the forecast of 136 to 140?","Glenn G. Cohen","So first, let me just clarify the $900 million of proceeds from Mexico. $400 million of that will be in 2013, of which over $325 million of it is already closed. So the balance will come -- $500 million or so will come in 2014. As I mentioned, also, we will close on about another $260 million of acquisitions in 2013 during this quarter. There's another $350 million of properties that are under contract, including the Boston portfolio. But net-net, when you look to 2014, we're looking at somewhere, in total, around $800 million of acquisitions, of which we've already identified $350 million of it. So that's there -- and as far as a same-site NOI growth level, as I mentioned, we're going to give you that at the next call, because I want to finish doing it and we want to give you a very good, accurate number. But I am very confident that it will be positive and remains positive.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So from a transaction activity then, if you're -- you have $500 million left to go, either later this year or into next, but then from an acquisition perspective, you have $1.1 billion that's left to close. Am I not thinking about that the right way? I'm trying to think from the...","Glenn G. Cohen","In total, yes. In total, you're right. We're going to close $260 million this year and around $800 million next year.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And you are only getting in $500 million...","Glenn G. Cohen","Of which more than half is already identified.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. But you're only getting in $500 million in net cash. So you're going to be spending $600 million...","Glenn G. Cohen","No, we also have about $300 million or so of retail assets that are part of the 60 assets we announced that we would be selling, that's going to come in as well.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So in addition to the $500 million...","Glenn G. Cohen","But we still have a little bit left of the nonretail.","David B. Henry","A few nonretail assets that we expect to close some before year end. We have free cash flow, so we have other sources of cash.","Glenn G. Cohen","And we have some more closings of sales in the fourth quarter as well. So you'll get to the net-net, Michael, of roughly a $100 million of a net buyer when you're all said and done, $150 million of a net buyer.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","From this point, from basically fourth quarter through '14, $100 million of net, which is easily funded through free cash flow.","Glenn G. Cohen","Correct.","Operator","And our next question is another follow-up from Samit Parikh from ISI.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see if you could comment on the economic situation in Puerto Rico and what your thoughts are on if that could have an impact on sort of, midterm, maybe next 3 to 5 years, consumer demand and what impact that could have on sort of your exposure out there?","David B. Henry","Well, I'll give you just high-level to start with, I mean, Puerto Rico has been in an official economic recession for almost 5 years now. And notwithstanding that, because the island is so under retailed and because, culturally, the Puerto Ricans just love to shop, our retailers have done well. Our shopping centers have done well. And the rent growth is real there. And the list of retailers that want to open up in Puerto Rico notwithstanding the economy and the fiscal situation of Puerto Rico. The tax proposals that would have meaningful -- meaningfully impacted both landlords and tenants have been muted and taken back off the table recently. So that dark cloud seems to be not as dark as it was. So I think, longer term, we're very happy with what we have in Puerto Rico. And we feel good that retailers will continue to do well. And occupancy will continue to be high. And it will be a good contributor to earnings.","Samit Parikh - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Do think that there's any [indiscernible] increased income taxes and maybe sort of crackdown on the -- taxing some of the underground economy over there and what that could do to disposable income?","David B. Henry","Again, some of the more Draconian proposals have been tabled. So that was what the niche group were afraid of, whether they're successful cracking down of [indiscernible] that's very difficult to do, [indiscernible] Mexico or other places. And I think, embedded in the culture of Puerto Rico, [indiscernible] love to shop and the tenant [indiscernible] as well. So yes, it's certainly something we watch and we monitor and we participate in the industry lobbying efforts to make sure that the movement [ph] doesn't hurt us too bad. But I don't think there's anything meaningful that [indiscernible] there that [indiscernible] to be fair.","Operator","And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Bujnicki for any closing remarks.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Laura, and to everyone that participated on our call today.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to your moderator, Mr. David Bujnicki, Vice President. Sir, you may begin.","David F. Bujnicki","Thank you all for joining Kimco's third quarter 2012 earnings call. With me on the call this morning is Milton Cooper, our Executive Chairman; Dave Henry, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Pappagallo, Chief Operating Officer; Glenn Cohen, Chief Financial Officer, as well as other key executives, who will be available to address questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks.","As a reminder, statements made during the course of this call may be deemed forward-looking statements. It is important to note that the company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Please refer to the company's SEC filings that address such factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","During this presentation, management may make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe help investors better understand Kimco's operating results. Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website. [Operator Instructions]","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave Henry.","David B. Henry","Good morning, and thank you for dialing in today. Hurricane Sandy has given us an exciting few days, and we are glad it has moved on from our area. We are pleased to report strong third quarter results, continued progress on our key objectives and a significant increase in our annual dividend. Glenn and Mike will provide details and color. But in the main we continue to see steady and sustained improvement across our portfolio in terms of our key metrics and retailer demand for space.","Despite the soft economy and weak employment and housing, consumer spending is holding up and national retailers in particular are again pursuing aggressive expansion plans. Discount and value-oriented anchors of all types have announced increased store counts for 2013, 2014. And this bodes well for our portfolio, especially in the context of very limited new development or supply of retail space. Although market rents remain substantially below peak levels and while certainly not a landlord's market, effective rents are increasing in most areas. We are even beginning to see occupancy improvement in our local stores basis, which has been our primary issue over the past several years.","During the quarter, we made solid progress reducing our non-retail investments, selling our lower-quality, non-strategic properties, leasing up our Latin American development properties and strengthening our balance sheets. We are also thrilled to be able to discuss the fully executed purchase and sales agreement with an affiliate of Starwood Capital Group for the purchase of our InTown Suites investment. We've been working through the sales process for an extended period of time due to the complexity of selling both the corporate entity and the real estate assets. The closing timeframe is also expected to be prolonged due to the loan assumptions required and other closing details. However, all parties involved are proceeding as expeditiously as possible, and the underlying investment continues to perform very well.","I would also like to take a moment to discuss our concentrated efforts to transform over time our large shopping center portfolio into one that is well recognized and described as \"best-in-class.\" In addition to the disposition of nonstrategic and lower-quality retail assets, we have purchased many terrific new shopping centers, and we continue to expand, devote resources and invest capital in many of our very best retail properties. We recognize that the key to our success will be a dedicated focus on Kimco's primary core markets, which in general are highlighted by strong demographics, barriers to entry, limited retail per capita, larger-sized properties and higher population densities. The New York City metro area, where we have more than 70 shopping centers, and the Baltimore-Washington Corridor, where we have more than 40 shopping centers, are 2 good examples of Kimco primary markets, where we already have scale, long-standing tenant relationships and premier retail properties. We will remain fully national in scope, but we will continue to refine and focus on certain key markets.","With respect to our international markets, Canada remains a strong, improving contributor to our company with a long-term, very favorable outlook. Mexico, our other large international market, also has a strong economy with 10 straight quarters of year-over-year economic expansion and a strong resurgence of international capital in the real estate sector and increasing property values. For us, lease-up of our development portfolio remains paramount and the 130 basis points occupancy increase in aggregate in our Mexico properties during the quarter is gratifying and shows promise for the rest of the year. Overall, our Latin American stabilized portfolio now exceeds 90% occupancy.","Now I would like to turn to Glenn to discuss the financial details of the quarter, to be followed by Mike and Milton.","Glenn G. Cohen","Thanks, Dave, and good morning. It's been just over 2 years since we outlined our back-to-basics strategy focused on the operation and ownership of retail shopping centers, the growth of recurring retail operating cash flows from the continued lease-up of the portfolio and redevelopment opportunities and our commitment to monetize our non-retail investments and dispose of non-strategic retail assets, all while strengthening the balance sheet with reduced leverage and significant liquidity. Our strong third quarter results are further evidence of us getting it done. We continue to generate positive same-site NOI growth, increases in occupancy and positive leasing spreads. We have made further progress on the monetization of the non-retail assets and have ramped up the capital recycling program and further improved our leverage metrics.","Let me provide you some specifics on our progress. As we reported last night, FFO as adjusted, our term for recurring FFO, came in at $0.31 per share, an increase of 3.3% over the same quarter last year. Our recurring FFO included positive NOI growth of $16.6 million, of which 40% was attributable to organic growth from lease-up, positive leasing spreads and redevelopments coming online within the portfolio and the balance from acquisition activity.","Occupancy is up 70 basis points from the year ago to 93.7% on a gross basis and 60 basis points to 93.4% on a pro rata basis. U.S. leasing spreads are up 13%, 40.2% from new leases and 4.3% from options and renewals. In addition, combined same-site NOI was positive for the 10th straight quarter at 2.6%, excluding the impact of currency. Currency had a negative impact of 100 basis points, bringing same-site NOI to 1.6% overall with U.S. same-site NOI growth coming in at 2.5%. Mike will give you more detail on the portfolio performance in just a moment.","Headline FFO came in at $0.29 per share as compared to $0.33 last year. The current year headline number includes the impact of $0.02 per share related to the noncash preferred redemption charge of $6.2 million and acquisition-related costs while last year had net transaction income of $11 million or $0.03 a share. Based on our 9-month results of FFO as adjusted per share of $0.93, we are maintaining our full year 2012 guidance of $1.24 to $1.26. Again, this guidance range does not include transaction income and expenses or noncash charges for the redemption of preferred stock. Over 96% of the contributions are provided from the retail operating portfolio.","As I mentioned, our capital recycling program has gained momentum. We had a very active quarter selling 9 non-strategic retail properties for approximately $95 million and generating net non-FFO gains of $7.4 million, and then another 14 properties subsequent to quarter end for another $70 million. We redeployed the proceeds from these sales by acquiring 6 fully owned assets in our core markets for a gross purchase price of $154 million. We continue to chip away and monetize the non-retail assets reducing the balance by another $30 million and announcing the execution of a contract to sell InTown Suites, the largest remaining non-retail investment. We're actively working on the disposition of other non-retail assets. Once completed, the non-retail investments will be under $300 million or less than 2.5% of gross assets.","Including the activity mentioned above, we have sold 86 non-strategic retail assets with gross proceeds of $530 million and non-retail assets of approximately $400 million since our 2010 investor day. During the same period, we acquired 47 properties for a gross purchase price of $985 million. The assets acquired have a combined occupancy of 94.2%, an average base rent of almost $14 a square foot and average household income of over $95,000. Contrast this with the assets sold, which have a combined occupancy of 83.4%, an average base rent of $8.35 and average household income of $61,000. We've made demonstrative progress in upgrading the overall quality of the portfolio and have had only minimal dilution from it when combined with the non-retail assets sold. The [Audio Gap] identified non-strategic retail assets remaining represent only 6.5% of the total portfolio today, and we continue to aggressively run through our recycling program.","We continue to be proactive on the balance sheet as well. During July, we completed a new $225 million perpetual preferred issuance at a coupon of 5.5%, among the lowest coupons ever issued for this type of capital. We used the proceeds to redeem our $175 million 6.65% perpetual preferred stock in the middle of August. In addition, subsequent to quarter end we redeemed our $460 million 7.75% perpetual preferred stock. We used the proceeds from our $400 million 6% preferred issuance completed in March and the balance of the July issuance to fund the October redemption. As a result of these capital transactions, we will save approximately $11 million on an annual basis and further improve our fixed charge coverage. We expect to end 2012 with a net debt to recurring EBITDA of just under 6x in line with our expectation.","I also want to point out that we have been successful refinancing the maturing mortgages in the joint venture programs. We have closed on 24 individual mortgages totaling $628 million at a weighted average rate of just under 4% and have term sheets signed for 6 more for another $160 million. We continue to lower the leverage in the joint venture programs as well. In total, we have refinanced over $1.9 billion during 2012 at significantly lower rates. As we look forward to 2013, our debt maturities are very manageable and we have already begun working on them.","Now in keeping with our tradition, we are introducing initial FFO as adjusted guidance for 2013 of $1.28 to $1.33 per share, bearing in mind we have not yet completed our bottoms-up property-by-property forecast process. Again, this guidance range is solely based on recurring flows and does not include any transaction income or expenses. Using the midpoint of the 2013 guidance range yields an increase in recurring FFO per share of about 4.5%. The range is dependent on the timing of our capital recycling activities, including the sale of InTown Suites -- which we assume mid-second quarter to complete -- the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the timing of lease-up, leasing spreads and redevelopments coming online.  Over 98% of the contribution is expected from recurring retail operations. We will provide more specific guidance assumptions, including same-site NOI and occupancy targets on our year-end earnings call.","Last but certainly not least, we are pleased to announce that based on our 2012 performance and the expectations for 2013, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per common share to $0.21 per quarter, an increase of 10.5% on an annualized basis. Our FFO payout ratio remain conservative at a level of about 40 -- 64%. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.","Michael V. Pappagallo","Thanks, Glenn. I'll start by going off script. There are many questions surrounding the impact of Superstorm Sandy on the Kimco portfolio. The good news is that the impact on the portfolio is relatively tame considering the devastation that the storm brought to the area. Now recognize between Kimco's Northeast and Mid-Atlantic portfolios, we have over 200 properties. It's about 22 million square feet. And remarkably, most of it escaped pretty well.","Now our Mid-Atlantic region, essentially untouched, all but 5 centers have full power. New York metro, a little bit more impact, mostly canopies, facades, some roof damaged on a few centers but very few issues that are shutting down the centers. In fact, although there is a significant amount of power loss in the area, most of the major tenants are open for business through the use of their own generators. Our crews are out. Cleanup is already underway, so there's very little impact. The one area that we have not been able to gain access to is Staten Island because of the issues surrounding that particular area. But we hope to get out there this morning and assess the situation in that market.","Most -- all of our properties will be fully covered by insurance and we have a very low deductible, so there's certainly no economic impact on that. And again, with respect to our tenant base, the majority of the tenants are open and operating, so we don't see any significant issues coming out of rental revenues. We will keep everyone posted as conditions warrant. So that's the update on Hurricane Sandy. And I do need to give a full public acknowledgment to our property management teams in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, who are doing an incredible job of getting out to the properties and making an assessment as we go through this process.","Okay. Back to the standard stuff. The third quarter operating metrics and trendlines remained solid. And I think they underscore the strengthening of our portfolio base and the overall improving environment. Both the U.S. and overall occupancy levels improved again in the third quarter. The U.S. portfolio occupancy increased by 20 basis points sequentially. Interestingly, the uptick was due solely to smaller-space lease-up, and it's certainly been a while since we've been able to say that. The occupancy of spaces under 10,000 square feet jumped 60 basis points to 83.9% with 2\/3 of the increase attributable to positive leasing activity and the balance that benefited from the dispositions.","Peeling back the onion a bit more, the overall non-anchor space occupancy has jumped over 2% in the past 12 months, and we're experiencing increases in both the true small-space leasing of under 5,000 square feet, as well as the larger mid-shop spaces. Consistent with prior quarters, this shift is towards national and franchise concepts with the 2 drivers being food and service offerings.","On the anchor leasing side, we did experience some important new lease signings, but it was mostly offset from a couple of vacancies from the bankruptcy of RoomStore. With respect to those new deals, the eye-popping 40% positive spread underscores the ongoing trend of improvements in rental rates, periodically turbocharged by a below-market anchor box space brought up to market. In this case, it was a location in Pompano, Florida, in which Kmart was replaced by Whole Foods and Sports Authority. And I'd also like to point out that the meaningful increases were captured in releasing of spaces made available from the Borders and A&P bankruptcies, including Nordstrom Rack at our center in Manhasset, New York, and LA Fitness in Farmington, Connecticut, and a strong regional specialty supermarket replacing a Waldbaum's in Huntington, also along Long Island.","Our U.S. same-store gross number landed at 2.5%. And I was quite pleased with this result knowing that the rent commencements for some of our replacement deals for those Borders and A&P boxes wouldn't kick in until the fourth quarter and thought we might get nicked a bit on the comps for this reporting period. However, our renewal experience was better than expected and credit loss experience continues to improve, underscoring the overall upgrade in tenancy and portfolio composition over the past year. And as a result, the U.S. same-site numbers have averaged at roughly to 2.5% handled through the 9-month period.","So we are pleased with direction, velocity and recovery of rental rates, leasing spreads and NOI growth. But we are not losing focus as there's still a lot of hard work and creativity needed to manage through some of the downsizing initiatives on certain formats, the inevitable retailer bankruptcy and recognizing changing demographics and consequent demand in best tenant fit at our centers. That said, we're aided by increased demand for space, conscious that it's the stronger retailers that are taking market share rather than the general economic rising tide lifting all boats. It is the retailers that demonstrate operational excellence and\/or focusing on differentiation, often by catering to specific targets, be it high-end or specialty or value or ethnic or other differences that are carrying the day. And as mentioned earlier, for smaller-space users, services and food products and restaurants across the spectrum are filling the gaps.","Recognizing that over the long term, the primary driver in demand for space and strong pricing at a property will remain its location and market, we continue to push through our portfolio recycling efforts. We accelerated the pace of dispose since the begin of the third quarter with a total of 23 properties and 2.7 million square feet exited over the past 4 months. Because of these moves, we were able to consolidate our 2 Ohio offices into a single one and generated over $116 million for reinvestment into our existing property base and purchases in our target markets. We currently have deals set on 15 more properties and another 20 are in the market. And we expect that pace to continue through the next couple of years.","Finally, looking outside the U.S., as Glenn noted, currency movements did not help the cause for our Mexico and Canadian comparable results this quarter. But in local currency terms, we're still trending well and expect 2012 to end with an NOI level ahead of budget both in local currency and U.S. dollar basis.","Latin America, we executed a little under 200,000 square feet of leasing since our last earnings call and overall occupancy continues to increase. As Dave mentioned, in Mexico, we reached the 90% mark on our portfolio of stabilized properties. And when adding in those still in development and lease-up, the overall Mexico occupancy rose to 86.9%. Demand levels have continued to increase. And our operating team there has noted an increased interest from U.S.-based apparel retailers to enter the Mexico market. I think this has been helped by the reduction of tariffs against the wide variety of Chinese-made goods, including shoes and textiles.","Canadian market remains healthy with an ever-growing roster of retailers expressing interest in opening stores north of the border. Most recently, Nordstrom announced its intention to open full -- 4 Full-Line Stores over the next 2 years and they'll continue to pursue additional opportunities for both more Full-Line and Nordstrom Racks.","That's my report. And now for concluding comments, if Milton is still on his cell phone, I'll turn it over to him.","Milton Cooper","Yes, I am. Well, thanks, Mike. Our business is to be the premier owner of retail real estate. And the keyword is real [ph]. We own real estate and retailers are our tenants. We have consistently pointed out that our retail tenants may come and go, but our real estate remains growing in value over time. Some retailers will continue to face challenges.","To mitigate those challenges, we focus on 3 things. One, retailer who sell nondiscretionary items, such as food, supermarkets and warehouse clubs, as well as discounters [ph] [Audio Gap]  That offer value in all economic [indiscernible]. Tenants with good credits. Three, tenants who have below-market rents. Our list [indiscernible] by TJX, the off-price apparel retailer. The company has an [Audio Gap] of $30 billion. [indiscernible] market [indiscernible] have 2 largest tenants as well, with a 250 [indiscernible] our excellent investment rate credits. [indiscernible] we handled 8,000 tenants representing almost 15,000 leases. No tenant represents more than 3% of our annual base. This highlights how diversified our portfolio is and how we have spread the risk in our portfolio.","We have diluted [ph]   [indiscernible] cash flows and dividends and repeatedly seized the opportunity [indiscernible] but have a good real estate. Now we may be facing headwinds in the economy, but on a relative basis, our retailers should fare better than most. And we're so gratified by the positive metrics in our portfolio and our return to core real estate. And with that, we're happy to take any questions.","David F. Bujnicki","Operator, we're ready to move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from R.J. Milligan from Raymond James.","R.J. Milligan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Mike, you touched on the leasing spreads a little bit. And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the TI side, which was up considerably from, I guess, the trailing 12-month number. So just how that dynamic is working.","Michael V. Pappagallo","Sure. The overall TI did go up. I think it was in part due to the Pompano deal that I did mention because even though the footprint was the same, it was a pretty significant rebuild of the existing location, as well some of the deals that I'd also referred to in terms of new tenants at the former bankruptcies of Borders and A&P also had more cost to it. So in this quarter, I think the activity and the rents -- excuse me, the activity and the number of leases did uptick the average spending a little. That said, the rent dollars did support it. So on a net effective rent basis at those spaces, we were still well ahead of the previous NER.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Spector from Merrill Lynch.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to see -- I don't know if you've done this analysis or provided it, just thinking about as you discussed your efforts in pruning noncore assets but specifically, your -- what you've labeled as noncore retail assets, have you quantified the improvement, what you expect in demographics in the portfolio?","Michael V. Pappagallo","Jeff, we haven't come up with specific quantitative targets on where we want it to go. And I think that's in part because, as Dave's comments, as his prepared comments indicated, we are going to remain and we find great value in being a national company. So in being a national company, just by definition, we're going to have more blended macro statistics with respect to demographics than say someone who may be just regionally focused in one particular area or not. All that said, without a specific target, I would refer back to some of the points that Glenn had made and also what you see in our published materials and presentations that the acquired sites -- again, using it as a national footprint, is somewhat representative of where we are looking to go both in terms of household incomes, densities and population. In addition to that, we're going to look on a very specific basis on a given property as to barriers to entry or a particular attribute, or series of attributes at the location that would prevent competition and give us more pricing power. So when you blend all of those forces together, continuing on a national footprint, I think what you will see over time is a continuing improvement towards the demographic numbers that you see on our more currently acquired sites.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to see if Dave or if you could, Mike, give a little bit more color on Dave's comment at the opening, talking about you're seeing an increase in store counts from discounters in '13 and '14?","Michael V. Pappagallo","We have continued to see the demand increasing from the national and regional players, as again as well as some of the franchise concepts. It cuts across the board. As we've said in different forums that retailers are expanding. I think the expansion plans though are what I'd call more intelligent expansion than perhaps in the heyday when it was just open x number of stores because Wall Street wanted it. And in certain formats, I think the realities of not enough available space are coming to the fore because retailers aren't necessarily going to open in any and all markets. There still is a bias towards those markets where they can estimate sales pretty well. They're generally in fill [ph] existing population areas, not a lot of greenfield. So you put all those things into play, the demand is still there, but the supply continues to shrink.","Milton Cooper","I would just add this. There's a Pricewaterhouse study of proposed openings of different categories. And the 2 highest number of openings belong to the discounters and the warehouse clubs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Morgan from Morgan Stanley.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","In terms of the guidance, so you provide the breakout in the South [ph], and I just wanted to try to -- I mean, you can sort of triangulate it, but maybe if you could just provide what you have as the net dilution from the sale of InTown in the guidance? I know you're incorporating some -- I mean, you are obviously incorporating the interest expense savings and the loss in income. But any reinvestments or anything else in sort of mid-second quarter, is that what I heard you say?","Glenn G. Cohen","So Paul, as I mentioned, we are expecting to have a closing. And in the assumptions, it's mid-second quarter. InTown will provide this year a little over $0.06, so we've modeled in about $0.02 for next year. So we have about $0.04 of dilution that will come from it. Part of the guidance range, again depends on when that timing occurs. So if it doesn't happen until the end of the second quarter or the middle of the third quarter, you'll get further toward the higher end of the range, among other things. But you still have a very solid increase from where we are, right? We're expecting midpoint 2012 $1.25, midpoint of the new guidance is $1.31, so you're looking at 4.8% up.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So the $0.06 per share of FFO drop from non-retail is -- that's $0.02 of that is InTown, and then there's other non-retail that's comprising the other $0.04?","Glenn G. Cohen","$0.04 of it is InTown. The other $0.02 are the other things that we've sold off during the year and the repayment of certain mortgages and the other assets that have been monetized.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second question is just on your acquisitions and dispositions activity in the retail side. You talk about cap rates, the spread between what you're selling and what you're buying and where they are today for your targeted markets.","David B. Henry","Yes. As we mentioned before, 2 things are occurring -- for us, anyway. The high-quality properties we're buying are in the 6s today and sometimes drift a little bit south of that, and that's an indication of the high demand for high-quality shopping centers in primary key markets. That's where the highest demand is. On the other side of the coin, B properties in secondary markets, there's still at least a couple of hundred basis points difference in cap rate. Although activity in those secondary markets and B properties has picked up, there's still a wide difference between those 2 categories. Luckily, in our case, because we are also selling certain non-earning, non-retail assets such our buildings, our urban buildings in New York and Philadelphia and Chicago and Boston that we've sold over time, those buildings were purchased years ago as redevelopment assets. And today, they produce no earnings. So when you blend the sale of those assets with our non-strategic shopping centers that we're selling in the 8 and 9s and aboves, the blend equals basically no dilution for us. It's about an average of a 7% cap of what we've been buying and about a 7% when you look at all the dispositions we've had. So for now, there's very minimal dilution on our dispositions.","Michael V. Pappagallo","And the one thing I would add though is that as we go forward and as we successfully eliminate those non-earning, non-retail assets, we will be confronted with, I think, some mild dilution because there will be a spread on what we're buying and what we're selling. But in many respects, I've spoken with many of you on the sell side, and the advice that I've constantly heard from you is that, \"Don't worry as much about FFO. If you're recycling the portfolio and upgrading the portfolio, you should get more than enough value creation and more than enough benefit in your multiple.\" So whereas we recognize that there might be a nick in the short-term FFO dilution -- or FFO estimates, certainly, I think that the research community would understand and embrace that relative to the recycling program that we've begun.","Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And is that nick included in the 2013 number at all?","Michael V. Pappagallo","Yes.","Glenn G. Cohen","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just sticking with the transaction activity for a moment. Dave, I think in your opening comments, you talked about concentrating on those core markets and you talked about New York and D.C., where you already have a big presence. I guess, as you execute that plan, does that incorporate perhaps buying out any of your joint venture partners? Or is all that new incremental assets to the marketplace?","David B. Henry","From time to time, we certainly have been buying out partners, where we really like the properties and the markets longterm. And we will continue to do that over time because some of these institutional investors prefer to go home or need to dispose of certain assets. So that's certainly part of our acquisition strategy. It's much easier to buy out a partner in a property that we've been managing for years than it is to bid for a property on the open market. So that's certainly part of our strategy.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And were you trying to infer that there'd be actual near-term activity that would be boosting some of these markets? Or were you just saying it more as a long-term goal?","David B. Henry","More as a long-term goal.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just, Glenn, quickly just in terms of the guidance, in terms of the core retail FFO, so the $2.29 to $2.36, so that's up $0.07 to $0.12 relative to what's you're going to produce this year. How much of that is being driven just by sort of the core effective same-store versus the investments that you've made in terms of buying assets or the redeployment of some of the proceeds out of InTown? Just trying to understand the differential between really what is internal versus external growth in that number.","Glenn G. Cohen","The majority of it today is internal. If you look at -- just use the midpoint because it's just easier to work from, you're looking at 4.5% growth of the total retail line. Most of that is internal from the existing portfolio and from the assets that we've acquired and the growth rates that are in there. And again, the guidance range, it's early, it's only October, but the guidance range is going to be somewhat dependent on how well leasing spreads go, the further lease-up occupancy and the growth in those same sites. But we've modeled it enough where we're comfortable with this range. And we think 4.5% growth at the midpoint is pretty solid for a retail portfolio that has lots of long-term leases.","Michael V. Pappagallo","And to add a tack  [ph] on my earlier points, Mike, I think as we look at the recycling, we will get the benefit, the full year benefit of things we acquired in 2012, but we also will continue that recycling for 2013. So the net acquisition -- to Glenn's point, the net acquisition disposition activity is not going to be a meaningful adder to that. Most of that is being generated from in-place, existing property base.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. And then InTown is completely in the non-retail line. There's no -- the debt that's on InTown is not in the corporate finance? That's not why that's going down. That's just being driven by your positive refinancing, correct?","Glenn G. Cohen","Correct. Spot on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cedrik Lachance from Green Street Advisors.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","There's a number of small strip center REIT companies out there that have low market cap and high G&A burdens, no evidence of ability to grow over time. What's your appetite to take out some of these companies? Or what's your appetite for public-to-public transactions?","David B. Henry","Well, first of all, certainly Kimco has a history of acquiring other public companies. I think we bought 5 over the last 12 years, so we're certainly experienced and constantly look at that opportunity. But that said, as we mentioned, we are very determined to focus on these primary key markets and very high-quality assets. So in some cases, that will knock out the attractiveness of acquiring some of these smaller companies. So we will look at this. But again, we're much more determined to make sure that we upgrade our portfolio over time by sticking to these key primary markets for us.","Cedrik Lachance - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division","And I'll squeeze a second question since it's a bit of a trend. I noticed you bought back about $30 million of your shares so far this year. What's the thought process behind that?","Glenn G. Cohen","That simply was just keeping the amount of share dilution down from option exercises and any restricted stock that was issued.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, a clarification. Glenn, for 2013, outside of InTown, are there any acquisitions, dispositions in that number? Or is it just nothing beyond InTown and what's been done so far?","Glenn G. Cohen","Well, in terms of -- again, from a capital plan, it's not finalized yet, but the initial capital plan is pretty much what we've been doing. It's recycling. So to the extent that we're selling assets, both non-retail and retail, we're redeploying that capital into other shopping center assets. So we're pretty much net on it. We're probably modestly a net buyer but very modestly.","Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then post InTown, if we're just looking at the remaining non-retail assets, I know the yield on that is going be lower. What's the effective NOI yield post InTown?","Glenn G. Cohen","It's really small. It's like very low single-digit because what's left are our Philadelphia -- at the bulk of it, it will be our Philadelphia assets, which there is virtually no yield on. And we have a small amount of marketable securities that has a small dividend yield on it, but that's a longer-term play. So it's very small. It's probably in the 2 percentage range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Schaffer from Sandler O'Neill.","Andrew Schaffer","One quick question. I was wondering if you guys have seen any slowdown in the small tenant leasing within the last 30 to 45 days.","Michael V. Pappagallo","No, we have not, not within the last 30 or 45 days. It's been a continuous process of slow and steady increase in demand, again with a bias towards the smaller national chains.","Andrew Schaffer","And then thinking bigger picture, as the election and fiscal cliff are coming up, do you see any slowdown on the larger national [indiscernible] tenants, as well? Or this is probably [ph] across the board, you guys are seeing slow progress?","David B. Henry","Yes. I'll take the bigger tenants. There is a momentum to these national chains, and they're fully into this. There's been no slowdown at all. They establish their capital plans years in advance, and so they're going forward. There's no \"capping on the breaks\" that we can tell on these national retailers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On the Latin American front, same-store NOI was down, I think, because of currency exchange rates. Are spreads down as well because of that, number one? And then number two, I noticed you split out the industrial portfolio in Mexico as a separate line item in the joint venture category, and I'm curious if anything special is going on there, like maybe a potential sale of those assets?","Michael V. Pappagallo","I'll answer the first part of the question. The spreads in Mexico actually for new leases this quarter were mildly positive on new deals. The disclosure shows that the renewals were negative, which was outside of what we've normally seen and that really is just a restructuring of one particular account, where we had a multiple tenant account, that in exchange for a rent shift closer to the market, we extended the term of the leases. But in general, Mexico leasing spreads over a period of time, even though they represent a very small population to the total Mexico portfolio, have slowly but surely improved, although you have seen negative spreads in those -- for that very small population.","David B. Henry","And I'll just add a little color to Mike's comment on this one restructure. These were leases that are U.S. dollar leases. So it particularly hurt that retailer because his income was in pesos and his obligation to us was in dollars -- relatively unique for our portfolio. We have very few retail leases that are in dollars. This one did, and it was part of the gives and the gets of extending certain leases and renewing them. And that's why the leasing spreads in this particular case were still negative.","Glenn G. Cohen","I'll take the second part of your question. Just on Page 6 of our supplemental, which is our NOI disclosures, we have always showed the Mexico industrial portfolio. And there had been a lot of requests from you and your brethren on disclosing it more on the joint venture side. So we just broke it out to help you guys tie the thing back. That's all. Nothing else going on there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nathan Isbee from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just going back to the leasing activity, Mike, maybe you can break out what the new lease spreads would have been without the Pompano and Manhasset leases?","Michael V. Pappagallo","They would have been a -- I'm doing this off the top of my head, Nate, I believe a high single-digit number, somewhere in the 8% or 9% range.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if you look at the lease spreads for the spaces below 10,000, how would those look?","Michael V. Pappagallo","They actually were positive as well, similar rate, much less impact. And that's been the encouraging side of the equation over the past few quarters is where they -- when we report leasing spreads in smaller spaces a year ago, it would've been negative,  [indiscernible] it down. And they flattened out earlier this year, and now they are net-net positive. Also in terms of the number of leases that are positive versus negative have increased, and actually are the majority now. And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that most of the fallout and most of the recycling, if you will, and rollover of some of the toughest spaces, the toughest rents, particularly out West, have really for the most part run through the system. I'd still give it a little bit more time before you really mark the entire West Coast portfolio to market. But outside of that, most of the other regions are strongly positive. And so net-net, you wind up with a mid- to high single-digit positive leasing spread.","Glenn G. Cohen","Nate, part of the advantage of the size of our portfolio and the age of our portfolio is things like Pompano do happen and we have those opportunities in a lot of cases, just where we had it in Staten Island. And there's more of those to come over time, so I think it's one of the benefits of the size and age of the portfolio.","Nathan Isbee - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. And Mike, you just mentioned in your prepared remarks about some rent commencements moving into the fourth quarter. Can you quantify what that was and what type of pop we might see in the same-store numbers in the fourth quarter?","Michael V. Pappagallo","Well, yes, in the normal planning process, I had attributed about 25 basis points on -- 25 to 30 basis points of same-store growth, just focusing on the bankruptcies and when the leases were signed, when the rents were going to commence. So whereas I'm not rolling out an official fourth quarter same-site NOI, I knew that, that number was going to benefit the fourth quarter. Hopefully, that helps.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Anything [ph] for Mike. I recognize that capital might ultimately belong to their high net worth clients. But one of the investment banks you're teamed up with on a significant JV has been in the press recently about derisking their balance sheet and reducing capital obligations. Does that news have any potential to impact the buy-hold decision on that JV? Because I noticed your square footage was down there about 8% to 10% year-over-year.","Michael V. Pappagallo","If you're talking about UBS's very public statement and downsizing, UBS has made it clear that they would like to exit over time. And we've made no secret of taking a look at that and talking to UBS about either increasing our [indiscernible] or acquiring the balance of UBS's portfolio there. It's been a long process as they've hired advisors to help them value their share of our joint venture. But that is certainly one institutional partner that is looking at exit.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Dave, do you think that could be accelerated into next year? Or do you still think that's kind of a longer, more drawn-out process?","David B. Henry","The UBS thing, I suspect, is a shorter-term timeframe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Spector from Merrill Lynch.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just one additional question on the food retailing category. It sounded like from Milton's comments, it's an area of focus going forward. And just curious to hear your latest thoughts on the category, specifically Walmart's continued push. And as you said, the increase in discounters growing their store count but also increasing their presence. How do you see that impacting your plans?","David B. Henry","Milton, would you like to comment on that one?","Milton Cooper","Well, we've always pointed out that the conventional supermarket, by and large, is under attack by warehouse clubs, Walmart superstores, Target superstores, ALDI's, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods -- you name it. So the conventional supermarket has had difficulty and will continue to have difficulty. And that's what we see in what we call the traditional supermarket.","Michael V. Pappagallo","So I think to just further that point, Jeff, you have seen pretty significant expansion from Whole Foods. They're dealing with a particular subgroup. On the low end of the value, ALDI's made a more aggressive expansion. The dollar stores are trying to increase the food component in their footprint, warehouse clubs are doing well. So it does cause us to take a good -- a close look at the \"conventional supermarkets\", the ones who are catering to the middle and don't have a particular niche. That doesn't necessarily mean to say that they're all in trouble. But as we evaluate the portfolio, the viability of some of these larger supermarkets and just the sustainability of the property as a supermarket location that potentially other supermarket chains may take over, those are the things that we put into the calculus. Food will always be an important dimension of a shopping center portfolio. It's just a question of being really ahead of the game and understanding a lot of the dynamics and macro forces that are affecting food retailing as we go forward.","Milton Cooper","From our point of view, what we have to be careful about is the traffic generated by the supermarket and the issue of how many local stores can exist based on that volume. We have maintained that many of the supermarket locations have too large a number of local stores and they can't keep their occupancy up.","David B. Henry","Sorry, I would just add one more point. It is interesting to note that some of the private grocery chains are healthy and alive and cooking. The Wegmans of the world, the H-E-Bs, the Publix, they're doing quite well and still expanding.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so at this point, you haven't concluded yet whether it's going to be one traditional plus the rest you discussed. You're still trying to figure that out.","David B. Henry","Well, we watch all of these companies and the specific real estate very carefully. As we acquire properties, we make sure that we can get a replacement grocer, that the rent is below market, that the store is right-sized and a good location and so forth. So we underwrite all these aspects of our grocery-anchored properties, and we're trying to be proactive as possible, given that it is a very thin margin and competitive industry facing some challenges.","Jeffrey Spector - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I thought it was interesting, I guess, given all the comments about the larger grocers. Did you say on the small shop side though, you're actually seeing some successful small shops in the food category? And if so, I mean, what are they doing? What are they offering?","Michael V. Pappagallo","My comments associated with smaller concepts were generally many of the food chains, everything from the traditional fast food and the McDonald's to the Burger King to some of the sit-down restaurants to the Chipotles of the world to the Five Guys Burgers, the comment was made generally to say that as we think about the utilization of smaller spaces, the 2 recurring formats that we see that are adding space, that are adding to our occupancy are things that cut across the food spectrum, as well as on the other side, more service orientation. And that can be -- just throw out a name, a Massage Envy, as one example, or the Weight Watchers centers as another. But just to give you a perspective of the smaller spaces are being filled, that interestingly enough, are things that are -- the old \"You can buy it on the Internet\", and that seems to be where the dynamic is. Milton's point was about generally with supermarket-anchored centers is depending on the traffic that we want a reasonable amount of small stores to complement the supermarkets. And one of the problems that our industry has had during the heyday of development is too much small store space was added to a grocery-anchored center. And when the recession hit, many of those fell by the wayside, the dynamics of the shop couldn't support those business concepts.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.","Richard C. Moore - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just one more question. Any interest in SUPERVALU?","Michael V. Pappagallo","SUPERVALU. It's one of those situations where they need to reassess their whole business model and they need to consider all the alternatives. Acquiring SUPERVALU in whole or in part is probably more the business of a financial buyer like a PE firm or maybe another supermarket operator. We have been involved in some of those transactions over the years, such as Albertsons, but we've been involved essentially for our real estate skills. So at this point, Rich, from the SUPERVALU situation, I just wouldn't speculate as to our involvement there at this point.","Operator","And at this time, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.","David F. Bujnicki","Thanks, Jamie, and to everyone that participated on our call today.
